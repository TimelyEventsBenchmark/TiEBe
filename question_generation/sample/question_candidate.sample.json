What to know about them “Today Illinois is not able to compete effectively with our neighboring states,” he said. “Our citizens are suffering because of it and in many cases they are up and leaving because of it.” He said in the weeks ahead, he plans to ask the legislature to work on a “comprehensive jobs and economic package that will get Illinois working again.” Rauner also addressed budget problems in the state by saying, “Some in government will be tempted to once again take the easy road and leave the real problems for another day and the next generation. But, we cannot do that because to do so, to conduct business as usual, would be morally corrupt.” “Instead, we have an opportunity to accomplish something historic: to fix years of busted budgets and broken government; to forge a path toward long-term prosperity and a brighter future; to make Illinois the kind of state others aspire to become, a national leader in job growth and education quality,” he said.
