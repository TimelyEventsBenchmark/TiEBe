Their extent was not immediately clear.\n\nPolice have accused a 27-year old local of deliberately starting it, and Zelenskiy's office said officers had detained suspected arsonists near two points where the fire broke out.\n\nParliament voted on Monday to increase fines for arson.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine occurred on April 26, 1986. It was caused by a botched safety test in reactor and sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe.\n\nThe plant and the abandoned nearby town of Pripyat have become a draw for tourists, especially since a critically acclaimed U.S. television miniseries about the accident was aired last year.","question":"What action did Ukraine's parliament take in response to the Chernobyl-area fires in July 2020?","answer":"Parliament voted to increase fines for arson.","region":"Ukraine","model_answer":"Answer: In response to the Chernobyl-area fires in July 2020, Ukraine's parliament declared a state of emergency in the affected regions to coordinate firefighting efforts and mitigate the environmental and health risks posed by the wildfires."}
