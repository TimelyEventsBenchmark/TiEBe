Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva talks to the media after casting his vote during Portugal's presidential election in Lisbon, Portugal, January 24, 2016. REUTERS/Hugo Correia The motion was passed by 137 votes in the 230-seat parliament, bringing together the ruling Socialists, their far-left allies - the Communists and Left Bloc, and some opposition deputies from the Social Democratic Party. The rightist CDS voted against. Parliament also overturned Cavaco Silva’s veto on changes to the law on abortion. The changes eliminate co-payment by patients and other obstacles to voluntary interruption of pregnancy, which were introduced by the previous centre-right government. Cavaco Silva last month vetoed the gay adoption bill on the grounds that parliament passed it in November without having promoted a wide-enough national debate and citing doubts that it would promote the wellbeing of children. His refusal provoked sharp criticism from human rights groups and politicians alike, who said the president had simply opted to ignore a long-running debate on the issue as well as scientific evidence of benefits of adoption, in favour of his own conservative values. Under the constitution, he now has eight days to sign the bills into law. Cavaco Silva, a Social Democrat, is finishing his second term with record low popularity ratings as many Portuguese blame him for having done nothing to protect them from harsh austerity imposed under an international bailout in 2011-2014. The country last month elected centre-right politician and former TV commentator Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to succeed Cavaco Silva in an outcome that should help maintain political balance after a dramatic swing to the left in October’s parliamentary ballot.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - A record number of foreign tourists stayed in Portuguese hotels last year, with the number surpassing 10 million visitors for the first time and boosting hotel revenues to nearly 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion), official data showed on Tuesday. Tourist arrivals and all travel-related revenues, which account for around 10 percent of Portugal's gross domestic product, have been growing since 2011, helping the Atlantic coastal country overcome its economic and debt crisis. The National Statistics Institute said the number of foreign tourists reached 10.18 million in 2015, a rise of 10 percent on the previous year. As economic growth accelerated to 1.5 percent last year from 0.9 percent in 2014, the number of local travelers rose by 7 percent to 7.3 million. Hotel revenues rose by more than 13 percent, outpacing the tourist arrivals growth, as hotels were able to increase prices thanks to strong demand. Portugal opened more than 50 new hotels, practically all of them four- and five-star establishments, last year. Private entrepreneurs have also redeveloped hundreds of apartment buildings in old parts of Lisbon and other areas of Portugal to rent to tourists, helping the country's flagging construction sector.

Media caption, New UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says ending the conflict in Syria is his top priority Former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres has been officially appointed as the next UN secretary-general. He will become the world's top diplomat on 1 January when Ban Ki-moon's second five-year term ends. Mr Guterres, 67, who led the UN refugee agency UNHCR for 10 years, was chosen from among 13 candidates last week. He told the BBC that ending the civil war in Syria would be his biggest challenge. \"I believe it is the international community's first priority is to be able to end this conflict and use this momentum created by it to try to address all the other conflicts that are interlinked,\" he told the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet. He said the world was facing a dangerous time and he wanted to see people across the globe working together to achieve a safer future. \"I hope people will understand that it's better to put aside different opinions, different interests and to understand that there is a common, vital interest to put an end to these conflicts, because that is absolutely central if you want to live in a world where a minimum of securities are established, where people can live a normal life,\" he said. The UN's new man at the top UN secretary general: The hardest job in the world? Wonder Woman made UN champion Mr Guterres, who trained as an engineer, entered politics in 1976 in Portugal's first democratic election after the \"Carnation Revolution\" that ended five decades of dictatorship. As head of the UNHCR refugee agency from 2005 to 2015, he led the agency through some of the world's worst refugee crises, including those in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. During that time, he repeatedly appealed to Western states to do more to help refugees fleeing the conflicts. Mr Guterres' nomination came despite a concerted effort to appoint the UN's first female secretary general. Of the 13 candidates, seven were women, among them Unesco director-general Irina Bokova from Bulgaria, and Helen Clark, 66, a former prime minister of New Zealand and current head of the UN development programme. Mr Guterres told the general assembly: \"The dramatic problems of today's complex world can only inspire a humble approach. One in which the secretary general alone neither has all the answers, nor seeks to impose his views. \"One in which the secretary general makes his good offices available, working as a convenor, a mediator, a bridge-builder and an honest broker to help find the solutions that benefit everyone involved.\" Image source, AFP Image caption, Mr Guterres will become the world's top diplomat on 1 January Mr Ban told the assembly that his successor was well-known in diplomatic circles as a man of compassion. \"He is perhaps best known where it counts most - on the frontlines of armed conflict and humanitarian suffering,\" Mr Ban said. \"His political instincts are those of the United Nations - co-operation for the common good and shared responsibility for people and the planet.\" What does a UN secretary-general do? The Security Council - with five of its members wielding vetos - is the most powerful body in the UN. While not as powerful, the secretary-general serves as the organisation's top diplomat and chief \"administrative officer\". It has been described as the most impossible job in the world, says the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale. The secretary-general has to run an unwieldy bureaucracy and manage the competing demands of the world's big powers, he adds. A key requisite of the role is to step in both publicly and privately to prevent international disputes from escalating. The post lasts for five years and is limited to a maximum of two terms.

REUTERS/Josue Decavele Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Five people in Portugal have tested positive for the mosquito-transmitted Zika virus after recent trips to Brazil, but none required admission to hospital, the National Health Institute (NHI) said on Thursday. \"As of today we have five confirmed cases, all imported from Brazil. These people have not been hospitalised and do not require further medical attention as these are mild cases,\" said a spokesman for the institute. The NHI is in charge of all epidemiology tests in Portugal. The Zika virus is spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito that transmits dengue fever and yellow fever. There is no vaccine or treatment for the virus, a close cousin of dengue, which normally causes mild fever and rash. Zika has been linked to mental defects at birth in thousands of children in Brazil. An estimated 80 percent of people infected have no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected. Continental Portugal has not had any cases of locally-contracted viruses from Aedes aegypti, but there was an indigenous dengue outbreak on its Atlantic island of Madeira in 2012, the first dengue epidemic in Europe since the 1920s. Cases of Zika have been detected in Denmark and Britain and health experts say such cases are to be expected in Europe, given the scale of the outbreak in South America and the frequency of international travel.

        "event_desc": "24 January  Presidential election Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is elected as President after securing 52.4% of the vote in the first round, a majority that removes the need for a second round. Turnout rises slightly from the last election to 49%.",
        "text": "The new center-right president will have to ensure stability after two tough months in power for the Socialists.\t\t\t\nTV pundit Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa will become Portugal’s new president after winning Sunday’s elections, potentially providing a center-right counterweight to the anti-austerity policies of Prime Minister António Costa’s Socialists.\nRebelo de Sousa won 52 percent of votes — more than twice the level of support for his nearest rival, left-wing law professor António Sampaio da Nóvoa — meaning a second round of voting won’t be necessary. Rebelo de Sousa won against nine other candidates, including five who were linked to the Socialists.\nRebelo de Sousa, a law professor and popular television host, will have the task of ensuring stability after a difficult two months in power for Costa, who lost October’s parliamentary elections to the center-right incumbent Pedro Passos Coelho but ended up taking power because Passos Coelho was unable to form a majority.\nCosta’s leftist coalition began fraying just before Christmas when far-left allies voted against the sale of a failed bank at a cost of up to €3 billion to taxpayers, forcing Costa to work with the center-right to get the deal through parliament.\nWhile the president’s role is largely ceremonial, the head of state can order the Constitutional Court to review government legislation, and call new elections if they think the “normal operation” of democracy is under threat.\nManuel Caldeira Cabral, the economy minister, said Friday he did not expect any of the presidential hopefuls to jeopardize the government.\n“I think the frontrunners are moderate candidates and all of them committed to maintain the government and to maintain the legislature,” Cabral told broadcaster CNBC. “The center-right wing candidate (Rebelo de Sousa) is quite moderate and it was quite sure that he is going to maintain the government and the legislature.”\nRebelo de Sousa, 67, was one of the founders of the center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) and helped draft Portugal’s constitution in 1976. He briefly held ministerial office and for a time in the 1990s was a not-very-successful leader of the PSD in opposition.\nAnxious to win middle-of-the-road votes, he managed to alienate some core supporters by distancing himself from the painful economic reforms enacted by the previous PSD-led government.\nThe turnout in the country of 10.4 million was low at almost 49 percent, the election authority said. In 2011’s presidential election turnout was 47 percent, down from 62 percent in 2006 and around 80 percent in the 1980s.\nThis article was updated to reflect full official results.\n‘We now need an election to allow people to make their own judgment,’ McGuinness wrote.\nBritish PM wants Londoners to go about ‘business as usual.’\nMore than four-fifths said EU proposals not fit for modern needs.\nEU can’t rely on ‘facts and evidence’ found in media and on the internet, the non-binding opinion said.",

The supposed double agent, identified by the local media as Frederico Carvalhão, is a member of the Potugal’s SIS intelligence service, the country’s equivalent of MI5, responsible for internal security and counter-terrorism. Mr Carvalhão is accused of selling sensitive information relating to Nato and the European Union, both of which are key targets for Russian intelligence. In line with the tradecraft of espionage, Mr Carvalhão had allegedly been leaving Portugal and travelling to different European capitals to meet his Russian handler since 2014. But he was secretly tracked by the SIS counter-espionage unit. Last Friday, Mr Carvalhão flew to Rome for a meeting with his Russian contact on Saturday. Italian police accompanied by Portuguese intelligence officers claim to have captured him red-handed in the act of passing documents to the Russian. Unusually, the alleged Russian intelligence officer was not a diplomat with legal immunity, so he was also arrested. Mr Carvalhão, who had risen to become a departmental chief in SIS before being shunted sideways into information analysis, is accused of charging €10,000 (£7,700) for every document he passed on. \"As a result of excellent coordination between the public prosecutor, the judicial police and the SIS, and the level of international cooperation with the Italian authorities, two people were arrested in Rome for alleged espionage crimes, corruption and violation of state secrecy,\" said a statement from the Portuguese police. This “complex and sensitive operation”stemmed from an investigation started last year pointing to “the suspected existence of a crime of espionage by an official on behalf of a foreign intelligence service”. Russia has escalated its espionage offensive against Nato and Europe, but this is a rare incident of a face-to-face meeting between spies being uncovered. Experts will be surprised at the clumsiness of the episode, with an alleged Russian intelligence officer being caught in the act of receiving information – and not being able to claim diplomatic immunity. Documents and an unspecified quantity of cash were also seized from Mr Carvalhão’s home in Lisbon. The spy is understood to have been the subject of earlier disciplinary proceedings within SIS. He is also believed to have had relationships with several women from Eastern Europe, including Russia.

By TPN/Lusa,\r\n                                                                in News · 05 May 2016, 07:38 · 0 Comments According to the estimates released on Tuesday by Eurostat, EU-wide emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels, which scientists say are the main factor in global warming and climate change, rose 0.7% from 2014 levels. In Portugal, emissions rose 8.6%, a rate only exceeded by Slovakia, with 9.5%. Malta, Estonia, Denmark and Finland had the largest decreases in emissions. CO2 contributes 80% to all greenhouse gas emissions, which the EU, like other signatories of December's United Nations agreement on climate change, is trying to reduce by means of measures above all in the energy and transport sectors. Portugal has two big coal-fired power stations, at Sines and at Pego, and their use depends on various factors, including consumption levels lined to the country's economic situation and meteorological conditions, given that in dry years less rainfall means lower output from hydro-electric power.

Há 19 nascidos no estrangeiro Tiago Pimentel 31 de Julho de 2016, 9:45 Partilhar notícia Partilhar no Facebook Partilhar no WhatsApp Partilhar no Messenger Partilhar no Twitter Comentar Partilhar no Messenger Partilhar no LinkedIn Partilhar no Pinterest Enviar por email Guardar Comentar Alertas Foto Nelson Évora simboliza bem o atleta-tipo português nos Jogos do Rio 2016 DAVID W CERNY/Reuters O desporto português estará representado por 92 atletas em 16 modalidades nos Jogos Olímpicos do Rio de Janeiro. Vista ao raios-X, a comitiva portuguesa é maioritariamente composta por estreantes: 54 dos atletas terão no Rio 2016 a primeira experiência olímpica. Entre os 38 restantes destaca-se o velejador João Rodrigues, que vai disputar os seus sétimos Jogos Olímpicos – o madeirense foi por isso escolhido pelo chefe da missão olímpica portuguesa, José Garcia, para ser o porta-estandarte de Portugal na cerimónia de abertura. Os homens representam mais de dois terços da delegação portuguesa (62 atletas contra 30 elementos femininos) e João Rodrigues é, com 44 anos, o terceiro mais veterano da delegação portuguesa. Só é ultrapassado pela cavaleira Luciana Diniz (45 anos) e pelo atirador João Costa (51). A média de idades dos 92 atletas portugueses situa-se nos 27,7 anos, sendo Tamila Holub a mais jovem do grupo – a nadadora que vai disputar os 800m livres tem apenas 17 anos. A selecção de futebol é responsável pela presença de um número considerável de atletas jovens na delegação, já que a convocatória é limitada ao escalão sub-23. Só é permitida a inclusão de três futebolistas com mais de 23 anos. Para além de João Rodrigues, entre os atletas com mais presenças nos Jogos Olímpicos estão o atirador João Costa, o marchador João Vieira e o velejador Gustavo Lima, que vão cumprir no Rio de Janeiro a quinta participação olímpica. Seguem-se Telma Monteiro (judo) e Emanuel Silva (canoagem), que já estiveram em três Jogos Olímpicos. E o canoísta é um de apenas três atletas na comitiva com medalhas olímpicas no currículo. Emanuel Silva subiu ao pódio nos Jogos de Londres 2012, tendo conquistado a medalha de prata na prova de K2 1000m em conjunto com Fernando Pimenta. O outro medalhado da comitiva é Nelson Évora, que se sagrou campeão olímpico em Pequim 2008 no triplo salto. Nascido na Costa do Marfim, Nelson Évora é um dos 19 atletas nascidos fora de Portugal que vão competir por Portugal no Rio 2016. No que diz respeito à naturalidade, este é o contingente mais numeroso – seguido pelo dos naturais do distrito de Lisboa, que totaliza 16 elementos. No top das origens dos atletas seguem-se o Porto, com 12 atletas, Braga (nove) e Leiria (sete). Quase todo o país está representado, Açores (um atleta) e Madeira (três) incluídos. Só não há atletas oriundos dos distritos de Castelo Branco, Évora, Portalegre e Vila Real. Entre os nascidos no estrangeiro, há três desportistas com raízes em França (a maratonista Jéssica Augusto, a varista Maria Leonor Tavares e o golfista Filipe Lima). As mesatenistas Fu Yu e Shao Jieni nasceram na China; já a cavaleira Luciana Diniz e o velejador Gustavo Lima nasceram no Brasil. Angola, Bulgária, Congo, EUA, Guiné-Bissau, Inglaterra, Moldávia, Rússia, São Tomé e Príncipe, Suíça e Ucrânia são os países que compõem a lista. Um estudo conduzido por elementos do Imperial College de Londres concluiu que os portugueses “cresceram” 13,9 centímetros e as portuguesas 12,5 nos últimos 100 anos. A média de alturas, actualmente, situa-se nos 172,9 centímetros para os homens e 163cm para as mulheres. Mas os desportistas que vão ao Rio 2016 estão um pouco acima desses valores: a média de altura da delegação está em 175,4 centímetros, com o valor entre os homens a ser de 179,8 e para as mulheres de 166,2. Segundo os dados do Comité Olímpico de Portugal, o mais alto da comitiva é Tsanko Arnaudov, que competirá no lançamento do peso: mede 198 centímetros, mais quatro do que Tiago Ferreira (ciclismo BTT) e mais seis do que o judoca Célio Dias. A mulher mais alta é Irina Rodrigues, do lançamento do disco, com 183 centímetros. No extremo oposto estão três elementos do atletismo: Marta Pen (1500m) tem 153 centímetros de altura, seguida por Daniela Cardoso (20km marcha) e Salomé Rocha (10.000m), ambas com 157cm. David Rosa, que repete a presença de Londres 2012 no ciclismo BTT, é o mais baixo da delegação entre os homens: 164 centímetros. O atleta nascido em Fátima é também o homem mais leve, pesando 52 quilos. Mas ninguém pesa menos do que Jéssica Augusto, a mais leve da comitiva com 44 quilos. Tsanko Arnaudov é, para além do mais alto, também o mais pesado: 155 quilos. Sugerir correcção Leia os artigos que quiser, até ao fim.

REUTERS/Jose Manuel Ribeiro/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission and Portugal have agreed in principle on the recapitalization, on market terms, of ailing state-owned bank CGD, envisaging an injection of up to 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion) in state funds and nearly as much in debt and equity. Portugal is still reeling from two bank rescues in 2014 and 2015 that have undermined investor confidence. Caixa Geral de Depositos, or CGD, its largest bank by assets, needs to bolster its capital because of massive bad loans on its books. The government has been negotiating with Brussels for months so that any injection is not considered state aid and does not count towards the budget deficit, which Lisbon has promised to cut to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2016 from last year's 4.5 percent. \"This is an innovative deal in Europe...This is good news not only for CGD but for the whole Portuguese banking system,\" Finance Minister Mario Centeno told a news conference, adding that he expected that there would be no impact on the deficit. A spokeswoman for the European Commission said the planned recapitalization would have sufficiently high expected returns for the state to mean it would not be considered state aid. The plan, agreed in principle late on Tuesday between Centeno and European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is aimed at returning the bank to long-term health through cost cuts, improved efficiency and de-risking measures. The plan is yet to be formalized and approved by the College of Commissioners. Under the terms of the deal, Portugal will inject up to 2.7 billion euros of capital into CGD, transfer 500 million euros worth of its ParCaixa shares to CGD and convert 960 million euros of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds into equity. CGD has also committed to raise 1 billion euros of capital through subordinated debt, which means private investors can help to increase the bank's equity without becoming shareholders. CGD last received state funds in 2012 when 1.65 billion euros were injected via CoCo bonds. Other Portuguese banks that also received state help via CoCos then have repaid most of the loans to the government. The bank posted a net loss of 205 million euros in the first half of the year due to provisions for bad loans. The government in June ordered an independent audit of CGD, after allegations of irregularities in granting loans.

The paintings, estimated to be worth around €35m (£30.1m), came under state ownership in 2008 when the government nationalised the failed bank BNP which had built up the surrealist collection. Miró’s Studio review – hallucinatory shop window for the surrealist's later works Read more The former centre-right government put them up for auction in London in 2014 to raise cash but they were withdrawn after an outcry and a legal challenge from political opponents and activists. Centre-left prime minister, Antonio Costa, announced on Monday that the government had “finally decided to keep the famous collection of Miró works in the city of Porto”. It is unclear if they will remain state-owned or be sold to private collectors but a government official said any private buyer would have to accept keeping them in Porto. The paintings will go on display for the first time next Saturday at the city’s Serralves museum in an exhibition that runs until 28 January.

Can the statue of King D. Sebastiao be put back together again? Maybe. Courtesy Infraestruturas de Portugal It may well be if in the process of capturing your magic moment you also manage to destroy a treasured artifact. Authorities in Lisbon have told CNN they plan to press criminal charges against a 24-year-old Portuguese man who, while climbing onto a 126-year-old statue of King D. Sebastiao, knocked the statue to the ground, breaking it into about a dozen pieces. According to local police, the man’s weight brought the statue tumbling when he tried to climb it with a camera in hand. The incident took place on May 3 in downtown Lisbon’s Rossio Station. READ: Mumbai imposes no-selfie zones after deaths Police apprehended the man, who reportedly attempted to flee the scene, but have not released his name. Infraestruturas de Portugal (the public agency that oversees matters pertaining to Portuguese heritage and culture), says it plans to pursue charges “against the authors of this unfortunate act of destruction of national historical heritage.” Evaluation of statue ongoing The statue of King D. Sebastiao, was seriously damaged when it was accidentally knocked over by a tourist taking a selfie. Courtesy Infraestruturas de Portugal Infraestruturas de Portugal says it will consider restoring the broken statue or perhaps constructing a new one to take the old statue’s place. “We are (also) looking into the possibility of using a replica found at the palace of the Counts of Penamacor,” the agency tells CNN. Opened in 1890, Rossio Station is one of the most iconic and historically significant train stations in Europe. An ornate structure combining several architectural styles, it’s frequently mentioned in Portuguese literature. Travel + Leisure once named it one of the 14 most beautiful stations in the world. A legendary figure in Portuguese history, King D. Sebastiao, who reigned from 1557 to 1578, disappeared in battle at age 24. Soon after, Portugal lost its independence to Spain. Popular legend says Sebastiao will one day return on a foggy morning, riding a white horse. CNN’s Alba Prifti and Paulo Nogueira contributed to this report.

The Lisbon District Prosecutor's office said in a statement those detained were part of the Hammerskin Nation, a neo-Nazi skinhead group based in the U.S. city of Dallas. \"In our country they seek, among other things, to expel and prevent the entry of all ethnic minorities to Portugal,\" it said. The Portuguese Hammerskin group could not immediately be contacted for comment. The crimes being investigated took place between 2013 and 2015 and include at least one attempted murder, robbery, and religious and sexual discrimination, prosecutors said. Police said some of those detained were suspected of involvement in an attack on a group of anti-fascist communist activists in September 2015 following an anti-immigration rally in downtown Lisbon staged by ultra-nationalist groups. The police operation was the largest against neo-Nazi gangs since the 2007 arrest of 30 ultra-nationalists and their leader Mario Machado, who was sentenced to seven years in jail in 2010. Attacks on immigrants and refugees are rare in western Europe's poorest country, which attracts fewer newcomers than richer countries like Spain or France but has large minorities rooted in its African ex-colonies as well as Brazil and India.

Abstenção fixa-se nos 59,1%, a mais alta de sempre. PSD perde um mandato. CDS e Bloco de Esquerda ganham mais um representante Resultados fechados. O PS voltou a vencer as eleições nos Açores , com 46,4% dos votos, descendo 2,5 pontos face a 2012. Perdeu um mandato e fica com 30 no próximo Parlamento regional. Os socialistas conseguiram assim a sua quinta maioria absoluta, sendo a força política que durante mais anos governou o arquipélago. A segunda força mais votada foi o PSD. Os sociais-democratas, que têm menos um deputado , conquistaram 30,8% dos votos, contra os 32,9 de há quatro anos. A subir estiveram CDS , Bloco de Esquerda (BE), CDU e PPM. No caso dos centristas, passaram de três para quatro deputados no parlamento regional. O BE duplicou o número de eleitos e ficou com dois. CDU e PPM mantêm o mandato que tinham em 2012. Surpresa na noite eleitoral foi a eleição de um deputado da CDU pelo círculo das Flores, um facto inédito com João Paulo Corvelo a chegar ao parlamento regional. O médico veterinário conseguiu mesmo fazer da coligação liderada pelo PCP, a força mais votada na ilha, com 32,4% dos votos, contra 23,7% do PS e 21% do PSD. A abstenção cifrou-se nos 59,1%, a maior de sempre . Foram mais sete pontos face aos 52,1% registados em 2012. Círculo a círculo No círculo com menos eleitores, o da ilha do Corvo, o Partido Socialista e o Partido Popular Monárquico elegeram um deputado cada, repetindo assim o resultado das eleições de 2012. Já no círculo da Graciosa, o PS inverteu os resultados de 2012, conquistando dois deputados, levando o PSD a ficar com apenas um. Na ilha Terceira, o PS voltou a eleger seis deputados, à semelhança de 2012, 2008 e 2004. O PSD conquistou três mandatos e o CDS-PP, um. Nas Flores, a CDU consegue um resultado histórico ao conquistar um mandato ao PS, que elege também um deputado. O terceiro mandato foi para o PSD. No círculo do Faial, PS e PSD dividiram em partes iguais os quatro mandatos, à semelhança do que aconteceu em 2012 e em 2008. Na ilha de Santa Maria, o PS elegeu dois deputados regionais, tal como no sufrágio de 2012, enquanto o PSD voltou a conquistar um mandato. No Pico, PS e PSD repartiram também os quatro mandatos em disputa. No círculo da Terceira, o PS elegeu seis deputados, o PSD, 3 e o CDS, um. No maior círculo eleitoral, S. Miguel, o PS conquistou 12 mandatos, contra sete do PSD e um do BE. O sistema eleitoral regional açoriano compreende ainda um círculo de compensação que atribuiu um mandato a PS, PSD e BE e dois deputados ao CDS-PP. Vitória anunciada Desde o fecho das urnas, todas as projeções indicavam a vitória do PS com maioria absoluta nas eleições dos Açores. Vasco Cordeiro revalidava assim o mandato como presidente do Governo regional. Numa primeira reação, um porta-voz do PS dos Açores congratulou-se com a projetada vitória eleitoral, lamentando as perspetivas de um aumento da abstenção. Os números parecem indicar que houve uma avaliação positiva da atuação do Partido Socialista nos últimos quatro anos\" , referiu o vice-presidente do PS/Açores, André Bradford. A vitória viria a confirmar-se, com nova maioria absoluta. Alegria entre socialistas Logo após o fecho das urnas, a forte hipótese de repetição da maioria absoluta nas eleições regionais enchia já de festa o Teatro Micaelense, em Ponta Delgada, na ilha de São Miguel, onde estavam reunidos os socialistas. O vice-presidente do PS/Açores, André Bradford, salientou desde logo, a forma “ordeira” como decorreu o processo eleitoral, o que valoriza a autonomia. Mas lamentou também que “os níveis de abstenção previstos se mantenham elevados”, apesar de considerar ser necessária uma avaliação ponderada. Além de uma abstenção técnica crónica e muito elevada, há quatro anos, por exemplo, houve um aumento de 17 mil votantes, o que significa que qualquer análise a esta matéria tem de ser responsável, tecnicamente fundamentada, e não populista e pouco refletida” , sustentou. Cordeiro depois de César Há quatro anos, Vasco Cordeiro assumiu o cargo de presidente do Governo regional, sucedendo ao atual presidente do PS, Carlos César. Em 2012, o PS venceu as eleições regionais com maioria absoluta, (49,02%) e elegeu 31 deputados. O PSD obteve 20 mandatos (33,01%) e o CDS-PP três (5,67%). O Bloco de Esquerda (2,25%), a CDU (1,9%) e o PPM (0,08%) elegeram um parlamentar cada. Um total de 228.160 eleitores, mais 3.033 do que no sufrágio de 2012, estavam agora inscritos para escolher os 57 deputados da Assembleia Legislativa Regional. Mas quase seis em cada dez optaram por não votar, tendo em conta os 59,1% de abstenção. Concorreram às eleições 13 forças políticas: PSD, PSD, CDS-PP, BE, CDU, PPM, Livre, PAN, PCTP/MRPP, PURP, MAS, MPT e PDR. De acordo com os resultados das eleições, o Representante da República nomeia depois o presidente do Governo Regional que, por sua vez, propõe os membros do executivo.

Some 67,500 pine trees were planted in the Leiria forest, in central Portugal, which was almost entirely burned to ashes during a series of fires in October. \"We lost 80 percent of the Leiria pine forest in the fires, a great task is waiting for us: the reforestation will require the planting of about 22 million trees,\" said Cidalia Ferreira, the mayor of Marinha Grande where part of the 800-year-old wood is located. Volunteers were supported by military, police and fire personnel in the government-led initiative. \"We will rebuild this pine forest, so that it becomes pretty and so that our children will have clear air to breathe in the future. That is what motivates me,\" volunteer Jose Dyonisio told AFP. The forest dates back to the 13th century and its pine was used by Portuguese explorers to build sailing ships between the 15th and 17th centuries. The wave of fires which ripped through swathes of land in central Portugal killed 49 people in October last year. The latest victim of the blazes died of her wounds on Saturday in hospital. Those fires came after 64 people died in June in the central Pedrogao Grande region, in what were the deadliest wildfires in the country's history. © 2018 AFP Advertising Most read 1 ‘Time to boycott all men’: The 4B movement going viral after Trump's victory EXPLAINER Americas 2 The bells of Notre Dame cathedral ring out for first time since 2019 fire Europe 3 Israeli police detain two French Consulate gendarmes in Jerusalem Middle East 4 Who are the key figures of Donald Trump's new inner circle?

Portugal com dois representantes nos Jogos Olímpicos de Inverno Kequyan Lam, no esqui de fundo, e Arthur Hanse, no esqui alpino, são os defensores das cores portuguesas entre 9 e 25 de fevereiro na Coreia do Sul Laura Ramires 7 de Fevereiro 2018 às 21:48 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Email this Page Kequyen Lam, nascido em Macau, e Arthur Hanse, lusodescendente, seguiram esta terça-feira para PyeongChang, onde vão defender as cores portuguesas entre os próximos dias 9 e 25 de fevereiro nos Jogos Olímpicos de Inverno de 2018. Apesar de Lam ter começado a representar Portugal no snowboard, modalidade em que chegou a participar nos campeonatos do Mundo entre 2011 e 2013, o macaense irá prestar provas no esqui de fundo. Uma lesão no ombro empurrou-o para este novo desafio, que começou a praticar há apenas dois anos. “É um privilégio e irei usar as nossas cores com muito orgulho. Ser um dos dois atletas significa que podemos chamar muita atenção para os desportos de inverno em Portugal e espero também que possa inspirar outras pessoas a seguirem os seus sonhos”, disse ao “SOL” o atleta que, aos 38 anos, cumpriu pela primeira vez o sonho de se qualificar para uns JO. “Nervoso, ansioso, mas bem preparado”, Lam tem como principal objetivo esquiar com boa técnica, bom ritmo e o mais rápido e melhor que conseguir. CR7 do esqui Ao contrário de Kequyen Lam, para Arthur Hanse, de 24 anos, esta não será uma estreia. Aos 20 anos, o luso-francês foi o porta-estandarte nos Jogos Olímpicos de Sochi. “Tenho a nacionalidade portuguesa, vivo como um português fora do país, tenho amigos portugueses, gosto de Portugal, da cultura, do futebol, da comida, das bebidas… Sinto-me tão português quanto um português ou até mesmo mais”, garante ao i antes da partida. Agora, quatro anos depois, a meta para Hanse é terminar as corridas em slalom e slalom gigante, um feito que não conseguiu alcançar na Rússia. “Acabar as corridas para que Portugal seja classificado! Um top-30 seria um sonho e um top–50 é a realidade”, diz. “Quero mostrar ao mundo que Portugal tem outros talentos além do futebol”, explica o jovem estudante que há cerca de um ano se dedica a 100% à modalidade. Para Hanse, só agora se está a iniciar uma “revolução” nos desportos de inverno em Portugal e, por essa razão, acredita que “vai ser encontrada uma ótima equipa portuguesa para os JO2022”. “Quero ver uma equipa mais forte, uma família do esqui maior!”, conclui. Presidente da FPDI na Coreia Pedro Farromba, presidente da Federação Portuguesa de Desportos de Inverno (FPDI), será um entre a comitiva de seis portugueses que irão acompanhar Kequyen e Arthur na Coreia. Apesar de admitir que as medalhas olímpicas não estão no horizonte, o líder da missão lusa em solo sul–coreano reforçou a importância do evento desportivo como “forma de promover as modalidades de inverno”. A apresentação da missão olímpica decorreu esta segunda-feira na sede do Comité Olímpico de Portugal, em Lisboa, um dia antes da partida para PyeongChang, com a presença do presidente do Comité Olímpico Português, José Manuel Constantino, e do secretário de Estado do Desporto, João Paulo Rebelo.

The fire in Vila Nova da Rainha started when a heating boiler in the building exploded, the mayor said. More than 60 people were at the centre for an amateur card tournament or were watching football on TV. The fire reportedly ignited material in the roof and spread quickly, causing panic. Vila Nova da Rainha is close to the town of Tondela and is about 260km (160 miles) north-east of Lisbon. The mayor of Tondela, JosÃ© AntÃ³nio Jesus, told the PÃºblico newspaper , external that the fire quickly created a large amount of carbon monoxide. He said the recreational and cultural centre was \"very active and at the heart of the community\". At least 35 people were hurt, six of them seriously, according to local media, with most suffering burns or smoke inhalation. Some of the injured were taken to hospitals in Lisbon and Porto, the DiÃ¡rio de NotÃ­cias website reported. The newspaper said glass wool in the roof may have contributed to the spread of the fire in the two-storey building. The dense smoke may have disoriented people as they tried to escape. One of those at the centre, Rui Abreu, told Jornal de NotÃ­cias , external that some people had fallen on top of each other on the stairs. Dozens of fire-fighters were deployed and the flames were extinguished in about an hour. The Tondela area was badly hit by forest fires last October and local officials described the latest deaths as a \"new catastrophe\".

The person killed was a 23-year-old Brazilian man. An 18-year-old German woman was rushed to hospital by helicopter with multiple fractures, police said. Three other tourists from the same group were being treated for shock. \"The Maritime Authority has issued warnings in the last few days to avoid such areas because of the storms and rockslides ... These foreigners ... had the bad luck of having rocks falling right on their tent,\" said harbor police commander Rui Pereira da Terra. The group of five were camping out on the isolated Praia da Ursa beach, which lies beneath a 150-metre high cliff less than a mile north of Cape Roca, the western extremity of the Eurasian land mass on the Atlantic coast. The cape 40 km west of Lisbon, with its landmark lighthouse, is popular with tourists. Most of Portugal was hit by a low pressure storm dubbed Gisele on Wednesday and early on Thursday.

        "text": "Former Porto mayor rejects populism as he seeks to rebuild support for Social Democrats.\t\t\t\nLISBON — Rui Rio won the race to become leader of Portugal’s center-right opposition late Saturday after campaigning to hold his Social Democratic Party (PSD) on a centrist line.\n“The current government will have in the new PSD leadership a firm and attentive opposition, but never one that is populist or demagogic,” Rio told cheering supporters in the northern city of Porto, which he governed as mayor for almost 12 years up to 2013.\nRio defeated his more conservative rival, former prime minister Pedro Santana Lopes, winning 54 percent of votes from PSD party members.\nHe now faces an uphill struggle to unify the party so it can challenge the Socialist government led by Prime Minister António Costa in a parliamentary election scheduled for late 2019.\nTwo recent opinion polls suggested the PSD would lose heavily to Costa’s Socialists, whoever is in charge.\nRio is a supporter of abortion, euthanasia and legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes.\nRio would win 33 percent of the national vote against 56 percent for Costa, according to a poll published in the Correio da Manhã newspaper. The other poll, commissioned by Santana Lopes’ campaign, suggested Rio would win just 25 percent.\nThe new leader has to rebuild support for the Social Democrats that was damaged by unpopular austerity policies introduced when the party was in power from 2011 to 2015 under Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho.\nRio was a critic of austerity and has sought to distance himself from the tough remedies imposed by Passos Coelho in response to the eurozone economic crisis.\nIn his victory speech late Saturday, Rio promised to work for a “more just and more harmonious society.”\nHe also wants to lower taxes and has criticized Costa’s government for failing to take advantage of the current economic recovery to push through reforms to make Portugal more competitive.\nOn social issues, Rio is to the left of his party as a supporter of abortion, euthanasia and legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes.\nRio, 60, grew up studying at Porto’s German School. He will be able to converse fluently in German with Chancellor Angela Merkel when they meet at European People’s Party gatherings.\nHe joined the Social Democratic Party shortly after its foundation following Portugal’s 1974 revolution that ended over four decades of dictatorship.\nAn economist by training, Rio was a member of parliament from 1991 to 2001, held prominent party positions at the national level and won three consecutive elections as mayor of Porto.\nIn the bad-tempered leadership campaign, he pledged to reestablish the PSD as a broad-based centrist party.\n“The PSD is not of the right or of the left. The PSD is a party of the center,” he told broadcaster RTP. “Some of us are more to the center left, others more to the center right, this is our electoral space.”\nRio is also open to supporting a minority Socialist government if Costa wins the 2019 election.\nHe has suggested the Social Democrats could take up Costa’s call for a cross-party consensus on a national public works program to attract European Union funding.\nRio is also open to supporting a minority Socialist government if Costa wins the 2019 election but fails to secure a parliamentary majority.\nThat offer sparked criticism from his conservative leadership rival. Rio countered that his priority would be to ensure there would be no repeat of the current government alliance under which Costa’s minority administration governs with support from the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc party.\nHow the Portuguese Socialist leader upset the odds to win a rare majority government.\nSocialist Party wins absolute majority, but far right makes gains.\nAntónio Costa looks set for third term. \nSocialists’ poll lead narrows in runup to Sunday’s legislative vote.",

In televised remarks from Davos, Switzerland, Costa said the decision by the U.S. technology company would mean the creation of 500 tech jobs for highly-skilled Portuguese workers and was an acknowledgment of the country's growing education standards and technological prowess.

A Google spokesperson would not say how much the company planned to invest in the Lisbon centre, which will be fully dedicated to third party suppliers who support Google's operations.

The economy ministry said that the talks about the new hub had begun during the annual Web Summit in November, hosted by Lisbon for the second year in a row. The Web Summit has grown into one of the world's largest technology conferences, from 400 participants when it started in Dublin in 2010, to 59,000 participants in November. Portugal pulled off a coup by bringing the Web Summit to Lisbon in 2016 with the government pinning its hopes on the event to boost funding and other support for technology firms in an economy that is still recovering from a 2011-14 economic and debt crisis.

(Armando Franca/Associated Press) Social Sharing Pre-competition favourite Netta Barzilai won the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest for Israel on Saturday with her song Toy . Barzilai beat out competition from 42 other countries' performers to claim the music extravaganza's annual crown at the Grand Final in Lisbon, Portugal. It's not all glitter and gimmicks: Eurovision 2018 gets political Eurovision winner greeted by cheering fans upon return to Portugal There was a strong field of contestants at this year's event, and the Israeli entry topped close competition from Cyprus, Austria, Sweden and Germany. Barzilai racked up 529 points, compared with 436 for runner-up Cyprus and 342 for third-place Austria. The contest largely shed its traditional hallmarks of glitz and glitter in favour of a more restrained and tasteful tone in Lisbon, which was hosting the event because it won last year with Salvador Sobral's sober and subdued ballad Amar pelos Dois . She's not our TOY, but she is a 'beautiful creature'! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NettaBarzilai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NettaBarzilai</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESC2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ESC2018</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllAboard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AllAboard</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ISR</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Scr09CQ8X5\">pic.twitter.com/Scr09CQ8X5</a> &mdash; @Eurovision Sobral last week criticized Toy as \"horrible music.\" But Barzilai was unrepentant with her popular techno dance beat about women's empowerment. Her win — Israel's fourth overall and its first time since 1998 — means her country hosts next year's Eurovision Song Contest, which is watched by some 200 million people. \"Next time in Jersualem!\" Barzilai shouted to the audience as she picked up her award. \"I'm happy people chose something different.

(Armando Franca/Associated Press) The international contest began as a competition between European countries, but its huge popularity has led to the inclusion of Israel and Australia among the performers. Barzilai, known more usually as Netta, is a sassy woman with a witty on-stage personality. Before the Grand Final, her song had already racked up more than 20 million views on Eurovision's YouTube channel. In Toy , Netta makes funny noises, including a clucking sound like a chicken and barely decipherable words, and uses a looping machine and synthesizer. The lyrics say, \"I'm not your toy, You stupid boy, I'll take you down.\" Portugal came last, with 39 points.

The man got hold of the microphone but was quickly tackled by security and taken away while SuRie stood by. The British singer kept her composure and picked up her song where she left off. Previous editions of the annual event have also witnessed protesters getting onto the stage. The event is organized by the European Broadcasting Union, an alliance of public service broadcasters.

Citizens from the age of 16 will now be able to change their gender and name in documents without the need of a medical report. Activists welcomed the \"groundbreaking\" law, saying it respected the right of self-determination. Critics were against allowing changes without a medical report and lowering the minimum age, currently at 18. Lawmakers celebrated the vote of approval - by 109 votes in the 230-seat parliament - with a standing ovation. What does legally changing gender involve? Isabel Moreira, an MP from the Socialist Party, called this a \"historic day that honours every trans person and their families\". VÃ¢nia Dias da Silva, from the right-wing party CDS-PP, which opposed the bill, said: \"We disagree with this law. [Those who are] 16 years old can't marry, drink, or drive, so they shouldn't be able to make a decision with such definite and serious consequences.\" For those aged between 16 or 18, the change of gender will need to be approved by their parents or legal representatives. Under the old law, those wanting to change their gender on official documents had to present a medical report and be at least 18 years old. A tradition of liberal liberties By Mia Alberti, Lisbon Until 2011 Portugal had no legislation regarding the recognition of transgender identity. Back then to legally change their identity, transgender people had to be sterilised and sue the state for wrongful attribution of identity. That year Portugal approved the current Gender Law, widely celebrated by LGBT activists. Since then, 485 people have changed their legal name and gender, according to the Ministry of Justice. There is no data on how many transgender teenagers are in Portugal. However, ZÃ©lia Figueiredo, a psychiatrist and expert in sexology, says the transgender teens seeking her \"are increasingly younger\". The Gender Law follows a number of other liberal law changes that have reshaped the social landscape in Portugal: drug decriminalisation (2001), same-sex marriage (2010), same-sex adoption (2016) and surrogacy (2016). The legalisation of the medicinal use of marijuana and euthanasia are already scheduled for debate in parliament. Katrin Hugendubel of ILGA-Europe, an LGBT rights advocacy group, said: \"People will be able to change their legal gender through a procedure based on self-determination. \"This means that the law finally recognises and respects that trans people themselves know best who they are and how they identify.\" Only five other European countries have a model based on self-determination, according to the group: Malta, Norway, Denmark, Ireland and Belgium. In the UK, individuals need to be 18 years old to require a legal change of their gender , a process that can take up to five years and requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a psychiatrist. The new Portuguese legislation also outlaws unnecessary surgery on intersex children. It now needs to be signed by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to come into effect.

The stalemate left Sporting and Benfica four points behind Porto with one match each to play, ending Benfica’s run of four successive titles. Benfica midfielder Rafa Silva twice hit the woodwork in the first half as the Eagles tried desperately to keep alive the title race for another week. There was a boisterous atmosphere at the Alvalade stadium and play was interrupted after three minutes when firecrackers rained down on Sporting goalkeeper Rui Patricio’s penalty area. There was another delay at the start of the second half due to a problem with the cables supporting an aerial television camera. Porto, who host Feirense on Sunday, have 82 points from 32 games, with Benfica and Sporting on 78 from 33. It was their 28th league title and their first since 2013.

The Portuguese television channel RTP said that around 50 intruders, who had covered their faces to avoid being identified, interrupted team practice and assaulted players and staff. They also caused damage to a changing room. The club confirmed the incident, issuing a statement condemning “acts of vandalism and the attacks on [our] athletes, coaches and professional staff”. The Dutch forward Bas Dost, who has scored 34 goals for the club this season, reportedly suffered cuts to his head in the attack. Jorge Jesus, the team’s head coach, goalkeeper Rui Patrício and midfielder William Carvalho were also targeted, according to reports from the newspaper O Jogo. Police to issue England fans with guide to ‘sensitive sites’ at World Cup Read more “Sporting is not this, Sporting cannot be this,” the club statement added. “We will take all steps to establish responsibility for what has happened and we demand the punishment of those who have acted in this absolutely regrettable manner.” The Portuguese league also condemned “the violent acts [that] the players and coaching staff of Sporting were subject to today. The perpetrators of these incidents are not fans of football. They are criminals.” Sporting missed out on a Champions League place last weekend after Patrício’s late error led to a 2-1 defeat at Maritimo, allowing their bitter rivals Benfica to leapfrog them into second place. Tuesday’s events at the Alcochete training centre 20km south of Lisbon mark a new low in a turbulent season. Last month the club president Bruno de Carvalho suspended 19 first-team players after a row on social media. Sporting are preparing to play the Portuguese Cup final against Aves on Sunday.

These included Neuville's main championship rivals, Argentina winner Ott Tanak (Toyota) and points leader coming into the event Sebastien Ogier (M-Sport Ford). Tanak's rally lasted only a few miles as he retired on the first stage with an oil-related issue after hitting a rock. Adding to Toyota's disastrous start, his team-mate Jari-Matti Latvala stopped on the next stage with broken front-right suspension. Ogier then crashed out on Friday afternoon, sliding off the road on the Viana do Castelo stage after clipping a bank. There was further drama elsewhere that afternoon, particularly on the subsequent second run at Ponte de Lima where Neuville took an overall lead he wasn't to lose after the top three runners hit problems. Hyundai's Hayden Paddon crashed out while leading and his team-mate Dani Sordo, who was second, lost half a minute after cracking a rim. Citroen's Craig Breen was third but lost more than two minutes on the stage after stopping to change a tyre. Hyundai's Andreas Mikkelsen also stopped on this stage after power steering problems. This left Neuville leading by seven seconds from Ford's Elfyn Evans as the Hyundai driver built an advantage of around 40s over the Welshman by the end of Saturday's running, which he maintained until the end. Neuville also took four additional points by placing second on the rally-closing Fafe power stage. Kris Meeke was third after the second Ponte de Lima stage on Friday - despite an earlier puncture - but then lost a minute when he did the subsequent Porto street stages with his left-rear wheel down to the rim after a tyre delamination. The Citroen driver then crashed out heavily on Saturday morning on a left-hand bend with his car coming to rest in the trees. The Irishman was taken to hospital for precautionary checks on his back but was released later in the day. A tight battle for the final podium place was won by Evans' team-mate Teemu Suninen, taking his first ever WRC podium and making it a Ford 2-3. He was chased by Toyota's Esapekka Lappi and Sordo, the latter ending Saturday third overall but dropped to fourth overnight with a 10s penalty for dislodging two of the bails on a Porto street stage roundabout. Lappi took fourth in the end, 7.4s behind Suninen and 6.2s ahead of Sordo in fifth. Ogier, Latvala and Mikkelsen all returned to the action under Rally2 rules on Saturday hoping to score points on the power stage, but none of them did as Mikkelsen came closest in sixth. The five additional points were taken by Lappi.

REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament overwhelmingly approved a bill on Friday to legalise marijuana-based medicines, after rejecting earlier proposals to allow patients to grow the drug at home. Portugal decriminalised the use of all drugs in 2001 to fight a heroin epidemic, and has legal plantations growing marijuana products for export. But it had trailed EU countries such as Italy and Germany, as well as Canada and parts of the United States on medical marijuana.

The bill now goes to President Marcelo Rebelo de Souza to be signed into law.

The Party of People, Animals and Nature (PAN), which has only one MP, proposed legislation that would have prohibited an activity which has been part of the country’s culture since the 19th century. In contrast to Spain next door, where bulls are killed in the ring by a matador, in Portugal the animals’ lives are not ended in front of a cheering crowd. If they are judged to have performed well, they are spared and used for breeding. Often the bulls are simply slaughtered later.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante [1/11] Demonstrators attend a protest against euthanasia in front off the parliament in Lisbon, Portugal May 29,  2018. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament rejected on Tuesday a bill that would have legalised voluntary euthanasia for terminal patients in the Catholic-majority country by a narrow margin, but it secured enough support to ensure continued debate on the issue. Drafted by the ruling Socialists, the bill garnered 110 votes in the 230-seat parliament but was stymied by 115 opponents, with 4 abstentions, after a heated debate and a vote that required each lawmaker to declare his or her stance. Earlier, a few hundred people of all ages - mostly from religious groups and Catholic schools - protested in front of the parliament building, chanting \"Yes to life, no to euthanasia!\" and carrying placards, \"We demand palliative care for ALL\" and, \"Euthanasia is a recipe for elder abuse\". The Portuguese Doctors' Association opposed the change, saying it violated key principles of the medical profession. Proponents of the bill, which was inspired by a 2016 petition signed by over 8,000 people and promoted by groups defending the right to a \"death with dignity\" for those seriously ill, said the fight had only just begun. \"The issue is now firmly on the political agenda, it is now in detailed debate in society,\" said Catarina Martins, leader of the Left Bloc - a key government ally in parliament, which had its own version of a legalisation proposal. \"It is no longer a problem that each family with a suffering loved one has to face on its own, it now becomes a problem for all of us to find answers to...The state cannot continue to close its eyes to the suffering,\" she said. Another of the government's hard left allies, the Communists, voted against the legislation, joining the conservative CDS-PP on the other end of the political spectrum. Several lawmakers from the main opposition Social Democrats supported the bill, but that was not enough to get it passed. The Socialist bill envisaged legalisation for medically-assisted death based on an informed request by patients suffering profoundly from a serious, incurable illness with no expected improvement in sight, in a terminal state, or suffering from widely incapacitating lesion. On a national level, only a few countries in the world have legalised euthanasia - which usually means a doctor administering lethal doses of drugs to patients willing to die - or medically-assisted suicide where patients take the final action themselves. Laws in Belgium, the Netherlands, Colombia and Luxemburg allow euthanasia. In Switzerland, Germany, Japan and Canada, doctor-assisted suicide is legal. Portugal, which spent a large part of the 20th century until the 1974 Carnation revolution ruled by an ultra-conservative fascist regime, has since made strides in liberal reforms upholding human rights. It legalised abortions in 2007 and then allowed same-sex marriage in 2010, becoming only the eighth country in the world at the time to allow same-sex marriage nationwide.

The law, approved by parliament last month, would have allowed citizens to make the legal changes from the age of 16 without the need of a medical test. Currently, people must be at least 18 years old and present a medical report. The president told MPs to consider the need of a medical test for those under the age of 18. Under the proposed law, those aged between 16 and 18 would need to have the change of gender approved by their parents or legal representatives. The law needs to be signed by the president to take effect. What does legally changing gender involve? What happens now? Parliament can either amend the law in line with the president's suggestions or confirm the current legislation with the approval of an absolute majority of MPs. In this case, the president would be obliged to sign it into law. Mr Rebelo de Sousa called for \"the provision of prior medical evaluation for citizens under 18 years of age\" in a statement posted on the presidential website , external (in Portuguese). Explaining his decision, he said that if there is a possibility that the individual will undergo gender reassignment surgery in future then it would be \"sensible\" to seek a medical opinion at an early stage. What has the reaction been? Lawmakers celebrated with a standing ovation when the legislation was approved on 13 April by 109 votes in the country's 230-seat parliament. Activists welcomed the \"groundbreaking\" law, saying it respected the right of self-determination. But critics opposed allowing changes without a medical report and lowering the minimum age. Citing those divergences, Mr Rebelo de Sousa said the changes being introduced were \"far from being a consent\" among politicians and society. Image source, EPA Image caption, The president told MPs to consider the need of a medical test for those under the age of 18 There was mixed reaction to the veto: LGBT rights advocacy group ILGA-Europe called the decision \"frustrating\" , external , saying: \"Young people must be able to access a legal gender recognition procedure that is fair and trusts them to know who they are\" Margarida Faria, president of a group representing parents in favour of sexual orientation freedom, Amplos, said the president did not challenge the right of self-determination for those from the age of 18, \"an important progress\" , external The Association of Portuguese Catholic Doctors welcomed the decision saying the opinion of doctors in these cases is of \"huge importance\" Nuno MagalhÃ£es, from the right-wing party CDS-PP, also supported the veto while Isabel Moreira, an MP from the Socialist Party who voted in favour of the law, said changes could be made to it The new legislation also outlawed unnecessary surgery on intersex children. What's the legislation across Europe? Only five other European countries have a model based on self-determination, according to  ILGA-Europe: Malta, Norway, Denmark, Ireland and Belgium. In the UK, individuals need to be 18 years old to require a legal change of their gender , a process that can take up to five years and requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a psychiatrist.

Alan Tyers live updates 01 July 2018 1:45pm BST How does Portugal being knocked out change the World Cup? Have a look with our predictor Why Messi and Ronaldo must not just be judged on World Cups First Lionel Messi was upstaged by Kylian Mbappe, now Cristiano Ronaldo must wrestle with the crushing disappointment of seeing his World Cup dream shattered after being comprehensively outstripped by another Paris St-Germain striker. Two sumptuous goals from Edinson Cavani set up a tantalising quarter-final meeting with France on Friday on a day when hope of a Messi-Ronaldo showdown in Nizhny Novgorod was vanquished. Yet this was not quite the fairytale for Cavani that France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina had proved for his club team-mate, Mbappe, who also scored twice, earlier in the day. There was only 10 minutes between Cavani scoring Uruguay’s decisive second, after the Portugal defender Pepe had cancelled out his opening goal, and the striker pulling up with a hamstring injury and limping off with a crestfallen look on his face. Oscar Tabarez, the Uruguay coach, said Cavani would be assessed, but with only six days until they face France, time is against him. “He felt pain,” Tabarez said. “We don’t have a lot of time for recovery but after a rest day we will have a diagnosis. Now we are worried but right now we don’t know how grave this injury is.” Cristiano Ronaldo helps the injured Edinson Cavani off the pitch Credit : afp Cavani was helped off the field in a show of great sportsmanship from Ronaldo but this was the closest the Portugal captain got to making an impression on the game. The Real Madrid maestro was a virtual bystander, powerless, like Messi, to prevent his team’s exit, his misery compounded in the closing seconds when he was booked for protesting over a perceived Uruguay foul. It was actually the only yellow card of a game that, while ferociously fought, didn't descend into the slugfest many anticipated. Whether Ronaldo gets another stab at winning a World Cup in Qatar in four years time, when he will be 37, remains to be seen but Fernando Santos expects him to still be there when qualifying for Euro 2020 begins in September. “Cristiano still has a lot to give, there’s qualifying starting in September and, of course, we hope Cristiano will be with us to help these young players to grow. It’s important to have the captain’s presence there and he’s always there for us.” Portugal were certainly knocking on Uruguay’s door in the final 20 minutes but it was Bernardo Silva and others, rather than a strangely subdued Ronaldo, who led the fight, only to be repelled time and again by Uruguay’s outstanding defence, which played as big a part in this victory as its electrifying attack. And what an attack, one that will be sadly weakened if Cavani is missing against France. There have been all manner of arresting goals scored in this tournament but a pair of centre-forwards combining to convert what was effectively a 100-yard one-two provided a new category altogether. Uruguay's Edinson Cavani scores their first goal past Portugal's Rui Patricio Credit : Reuters Cavani picked up the ball on Uruguay’s right touchline, about 15 yards past the halfway line, and speared a raking pass over to Suarez on the opposite side. Suarez controlled on his chest and, while Cavani made a dash for the six-yard box, the Barcelona striker cut inside Ricardo and then bent a venomous, humdinger of a cross from the edge of the penalty area over Jose Fonte and the despairing Raphael Guerreiro to Cavani. Initially, it looked as if Cavani had craned his neck quite superbly to head home from close range. In fact, the ball hit his face and bounced in but the combination play was still something to savour. “There was no scheme against that - it was an incredible play,” Santos said. “Uruguay have never scored like that. We weren’t prepared to control that sort of movement from Cavani and Suarez.” That was seven minutes in and an early reminder that, for all its pre-match billing as a bruising, cynical encounter between some of the game’s most wily and belligerent individuals, there were plenty of players on show who could play a bit, too. That is not to say the fine arts were not interspersed with some occasional dark arts. There was some play-acting from Suarez and Pepe, a late poleaxing of Fonte by the uncompromising Martin Caceres and some grizzled old-school defending from the imperious Diego Godin, whose reaction to planting his forehead into the back of Goncalo Guedes’s head was the quickest rub and a shrug of the shoulders. But for the most part it was a game played hard but fair and was all the more engrossing for it. Diego Godin is a rock in Uruguay's defence Credit : afp It was slim pickings for Ronaldo throughout, though. There were shades of the 2009 Champions League final between Barcelona and Manchester United early on when he kept trying his hand from distance. One sighter was comfortably saved, another charged down and then he bludgeoned a free-kick into a wall, but, as the game wore on, he became increasingly peripheral as Portugal instead looked to Bernardo. Ronaldo’s one contribution of note was to draw the attention of Godin and his equally brilliant central-defensive partner, Jose Gimenez, away from Pepe and allow his Portugal team-mate the space and opportunity to head home Guerreiro’s corner. The goal was a frustration for Uruguay but no more. It was pretty much the only time their obdurate, highly-organised backline was breached but there is strength and balance running through this side and, within seven minutes, they were back in front. The ease with which Rodrigo Bentancur picked up possession after a long punt up field was knocked down will grate with Santos but make no mistake about the quality that followed. Bentancur swept the ball across the edge of the penalty, right to left, and into the path of Cavani, who opened up his body and stroked a sublime first-time finish low into the far corner. It would be Cavani's last contribution. But what a contribution, the kind Ronaldo must have dreamt of. WorldCup - newsletter promo - end of article 9:16PM Overall A nother highly enjoyable World Cup day. France and Argentina served up a seven-goal belter, and then Portugal and Uruguay had a great tussle that ended up with the South Americans worthy winners, and Ronaldo going home.

Suarez brilliant down the right, holds it up, avoid a couple of challenges and lashes it across.... the man arriving late in the area cannot turn it in. 8:51PM 90+ mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 G reat ball in from B Silva and a superb bit of defending from Laxalt, who has played so well he can be forgiven his Jar-Jar Binks braids. 8:50PM 90mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 H ere he is, the main man: Ronaldo runs at the goal, the play opens up, he hammers a shot... but slices it wide. Four minutes will be added. 8:48PM 88 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 C rowd roars as Ronaldo gets it but he's dispossessed with some ease. Here come POR again though. But no. Laxalt, who has had a good game at full back, wins a foul off Quaresma. Fernando Santos current look: stressed out deputy head just been told Ofsted arriving on Monday — Sam Wallace (@SamWallaceTel) June 30, 2018 8:47PM 86 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 M anuel Fernandes tries another ludicrous effort from distance that is still rising when it leaves the stadium (I exaggerate). Ronaldo gives him a dressing down. Chance for URG to relieve some pressure as Suarez works the Portugal defence. 8:45PM 85 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 J Mario is off. Manuel Fernandes, the man who replaces him, picks it up, runs at goal, and hits a hopeful effort straight at the keeper from distance. Quaresma with a good deep cross but it's cleared. 8:43PM 84 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 B ernardo with a great run, frees Ricardo Pereira, who goes down cheaply under pressure from Godin. Ref correctly tells him to wind his neck in. 8:42PM 83 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 Q uaresma, who scored that peach with the outside of his foot the other day, uses that technique again for a lovely improvised cross. Close to a chance! Cleared. Exciting stuff now. 8:40PM 81 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 R onaldo has tried to dribble through most if not all of the URG team. Nope. Beautiful moment there when he looked a bit peeved, saw himself on the big screen and just started clapping encouragingly. — Vithushan Ehantharajah (@Vitu_E) June 30, 2018 8:40PM 80 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 N ández comes off. He takes his time. Ref gives him the hurry up. He shakes the ref's hand. Heh. Carlos Sanchez replaces him. Portugal take a short corner that comes to naught. 8:38PM 79 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 U RG are digging in. Everyone working their socks off, from Suarez up top on back. Suarez is a terrible bloke but my God what a footballer. Tireless. Bernardo Silva gets to the byline, crosses, wins a corner off Giménez. 8:36PM 77 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 C orner. Ronaldo cannot connect with the header. Guerreiro fires over. Portugal's shooting has been poor.  Awful, in fact. Uruguay vs Portugal shots on goal 8:35PM 75 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 C avani is icing his calf on the bench. Hope he is okay. A magnificent display from him today; he deserves to take his place in the last eight. Stuani is on in his place. Gonçalo Guedes has come off to be replaced by Andre Silva 8:32PM 73 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 R onaldo comes deep. Portugal piling it on. Ronaldo shoots and it is charged down. Again, I think he'd be better off getting IN the box and trusting one of his minions to deliver the ball in. 8:31PM 72 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 C avani wants off. And he wants to do it as slowly as possible. Ronaldo sportingly helps him off. Alternative reading: Ronaldo manhandles him off to get the game going again! Credit: ITV 8:29PM 70 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 K eeper has come out flapping.... he thinks he has  got it under pressure from Quresma... he's dropped it! He's all over the shop the lad. It drops for Bernardo Silva, who cannot steer towards the open net. There were lots of bodies in the way and it was technically difficult to strike it but he really could have done better. 8:28PM 68 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 R onaldo comes deep to link with Guerreiro. Don't think URG will mind that, Portugal looked their best in the third quarter of the match here when CR7 played centrally with one behind him. 8:26PM 65 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 A drien Silva is substituted for Ricardo Quaresma, who soon has the ball on the right. Wins a corner. Ronaldo arrives like a train to meet the set piece but cannot connect. 8:25PM 64 mins: Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 T hat assist is Bentancur's last act. He is off. Rodríguez is on. Clinical Cavani. #URU 2-1 #POR https://t.co/O4oSE9NWt6 pic.twitter.com/MZG3ix9wI6 — Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) June 30, 2018 8:22PM GOAL! Uruguay 2 Portugal 1 (Cavani 62) U ruguay have been under the pump. But they have composure, heart and skill. The ball is hit forward by the URG keeper and Pepe has.... misjudged it! Portugal have four in the backline to deal with the three attackers of Uruguay but Portugal have not got their set-up right at all. Cavani is all alone our on the left there... he's slipped the ball, he spots the opening, he opens up his body and he curls it home. Yes! Uruguay 2 - 1 Portugal (Edinson Cavani, 62 min) 8:20PM 61 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 1 F onte tries to head it back across from the set piece. 8:19PM 60 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 1 G ame's opening up. B Silva and A Silva are both getting a chance to run at the defence. Corner to Portugal. Snuffed out. Another. I'd get it in there. 8:17PM 56 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 1 P ortugal dangerous, pushing for more. But here's a break from Uruguay's Laxalt. Ended unfairly by Carvalho. Nowhere near the ball. Ref quite generous I think. 8:15PM GOAL! Uruguay 1 Portugal 1 (Pepe 54) C orner taken short, and now played in with a really superb cross, finally they have found a ball. Rare misjudgment from Godin, he moves towards Ronaldo - not unreasonably - but here is Pepe arriving unmarked. Great header! Goal Portugal. Uruguay 1 - 1 Portugal (Pepe, 55 min) 8:14PM 53 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 J Mario dummies, I guess you'd call it. Ronaldo has the ball tries to find an opening, cannot, sets up colleague Adrien Silva. Shoots. Corner. 8:13PM 50 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 P ortugal starting to dominate the possession. Giménez clears a cross. 8:11PM 50 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 C orner for Portugal. Bernardo. Wasted. Very irritating, given that they've got Ronaldo to aim at. Breaks eventually to Guerreiro, who thumps a hopeful shot well over. 8:10PM 49 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 R icardo overlaps, crosses, Godin has seen that one coming. Clears. 8:09PM 49 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 B oth sides fighting like tigers, there's a lot to admire from these two teams, albeit that chances have been at a premium. Suarez catches B Silva. Not as much cheaty-cheaty as we'd feared/hoped. 8:07PM 47 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 Just a thought but maybe whoever is receiving the ball wide for Portugal could consider crossing first time. Absolutely dreadful deliveries/attempted deliveries in the first half & Ronaldo such a threat in the air. #bbcworldcup #URUvPOR — Steven Sutcliffe (@SteveOSutcliffe) June 30, 2018 8:05PM 46 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 U ruguay as good a team as any I would imagine at protecting a 1-0. Bernardo Silva is playing behind CR7 now. Gonçalo Guedes needs to raise his game. He's been pushed out wider. 8:04PM Ronaldo doing the team talk a s you'd imagine. Ronaldo on the left there with the blue arm band Credit: ITV 8:00PM It's great to see a striker combo R are to see two genuine forwards together these days, eh? And my goodness do Suarez and Cavani work hard. 7:55PM Nice analysis of the goal on ITV Cavani starts to make his run Credit: ITV Cavani circled. The full back has let him get away Credit: ITV Cavani's finish from Suarez's perfect cross Credit: ITV L ike so Uruguay 1 - 0 Portugal (Edinson Cavani, 7 min) 7:50PM Half time: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 I mpressive, professional stuff from Uruguay. They have the lead and it came from the half's sole moment of real class, when Cavani and Suarez combined for two lovely long balls. Element of fortune in the finish, Cav tried to head it and it came off his neck or face. Two defensive, able teams: you'd be surprised if there was more than one goal in the next 45. Ronaldo has not had much opportunity. FWIW I think England would fail to beat either of these. 7:48PM 45 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 G oing to have a couple of minutes added. Uruguay have the ball and a chance for a long throw. It's cleared. A huge garryowen from the Uruguay side into the Portugal area, Cavani gets on it and cracks a shot wide. Miss: Uruguay 1 - 0 Portugal (Edinson Cavani, 45 + 2 min) I t's pretty, but is it art? It's not pretty. That's the half. 7:46PM 44 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 B all pumped into the URG area. Safely gathered. Clive Tyldesley: \"Suarez seems to have recovered...\" 7:45PM 42 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 A h, this is more like it. Guerreiro has barged Suarez in the back. Suarez is on the floor clutching his face. Credit: ITV 7:41PM 39 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 W illiam Carvalho and Nandez are literally scrapping for it on the floor, more reminiscent of a rugby ruck than the beautiful game. Still, you cannot fault the commitment. 7:40PM 38 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 B oth teams fighting hard. The first signs of the game getting tetchy. Cáceres and João Mário at it down by the corner flag. 7:39PM 37 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 G odin puts the nut on Gonçalo Guedes as they go up for a ball. Accidentally, like. 7:39PM 35 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 L uis Suarez switches wings, links with Nandez on the overlapping right. Decent cross. Bentancur can't do anything with it. 7:34PM Uruguay lead with t heir only real moment. Uruguay vs Portugal 7:32PM 30 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 B itty, broken up game. Bentantcur has fouled Gonçalo Guedes centrally, shoved him with no real effort to win the ball. Here's Ronaldo. Credit: ITV I nto the wall. Didn't get hold of it. 7:30PM 29 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 R onaldo's popped up on the right wing but there's no room there either. Nandez blocks off Guerreiro. 7:30PM 28 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 Fonte just isn’t my type #URUPOR #WorldCup — Michael Hogan (@michaelhogan) June 30, 2018 H ere's Bernardo. Portugal putting together a move. Uruguay are extremely impressive with their press and discipline. The move is snuffed out. 7:27PM 26 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 Uruguay vs Portugal I would say Portugal have had a bit more of the ball but URG look slightly slicker and more dangerous coming forward. Cavani the best on the pitch, dangerous but also dropping back to make a midfield five and getting through a lot of work. 7:26PM 24 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 B ernardo Silva has been getting on the ball, which is encouraging for Portugal. He's fouled as he breaks down the right. Bentancur the aggressor. Freekick is cleared easily enough. 7:23PM 21 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 F onte has bundled Suarez over, giving the Bitey One a chance from a freekick. Central. Drilled low through the wall, Rui Patricio sees it late but gets behind it. Lucky for him the rebound doesn't go to an opponent. Suarez eventually, speculatively, tries to hook it back in. 7:20PM 18 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 R onaldo cuts it from the left, seemingly the entire URG team chasing him. Eventually, reluctantly, as a matter of last resort he passes. Now a ball in from the right by ? Guedes. Giménez with an important intercepting header, Ronaldo was a-lurking. 7:17PM 15 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 G ood work from Adrien Silva but Pereira's cross from the right is weak. Other than that moment of brilliance from Cavani-Suarez-Cavani, both sides' delivery has been so-so, from open play and dead balls. 7:15PM 13 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 C avani, who is one of those players for me where I watch him in Champions League and cannot see what the fuss is about, but he's at it tonight. He bullies the POR defence, pinches it, and frees Suarez.  Luis is outnumbered though and has to settle for a corner. 7:14PM 12 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 R onaldo pulls out wide, makes space, and crunches a shot at goal. Torreira blocks it, not that he had a choice. And that seems to have smarted. 7:12PM 10 mins: Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 C hance for Portugal to hit back! Nicely worked corner from the right, and it's played deep to the back stick where Fonte gets up powerfully to nod it across the area... but nobody can capitalise. 7:09PM GOAL! Uruguay 1 Portugal 0 (Cavani 7) W onderful vision from Cavani as he plays a crossfield ball out to his mate Suarez on the left wing and makes a run to the right-hand post. Suarez cuts inside and delivers a peach of a cross. Cavani pulls away from the markers and he has headed it in. Two magnificent passes. The header itself, funnily enough, seemed to come off his throat or chest - he slightly mistimed the jump. They deserved that bit of luck for the two pinpoint balls. Advantage @Uruguay ! #URUPOR 1-0 pic.twitter.com/BbWkAZdSfU — FIFA World Cup 🏆 (@FIFAWorldCup) June 30, 2018 7:06PM 5 mins: Uruguay 0 Portugal 0 R onaldo is teed up on the edge of the area and hits a crisp first-timer.... straight at the keeper. URG have kept SIX consecutive clean sheets. 7:04PM 4 mins: Uruguay 0 Portugal 0 N ández with a one-two involving Suarez. Gets to the byline and crosses. Corner. Pepe and Godin are grapplin'. Ref has a word. Corner comes to nothing. Portugal in fact break from it... Torreira barges Ronaldo to the floor. 7:03PM 2 mins: Uruguay 0 Portugal 0 R ef gets the first of one million uses out of that whistle. Ball pumped forward by URG, Cavani hunting it, is correctly adjudged to have shoved Pepe. And we have now had our first attempt on goal. POR down the left, deep cross, Bernardo Silva attempts the header but he's a long way from goal and cannot direct it. 7:01PM 1 mins: Uruguay 0 Portugal 0 I t is Portugal, in their white, who kick off. 7:00PM Here the line-ups U ruguay : Muslera, Caceres, Gimenez, Godin, Laxalt, Nandez,  Torreira, Vecino, Bentancur, Suarez, Cavani.

G reat shame that Lawro not on co-comms for this. 6:27PM As for URG J ose Maria Gimenez is back in Uruguay's starting lineup for the round of 16 game against Portugal at the World Cup. Gimenez missed the last group-stage match against Russia with a thigh injury but returned to practice this week and takes his place in the starting lineup next to Atletico Madrid teammate Diego Godin. Uruguay are the only team in the tournament who got through the groups without conceding. 6:23PM I make that 3 changes for POR C ristiano Ronaldo will lead the team but midfielder Joao Moutinho remains out of the starting lineup. Moutinho started on the bench against Iran due to flu-like symptoms. Ricardo Pereira (Porto) Goncalo Guedes (Valencia) and Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silvacome get into the side.

Cook Valery Maksimchik poses with pizzas decorated with portraits of Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Uruguay's Luis Suarez at the Hop Head cafe in St. Petersburg Credit: Reuters 5:00PM Suarez vs Ronaldo U ruguay vs Portugal. Footballers vs the rules of the game. This, my friends, is going to be an absolute festival of cheating, pleading, rolling around on the floor, play-acting, and general terrible behaviour. I for one cannot wait! We have already had one absolutely belting match today, when Kylian Mbappé confirmed his status as the most exciting young footballer on the planet. Argentina went our to France 3-2 and Uruguay are of course hoping not to join their neighbours on a plane home to South America. In their bid to progress, Uruguay can call on a really experienced, really formidable defence led by Diego Godin, and they of course have the attacking brilliance and never-say-die attitude of Luis Suarez at the other end of the pitch. They look a solid bet as World Cup dark horses, to me. As, IMHO, do Portugal. I have actually backed them at 25/1 each way to win the World Cup, on the basis that they have an experienced, quality defence who conceded few goals in qualifying. And they have, of course, the man who needs no introduction: the magnificent, the relentless Cristaino Ronaldo. His great rival Lionel Messi has exited the World Cup with a whimper, but I think that Ronaldo will not go gently in to that good night. I believe he thinks that the World Cup is his destiny, and if you were looking for one big name player to step up when everything was on the line, surely he would be your pick. Whoever wins, I am sure we will have a fraught and passionate game. Whether it can match the France and Argentina match for thrills remains to be seen. But there is only one place to be this sunny Saturday evening, so fire up the BBQ, crack open a can, and enjoy the latest drama in this wonderful World Cup with us. The team news and all the build up will be on its way right soon.

Temperatures reached 46C (115F) in places, close to Portugal's national record of 47.4C (117.3F). Soaring temperatures continued in Spain, where three deaths by heatstroke were reported. A continent-wide heatwave in recent weeks has seen drought and wildfires from Greece to Sweden. Temperatures above 40C in Spain and Portugal are expected to continue at least until Sunday. The side effects of the European heatwave In pictures: Europe heatwave Portugal's Civil Protection Agency has been sending mobile text alerts warning of extreme fire risk in some areas, as they seek to avert casualties. Dozens of people were killed in two major forest fires last year. Friday saw local all-time record temperatures at almost half the country's weather stations. Image source, EPA Image caption, Temperatures in parts of Portugal have topped 40C A major fire broke out on Friday in Monchique, in Algarve, consuming more than 1,000 hectares of forest and forcing evacuations from one village. On Saturday the fire was boosted by 46C temperatures with \"a real feel of 50C\", rescue operations head Victor Vaz Pinto told local media. The fire has been spreading through eucalyptus forest and dense undergrowth, the Civil Protection Agency says. Ten water-dropping planes have been assisting the firefighters. Meanwhile in Spain, media reports said two people died of heatstroke in the southeastern Murcia region, while a third - believed to be homeless - died in Barcelona.

In Greece high winds fanned dangerous wildfires which killed more than 90 people. Researchers said that climate change made Europe's extended heatwave twice as likely as it would otherwise have been.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese Defence Minister Jose Azeredo Lopes resigned on Friday amid an investigation into a suspected army cover-up of a weapons theft last year, a ministry spokesman said. Prime Minister Antonio Costa accepted the resignation after having firmly defended his minister during a parliament debate on Wednesday where he said he had his trust and should remain in office. Azeredo Lopes denied any wrongdoing. Opposition leaders had repeatedly called for his ouster. Local media reported earlier this month that one of the suspects had told investigators that the minister was aware of an alleged staged operation to recover the weapons last October, which Azeredo Lopes categorically denied on various occasions, including in his resignation letter on Friday. The minister said in the letter that he was stepping down to protect the armed forces from a political attack against him. He previously called the suspected involvement of the military in the cover-up \"an embarrassment\". The theft of grenades, anti-tank rockets, other explosives and ammunition from a military arms depot was discovered in June 2017 and caused a furor in Portugal. Questions arose about security at the armed forces bases of the NATO member country. Prosecutors initially said they suspected international arms traffickers and terrorist groups of having stolen the weapons and taken them out of the country, but military police recovered the weapons last October. The recovery, without any arrests or named suspects, triggered an investigation by prosecutors, who last month ordered the arrest of the head of the military police and several army officers.

The wreck of the still-unidentified vessel was found at the beginning of September by a team of experts surveying an area of sea around the fishing port of Cascais, about 15 miles west of Lisbon. The wreck site, which sits about 12 metres below the surface, is about 100 metres long and 50 metres wide. The teams say the discovery will shed light on both Portugal’s trading past and Cascais’s place within it. “We found the ship on 4 September, using a geophysical survey and divers, and spent four days working on the site,” said Jorge Freire, a maritime archaeologist and scientific director of the underwater archeological survey. He said divers had also come across cowrie shells, which were used in the slave trade. Lisbon museum plan stirs debate over Portugal's colonial past Read more “We don’t know the name of the ship, but it’s a Portuguese ship from the late 16th or early 17th century,” he said, adding that the team had been able to put a rough date on the wreck as the cannon bore the Portuguese coat of arms and the porcelain belonged to the Wanli period (1573-1619). “It tells us a great deal about Cascais’s maritime history and identity,” said Freire. “It’s like we’ve been telling the local people here: this is a great discovery and its greatness lies in what it, and the artefacts, can tell is about the cultural landscape.” The pieces will now be examined by the Portuguese government’s directorate-general for cultural heritage. View image in fullscreen Sixteenth-century Portuguese or Spanish ship by Pieter Bruegel. Photograph: Alamy The mayor of Cascais, Carlos Carreiras, described the discovery as one of the most significant archaeological finds of the past decade. He said that although the cargo ship had yet to be identified, it could prove significant to the town. “It’s an extraordinary discovery that allows us to know more about our history, reinforcing our collective identity and shared values,” said Carreiras. “That, in turn, will certainly make us more attractive and competitive.” The discovery comes 24 years after experts found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires (Our Lady of the Martyrs), which also sailed the spice route and sank off Lisbon in 1606. According to the survey team, who have been mapping the areas since 2009, the latest wreck is in better structural shape than the Nossa Senhora dos Mártires.

Media caption, About 1,000 trees have been uprooted by the hurricane-force winds Hurricane-force winds have struck central and northern Portugal, leaving 300,000 homes without power. The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept in overnight on Saturday, with winds gusting up to 176km/h (109mph). Civil defence officials said 27 people suffered minor injuries, with localised flooding, hundreds of trees uprooted and a number of flights cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now passing over northern Spain. Is climate change making hurricanes worse? The worst-affected areas in Portugal were around the capital, Lisbon, and in the districts of Coimbra and Leiria. Aveiro, Viseu and Porto in the north also suffered damage. About 1,000 trees have been uprooted, officials say. The main A1 motorway was among the roads temporarily blocked. Image source, Reuters Image caption, The storm wreaked havoc throughout Portuguese towns and cities Some 1,900 incidents were reported to emergency services, although civil defence commander Luis Belo Costa said \"the greatest danger has passed\". Hundreds of people remained in an arts centre in Figueira da Foz after a concert because of the high winds.

It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian peninsula, with only five such events recorded. Hurricane Leslie had formed on 23 September but was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. However, it retained gusts of hurricane strength. The Spanish Meteorological Agency (Amet) said Leslie was moving north-east through the peninsula. Gusts of almost 100km/h were recorded near the city of Zamora early on Sunday, but winds have now lessened. Amet said that on Sunday morning large areas of Asturias, Castille and LeÃ³n and Cantabria would be affected, with north-eastern areas hit in the afternoon. Four departments in southern France have also been put on alert for storms and flooding. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.

Cabinet Minister Pedro Siza Vieira, a lawyer who joined the government a year ago, will serve as the new economy minister, replacing Manuel Caldeira Cabral.

This is the biggest cabinet reshuffle since Prime Minister Antonio Costa's minority Socialist government came to power in 2015 and aims to bolster the administration going into next year's election. The Socialists lead in opinion polls with about 40 percent support. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Costa said in a statement the reshuffle \"reinforces economic policy at the centre of government and prioritises the transition of energy (use) to mitigate climatic change.\" Siza Vieira joined the government a year ago from the law firm Linklaters and will continue as cabinet minister as well as economy minister. The powerful economy ministry has recently gained further importance thanks to surging foreign investment and strong economic growth. The reshuffle comes after the government approved this weekend the 2019 draft budget which will be presented to parliament on Monday. The Socialist government has overseen a strong economic recovery since Portugal's 2011-14 debt crisis with policies to ease austerity measures, boost foreign investment and spur a fledgling technology sector. The reshuffle also includes the transfer of responsibility for the energy sector to the environment ministry from the economy ministry, indicating a stronger emphasis on clean energy. Portugal produces a large part of its energy from hydro-electric power and is boosting other alternative energy sources such as solar and wind. The other changes include the appointment of Graca Maria da Fonseca as the new minister of culture after working as secretary of state for administrative modernisation. Marta Temido, who previously headed the central administration of the public health system, will take over as health minister. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has to approve the nominations, said in a statement the new ministers would be sworn in on Monday.

O acidente matou os quatro ocupantes: um médico, uma enfermeira e dois pilotos. As buscas duraram várias horas e foram dificultadas pela chuva e pelo nevoeiro. Pelas 2h da manhã, a Protecção Civil anunciou ter encontrado os destroços do aparelho, bem como os corpos das quatro vítimas, na zona da Capela de Santa Justa, Valongo. Dois dos corpos estavam dentro da cabine e os outros dois, próximos dos destroços. Não são conhecidas as causas do acidente, que é o primeiro do género com uma aeronave do INEM. O helicóptero deixou de ser visto pelos radares por volta das 18h30. A Protecção Civil recebeu o primeiro alerta pelas 20h15. \"Queria deixar aqui bem presente que toda esta operação se desenvolveu depois de o alerta ter chegado à Autoridade Nacional de Protecção Civil\", frisou o comandante da Protecção Civil Carlos Rodrigues Alves, na conferência de imprensa em que anunciou o desfecho da operação de busca. \"Antes disso, há toda uma série de entidades – permitam-me que não fale nelas – que entram no processo de espoletar este tipo de operação.\" O secretário de Estado da Protecção Civil também notou o hiato temporal entre a última comunicação emitida pelo helicóptero e o alerta que chegou à Protecção Civil. \"A partir das 20h15, quando a Protecção Civil foi avisada, foram postos em marcha todos os meios. Até lá, haverá todo um conjunto de entidades que terão que averiguar o que se passou para apurar as responsabilidades, desde logo o facto de a aeronave não ter emitido um alerta. Portanto, haverá aí alguma falha que terá que ser avaliada, assim como todos os procedimentos associados terão de ser objecto das necessárias auditorias\", afirmou José Artur Neves. A equipa dos serviços de emergência médica tinha descolado às 15h13 da base em Macedo de Cavaleiros. Dirigiu-se ao Hospital Distrital de Bragança, para transportar uma mulher de 76 anos com problemas cardíacos graves, que tinha como destino o Hospital de Santo António, no Porto. A doente foi entregue aos médicos deste hospital por volta das 18h10. A equipa iniciou então a viagem de regresso. “O piloto era um piloto experiente, o co-piloto era mais jovem, o colega médico tinha nacionalidade espanhola e fazia habitualmente serviços com o INEM, e a enfermeira era residente na zona do Porto”, disse à RTP o presidente da Câmara de Macedo de Cavaleiros, Benjamim Rodrigues. Numa das duas conferências de imprensa que deu durante a noite, o comandante da Protecção Civil Rodrigues Alves explicou que, após o alerta, foram accionados “todos os mecanismos” para localizar o helicóptero, que regressava à base em Macedo de Cavaleiros, mas que antes ainda ia abastecer a Baltar, Paredes. Foram mobilizados mais de 100 operacionais e 35 veículos. Um helicóptero da Força Aérea também foi mobilizado para as buscas, mas o mau tempo acabou por fazer com que esta aeronave abandonasse as operações. Em declarações à agência Lusa, o tenente-coronel Manuel Costa, porta-voz da Força Aérea, referiu que o helicóptero, que saiu da base do Montijo pelas 21h45 de sábado, chegou a estar na zona da aldeia de Couce. A aeronave do INEM é um modelo Augusta A109S, que estava a ser operado pela empresa Babcock, uma multinacional britânica que trabalha para os serviços de emergência médica desde 2000. “Caberá às autoridades competentes desenvolver um inquérito para apurar com detalhe as causas do acidente, cujos contornos não são ainda neste momento conhecidos”, referiu o INEM, numa nota emitida na madrugada deste domingo. Também o primeiro-ministro manifestou pesar pela morte da equipa de quatro pessoas. \"Quero naturalmente apresentar às famílias e amigos as mais sentidas condolências e dirigir uma palavra de solidariedade para todos aqueles que trabalham no Instituto Nacional de Emergência Médica e que prestam um serviço inestimável aos portugueses\", afirmou, em declarações à Lusa, em Abu Dabi. António Costa disse ainda que no momento próprio serão apuradas \"as causas deste acidente\", frisando que é prematuro falar sobre os motivos que levaram à queda do helicóptero. O serviço de helicópteros de emergência médica do INEM foi criado em 1997, tendo desde então realizado cerca de 16.370 transportes de doentes, sem qualquer acidente grave. tp.ocilbup@ariereppj tp.ocilbup@sehcnasa tp.ocilbup@arieiv.erdna tp.ocilbup@atnemip.oluap Sugerir correcção Leia os artigos que quiser, até ao fim.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS/LISBON (Reuters) - France's Vinci has agreed to provide 1.15 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in funding for the expansion of Lisbon's main airport and the construction of a new hub in nearby Montijo opposed by environmental campaigners, it said on Tuesday. Under the terms of the deal struck with the Portuguese government, 650 million euros of the investment will be used for the first phase of the expansion of Lisbon airport, while 500 million euros will fund the new Montijo site, Vinci said. Advertisement · Scroll to continue As visitor numbers reach record levels, Portugal's tourism sector has grown increasingly frustrated with Lisbon's main airport near the city center, which is operating at full capacity. But the plan for a new airport, under consideration for five decades, has also proved controversial and is still uncertain. It has been blocked by an initial environmental impact study, and its advancement depends on the approval of a second study. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"We will do everything possible, once the environmental impact study proves favorable, for the operation to start immediately,\" Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at the deal signing with Vinci. \"Every day of delay will add to the 50 years we have been waiting for a solution to the airport.\" The airport, which if approved could be ready in 2022, would be built on the site of a military airfield on the bank of the Tagus River estuary, a spot frequented by flocks of migratory birds and other wildlife. Vinci's Aeropuertos de Portugal subsidiary already manages 10 airport concessions in the country. The company said a concession agreement for the Montijo site \"should be signed in 2019, once the environmental authorizations have been obtained\". Environmental group Zero last year sent a complaint to the European Commission, insisting that a more demanding strategic environmental evaluation be carried out before the airport can be built. It has also threatened to go to court against the decision in Portugal. Around 13 million people visited Portugal last year, when tourism raised an estimated 14 billion euros in revenues for Lisbon. An airport on the south bank of the Tagus could prove a shot in the arm for the poorest area in the Lisbon region, which has yet to benefit from the tourism boom to the north. Previous plans for a new airport for Lisbon's south side, made about 10 years ago, were ultimately scrapped.

The plan is expected to include an upgrade of the main Lisbon to Porto route, plus improvements to suburban and regional lines.\nAbout 15 percent of the funding for the investment program is expected to come from the state budget, according to Portuguese media reports, with most of the rest from private investment and EU funding.\nAlthough there is widespread support for modernizing infrastructure, the government’s plans are coming in for criticism.\nVinci Airports President Nicolas Notebaert (L) speaks with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa (R) during a ceremony to sign an agreement between the Portuguese government and ANA airports for the expansion of the Lisbon airport to Montijo at the Montijo military air base on the outskirts of Lisbon on January 8, 2019 | Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP via Getty Images\nCampaigners are launching legal action against the airport expansion, which depends on the results of an environmental assessment plan. Passenger groups also criticized the proposals for extending the Lisbon metro. Opposition lawmakers also attacked the project in parliament Thursday.\n“The extension will not benefit the network, the money should be spent on overcoming the shortage of trains, the shortage of drivers, the lack of services,” Cecilia Sales, of the Committee of Lisbon Transport Users, told TVI television.\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO’s premium policy service.

The National Statistics Institute (INE), which monitors hotel stays, said total arrivals grew to 12.8 million in 2018. Portugal's tourism has been growing for eight years in a row, helping the country recover from a severe debt crisis and economic recession. However, some in the industry believe it is set to reverse in 2019, party due to a drop in British visitors due to Brexit. Hotel revenues rose 6 percent last year, mainly benefiting from domestic tourism, to reach 3.6 billion euros ($4.06 billion), but that growth slowed from 16 percent a year earlier. Holiday seekers from the UK, Portugal's largest tourism market, stayed fewer nights in the country last year, dropping 7.3 percent. There was also a drop among German, French, Dutch and Irish visitors. On the other hand, Portugal received more visitors from Brazil and North America, with a 20 percent increase in the number of tourists from the United States, the data showed. The total contribution of travel and tourism to Portugal's gross domestic product reached 17.3 percent, or 33.5 billion euros ($41.1 billion), in 2017, according to the International Tourism Association. Data for 2018 is not yet available. ($1 = 0.8864 euros) Sign up here.

REUTERS/Pedro Nunes Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Dressed in white and holding white flowers, thousands of nurses marched through Lisbon on Friday in a show of unity to demand better pay and working conditions and protest the Portuguese government's poor handling of the long-running dispute. Police estimated some 6,000 women and men, many of whom were bussed in from across the country, took part in the \"white march\" to honour the profession on International Women's Day. The march organisers put the number at 10,000. \"What we wanted to achieve with this march has been achieved. We have at least 10,000 people, a beautiful wave of humans dressed in white, which shows the unity in our profession,\" said Sonia Viegas, one of the organizers from the National Movement of Nurses. Some of the placards carried by the nurses said: \"No fear!\" \"We shall fight!\", and \"No to the blackmail\" in a reference to the government's negotiating stance. Last month, nurses staged a three-week strike, forcing the postponement of around 5,000 scheduled surgical operations, according to government figures. A similar strike last year led to the cancellation of around 7,500 surgeries. The strike was suspended on Feb. 22 when the government agreed to resume talks with the unions after having declared the labour action unlawful and threatened penalties for strikers. The first round of talks took place on Thursday, during which the government signed a protocol for the negotiation of a collective work agreement for nurses, but Sindepor, one of the two main nurses unions, was quick to call a new strike in April. It said it would cancel the planned strike if the talks with the government are constructive. The next meeting is scheduled for March 21.

Sweden, Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal also lined up behind Guaido, who last month declared himself interim president with the support of the United States and many Latin American nations.\nIn Canada’s capital, foreign ministers from the Lima Group of 13 Western Hemisphere countries that took the lead in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader discussed additional steps to pressure Maduro.\nBefore the closed-door meeting got under way, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned a “dictatorship willing to use force and fear” to maintain its power. He also announced $53 million in humanitarian aid to support the Venezuelan people.\n\n\n“We know that the people of Venezuela are facing tremendous hardship and they need our help, as do the countries that have taken in those fleeing violence,” Trudeau said.\nThe coalition called upon Venezuela’s military to allow badly needed food and medicine across the border and show their loyalty to Guaido. They also urged the United Nationa and the international community to step up with humanitarian assistance.\nMaduro showed no signs of caving in and lashed out at the EU, accusing it of taking orders from the Trump administration, who he has repeatedly accused of trying to carry out a coup to get its hands on Venezuela’s oil reserves, the world’s largest.\nBut he stopped short of breaking off diplomatic relations with the 16 European countries that recognized his rival Monday, unlike his swift move to cut off ties with the U.S. after it threw its support behind Guaido last month. A growing list of 38 countries has now recognized Guaido, including non-EU European nations Kosovo, Iceland and Albania.\nLong-time backers Russia and China are among at least nine nations that have declared their support for Maduro.\nMaduro was especially harsh on fellow socialist and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, saying he would have “blood on his hands” if Maduro is toppled.\n“They gave us an ultimatum, as if Venezuela was being governed from Madrid,” said Maduro, who was addressing troops Monday on the 27th anniversary of the failed military uprising that thrust his political mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, onto the national stage.\nAmid the rising pressure, Maduro has shown signs he’s willing to negotiate.\nIn an interview that aired Monday with Italy’s Sky TG24 he said that he had written Pope Francis asking for help in fostering dialogue with the opposition.\nThe Vatican didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Maduro’s appeal. Recently, while in Central America, Francis called for a “just and peaceful” solution to the crisis in Venezuela. But he didn’t say if the Holy See would recognize Guaido and said he had no business interfering in the crisis.\nSome of the EU countries backing Guaido are part of a newly formed “International Contact Group” of eight European and four Latin American nations. It aims to facilitate dialogue and is due to hold its first meeting in Uruguay on Thursday.\nPortugal’s Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said the group wants to end Venezuela’s political stalemate through the ballot box, preventing a civil war or an “illegitimate foreign intervention.”\nVenezuela’s opposition has rejected any offers of dialogue that don’t include Maduro’s exit as a starting point.\nMeanwhile, the opposition was moving ahead with a risky strategy to bring in humanitarian aid from Colombia , hoping to break the all-important military’s loyalty to Maduro.\n“Soldiers of the fatherland: We need the humanitarian aid to come, for your mother, your sister and all your family,” Guaido said at a news conference at the National Assembly to thank the European governments for their support.\n“Otherwise we are sentenced to death,” he said.\nWhile U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said last week that boxes of USAID branded baby formula and supplies for malnourished children are being readied to deploy to Venezuela, it’s not clear how they can safely enter.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is among the groups who have warned about the dangers of deploying aid without the consent of the Maduro government, which has repeatedly rejected the offers.\nMaduro denies the existence of a humanitarian crisis, calling it a fabrication by Venezuela’s enemies to sow instability and justify a military intervention.\nBut David Lipton, the No. 2 at the International Monetary Fund, called Venezuela’s economic crisis — marked by widespread food shortages, protracted hyperinflation and the loss of human capital through emigration — an “unprecedented economic storm” that will required generous, broad-based international support to overcome.\n“We have seen versions of each,” Lipton said on Twitter, “but rarely a combination as severe at this.”\nAssociated Press writer Scott Smith reported this story in Caracas and AP writer Barry Hatton reported from Lisbon. AP writers Christine Armario in Cucuta, Colombia, and Tracey Lindeman in Ottawa, Canada, contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

Media caption, The bus plunged off a road and overturned near houses At least 29 people have died after a bus carrying German tourists plunged off a road and overturned on the Portuguese island of Madeira. Another 27 were injured in the accident near the town of CaniÃ§o. The accident happened at 18:30 (17:30 GMT) when the driver lost control of the bus at a junction and went off the road, according to Portuguese news agency Lusa. Pictures show how the vehicle stopped just short of destroying a house. \"I have no words to describe what happened. I cannot face the suffering of these people,\" the mayor of CaniÃ§o, Filipe Sousa, told broadcaster SIC TV. He said all the tourists on the bus were German but some local people could also be among the casualties. Eleven of the fatalities were men and 17 women, Mr Sousa added. The bus was reported to be carrying 55 passengers, as well as the driver and a tour guide. Another woman later died of her injuries in hospital. The vice-president of Madeira's regional government Pedro Calado said the bus met safety standards and so it was \"premature to talk about what caused the crash\".

According to reports, the vehicle was only five or six years old and the driver was experienced. The scene of the crash has been sealed off and the injured transferred to a hospital in the island's capital, Funchal, Lusa said. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is flying to the island to visit the scene, the agency said. Prime Minister Antonio Costa has sent a message of condolence to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Reuters reported. The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted: \"Our deep sorrow goes to all those who lost their lives in the bus accident, our thoughts are with the injured.\" Portugal country profile Madeira was the scene of another fatal bus crash in 2005 when five Italian tourists died in SÃ£o Vicente, on the northern coast.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante [1/7] A villager helps put out a forest fire next to the village of Aroes, Portugal March 27, 2019. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab GONDOMIL, Portugal (Reuters) - Hundreds of Portuguese firefighters struggled on Wednesday to contain wildfires which erupted far earlier in the season than usual because of unexpectedly hot and windy weather. Ten fires were burning across the country, most in the north, several months before the late spring season when fire crews are normally in place. Meteorologists said global warming had made it difficult to predict where blazes would erupt. \"We are having significant fire outbreaks in areas where we didn't know the risk was high,\" Miguel Miranda, president of the Portuguese Institute of Meteorology (IPMA), told Portuguese radio station TSF. \"We are in unexplored territory, we have never been through this.\" Helicopters dropped water on flaming woodlands near the tiny village of Gondomil on Portugal's northern edge near the Spanish frontier. A firefighter there told Reuters the force was waiting at a wooded area until the weather conditions made it possible to fight the blaze. There were no immediate reports of casualties or figures for property damage. Portugal's government issued a wildfire alert on Tuesday evening, with no rain in sight and temperatures at the start of the week that soared as high as 28 degrees Celsius (82 Fahrenheit), far above seasonal norms. The weather conditions resemble those that caused a devastating wildfire in the central town of Pedrogao Grande in June 2017, killing 64 people and injuring more than 250, the worst disaster in modern Portuguese history. The government warning prohibits farmers from using slash-and-burn methods and requires employers to authorise absences for workers who serve as volunteer firefighters. Temperatures are expected to remain unseasonably hot, according to IPMA, with the temperature in the northern river city of Porto expected to reach 24C on Wednesday, compared with a March average of 12C. \"This meteorological scenario means an increase in the fire risk index from Monday until Wednesday with favourable conditions for the rapid spread of fires throughout the mainland, with high to very high levels,\" the Civil Protection agency said on its website. The most aggressive wildfire raged in the municipality of Oliveira de Azemeis since the early hours of Tuesday morning, with 450 firefighters on the ground who managed to bring it under control on Tuesday. In the district of Esposende, also in northern Portugal, a wildfire on Tuesday forced authorities to evacuate two schools due to high levels of smoke. It has since been put out.

The country declared an energy emergency on Tuesday, and drivers agreed to supply essential services including hospitals and airports. But widespread shortages have prompted queues at petrol stations across the country, while some have closed. Among their demands, the drivers are pressing for double the minimum wage. Before the agreement to supply essential services, airports reported that they were running low on fuel supplies, which could have delayed or cancelled flights. Tuesday's agreement did not include any possible solution to the strike, officials said, and the union has only agreed to supply minimum quantities. But the minimum service should guarantee supplies for emergency and rescue services, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. At one petrol station in the suburbs of the capital, Lisbon, a queue of at least 50 cars stretched for hundreds of metres, AFP news agency reported. Thousands of other service stations had been completely emptied, it said. Image source, AFP Image caption, Queues stretch down the road at a petrol station in Seixal near Lisbon on Wednesday Portugal's Minister of Economy Pedro Siza Vieira asked citizens not to rush to the pumps to help avoid any further shortages. Portuguese newspaper DiÃ¡rio de Noticias reported that soldiers were on standby ready to drive fuel trucks if necessary. It added that the strike was \"threatening to spoil the Easter weekend for many families, and business for many companies\". The newspaper warned that the strike was planned to continue \"indefinitely\", or until union demands were met. The union is comprised of drivers who specialise in the transport of hazardous substances. They want to be recognised for their specific skills and to be considered separately from other forms of heavy vehicle drivers. They are also seeking changes to salaries and long working hours.

The Cabinet contains a husband and wife, as well as a father and daughter, and relatives of prominent Socialist Party members have in recent times landed plum government jobs.\nThough Prime Minister Antonio Costa has insisted the appointments were all based on merit, the revelations have brought accusations of nepotism and wide public criticism on social media.\nEnvironment secretary Carlos Martins announced he was resigning because he didn’t want the controversy over his cousin’s appointment to damage the government.\nLater, in the Republican Assembly, Portugal’s parliament, the parliamentary leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, Fernando Negrao, said “the government has overstepped the mark” in handing jobs to family relations.\nBut Costa, the prime minister, told lawmakers that the issue had never been raised before and so the rules were unclear over what kinds of relationship should be permitted between government members and the people they appointed.\n“It would be interesting to have a level-headed debate about it,” Costa said. “It’s just a pity it comes now, with elections on the horizon.”\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Buildings across Portugal flew flags at half mast and parliament held a minute of silence in honour of domestic violence victims on Thursday, a day after a 39-year-old woman was strangled to death. The latest killing shocked the country, bringing the number of victims since the beginning of the year to 12, the highest figure in a decade, which prompted the government to declare a day of mourning. \"Sadly the number increased yesterday,\" said parliament speaker Ferro Rodrigues. \"It's our obligation to do better.\" Police said a woman in north Portugal was strangled to death on Wednesday and have arrested her husband on suspicion of having killed her. The number of murders so far this year is more than double the same period in 2018, according to the Observatory of Murdered Women, a Portuguese campaign group. In 2017, 12 murders were recorded through the whole year. In addition to the minute of silence, held before parliament's biweekly debate, new measures to tackle the crime have been proposed including a plan to create specialised courts to deal with domestic violence cases. The Portuguese justice system has been heavily criticised, with activists describing it as sexist, after a court upheld in 2017 a light sentence for a woman's attacker on the grounds that he may have been motivated by her adultery.

The Lisbon-based side needed only a point in their final match, with rivals Porto looking to take advantage of anything less. However, two goals from Swiss forward Haris Seferovic, one from Joao Felix and Rafa Silva secured a 4-1 victory. Porto recorded a 2-1 win over Sporting Lisbon in a game which saw both teams reduced to 10 men. Sporting left-back Cristian Borja was shown a straight red in the 20th minute before forward Luiz Phellype gave the visitors the lead. Danilo Pereira equalised in the 78th minute before Hector Herrera grabbed an 87th minute winner. Porto's Jesus Corona received two yellows in stoppage time. Benfica finished the season with 87 points, two ahead of Porto, who were last year's champions, with Sporting third on 74 points. Sorry, we can't display this part of the article any more.

The bear, which most likely belongs to a population living in the western Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain, is thought to have wandered across the border. \"The reappearance of individuals from this species in Portugal... has now been confirmed by the ICNF,\" the Portuguese Institute for Conservation of Nature and Forests (ICNF) said. Brown bears have been extinct in Portugal since the 19th century. \"The last reports of a stable presence of brown bears in Portugal are between the 18th and the end of the 19th century. They then died out,\" the ICNF said. The animal was spotted in the Montesinho Natural Park and Braganca commune in northeastern Portugal. The town of Bragance is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Spanish border. Media reports say the last living bear in Portugal was killed in 1843 in the northwest mountainous region of Geres. \"The fact that a bear has crossed our border does not mean that there is a bear established in Portugal. At the moment we have a stray animal,\" said Paulo Caetano, an author of a book on bears, on Portuguese radio. The animal is probably a young male looking for \"a peaceful territory, a companion and food,\" he said. The bear population in the Cantabrian mountain range, which extends east to west over four Spanish regions, has been increasing since the 1989 adoption of a relocation plan. In 2018, some 330 bears were counted in the mountains there, according to the environmentalist foundation Oso Pardo. ? 2019 AFP Advertising Most read 1 ‘Time to boycott all men’: The 4B movement going viral after Trump's victory EXPLAINER Americas 2 The bells of Notre Dame cathedral ring out for first time since 2019 fire Europe 3 Israeli police detain two French Consulate gendarmes in Jerusalem Middle East 4 Who are the key figures of Donald Trump's new inner circle?

        "text": "Prime minister had threatened to resign if bill was passed.\t\t\t\nPortugal’s main conservative opposition parties voted against a bill that would have given full retroactive pay rises to teachers, and that made Prime Minister António Costa threaten to resign.\nDespite backing a parliamentary committee’s decision to give teachers payouts as compensation for salary freezes during the country’s debt crisis, the Social Democrats (PSD) and the People’s Party (CDS), together with the smaller Socialist Party, rejected the final text of the bill in a vote Friday.\nPSD and CDS had teamed up with far-left parties to leave the Socialists isolated in resisting the teachers’ demands. They had voted in favor of a full refund of teachers’ pay dating back almost a decade, but made a U-turn after Costa threatened to resign if the bill passed.\nAfter a long emergency meeting with key ministers, and talks with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa last week, Costa said approval of the payouts would “force the government to resign,” and would constitute “an irreparable breach” with the country’s economic plans.\nThe bill, the prime minister warned, would create an additional cost of at least €340 million between this year and next, a figure that could have risen massively if the retroactive payments were also given to other public sector workers who experienced pay freezes. Finance Minister Mário Centeno said approving the measure could cost the country between €600 million and €800 million.\nFearing an early general election where Costa could stand as the defender of fiscal discipline, PSD and CDS backed away from their initial positions and proposed budgetary safeguards in the final text, to ensure that any money paid out would not adversely affect the country’s economy.\nThe Left Bloc, which together with the Communist Party (PCP) supports the Socialist government, had unexpectedly voted in favor of the bill at committee stage. In the final vote, both leftist parties refused to back the budgetary safeguards proposed by the conservative parties and voted for the full amount to be returned to teachers from the salary freezes in 2005 to 2007 and from 2011 to 2017.\nAddressing the nation on Friday, Costa said the vote was “a victory for responsibility.”\n“We went to the limit of what was possible,” said the prime minister. “And we went to a point where we can replicate the solution to other professionals. The government not only did not do theater but spoke the truth,” he added.\nOn Thursday at a summit of EU leaders in Romania, Costa said: “If everybody would vote as they had announced they would vote,” the country “will have avoided a budget crisis that would seriously jeopardize its international credibility.”\nBombed-out buildings, refugees forced to flee, death and destruction — what the country has endured since Russia invaded.\nBrazil’s president has played down the clinical effects of the coronavirus up to this point. \nBut the local mayor insisted there was ‘no immediate prospect’ of such a move.\n‘There is still quite some way to go towards an agreement,’ European Council chief says ahead of virtual summit.",

The operation, codenamed El Pibe, led to the arrest of eight foreign nationals suspected of trafficking women for sexual exploitation, money laundering and belonging to an organised crime group, said Portugal's Immigration and Border Service SEF. As part of the operation, which took place in Portugal's northern region, SEF raided 12 homes and 12 vehicles, seizing jewellery, money and false documents. Two money transfer companies and a travel agency were also searched. SEF said in a statement that the traffickers, operating in Portugal and other European countries, used \"persuasion, manipulation and intimidation\" to take advantage of around 20 vulnerable women with no financial means or family support. \"The women were used as objects to make money in order to pay debts and 'commissions' imposed by the leader of the criminal group,\" SEF said. \"They were considered and treated as 'things' or 'objects' which provided huge financial gains.\" Now receiving help from a victim support group, the women also suffered from domestic and substance abuse, SEF said, adding that those arrested will appear before a court. The victims' nationalities were not revealed by authorities. Sexual exploitation is the most common form of human trafficking, according to the United Nations.

Sebastien Ogier was promoted into third, with Tanak's winning margin over Neuville standing at 15.9s. Ogier remains the championship leader by two points after winning the powerstage. Tanak was third-fastest after backing off at the end of the test to ensure his rival sweeps the road first on the next round in Sardinia. Tanak hit the front on stage three on Friday morning, when early leader Dani Sordo ran into trouble. Sordo had held a slim lead over Tanak, but fuel pressure issues dropped him well out of contention. Although Tanak would never relinquish the lead, he was not able to establish a comfortable advantage with both his team-mates Meeke and Jari-Matti Latvala chasing him hard. Latvala hounded Tanak on Saturday, opting for a harder tyre compound that handsomely paid off. Trailing by just 5.1s, Latvala was geared up for an attack but retired late in the day with a broken damper. Tanak also broke his damper and, even though he managed to continue, Meeke spotted his chance and ended Saturday a mere 4.3s in arrears. By then Neuville was also in contention, just 9.2s off the lead. He could not match Tanak on Sunday but was there to pick up the pieces when Meeke's rally unravelled on Sunday. Ogier was lumbered with cleaning the road on Friday and struggled to keep up with the leading trio thereafter. Teemu Suninen was in podium contention on Friday before losing breaks aboard his M-Sport Fiesta. Suninen fell backwards to sixth, but recovered to take fourth place. Elfyn Evans lost four minutes on Friday morning when a throttle pedal sensor became disconnected. The M-Sport driver fixed it in stage, eventually salvaging fifth place after the late drama. Kalle Rovanpera took a fine sixth place, winning the WRC2 Pro class on the debut of the new Skoda Fabia R5 Evo. Team-mate Jan Kopecky finished a minute behind in eighth. Latvala finished seventh after being given a notional time for the powerstage that elevated him above Kopecky, as his run was curtailed by a red flag caused by Gus Greensmith. Greensmith had a mixed debut in a World Rally car, running seventh until ditching his M-Sport Fiesta on Saturday's final stage. He returned on Sunday to run 11th, but the steering broke as he took off over Fafe's big jump on the powerstage, careering into a bank and into retirement just metres from the finish. Esapekka Lappi retired from fifth on Sunday morning after rolling his Citroen C3 on the day's opening stage. He then wrecked suspension on the first of Fafe and was unable to continue. Sebastien Loeb endured a torrid weekend for Hyundai. He suffered the same fuel pressure problems as team-mate Sordo, and then destroyed the rear-left of his Hyundai on the Fafe powerstage after hitting something on an asphalt section.

In the case, a man was detained accused of throwing stones at a police car. When five other men protested at a police station, they too were detained. Accusations of torture and racist motivation were rejected by the court. It is the first time so many officers have been convicted in a such a case in Portugal, correspondents say. The six youths, reportedly aged between 23 and 25 at the time, lived in Cova da Moura - a neighbourhood predominantly inhabited by immigrants from Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony in Africa - in the city of Amadora. The police force accused of hating black people Slavery memorial highlights Portugal's racism taboo Judge Ester Pacheco said there was a \"serious abuse of authority\" by the officers, who made unjustified arrests and then tried to make it appear the youths had invaded the police station. The court in Sintra sentenced one officer to 18 months in prison for a repeat offence while the others were given suspended sentences. Their lawyers say they will appeal. Nine other officers were acquitted. The victims will receive compensation of â¬10,000 (Â£8,800; $11,200), , external DiÃ¡rio de NotÃ­cias newspaper reports (in Portuguese). Pedro Neto, executive director of human rights group Amnesty International in Portugal, said the case \"underscores the need for independent and outside control of security forces\". \"The state must not fail victims of racism,\" , external he added in a statement (in Portuguese).

JJ Bull live updates 09 June 2019 10:03pm BST Their football culture may be dominated by the global superstar in their No 7 shirt but Portugal have developed a habit of winning big matches that goes a lot deeper than the status of Cristiano Ronaldo, in what is becoming a golden dusk to his career. This was the 18th major trophy of his life on Sunday night, if that is what we are to call the Nations League, while excluding all those Supercopas and Club World Cups, and pre-lift he put it on his shoulder to carry it over his team-mates, with an easy familiarity. Still no-one quite knows what to make of the Nations League, and certainly no-one among the winners or the losers were behaving like this was a career-changing moment, but the home crowd loved it. European champions in 2016, and a replaying of that triumph on a smaller scale three years later – no-one could deny that this Portugal team knows how to win. They controlled the Dutch passing game much more shrewdly than England ever managed on Thursday night and when the time came, it was the turn of Goncalo Guedes to pull the trigger, just as the relative unknown Eder had done in Paris in the final of Euro 2016. The great Holland resurgence fell one step short of a trophy this time, paying the price for the absence of a great goalscorer and perhaps some of the ringcraft you need against a team as cussed as the Portuguese. Fernando Santos’ side were superb in defence, giving up a single attempt on target – a header from Memphis Depay – and it was hard to argue with the Uefa technical committee awarding the man of the match award to the Benfica defender Ruben Dias. The player of the tournament went to Bernardo Silva, the architect of this game’s only goal – and the end to a fine season for the man from Manchester City. As for Ronaldo, he had to settle for tournament top goalscorer, thanks to that hat-trick against Switzerland on Wednesday night. He does something different now for Portugal, to the days when he carried the team on his back. Certainly there are still goals but it is also as much about the shock and awe of his sheer presence on a new generation who have watched his career. Ronaldo preparing to take a free-kick he smashed well wide of goal Credit : UEFA The Portugal captain is there to lead, and when the Dutch were trying to turn the screw in pursuit of an equaliser it was him back in his own penalty area at corners, encouraging and organising. This is unquestionably a better Portugal team than the one who shocked France in the final of Euro 2016 three years ago. They can still be hard to watch, and they could not care less about that, but this country, with a population of 10 million, keeps punching far above its weight in international football. Come the real defence of their European title next summer, the champions will be hard to beat. They did not panic under the high press of the Dutch, and there is never any rush to play the game their own way. Instead they waited out the early pressure from Holland and benefited from the briefest slip of concentration - a mistake by goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen who should have saved Guedes’ shot. Later, Santos would say that his team was very different to the side that won in Euro 2016, testament, he said, to the enduring ability of his country to produce top players. As for the style, he said: “I’m not talking about handsome or ugly, I only think about that when I am judging great painters. What I do know is that you have to win.” Without the injured Pepe in the side, his central defenders, Jose Fonte and Dias were excellent. So too, the midfielder Bruno Fernandes, 24, from Sporting Lisbon, one of those names in orbit around Manchester City. He keeps the ball moving forward without any fuss and has lots of energy. Portugal’s statistics reflected the way in which they had controlled Holland’s midfield, including Frenkie De Jong. The hosts had just 43 per cent of the possession but 18 attempts on goal and seven on target. Holland had just a single one of their own on target. Before the break Ronald Koeman’s team had cumulatively just four touches in the Portugal area. Frenkie de Jong and the Holland midfield were dominated throughout Credit : GETTY IMAGES Bernardo and Guedes tucked in along the flanks of the three central midfielders and blocked as many holes as possible. There was no Joao Felix in this side, the young pretender having struggled in the previous game. Neither was Ruben Neves in the midfield. Instead Santos opted for William Carvalho and Porto’s Danilo to keep the door closed and Fernandes shutting down De Jong. Barcelona’s new maestro had plenty of the ball, he just did not get the chance to open up the opposition in the way he would usually expect to do. Later voted the tournament’s leading young player, these are the challenges facing him as he moves into the phase of his career when expectations are that much higher and opponents more focussed on curtailing his influence. “Once the goal came it became even more difficult,” Koeman said later. “They are masters in defending when they have a lead”. He acknowledged the deficit of attacking options in his side when it came to breaking down such a formidable defence. “Maybe,” he said, “we miss a bit of that creativity in that attacking way.” The goal came on the hour, Bernardo carrying the ball forward and squaring it at just the moment to make the Dutch defence hesitate about coming out to Guedes. He let the ball run across his body and struck it fiercely with his right foot past Cillessen’s left hand. A bad one for the Holland goalkeeper who moved quickly enough to get a glove on Guedes’ shot but was not strong enough to stop it going in. Within five minutes of the goal, Depay glimpsed what turned out to be Holland’s one chance and headed it straight at Rui Patricio. Holland switched to a 4-2-3-1 system with substitute Donny van de Beek as the No 10 behind Depay. But Portugal are a hard team to dislodge from the lead. They have shown that they can produce winning teams as well as the one superstar at the centre of it all. Not every country that has had a player of Ronaldo’s status can say the same. Meanwhile the Dutch defender Matthijs De Ligt later confirmed to the Dutch media that Ronaldo had told him on the pitch after the game to come to Juventus this summer. ‘I was a bit shocked,’ De Ligt said, ‘that’s why I laughed. But I didn’t say anything.

Portugal are the first European nation to host and win a final of a major competition since France beat Brazil 3-0 in the final of th e 1998 FIFA World Cup. The Netherlands have lost four of their last five finals in major international tournaments (three in the World Cup, once in the UEFA Nations League). The Netherlands remain winless against Portugal when playing them in Portugal, drawing two and losing four of their six such meetings. Gonçalo Guedes has been directly involved in five goals in his last eight appearances for Portugal (three goals and two assists). No Portugal player has been directly involved in more goals than Bernardo Silva in the UEFA Nations League this season (3 – joint-most with Cristiano Ronaldo and André Silva), while he also made the most assists of any Portuguese player (2). The Netherlands’ first shot in this game came in the 65th minute; by which time Portugal had already had 14 shots and opened the scoring. Jasper Cillessen became the fifth goalkeeper to reach 50 international appearances for the Netherlands, after Edwin Van Der Sar (130), Hans Van Breukelen (73), Maarten Stekelenburg (58) and Gejus Van Der Meulen (54). The Netherlands fielded the same starting XI in consecutive games for the first time since October 2014 (under Guus Hiddink). 9:53PM Remember this D efinitely coming up in a pub quiz near you soon. 1 - Portugal have become the first European nation to host and win a final of a major competition since France beat Brazil 3-0 in the of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Título #UEFANATIONSLEAGUEFINAL pic.twitter.com/nyOgISBGfU — OptaJose (@OptaJose) June 9, 2019 9:45PM There's going to be a trophy ceremony R eally taking this very seriously. Holland are being made to stand around and wait for a runners up medal they definitely don't want, \"Portugal\" has been scratched onto the sexy looking trophy. 9:35PM The crowd goes wild P ortugal players celebrate, the crowd cheer... does this really mean anything at all? Let's say yes for now. Holland players seem genuinely upset about it anyway. 9:34PM PORTUGAL ARE THE BEST NATION P ortugal win the Nations League! 9:33PM 90 mins +3 - Portugal 1 Holland 0 V an Dijk is staying upfront now. Long balls are the order of the day and it's got them to within the final third. A cross into the area is caught by Patricio - easily - and that might be Holland's last chance. Ruben Neves is about to come on as a sub for the last 40 seconds or so. 9:31PM 90 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 R onaldo catches the ball quite nicely but it wobbles and zips about 10 yards wide of the far post. Worth a hit. Portugal keep up the pressure, Carvalho intercepts in Holland's half and Carvalho brings the ball towards the box. He passes wide to Rafa, Rafa goes for the back post and the headed clearance is then booted into the car park by Moutinho. 9:29PM 88 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 F renkie De Jong goes down howling in pain after Ronaldo catches him but as Holland play on he magically discovers that he's not injured at all and gets to his feet. Good on his teammates for playing on. Portugal break through Rafa Silva and De Jong and Dumfries double team him, fouling the Dutchman on the edge of the area. Ronaldo fancies this one. 9:27PM 87 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 P ortugal want a penalty as Moutinho turns his back to take a ball to feet in the box and Blind drags him to the floor. Seems pretty nailed on to me but the referee is standing right next to it and says no. Semedo has a chance to shoot shortly after but thumps it low into the goalkeeper. 9:24PM 84 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 H olland come forward, the ball is flicked through to Van De Beek, who stabs a leg at it and Patricio has to turn the ball behind! A brief VAR check for a penalty goes by (it probably wasn't) and the corner is taken but comes to nothing. 9:22PM 83 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 Credit: PA & nbsp;Luuk De Jong is getting ready to come on now. Fernandes is standing in space 30 yards out... gets the ball and considers his optio SHOOOOOOT and the goalkeeper saves again. Loves a shot, that guy. Loves it. Portugal take Fernandes after only 98 shots taken and replace him with Joao Moutinho, who was one of my favourite players of the Premier League last season. Yes, that's right. We're calling it last season now. 9:20PM 80 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 A shot opens up for De Roon 25 yards out but he batters it miles over the bar. Holland have still only had one shot on target (Depay's header). 9:19PM 78 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 R afa Silva has just come on as a sub for Guedes and then run 70 yards with the ball at feet after an astonishing bit of control near the Portugal box. Bernardo Silva then spots an opportunity to accelerate past the Dutch backline and takes them on 30 yards from goal. He runs into bodies and is taken out. 9:16PM 75 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 H olland still unable to find a way to get a shot on goal. Whenever they're within about 30 yards of goal there's no movement, Portugal stand in walls of defence and the only safe option is sideways. Depay isn't actually that good, nor is he a poacher, so crosses from wide won't do any good and he's not looking for balls into channels. Not that there are channels to run into, of course, since Portugal have bodies standing there too. The boy Santos knows his potatoes. 9:12PM 72 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 H olland win a free-kick near the area and will curl this towards the Big Lads at the back post. Depay whips it... and Ronaldo heads away. Portugal hold their shape and force the ball all the way back to the centre-backs and then Van Dijk is ruled to have fouled Semedo by running past him. Not sure that's a great decision. 9:10PM 69 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 B ernardo Silva runs around like he's been left on charge for too long and doesn't know what to do with the excess energy. He's just beaten De Ligt to a header. Holland have been much more aggressive and progressive with their play since the goal went in, but I'd say the real reason for that is Van De Beek, rather than them being 1-0 down. 9:06PM 66 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 V an de Beek is running from deep into positions beside the Portugal defence and that means Holland can finally get the ball forward quickly when near the final third. Their best bet of scoring still seems like it'll be a header AND MEMPHIS HAS DONE JUST THAT! WHAT A SAVE! From close range, Depay leaps and powers a header low to the floor but the goalkeeper is down quickly and blocks. 9:04PM 64 mins - Portugal 1 Holland 0 S o many scrappy little fouls in this game. Really takes the pace out of it. Portugal look full of confidence now and know that Holland have to open up a bit if they want to get into the game and win the title of 'best nation'. It's what every young footballer dreams about. 9:00PM GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! W HAT A HIT! PORTUGAL HAVE THE LEAD! Portugal 1 (Guedes 61') Holland 0 Credit: PA T here's a little nutmeg from Guedes from a throw, putting Bernardo in space as he runs ahead! Bernardo then cuts a reverse pass back to him on the edge of the area and Guedes, with Ronaldo waiting for the pass in space to his right, then launches a shot towards the far right of the goal and beats Cillessen for pure power. Absolute rocket. Wooooosh there it goes. 9:00PM 59 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 B ergwijn is substituted for Van De Beek. That might mean a change in shape for Holland. 8:59PM 58 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 P atricio absolutely batters a corner away, Portugal try to break and Guedes tries to run away from the Dutch centre-backs and is hacked down by Bergwijn... but the referee thinks he's taken the ball. Big decision! 8:56PM 56 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 T he corner is swung in, RONALDO ATTACKS IT! The ball loops into the box and Fonte attacks it but the goalkeeper recovers and Holland have possession. That's been a lively 10 minutes and now Portugal have found space on the right! The ball is crossed low but turned behind for a corner by De Ligt. Headed away. Another corner. Guedes tries to rocket one in from 25 yards and wins another corner. This time it goes short, Fernandes tries to thread a pass beyond the full-back but Holland can clear their lines. 8:53PM 53 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 P ortugal are making it as difficult as possible for Holland to create anything around their box and force play wide every time until there are no options except punting a cross in. Depay does just that but it starts a Portugal counter and Ronaldo bursts away beyond De Ligt. Fernandes takes the ball on and tries to catch the goalie at his near post but it's a corner. 8:51PM 50 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 P ortugal are made to pass sideways at halfway but stay patient. Holland are pressing high up the pitch and it's paying off... and WIJNALDUM IS IN! The ball is knocked through to him, he's away from the defence and only has Patricio to beat but goes for the dink way too early and makes it an easy - but quality - save. Turns out he was offside anyway. 8:48PM 47 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 H olland have pushed a little higher up the pitch and look to have switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation, trying to make the pitch nice and wide. Dumfries so far forward he's a right winger at the moment. 8:46PM KICK OFF 2 A nd we're back. Goals please. 8:44PM This game's hashtag Throwback to this match hashtag taking centre stage again ☺️ #PORNED https://t.co/fO1iyf0du3 — Kay Murray (@KayLMurray) June 9, 2019 8:38PM Bruno Fernandes Credit: REUTERS T his guy has taken five shots so far, which is 41 per cent of Portugal's total 12 so far. I'm not sure what you're meant to do with this information but there you go. 8:31PM HALF TIME P ortugal definitely the better team and far more likely to score, Holland are keeping the ball well when they get it but don't seem to know how to get shots on goal. 8:30PM 45 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 H olland win their first corner of the night. Up come De Ligt and Van Dijk to attack it, Portugal try to block their path to the box and steal it on the edge of the 18 as the ball is headed away. Portugal break! Guedes takes too long on the ball and has to go back, Semedo underlaps and takes it off Fernandes but has to settle for another corner. 8:27PM 42 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 I t's definitely a 4-3-3 when they attack and the full-backs get right up the pitch but Portugal are defending with a five man defence at times. H olland are playing two strikers, even if Depay and Babel are hardly strikers, so a central three in defence makes sense to gain numbers. De Jong is dropping to centre-back for Holland too so Blind can get further up the pitch. 8:24PM 39 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 P ortugal all over Holland. They work the ball to the final third and Fernandes is free so guess what he does SHOOOOOOOOT and this time it's just over the top corner. He's getting closer. Fernandes has the ball again shortly after but is outside shooting range so passes to Bernardo, who dribbles inside and tries to beat about four defenders with skill... and is crowded out. 8:22PM 37 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 N ow Portugal try to break. It's great one touch pass-and-move but Semedo tries to find Ronaldo at the back post and gets his delivery all wrong. Ronaldo recovers, faces his defender and nutmegs with a pass to the edge of the area and Fernandes is there. He could pass, dribble, cross SHOOT and that effort is blocked. Portugal pressing with intensity, attacking quickly. They've got control of this game. 8:19PM 35 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 H olland break after a Portugal corner but again run out of ideas in the final third and hand possession back. Holland are great at everything except creating proper chances in the final third and then taking them. It's a problem since this sport relies heavily on scoring goals. 8:16PM 32 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 F ernandes likes a punt from distance. As soon as he has the ball in space with the goal in range, which is about 30 yards for him, he tries to smash it past the goalkeeper but hasn't quite caught one cleanly yet. Another shot is turned away, a cross comes in from left and RONALDO IS THERE! Saved again! A powerful header saved low by Cillessen. 8:14PM 30 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 T he corner is swung to the box, Fonte gets his head to the ball and shoots but the goalkeeper saves in the middle of his goal. De Ligt absolutely battered into the shoulder of a Portugal player in the ruckus and takes his time to get to his feet. That looked sore. How Ryan Babel is still relevant with the Oranje in 2019 is a miracle. For a player that has played for mostly subpar teams in the last three years: Al Ain in the UAE, Deportivo La Coruna and Fulham. #NationsLeague — Godwin Odiko ⚽™ (@GodwinOdiko) June 9, 2019 8:13PM 28 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 Credit: REUTERS & nbsp;Portugal now passing around trying to work their way up the pitch. A forward pass is deflected towards Ronaldo and he attempts a shot from distance which comes off Van Dijk and goes out for a corner. 8:10PM 25 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 H olland keep possession in Portugal's half for a bit, moving it around without quite being able to create anything like a shooting chance. They win a free-kick 35 yards out on the right, curled to the back post... and out for a throw. 8:09PM 23 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 B ergwijn looks to have a run on goal as he steals from Guedes but the referee blows for a foul. 8:06PM 21 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 B eautiful football from Portugal. They fire some quick passes together from defence to midfield and just as it looks like Fernandes will have to control then go backwards, he backheel flicks it and bursts into space for the return. Suddenly Portugal are on the attack but Ronaldo's cross from right is aimed towards a box without a striker in it. Portugal win a corner. 8:03PM 18 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 L oose pass! That's a dreadful choice of ball as a Portugal forward goes all the way back to his defenders from the right wing but doesn't get enough power or direction on it. Bergwijn intercepts and has two centre-backs and most of the Portugal half to run into! Dias has to recover and steps across to get a foot on the ball before it becomes a problem. 8:00PM 15 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 W ijnaldum is such a classy player. He nearly loses control of the ball, chases it and waits for the challenge to come in before scooping it forward then moving into space. The ball comes back, he moves it forward again and jumps over a tackle while doing so, then sprints into space again to receive the return, nutmegging a Portugal defender with a clever little flick. 7:58PM 12 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 G ood play from Portugal, again lead by Ronaldo. He finds Fernandes in space on the right but his cross results in a corner. That is played short, launched at goal and Carvalho just about gets a head to the shot which would turn it beyond the goalkeeper. Saved by Cillessen. Portugal look dangerous when the come forward. 7:54PM 9 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 Credit: AP P ortugal fans making a lot of noise here. Ronaldo kills a long pass with brilliant control and spreads play, Fernandes tries an ambitious shot which bounces way wide. 7:52PM 8 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 P ortugal are a 4-3-3 when they go forward but are defending with a flat five when near their own box. They're forced into going long from a goal kick by Holland's high press and can't keep the ball in play after a brief duel on the line. Holland pass it around a bit, Van Dijk comes out from the back and tries to take his team forward. 7:49PM 5 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 P ortugal players keep asking for free-kicks from the referee and don't seem to be enjoying the physical nature of Holland's challenging for the ball. Very stop start so far. Bernardo runs in behind the Dutch defence and a long ball over the top is sent his way! Blue shirts surround him as he goes to ground in the area, the crowd want a penalty and nothing happens. Never a foul. 7:47PM 2 mins - Portugal 0 Holland 0 I was hoping for red wine strips vs orange this evening but Holland are in highlighter blue. Bit of a scrappy start to the game, neither team keeping possession particularly well. 7:45PM KICK OFF H ERE WE GO! 7:41PM Big atmosphere U efa are taking this one seriously.

Earlier on, England struggled to a 0-0 draw with Switzerland, hitting the frame of the goal a few times and having a goal ruled out for offside, before beating them on penalties. Jordan Pickford took one and saved one. You can read all about that match here . 6:31PM Starting lineups P ortugal Rui Patricio, Semedo, Fonte, Dias, Guerreiro, Danilo, William, Bruno Fernandes, B. Silva, Guedes, Ronaldo. Holland Cillessen, Dumfries, Blind, Van Dijk, De Ligt, De Roon, De Jong, Wijnaldum, Babel, Bergwijn, Memphis. 6:26PM It's the biggest game of the year T he Nations League final. My god. Think of the prestige, the glory, the history... it's all here and tonight one of Portugal or Holland will be crowned champions of whatever the Nations League is. Sure, England would have liked to win it but as defeats to Holland and Switzerland have shown, they aren't actually that good; a solid four stars out of five team just like many others. Holland have two of the best young players in world football in their side though. Matthijs de Ligt is an already excellent centre-back and Frenkie De Jong showed Gareth Southgate what a midfielder looks like. Alongside them are Virgil Van Dijk (you'll know about him), Memphis Depay and Champions League winner Gini Wijnaldum. They lack a bit of firepower but have plenty of creativity. Portugal are captained by Cristiano Ronaldo, who is still unbelievably good at football despite being 34. It's not that Ronaldo still has the tricks and flicks to play at a high level, it's that physically he looks fitter, faster and stronger than many top tier professionals in their mid-20s peak. Ronaldo's so good that you'd hardly even remember he was convicted of tax evasion. But who will triumph tonight? The mighty Netherlands with their midfield of space and movement or the Ronaldo-led Portugal? And who is this Joao Felix person that people on Twitter keep speaking about? A Football Manager wonderkid turned Actual Real Life wonderkid, Felix is the current hottest prospect on the transfer market. He's more of a second striker than winger or sole central forward, but has impressed at Benfica this season and been rated highly for a few seasons despite only being 19. Considering Portugal also have Bernardo Silva, Rui Patricio, Ruben Dias, Bruno Fernandes, Ruben Neves... they've rather sneakily become an absolutely superb team.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal has suspended the issuance of entry visas for Iranian nationals for unspecified security reasons, Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said on Tuesday, adding the move was not related to bilateral relations between the two countries. Answering a question from a lawmaker at parliamentary committee on whether such a move had been taken, Santos Silva said during the televised meeting: \"Yes, we suspended those for security reasons ... I will provide explanations later, but not publicly\". \"Portugal does not play around with entry into its territory,\" he added, without disclosing when the decision was taken. The chairman declared the meeting closed after about two hours without further off-camera testimony. Joao Goncalves Pereira, the lawmaker from the conservative CDS-PP party who asked the question, told Reuters: \"We received information that visas for Iranians had been suspended for two or three weeks, and we just wanted to confirm that.\" He would not say what was the source of that original information or whether any Iranian nationals had complained about the situation. Questioned by reporters after the committee, minister Santos Silva said the suspension had \"nothing to do with the quality of Portugal's bilateral relations with Tehran\". \"It was a temporary suspension and we hope to resume very shortly,\" he added, quoted by Portuguese news agency Lusa.

Earlier in the day, the World Heritage Committee inscribed the National Palace of Mafra and the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus in Braga on UNESCO's World Heritage List during its 43rd session in Baku, Azerbaijan, which runs from June 30 to July 10. \"It is a reason for great rejoicing for all the Portuguese,\" President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said in his welcoming notes published on the website of the presidency. \"With this decision, the World Heritage Committee added two Portuguese cultural assets to a list of seventeen of national landscapes and monuments ... recognizing in each case, the exceptional value, integrity, authenticity and preservation capacity of a heritage that is not only local but belongs to Humanity,\" he noted. The Sanctuary of Bom Jesus in Braga is an architectural and landscape complex built and reconstructed from the 16th century onwards, in which baroque, rococo and neoclassical styles are evident, while the National Palace of Mafra is the most emblematic and magnificent works of King JoÃ£o V, the president said. Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa, in his tweet, also welcomed the decision as \"another reason for great pride\" for Portugal. The UNESCO World Heritage List currently comprises 1,092 sites in 167 countries. Portugal now has 17 sites classified in the national territory, and there are 11 that constitute world heritage of Portuguese origin.

The fires broke out on Saturday across three fronts in the district of Castelo Branco, about 125 miles (200km) north-east of Lisbon, Portugal’s civil protection agency said. The firefighters were being supported by 19 firefighting aircraft and hundreds of vehicles. It is the first major bout of wildfires in Portugal this summer. The interior minister, Eduardo Cabrita, gave the injury toll on Sunday and said authorities were investigating the causes of the blazes. The state broadcaster, RTP, televised images of flames consuming wooded areas of the rural region that has experienced recurrent wildfires in Portugal’s hot and dry summer months. RTP showed firefighters hosing down a line of flames rapidly advancing on houses in the village of Sarnadas while desperate residents looked on and water-dumping aircraft swooped overhead. View image in fullscreen A firefighter watches the progression of a wildfire in Mação. Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images While most of the injuries were from smoke inhalation, one person was evacuated to a hospital to be treated for burns, according to health authorities. At least one road was closed and several residents were told to leave their homes. The Portuguese military deployed a mobile kitchen to help feed those affected by the fire and used its tracked vehicles to help clear roads for firefighting crews. The country has witnessed some of its deadliest fires on record in recent years, with 106 people killed in 2017 . That year’s death toll prompted the Portuguese government to back stronger firefighting prevention measures, leading to no wildfire deaths in 2018.

For months, three Portuguese banks had tried but failed to seize the art collection from Portuguese businessman José Berardo. The 75-year-old had offered the works as collateral for his debt which totalled nearly €1bn (£920m). The modern art collection of more than 900 works which includes, besides Miró and Mondrian, other famous artists such as Gerhard Richter and Francis Bacon, was valued in 2006 at €316m euros. But the collection could have doubled in value since then given the growth in the art market. Bacon’s Self-Portrait , for example, sold for over €17m when it was auctioned at Sotheby’s last month. Much of the Berardo collection has been on display to the public in Lisbon’s museums since 2006, under an agreement between the businessman and the galleries, which put them out of the banks’ reach. It is unclear if the lenders will obtain possession of the collection, which for now remains in the state’s custody, according to Portuguese media reports. It is not the first time Berardo’s assets have been seized. According to the media, Portugal had already taken a property of his on the island of Madeira which he had left in 1963 to make his fortune in South Africa. Berardo had borrowed a total of €962m from the state bank Caixa Geral de Depósitos the Banco Comercial Português (BCP) and the former bank Espírito Santo, now Novo Banco. He acquired shares of BCP to become its third largest shareholder.

Strikers reacted angrily after proceedings began against 14 drivers who did not comply with the decree. The government is trying to stop the strike hitting key tourist areas. Officials are particularly keen to protect Lisbon airport and the southern Algarve coastal region and the military and police have been drafted in to help move fuel stocks to areas that are running dry. Portugal police drive fuel trucks as strike bites Petrol rationing has already begun and the government's decree is aimed at keeping basic services running. Ministers are insisting that half of normal deliveries reach petrol stations and 75% for public transport.

Goods transport association Antram warned that any attempt to ignore the minimum service decree could seriously harm the economy. Environment Minister Joao Pedro Matos Fernandes said on Tuesday evening that 14 drivers were being notified of carrying out a crime of disobedience. In theory, anyone breaching the \"civil requisition\" could face up to two years in jail and one union official, Manuel Mendes, acknowledged that some drivers were boycotting the minimum service requirement. He said some drivers had been threatened with dismissal if they did not respect the decree. \"We have to stop this joke. We have drivers threatened with arrest and prosecution,\" Mr Mendes told the Observador website. According to local reports, 71 fuel tankers had left the Aveiras de Cima depot in Lisbon on Wednesday. Trucks were also seen leaving a refinery at Matosinhos near Porto, with the aim of transporting fuel to the north. At Sines in the south, union official Carlos Bonito was quoted by the Lusa news agency as saying that minimum services would be fulfilled on Wednesday, as they had the previous day. Government officials said that police and soldiers had also helped transport 28 tankers in the first two days of the strike. The unions are seeking staged increases in their basic salaries and improved working conditions.

The government's decision on Friday to declare an energy crisis indicates it expects negotiations between drivers and their employers to fail and that an open-ended strike will start on Monday. Fuel rationing, which will restrict car drivers to a maximum of 15 liters of petrol or diesel at specially designated stations, will start at midnight Saturday and is scheduled to last until Aug. 21. \"The energy crisis aims to guarantee essential energy supplies for defense, functioning of the state and priority sectors of the economy,\" the government said in a statement after the cabinet met. A similar strike by fuel-tanker drivers in April caused low supplies at more than 2,000 petrol stations and prompted panic buying by drivers. Drivers have again been rushing to filling stations, causing long queues in some cities, on fears that this strike could be worse as it comes at the height of the summer tourist season. A website providing information on the strike said 7% of the country's filling stations were already running low. The declaration of an energy crisis allows the government to ensure full supplies to ports, hospitals, airports, military bases, fire stations, the civil protection agency and some 320 key public petrol stations. It will also be able to mobilize the army to secure supplies. The fuel tanker drivers are demanding higher wages and better working conditions. They will make a final decision on Saturday after last-minute talks with employers whether to go ahead with the strike. Portugal is due to go to the polls in a national election in October when the ruling Socialists are on course to retain power.

It was the second helicopter to have crashed in as many days while helping extinguish Portuguese wildfires that have broken out following a spell of hot and dry weather. In Wednesday's crash, the pilot was lightly injured. An emergency service official said that in Thursday's incident the helicopter had apparently hit a high-tension wire before crashing and burning. Portugal, which in 2017 suffered two devastating wildfires that killed over 100 people, has in the past two years reinforced its emergency services to prevent and combat forest blazes, deploying dozens of aircraft from scout helicopters to waterbombing planes.

(Photo by Pedro Fiuza/Xinhua) LISBON, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- Portugal introduced on Wednesday a strict law aiming at combating smokers who throw the cigarette butts on the ground in public. The new law that approves measures for the collection and treatment of the tobacco waste enters into force on Wednesday. Whoever throws on the floor will be punished with fines between 25 and 250 euros (27.6 U.S. dollars to 276 U.S. dollars). As of Wednesday, cigarette butts, cigars or other cigarette containing tobacco products will be treated as urban solid waste and therefore their \"disposal in public space\" is prohibited. Although the law comes into force on Wednesday, it provides for a \"transitional period of one year\" to adapt to it, which means that only in September 2020 there will be effective fines. The new law stipulates that \"commercial establishments, namely restaurants and establishments where recreational activities take place and all buildings where smoking is prohibited must have ashtrays and equipment for the disposal of undifferentiated and selective waste produced by its costumers\". The government shall now establish an incentive system within the Environmental Fund and promote consumer awareness campaigns on the responsible destination of tobacco waste, including cigarettes, cigars or other cigarettes. Regarding the tobacco producing companies, the new law states that they should promote the use of biodegradable materials in the manufacture of tobacco filters. 1 2 3 Next 1 2 3 Next KEY WORDS: YOU MAY LIKE Bulgaria busts illegal cigarette factory MORE PHOTOS Centrestage 2019 event kicks off in Hong Kong Press conference held after FIBA World Cup group A match between China and Venezuela Moroccan interior minister meets Spanish counterpart in Rabat Newborn Hawksbill sea turtle seen in Singapore's Sentosa Island MOST VIEWED Highlights of 2019 Canadian Int'l Air Show Scenery of Yamzbog Yumco Lake in SW China's Tibet Scenery of highland barley field in Bainang County, China's Tibet China's FAST telescope identifies 93 pulsars Scenery of Haokun Lake in Baise City, south China's Guangxi Cherry blossoms in Canberra, Australia In pics: magnificent scenery across China MAKS 2019 air show opens in Zhukovsky, Russia EXPLORE XINHUANET News China World Business Culture Edu Sports Sci Tech Health Entertainment Regions Asia & Pacific Americas Europe Africa Organizations North America Services Investment Doing Business Work in China Study in China Visit in China Live in China Emergency Weather More Photos Video In-depth Special Reports Corrections 010020070750000000000000011100001383657351",

Photograph: Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images Portugal This article is more than 5 years old Portuguese MPs denounce museum dedicated to dictator Salazar This article is more than 5 years old Plan to honour Estado Novo founder in home town called insult to victims of regime AFP in Lisbon Thu 12 Sep 2019 17.41 BST Last modified on Thu 12 Sep 2019 18.12 BST Share Portugal ’s parliament has voted to denounce a planned museum dedicated to the former dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, calling it an “affront to democracy”. Leonel Gouveia, the mayor of Salazar’s hometown of Santa Comba Dão in central Portugal, announced the plan to create the museum last month. Critics said it could attract people sympathetic to Salazar , who ruled Portugal with an iron fist for more than 30 years. Portugal’s leftwing majority parliament said on Wednesday that the museum, to be built in an old school next to Salazar’s former home, would be an “insult to the memory of victims of the dictatorship”. Parliament asked “all public and private entities not to support the project directly or indirectly”. Salazar rose to power in 1932 following a military coup four years earlier, and ruled until 1968. He died in Lisbon in 1970. A military uprising toppled his Estado Novo, or New State, regime in 1974, putting an end to 13 years of colonial wars in Africa. It is not the first time authorities in Santa Comba Dão have come under fire for publicising the town’s links to the dictator. In 2012 the mayor at the time, João Lourenço, failed in an attempt to have a wine called Salazar’s Memories registered as a trademark.

REUTERS/Jon Nazca Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab By Catarina Demony and Patricia Vicente  Rua LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's minority Socialist government presented on Wednesday a proposal to raise the monthly minimum wage by nearly 6% to 635 euros (£547) next year, remaining the lowest in western Europe. Prime Minister Antonio Costa promised to raise the monthly minimum wage by 25% to 750 euros by 2023 when he began his second term in office last month. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"This trajectory contributes to the recovery of income and the improvement of social cohesion levels,\" the government said in the plan, seen by Reuters. \"The increase has coincided with significant dynamism in the economy and the labour market.\" One in five workers in Portugal are on the minimum wage and the employment status of 890,000 people was last year officially described as precarious, a term used to refer to non-standard forms of employment, including temporary work and fixed-term contracts. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Costa's centre-left Socialists, who presided over four years of strong economic growth and budget deficit cuts, won an Oct. 6 election, expanding their parliamentary representation as the biggest party but still just shy of a majority. Now governing alone, Costa relied on support from two far-left parties - the Communists and Left Bloc - in the last four years and the wage plan is likely to be well received by them. JOB INSECURITY Handed over to workers' unions and others during a meeting on Wednesday, the government's proposal said the new minimum wage of 635 euros will be implemented on Jan. 1, 2020. Increases will be negotiated and reviewed every year until it reaches the 750 euros target in 2023. Between 2015, when the Socialists took power, and 2019, the minimum wage increased 14%, from 505 to 600 euros, way below neighbouring Spain's 1,050 euros. \"But the salary increases have not yet reached the pace of growth needed to ensure a balanced distribution of income,\" the government said, adding Portugal \"remains one of the countries with the highest income inequality rates in the European Union.\" Analysts see job insecurity as a big flaw of the economy, which is cooling after recording its strongest expansion in almost two decades in 2017 as Portugal recovered from a debt crisis that required an international bailout. Portugal's biggest workers' union CTGP said the increase to 635 euros is \"insufficient\", arguing the country is now \"in a position to go much further\".

Depois de ter sido constituído arguido em julho, o ex-ministro Azeredo Lopes foi formalmente acusado de quatro crimes pelo Ministério: dois crimes de denegação de justiça, prevaricação, abuso de poder e favorecimento pessoal praticado por funcionário no inquérito criminal ao roubo de armas dos paióis de Tancos ocorrido a 28 de junho de 2017. O Ministério Público (MP) acusou ainda mais 22 arguidos de crimes tão diversos como associação criminosa, furto, detenção e tráfico de armas e de terrorismo internacional, entre outros.\nAo que o Observador apurou, o ex-ministro da Defesa Nacional é acusado em regime de co-autoria e em regime de autoria singular. No primeiro caso, e em regime de co-autoria com o coronel Luís Vieira (ex-diretor da Polícia Judiciária Militar) e o major Vasco Brazão (investigador da Judiciária Militar), é acusado de um crime de denegação de justiça e prevaricação e de um crime de favorecimento pessoal praticado por funcionário.

Os oito arguidos detidos estão a ser notificado aos oito arguidos que estão ainda detidos, sendo que da parte da tarde deverão ser notificados os restantes arguidos que estão em liberdade.\nAo que o Observador apurou, a acusação está dividida em duas partes:\nÉ nesta ultima parte que os procuradores Vítor Magalhães e Cláudia Porto, responsáveis pela investigação do Departamento Central de Investigação e Ação Penal (DCIAP), imputam a Azeredo Lopes a co-autoria dos alegados crimes de denegação de justiça e prevaricação e de favorecimento pessoal praticado por funcionário. Isto porque além de ter estado alegadamente a par das negociações ilícitas entre investigadores da PJM e João Paulino, o ex-ministro terá igualmente conspirado com os responsáveis da PJM (coronel Luís Vieira, ex-diretor da PJM, e o major Vasco Brazão, líder do grupo de investigação) na sabotagem da investigação da PJ.\nTancos. Como Paulino, Laranginha, ‘Fechaduras’, ‘Nando’, ‘Caveirinha’ e ‘Pisca’ deram o golpe (e foram tramados pelo Facebook)\n\nUma das principais provas usadas contra o ex-ministro Azeredo Lopes é uma troca de sms alegadamente comprometedora com o deputado Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro (PS), revelada em exclusivo pelo Observador. O Ministério Público (MP) e a Polícia Judiciária (PJ) encaram mesmo as afirmações escritas por Azeredo Lopes como uma confissão em versão de SMS de que estaria a par de todas as movimentações ilícitas da Polícia Judiciária Militar (PJM).\n“Eu sabia (…) Mas, como é claro, não sabia que ia ser hoje.” Foi assim que Azeredo Lopes, então ministro da Defesa, confessou a Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro, ex-presidente da concelhia do PS Porto, o seu conhecimento sobre a investigação paralela e ilícita da PJM para descobrir as armas roubadas nos paióis de Tancos no dia 28 de junho de 2017.\nPior: Azeredo Lopes assumiu na troca de mensagens com o ex-presidente da concelhia do PS Porto que iria omitir ao Parlamento o seu conhecimento sobre as manobras da PJM. O deputado do PS nada disse perante essa segunda confissão do ministro da Defesa de António Costa.\n[Contradições, revelações e o que ficou por explicar. O filme da Comissão de Inquérito a Tancos]\nOutro testemunho importante contra Azeredo Lopes é o testemunho de Joana Marques Vidal prestada nos autos. A ex-procuradora-geral garantiu nos autos que falou com Azeredo Lopes a 18 de outubro de 2017, no dia do ‘achamento’ das armas, para protestar contra o facto de a PJM não estar a colaborar com a PJ na investigação ao roubo nos paióis de Tancos — num momento em que o então ministro da Defesa, segundo o despacho de acusação, já estava a par das diligências da PJM e das alegadas negóciações ilícitas da Judiciária Militar e da GNR de Loulé com o grupo de João Paulino.\nRecorde-se que, através de um despacho assinado a 7 de julho de 2017, Marques Vidal tinha retirado a PJM da investigação e decidido que o órgão de polícia criminal que coadjuvaria o DCIAP seria a PJ.\nDe acordo com a acusação, o ex-ministro da Defesa Nacional soube desde o início da investigação paralela da PJM — que pretendia ‘passar a perna’ à PJ e descobrir primeiro o paradeiro das armas roubadas — e no momento em que falou com Joana Marques Vidal terá alegadamente omitido esse seu conhecimento. Pior: Azeredo Lopes terá tido “pleno conhecimento” de que a equipa de investigadores da PJM liderada por Vasco Brazão terá encetado negociações, juntamente com diversos elementos da GNR de Loulé, o líder dos assaltantes (João Paulino), para que as armas roubadas fossem encontradas. Em contrapartda, os assaltantes não seriam presos.\nTerá sido Luís Vieira, diretor da PJM, a dar conhecimento a Azeredo Lopes do ‘achamento’ das armas que estava a ser planeado. A reunião entre Azeredo e Vieira ocorreu, segundo a acusação, a 4 de agosto de 2017 e terá sido aí que o diretor da PJM entregou diversos documentos ao então ministro da Defesa Nacional e ter-lhe-á comunicado que iria tentar anular juridicamente o despacho da procuradora-geral e iria abrir uma frente operacional para recuperar o material roubado — mesmo não tenho competência legal para o fazer.\nTal como o Observador já explicou detalhadamente aqui, o assalto aos paióis de Tancos foi concretizado por um grupo de sete elementos. João Paulino, ex-fuzileiro e alegado líder, António Laranjinha, João Pais ‘Caveirinha’, Gabriel Moreira ‘Tije’, Fernando Santos ‘Baião’ e Hugo Santos foram os assaltantes que entraram no quartel de Tancos para roubarem 300 quilos de material militar. O sétimo elemento do grupo chama-se Valter Abreu e terá ficado do lado de fora do quartel com a função de vigilância depois de ter cortado a rede para o grupo entrar no perímetro militar.\nFernando Guimarães ‘Nando’, que foi dado em maio de 2019 como tendo participado no assalto a Tancos, acabou por não ser acusado pelo Ministério Público. Os procuradores do DCIAP entenderam que apenas participou nos atos preparatórios da operação.\nJoão Paulino e os restantes elementos do grupo terão sido acusados, entre outros crimes, dos crimes de associação criminosa, furto, detenção e tráfico de armas e de terrorismo internacional.\nO grupo de João Paulino, natural de Albufeira e proprietário de um bar (JB Bar) que explorava em Ansião (distrito de Leiria), divide-se em dois subgrupos geográficos: os elementos de Ansião/Aveiro e aqueles que moravam em Albufeira. Comecemos pelos primeiros:\nAntónio Laranjinha — Dado como um segundo líder, mas menos importante que Paulino, com alegadas ligações ao tráfico de estupefacientes e de armas;\nGabriel Moreira ‘Tije’, Hugo Santos e Pedro Marques — Amigos de João Paulino com quem costumavam jogar póquer no Chão de Couce (Ansião);\nFernando Santos, ‘Baião’ — Amigo de Paulino que também trabalhava no JB Bar;\nValter Abreu, ‘Pisca’ — Distribuidor e consumidor da alegada rede de tráfico de droga de João Paulino. É tio do 2.º Furriel Filipe Sousa, colocado nos Quartel de Tancos, que deu informações fundamentais a João Paulino sobre as armas que estavam guardadas nos paióis e sobre as patrulhas de vigilância que eram realizadas.\nPedro Marques (à esquerda), João Paulino (ao centro) e ao Fernando Santos ‘Baião’ (à direita) juntos com as namoradas num bar (Foto retirada do perfil público de João Paulino no Facebook)\nJá o subgrupo do Algarve, que em maio de 2019 era dado como estando alegadamente ligado ao tráfico de estupefacientes, era composto por:\n‘Nando’ e ‘Fechaduras’ dividiam a mesma casa no Algarve e geriam em conjunto estabelecimentos de diversão noturna.

        "text": "Polls show Socialists on course for four more years.\t\t\t\nLISBON — Campaigning for Portugal’s general election kicked off Monday with Prime Minister António Costa enjoying big poll leads and boosted by a surge in support for his Socialist Party in a key regional election on the island of Madeira.\nThe Socialists (PS) more than tripled their score on the traditionally conservative Atlantic island, denying the center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) an absolute majority in the regional parliament for the first time since it was set up in 1976.\n“This is an historical result for the Socialist Party, its best ever,” Costa told reporters. “It’s extraordinary.”\nSocialist joy was muted, however, because the PSD looks likely to cling to power in Madeira by forging a coalition with the conservative CDS-People’s Party.\nThe PSD won 21 seats in the 47-seat assembly, down from 24, while the PS grew from five to 19. However, the three seats of the CDS-PP should be enough to form a coalition with the PSD, if the two center-right parties can overcome a history of rancor on the island.\nRui Rio, leader of Portugal’s center-right PSD | Patricia De Melo Moreira/AFP via Getty Images\n“If what happened in Madeira today is repeated on the mainland, that would suit me just fine,” chuckled the PSD’s national leader Rui Rio as the result was confirmed.\nThat looks unlikely.\nLatest polls have Costa’s Socialists winning close to 40 percent of the vote in the October 6 national ballot, compared to around 25 percent for the PSD.\nUnless there’s a major turnaround, Europe’s most successful Socialist looks sure to again buck the trend of declining center-left fortunes elsewhere on the continent.\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\nVoters are pleased with how Costa and Finance Minister Mário Centeno have managed the past four years of economic recovery. They still blame the center right for austerity measures introduced in return for a €78 billion bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund that kept finances afloat after the country was clobbered by the eurozone debt crisis.\nThe only real electoral suspense is whether Costa can secure an absolute majority or be obliged to continue his geringonça (contraption) alliance with two smaller, far-left parties.\nBoth his partners fared badly in Madeira. The Left Bloc lost its two seats in the regional assembly and the Portuguese Communist Party kept just one after seeing its vote drop from 5.5 percent to 1.8 percent.\nNationwide, however, the leftists’ vote seems to be holding up better. The Left Bloc is polling around 10 percent and the PCP close to 7 percent. Both have warned that giving the Socialists an absolute majority will hand Costa excessive power and tempt the PS to lurch further to the center, away from “progressive” policies.\nWith Portuguese voters continuing to reject right-wing populism (two hard-right parties running in Madeira scored a combined total of 0.61 percent), the main insurgent party is the animal rights outfit People Animals and Nature (PAN).\nIt failed to make a breakthrough in Madeira but got its first MEP in May’s European Parliament election and is polling over 4 percent nationwide with a program that includes creating a “sort of national health service” for pets, a ban on bullfighting and setting up a network of “pet-friendly” beaches.\n“They’ll wipe out our economy, wipe out investment and everybody will be forced to live like beggars like in Venezuela” — Miguel Albuquerque, outgoing presidentof Madeira\nDespite such ideas, debates have been rather tepid.\nA Costa vs. Rio face-off carried live during primetime on all three main national TV networks last week focused on technical points of tax policy and healthcare spending. It was completely lacking in the personal attacks and populist fireworks that have become familiar in much of Europe.\nThey notably agreed to make the fight against climate change a cross-party national priority. “We all have to be together on this, right and left,” Rio said. “It’s too serious to be the PSD against the PS, I even agree with the Left Bloc’s slogan: there is no planet B.”\nThe Madeira campaign, in contrast, was a no-holds-barred affair as the right struggled to defend its stronghold on the sub-tropical vacation island.\nLying in the Atlantic, some 500 kilometers off the coast of northwest Africa and 1,000 kilometers southwest of mainland Portugal, the autonomous region consists of Madeira island, its much smaller neighbor Porto Santo and a scattering of uninhabited rocks. It has enjoyed a wide degree of self-rule since the 1970s. Portugal’s other Atlantic archipelago, the Azores, have a similar status.\nThe election in Madeira saw a surge in support for the Socialists | Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images\nPSD leaders on the island warned a victory for the left would lead to communist-style economic ruin and unrest.\n“They’ll wipe out our economy, wipe out investment and everybody will be forced to live like beggars like in Venezuela,” Miguel Albuquerque, the outgoing regional president, cautioned in a final rally.  “If they want Venezuela, they should go and live there.”\nThat message resonated with a significant section of the population.\nTens of thousands of Madeiran islanders emigrated to Venezuela during the country’s mid-20th century oil boom. Recently, their descendants have been flocking back to escape the economic ruin and political chaos under the left-wing regime of Nicolás Maduro.\n“Socialism and communism aren’t exactly the most popular words in our dictionary,” Ana Cristina Monteiro, president of the Venezuelan Immigrant Community Association, told the SAPO24 news site last week. She was elected on the CDS-PP list.\nVenezuelan-Portuguese voters accounted for around 5,000 of the 258,000 registered voters in the Madeira election and the PSD’s margin of victory over the Socialists was just over 5,200 votes.\nHow the Portuguese Socialist leader upset the odds to win a rare majority government.\nSocialist Party wins absolute majority, but far right makes gains.\nAntónio Costa looks set for third term. \nSocialists’ poll lead narrows in runup to Sunday’s legislative vote.",

By Joana Ramiro TOPSHOT - Socialist party candidate and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa waves as he addresses the nation after winning the Portugal's General Election in Lisbon on October 6, 2019. - Portugal's incumbent Prime Minister Antonio Costa's Socialists won a general election today after presiding over a period of solid economic growth following years of austerity, near total results showed. (Photo by PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA / AFP) (Photo by PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP via Getty Images) Closing Telejornal ’s election night coverage in the early hours of 7 October, Portuguese veteran news anchor José Rodrigues dos Santos wished viewers good night from “a country that looks very different and yet somewhat still the same”. The contradictory sign-off could not have been more appropriate, encapsulating the political situation in Portugal following the general election, locally known as the legislativas . At first glance, the Portuguese electorate seem to have endorsed the geringonça – which loosely translates as “contraption”. This was the agreement reached between Prime Minister António Costa’s Socialist Party (PS) and the far-left Communist Party (PCP) and the Bloco de Esquerda (BE) to ensure a stable government after elections in 2015 resulted in a hung parliament. Under the PS-led administration, a more progressive package of fiscal and social policies reversed much of the damage inflicted by an austerity programme that the previous conservative government introduced in 2011. The electorate appears content with Costa, granting the PS just under 37 per cent of the vote and an extra 20 seats in the Assembleia, Portugal’s parliament. The other partners did not fare so well – Bloco retained its seats in parliament, but lost vote share, while the alliance between the PCP and the Portuguese Greens (CDU) saw its vote share plummet to 6.5 per cent. The success of Portugal’s leftist parties is remarkable at a time of rising right-wing populism and xenophobia across Europe. But in another sense the results are surprisingly mediocre, given that the geringonça has increased the national minimum wage, overseen a general fall in unemployment and led an economic recovery in which Portugal’s GDP grew by 1.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2018. The election result was also marred by an unprecedented 45.5 per cent abstention rate; more people decided not to vote rather than support the parties that have, albeit marginally, improved the quality of their lives.

THANK YOU Close The more significant news, perhaps, is the collection of new parties that have gained seats in parliament for the first time, including the animal rights party PAN and André Ventura’s Chega – the first avowedly fascist party to enter parliament since the Carnation Revolution of 1974. On the last day of campaigning I followed members of Bloco de Esquerda around the streets of Lisbon and Setúbal, speaking to their candidates and supporters, and gauging how they felt after four years in government. “Today, people have a clearer sense of what they do and do not want,” Bloco’s MP Isabel Pires told me when I met her at the party’s Lisbon headquarters, a beautiful 19th-century mansion occupied by the International Communist League in 1975 and the unofficial home of Portuguese radical politics since. She told me how people on the streets asked twice before they took Bloco’s leaflets – they did not want to read anything from the pro-austerity Christian democratic People’s Party (CDS) and its leader Assunção Cristas. “We heard this every day,” Pires said. The CDS suffered the most on election night, losing 13 seats, prompting Cristas, a former environment minister and a fierce proponent of austerity, to resign. The Social-Democratic Party (PSD) lost 12 of its MPs. The two parties had run together in 2015, winning 38.6 per cent of the vote. This time around they barely topped 32 per cent. Their commitment to austerity and privatisation of national services and industries are no longer attractive policies for most voters, who increasingly favour investment in public services and a rise in wages and pensions. For those voters who still subscribe to the neoliberal programme espoused by the CDS and PSD there are now other parties to vote for, such as Iniciativa Liberal, which, despite being led by two “tech bro” champions of Ayn Rand, seems to have attracted enough votes from the liberal classes to gain a seat in parliament. Pires was cautious about the future of the geringonça and the new political forces she feared might gain support. Like Bloco’s leader, Catarina Martins, Pires does not discount the BE continuing to support the geringonça , but added that it would depend “on factors that are a little uncertain, including which other parties will join [the governing coalition]”. In his victory speech, Costa extended a hand to the animal rights party (PAN), as well as Livre, an eco-socialist, pro-EU party, which is also the first in Portugal to be led by a black woman, Joacine Katar Moreira. These two new parties could alter the balance of forces within the geringonça . The PS cannot govern alone, but with enough sangfroid and political wit it could make itself a minority government that keeps the smaller satellite parties happy and therefore willing to help it pass its political and economic programme. Which brings us back to a Portugal that is the same as it always was and yet completely different. Because while it is clear that for enough Portuguese voters the political status quo is no longer acceptable, it is also true that no matter what the incoming coalition government looks like, a second geringonça would keep PS’s neoliberal tendencies in check, but also soften the more radical policies of its far-left partners. Only time will tell if this elaborate parliamentary dance is precisely what the Portuguese people demanded as an alternative to the tired two-party hegemony of the PS and PSD, or if, in the end, there are too many cooks in the kitchen. But one thing is for certain. The geringonça that followed years of hard and exhausting austerity delivered many of the things the Portuguese people had asked for, and helped restore faith in the country’s political system after a series of short-lived provisional governments. But if the left, and even the PS, wants to take advantage of this political moment, and continue to prevent the rise of right-wing populism, it must do more, and be bolder in its intent. Otherwise, as has happened in Greece, the mood might quickly turn sour. Content from our partners Can green energy solutions deliver for nature and people?

        "text": "Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nLISBON, Portugal (AP) — Portugal won’t exclude Chinese companies from supplying technology for the country’s next-generation 5G wireless network, senior Portuguese officials told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday.\nPortugal is the latest European Union country to resist U.S. efforts to persuade allies they should shun Huawei’s bids to provide the hardware that operators will use for the new ultra-fast 5G networks.\nThe Chinese government “won’t hesitate” to use Huawei as a back door to sensitive data, Pompeo warned at a news conference with Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva.\nHe said each country has to make its own decision about such issues.\n“But we have tried for these past couple of years to make clear to our friends all around the world of the attendant risks,” Pompeo said.\nSantos Silva said bids from 5G operators will be assessed in the light of strict Portuguese and EU regulations. Market-leading wireless carrier Altice Portugal partnered last year with Huawei to develop 5G technology as it prepares to launch service in 2020.\nEuropean countries have been caught in the middle of a geopolitical battle over 5G networks, as Washington lobbies its allies to avoid Huawei because of suspicions the company could be used by Beijing for cyberespionage - allegations the company has denied.\nOther EU countries, including key markets Germany and the United Kingdom, have also resisted Washington’s entreaties to block Huawei, though they have yet to make a final decision. Hungary announced last month that Huawei will take part in the construction of its 5G wireless network.\n\n\nThose decisions have contributed to at times strained relations between Washington and the EU, though there are signs that Europe is starting to take the U.S concerns more seriously.\nThe Dutch government said Thursday in its plans to auction 5G frequencies that wireless companies could ban equipment suppliers with connections to foreign governments or intelligence agencies involved in spying.\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson hinted at a tougher stance Wednesday, saying he didn’t want to compromise security and intelligence cooperation in any decision on 5G suppliers.\nThe EU Council adopted 5G conclusions this week stressing that cybersecurity should consider “non-technical factors including the legal and policy framework” suppliers may face in third countries, an apparent reference to communist-ruled China.\nRobert Strayer, a cybersecurity official with the U.S. State Department, said he was pleased with the council’s position, because it’s in line with what Washington has lobbied other governments to adopt: “a set of principles to protect the whole of the network from untrusted vendors.”\nSantos Silva said that all foreign investment is welcome.\nPortugal is one of the EU’s, and NATO’s, smaller members and keen to attract investors. Chinese companies already own significant assets in the energy, banking and insurance sectors in Portugal.\nPortugal has challenged critics of its China policy to compete with Beijing on Portuguese investments.\nSantos Silva noted that a public tender is to open soon for a container terminal at the country’s biggest Atlantic deepwater port, in Sines. China is expected to table a strong bid, but Santos Silva said he hoped U.S. companies would compete, too.\nPompeo also met privately with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.\nChan reported from London.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He said he had not been named as a suspect but believed the inquiry was incompatible with staying in office. Prosecutors said on Tuesday they were investigating concessions awarded for lithium mines and hydrogen production. They said detention warrants were issued for five people including Mr Costa's chief of staff, Vítor Escária. Público newspaper reported that Mr Escária had been detained. Infrastructure Minister João Galamba has meanwhile been indicted as part of the inquiry into energy deals. \"The dignity of the functions of prime minister is not compatible with any suspicion about his integrity, his good conduct and even less with the suspicion of the practice of any criminal act,\" the prime minister said in a televised address on Tuesday. Mr Costa said he was caught by surprise by the corruption investigation but promised to collaborate with it. \"There is no illicit act that weighs on my conscience, or even any censurable act,\" he added. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said he had accepted the prime minister's resignation and summoned political parties for consultations on Wednesday. Portugal country profile Villagers up in arms over plans to mine lithium The political crisis unfolded after prosecutors published a statement detailing searches in more than 40 different premises as part of the inquiry. Prosecutors are investigating alleged corruption and influence peddling in lithium mining concessions in northern Portugal, as well as a hydrogen production project and the planned construction of a data centre in the deep-water port of Sines, south of Lisbon. About 140 detectives searched 17 residential properties and 25 other premises, including the office of the prime minister's chief of staff and two government ministries. They also searched municipal offices in Sines. Portugal's main PSI 20 share index was down almost 3% as the political crisis unfolded. The European Union is keen to reduce its dependence on mines in China, Africa and South America for lithium and other raw materials needed for the green energy transition. Portugal's lithium reserves are considered central to Europe's increasing demand for electric cars, but exploration projects have faced opposition by some locals.

In de Algarve, waar veel toeristen momenteel vakantie vieren, worden hoge temperaturen gemeten en waait het flink. Die combinatie leidt ertoe dat brandweerlieden veel moeite hebben met het blussen van de brand. Ook de zes blusvliegtuigen die de brandweer inzet, kunnen lastig bij het gebied komen waar inmiddels naar schatting 7000 hectare is afgebrand. Ongeveer 1400 mensen zijn geëvacueerd. In het noordelijker gelegen Odemira, dat net boven de Algarve ligt, begon zaterdag de brand. De omstandigheden zijn daar volgens de brandweer nog steeds uitdagend. Maandagavond werd de lucht er donker door een enorme rookwolk. NOS De burgemeester van Odemira noemt de situatie \"zorgwekkend, kritiek en complex\". De vrees is dat de brand zich zal verspreiden naar Monchique, een groen en bergachtig gebied op het platteland van de Algarve. Daar waren voor het laatst bosbranden in 2018. In totaal zijn in Portugal twintig dorpen, vier toeristische accommodaties en één camping uit voorzorg ontruimd. Ook zijn verschillende wegen afgezet. Voor 120 Portugese gemeenten, waaronder Lissabon, geldt nu volgens de autoriteiten het hoogste risico op bosbranden. 0:35 Branden in Portugal veroorzaken schade en evacuaties Bosbranden richten schade aan in Portugal en Spanje, ook risico in Griekenland Fransen lappen regels tegen bosbranden aan hun laars Bosbranden La Palma breiden zich uit, nu 4000 mensen geëvacueerd Buitenland Deel artikel: Link gekopieerd!

REUTERS/Pedro Nunes/File Photo [1/2] A person walks in Alfama neighbourhood in Lisbon, Portugal, February 16, 2023. REUTERS/Pedro Nunes/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - (This Feb. 16 story has been corrected to make clear that the scheme offers residency rights, not an EU passport, which golden visa-holders can apply for after five years, in paragraphs 9 and 11) Portugal announced on Thursday a hefty package of measures to tackle a housing crisis, including the end of its controversial \"Golden Visa\" scheme and a ban on new licenses for Airbnbs and other short-term holiday rentals. Rents and house prices have skyrocketed in Portugal, which is among the poorest countries in Western Europe. Last year, more than 50% of workers earned less than 1,000 euros per month while in Lisbon alone, rents jumped 37% in 2022. Low salaries, a red-hot property market, policies encouraging wealthy foreigners to invest and a tourism-dependent economy have for years made it hard for locals to rent or buy, housing groups have said. Portugal's 8.3% inflation rate has exacerbated the problem. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said the crisis was now affecting all families, not just the most vulnerable. It is not clear when the measures, worth at least 900 million euros ($962.19 million), will come into effect. Costa said some would be approved next month and others will be voted on by lawmakers. A mechanism would be introduced to regulate rent increases, he added, and the government will offer tax incentives to landlords who convert tourism properties into houses for locals to rent. Left Bloc party MP Mariana Mortagua criticised the measures, saying the government was giving tax breaks to landlords who have already \"benefited from (housing) speculation\". New licenses for tourism accommodations, such as Airbnbs, will be prohibited - except in less populated rural areas. The Social Democrats said the measures were an \"attack\" on the rights of property owners and businesses. To address the housing shortage, Costa said the state would rent vacant houses direct from landlords for a period of five years and put them on the rental market. Portugal will end its golden visa programme, which offers residency rights to non-EU nationals in return for investments including in real estate and has been criticised for boosting house prices and rents. Successful applicants can apply to obtain a passport after five years. The scheme attracted 6.8 billion euros in investment since its launch in 2012, with the bulk of the money going into real estate. Housing groups said the measures would mean little if the government continued to promote other policies to attract wealthy foreigners to Portugal, such as the \"Digital Nomads Visa\" introduced in October, which gives foreigners with high monthly income from remote work to live and work from Portugal without paying local taxes. At a small housing protest in Lisbon, 23-year-old activist Andreia Galvao accused the government of failing to live up to promises it made to address the housing crisis in the past. \"The goal was that by 2024 all Portuguese would have access to quality housing - it doesn't look like that will happen,\" she said. \"The situation is dramatic.\" The \"Housing is a right\" group said the measures do not change the \"system in place\" in which large real estate investment funds control a significant chunk of the market. \"For the vast majority of people, rents will remain unaffordable and buying a house will continue to be a dream,\" it said.

The attack took place at the Ismaili Centre on Avenida Lusíada. The suspect, who was in possession of a large knife, was shot in the leg by police. He was then detained and taken to hospital. The motive for the attack on Tuesday is not clear. Police said they received a call at about 11:00 local time after the suspect entered the centre. Officers asked the suspect to stop the attack, but he disobeyed and was shot. The attacker is believed to be Afghan and the two victims were Portuguese women - one was the attacker's English teacher at the centre and the other a fellow classmate, according to Portuguese media. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said it appeared to be \"an isolated act\" and discussing a possible motive was \"premature\". This was echoed by home affairs minister Jose Luis Carneiro, who said \"the circumstances and motivations\" of the attack were being investigated. He said the alleged attacker was a \"relatively young man\" with three young children and his wife had died in a refugee camp in Greece. The president of the Afghan community Association, Omed Taeri, said the attacker arrived in Portugal \"a year or so ago\" and was being aided by the Ismaili centre. EPA Police said a motive for the attack had not yet been determined Mr Carneiro said the man often visited the centre to to study Portuguese, collect food donations and for childcare. He added that the victims worked at the centre's refugee support programme. Police urged the public to avoid the area near to the Ismaili Centre on Tuesday. Ismailism is a minority branch of Shia Islam. Its members recognise Prince Karim Aga Khan as their spiritual leader. The Ismaili community in Portugal is one of the largest in continental Europe, numbering thousands, including many who fled Mozambique during its civil war.

The 230-seat parliament approved five right-to-die bills, by margins of between 28 and 41 votes. Isabel Moreira, a Socialist MP, said the aim of the bills was to let people “make intimate choices, without breaking the law”. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside parliament in Lisbon ahead of the vote on the legislation, which has set Portugal on course to become one of only a handful of countries to decriminalise the procedures. The vote came two years after parliament rejected a bill to legalise voluntary euthanasia for terminal patients in the Catholic-majority country.

The public prosecutor’s office in Lisbon confirmed reports that dozens of personal and corporate accounts belonging to Dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo, were the subject of a seizure order. The daughter of the former Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos, she is said to be Africa’s richest woman, with a fortune estimated at $2.2bn. The order was prompted by a request from Angola , where Dos Santos has been named as a suspect in a criminal investigation into the misappropriation of funds from the state oil company, Sonangol. “We confirm that the public prosecution service requested the seizure of bank accounts, as part of the request for international judicial cooperation from the Angolan authorities,” the Portuguese prosecutor’s office told news agency Lusa . Q&A What is the Luanda Leaks investigation? Show The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola. The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the Guardian, the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper Expresso. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Dos Santos was appointed the chair of Sonangol as her father was nearing the end of his 38-year term as president. Prosecutors are investigating the transfer of some $115m in consultancy fees which she allegedly authorised while at the helm of the company. A spokesperson for Dos Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She has previously rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing , describing allegations against her as “extremely misleading and untrue”. Dos Santos has said she is the subject of a “a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack” led by Angola’s current president. The empire she and her husband control spans banking, diamonds, oil, telecoms, property, engineering and supermarkets in Angola and Portugal . The couple own a number of homes in London and she has in the past referred to the UK capital as her main family home. In January, the Luanda Leaks investigation revealed numerous schemes apparently used by Dos Santos and her husband to obtain Angolan state funds during her father’s presidency. The revelations were based on a leak of 715,000 files obtained from administrators of the Dos Santos empire, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with news groups including the Guardian, the BBC and the New York Times. Portugal is now the second country to have imposed a freeze on Dos Santos. In December, personal and corporate accounts belonging to her, her husband and a key adviser were frozen in Angola. Prosecutors say deals between the couple and state-owned businesses in the diamond and oil sectors harmed the state to the tune of $1bn. Angola is demanding compensation. The Angolan attorney general, Hélder Pitta Grós, reportedly requested the Portuguese seizure in a letter sent following a visit to Lisbon on 23 January, when he met with his Portuguese counterpart in order to request help with the prosecution against Dos Santos. “At the meeting in Lisbon between the attorneys general of Angola and Portugal, and following requests for cooperation, the freezing of Isabel dos Santos’s personal and company accounts was requested as part of the seizure process in Angola,” a spokesperson for the Angolan attorney general told O Jornal Económico , adding that that request “was formalised in a letter rogatory sent after the visit, where these steps by the Portuguese justice are requested.”.

O seu nome foi a votos na primeira reunião do novo conselho nacional da central sindical, tendo obtido 115 votos a favor entre os elementos deste órgão da central. Houve 25 votos brancos e um nulo. Minoritária, a corrente socialista tinha proposto como secretário-geral Fernando Gomes, mas, sem surpresa, Isabel Camarinha, da corrente comunista, foi o nome indicado pela nova comissão executiva para ir a votos no conselho nacional. Camarinha discursa ao final da tarde no encerramento do 14.º congresso da CGTP que decorre desde sexta-feira no Seixal. A sindicalista já fazia parte da comissão executiva desde 2016 — no segundo mandato de Arménio Carlos — e o seu nome foi sugerido para suceder ao anterior secretário-geral na reunião que este órgão teve na última segunda-feira , a última antes do congresso que começou ontem. Na mesma reunião do conselho nacional, que começou na noite de sexta-feira, foi ainda eleita a nova comissão executiva da CGTP, com 134 votos a favor e nove brancos. Isabel Camarinha, até agora presidente do Sindicato dos Trabalhadores do Comércio, Escritórios e Serviços de Portugal ( CESP ), considera uma honra ser a primeira mulher secretária-geral da CTGP, prestes a celebrar 50 anos. “A participação das mulheres tem vindo a aumentar no mundo do trabalho, portanto é natural que assumam funções diversas no movimento sindical”, destacou, citada pela Lusa, depois de conhecidos os resultados da votação. Além de Arménio Carlos, que sai de secretário-geral aos 64 anos ao fim de dois mandatos, deixam de pertencer à comissão executiva mais nove pessoas, entre os quais estão sindicalistas das várias correntes da Inter e nomes históricos. Saem Deolinda Machado, Graciete Cruz, Carlos Trindade, João Torres, Fernando Jorge Fernandes, Augusto Praça e Carlos João Tomás. Camarinha tem 59 anos e, como atingirá a idade legal da reforma num segundo mandato, tudo indica que será secretária-geral apenas durante quatro anos. Arménio Carlos fez um discurso de abertura do congresso marcando reivindicações que estão na agenda da CGTP e previstas no documento estratégico que está em discussão no congresso, chamado Programa de Acção. O anterior secretário-geral fez uma retrospectiva dos 50 anos da Intersindical, recordou os tempos da troika nos anos de Governo de Pedro Passos Coelho e a viragem para a negociação à esquerda no Parlamento. Criticou o executivo de António Costa pela “cedências” à direita e por não abdicar do excedente orçamental. E reforçou o posicionamento da CGTP na luta contra o empobrecimento dos jovens trabalhadores . Sem esquecer todos os que trabalham e “quem trabalhou”. tp.ocilbup@omotsosirc.ordep Sugerir correcção Leia os artigos que quiser, até ao fim.

Daily newspaper Publico denounced Andre Ventura's comments as \"abject\" in its editorial, after his attack on Joacine Katar Moreira, of the left-wing Livre (Free) party. Left-wing deputies have condemned his comments. Katar Moreira, who was born in Guinea Bissau, west Africa, had introduced a bill Tuesday calling for Lisbon to return works of art from Portugal's former colonies to their countries of origin. She suggested the authorities draw up a list of works of art that Portugal should hand back. Ventura, leader of the far-right party Chega (Enough), hit back on Facebook, writing: \"I propose that the deputy Joacine is herself sent back to her country of origin. It would be a lot better for everyone.\" Moreira is the Livre party's only deputy, and on Tuesday they denounced \"constant personal attacks of a racist nature\" against her. Other parties, including deputies of the ruling Socialist Party and the far-left Left Bloc also attacked Ventura's comments as racist. Ventura was elected to parliament last October, the first far-right deputy since the fall of the military regime in 1974 and the return of democracy. Since then, he has launched regular attacks on the black and Roma communities. Katar Moreira's proposal is similar to an initiative by the French government, which has begun returning works of art pillaged from its former colonies. French President Emmanuel Macron has called on other European countries to consider their position on the issue, including Belgium, Britain and Germany, as have a number of their former colonies. © 2020 AFP Advertising Most read 1 ‘Time to boycott all men’: The 4B movement going viral after Trump's victory EXPLAINER Americas 2 The bells of Notre Dame cathedral ring out for first time since 2019 fire Europe 3 Israeli police detain two French Consulate gendarmes in Jerusalem Middle East 4 Who are the key figures of Donald Trump's new inner circle?

Famílias querem indemnização de 900 mil euros\n\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nJosé Soares Campos alegou que “a morte do seu filho tinha sido causada pela falta de um enquadramento legal que regule as atividades de praxe nas universidades portuguesas e queixou-se de que a investigação às circunstâncias da morte do seu filho não tinha sido eficaz”.\nO TEDH concluiu que, com efeito, a investigação não satisfez os requisitos da legislação europeia e que “uma série de medidas urgentes podiam ter sido tomadas imediatamente após a tragédia”.\nPorém, o tribunal europeu não considerou que exista um vazio legal relativamente à praxe, uma vez que a legislação portuguesa inclui “provisões criminais, civis e disciplinares desenhadas para evitar, suprimir e punir ofensas que coloquem em risco as vidas das pessoas ou a sua integridade física ou psicológica”.\n“Reconhecendo a inegável natureza trágica do presente caso, o Tribunal não concluiu que o Estado tenha falhado as suas obrigações positivas à luz do Artigo 2 e por isso pudesse ser responsabilizado pela morte do filho do Sr. Soares Campos”, lê-se na nota divulgada pelo tribunal.\nO caso remonta a dezembro de 2013, altura em que Tiago Campos e outros seis estudantes da Universidade Lusófona se dirigiram à praia do Meco para uma praxe. Entre eles estava João Gouveia, o “dux” (líder da praxe), que acabaria por ser o único sobrevivente daquela noite.\nNa madrugada de 15 de dezembro de 2013, os seis estudantes que estavam a ser submetidos à praxe foram arrastados pelas ondas do mar, acabando por morrer. Os cadáveres foram encontrados nos dias seguintes.\nLogo a 16 de dezembro, após a descoberta do corpo de Tiago Campos, foi aberto um inquérito às circunstâncias da morte dos jovens, que viria a ser arquivado em julho de 2014.\nO caso seria reaberto em outubro de 2014, com o “dux” João Gouveia a ser constituído arguido, mas em março de 2015 o tribunal decidiu não enviar o caso para julgamento. O tribunal da Relação de Évora concordou: as vítimas eram adultas e não haviam sido privados da sua liberdade durante a praxe, pelo que não havia responsabilidade criminal sobre João Gouveia.\nEm 27 de maio de 2016, o pai de Tiago Campos apresentou uma queixa ao Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos do Homem com a alegação de que Portugal tinha violado o Artigo 2 da Convenção Europeia dos Direitos do Homem — o artigo que prevê o direito à vida.\nO pai de Tiago Campos e autor da queixa apresentada ao TEDH, José Soares Campos, disse à Rádio Observador estar contente por finalmente ver o seu lado reconhecido por uma instância de justiça.\n“Fiquei contente, porque alguma instância deu-nos razão a nós. Em primeiro lugar, tenho de dizer que isto é um processo de todos nós, não é só meu. Está o meu nome, mas é dos seis pais dos seis jovens que morreram. Estou feliz, mas triste ao mesmo tempo, porque tive de recorrer ao Tribunal Europeu, apresentar uma queixa contra o Estado, para que alguém independente me desse razão. Estava a olhos nus tudo o que se passou”, afirmou José Soares Campos.\n“Nós, pais, estamos há três anos à espera dos processos cíveis. Sempre disse que as pessoas estavam à espera deste veredicto. Porque os processos cíveis nunca demoram tanto tempo assim, três anos, mas é mais uma acha para a fogueira”, acrescentou.\nAinda assim, é pouco para as famílias. “Tudo o que está em causa, a morte de seis jovens, é muito pouco. Dá-nos algum alento para continuarmos, mas estamos há seis anos em sofrimento, e todas as provas que estavam evidentes no processo, todas elas foram destruídas. Só tenho de esperar pelos processos cíveis, para ver o que é que nos vai dizer o juiz.”\nNa nota de imprensa divulgada esta terça-feira, o tribunal sublinha que, “para uma investigação ser eficaz, as autoridades tiveram de dar todos os passos razoáveis ao seu alcance no momento para proteger as provas relacionadas com o incidente”.\nDepois de sublinhar que a investigação foi iniciada no dia seguinte à morte de Tiago Campos, o tribunal destaca que o Ministério Público devia ter tomado imediatamente pelo menos seis medidas urgentes:\nConsequentemente, o Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos do Homem concluiu que a investigação criminal à morte das vítimas não respeitou os requisitos procedimentais associados ao cumprimento do Artigo 2 da Convenção Europeia dos Direitos do Homem.\nRelativamente à outra parte da queixa de José Soares Campos — sobre o eventual “vazio legal” em relação às atividades de praxe —, o TEDH concluiu que a legislação portuguesa atual é suficiente para enquadrar crimes praticados contra a integridade física ou contra a vida, tenham ou não sido cometidos em contexto da praxe académica.\nO Estado português ficou agora condenado a pagar 13 mil euros de indemnização a José Soares Campos e ainda 7.188,51 euros relativos aos custos com o processo.\nEnquanto assinante, tem  para partilhar este mês.\nA enviar artigo...\nAinda tem  para partilhar este mês.\nO seu amigo  vai receber, nos próximos minutos, um e-mail com uma ligação para ler este artigo gratuitamente.\nPartilhe os seus artigos preferidos com os seus amigos.\n            Quem recebe só precisa de iniciar a sessão na conta Observador e poderá ler o artigo, mesmo que não seja assinante.\n        \n\n            Este artigo foi-lhe oferecido pelo nosso assinante .\n            Assine o Observador hoje, e tenha acesso ilimitado a todo o nosso conteúdo.

The suspension of classes encompasses all the education system from kindergartens to universities, both public and private, and will be in force until further evaluation on April 9. There are about 2 million school children in Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people. Costa also said cruise ships would not be allowed to disembark passengers except those residing in Portugal, night clubs will be shut and there would be capacity restrictions on entry to shopping malls and restaurants. “This is a fight for our very survival ... the government is determined to adopt every measure necessary,” Costa said. Portugal has so far reported 78 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, far below the 3,004 in neighbouring Spain where 84 people have died. Dozens of schools and various universities across Portugal have been shut for several days after tests revealed the virus in pupils or teachers. “The pandemic has not reached its peak. It is evolving and it is highly likely that in the coming weeks more people will be infected ... and it could be a more lasting outbreak than initially imagined,” Costa added. He did not announce any specific measures to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, which has already hit the hotel industry in the tourism-dependent Atlantic coastal country, but said the government would seek to support workers and incomes of those who will stay at home due to the shutdowns. Earlier on Thursday, Portugal’s AHP hotels association said the hotel sector could lose 30% to 50% of its revenues, or up to 800 million euros ($892 million), between March and June. Portugal attracts millions of foreign visitors annually, and the tourism sector, accounting for nearly 15% of gross domestic product, helped it recover from the 2010-14 debt crisis.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/Files Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Confirmed coronavirus cases in Portugal pushed past the 10,000 mark on Saturday, while government data showed more than half a million Portuguese workers were at risk of being temporarily laid off due to the outbreak. \"This fight is not a 100-meter (109.3-yard) race; it is a long marathon,\" Health Minister Marta Temido told a news conference, urging citizens to step up their fight against the outbreak as there was still \"no light at the end of the tunnel.\" \"This is the time to balance fear and courage, courage to stay home, to continue helping others, to ask for help when we need it,\" Temido said. Portugal has confirmed 10,524 coronavirus cases and 266 deaths, with health authorities expecting the outbreak to plateau at the end of May. Portugal extended its state of emergency by 15 days on Thursday, and tightened measures to restrict movements, especially during the normally busy Easter holiday period. Portugal's once-bailed out economy is struggling to cope with the outbreak despite several government measures to help families and businesses, including a multi-billion euro stimulus package. The central bank said last week the country would relapse into recession this year, with gross domestic product dropping between 3.7% and 5.7% in 2020. Last year it grew 2.2%. In a statement on Saturday, the Labour Ministry revealed that 31,914 Portuguese companies, mostly micro and small businesses with a total staff of 552,000, had already applied to be able to lay off their workers since the measure was reviewed a week ago. The measure allows companies to temporarily suspend jobs or reduce working hours but does not let them fire or make workers redundant. According to the ministry, most layoff requests were made by businesses in the hospitality industry, as well manufacturing firms and auto repair businesses. This year, the unemployment rate is set to increase to between 10.1% and 11.7%, compared with 6.5% in 2019, the central bank said. Around 321,000 people were unemployed in March, compared to 293,000 the month before, preliminary data by the Labour Ministry also showed on Saturday. \"We still don't have a significant increase in unemployment,\" Labour Minister Ana Mendes Godinho told SIC television. \"Many companies are opting for layoffs instead.\" Reporting by Catarina Demony, Editing by Christina Fincher and Richard Chang Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Ukraine attacks Moscow with 34 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital 2:47 PM UTC ANALYSIS Kamala Harris' Michigan loss highlights Democrats' weak spots 11:56 AM UTC Middle East category Dozens killed and wounded in Israeli strike in northern Gaza, medics say 3:54 PM UTC · Updated  ago United States category Republicans on brink of clinching US House control after taking Senate 1:17 PM UTC World Five killed in Turkish drone strikes on PKK members in northern Iraq Middle East category · November 10, 2024 · 4:01 PM UTC ·  ago Turkish drone strikes killed five members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan's counter-terrorism service and security sources said on Sunday.

Until now, many Neanderthal sites had shown only small-scale use of marine resources; for example, scattered shells. But now archaeologists have excavated a cave on the coast of Portugal and discovered a huge, structured deposit of remains, including from mussels and limpets, dating to between 106,000 and 86,000 years ago. Researchers say the discovery shows that Neanderthals systematically collected seafood: in some layers the density of shells was as high as 370kg per cubic metre. They say this is exciting because the use of marine resources on such a scale and in such a way had previously been thought to be a trait of anatomically modern humans. View image in fullscreen The cave on the coast of Portugal that was found to contain evidence of Neanderthals’ use of food from the sea. Photograph: Zilhao et al./Science Prof João Zilhão, of the University of Barcelona, a co-author of the report, said the discovery added to a growing body of research suggesting modern humans and Neanderthals were very similar. “I feel myself uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens too,” he said. “Not only was there extensive interbreeding, and such interbreeding was the norm and not the exception, but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks.” The findings chime with recent evidence that Neanderthals had “surfers’ ear” and may have dived to collect shells for use as tools . Previous finds in Spain have shown they decorated seashells and were producing rock art 65,000 years ago. “Forget about this Hollywood-like image of the Neanderthal as this half-naked primitive that roamed the steppe tundra of northern Europe hunting for mammoths and other megafauna with poor and inefficient weapons,” said Zilhão. “The real Neanderthal is the Neanderthal who is in southern Europe.” The discovery appears to throws cold water on the idea that the marine-rich diet of modern humans, high in fatty acids, helped them to outcompete Neanderthals as a result of better cognition. “If [marine foods] were important to modern humans, then they were important for Neanderthals as well – or perhaps they did not have the importance people have been attributing to them,” said Zilhão, noting that in any case few modern humans were living by the coast. Writing in the journal Science , researchers reveal how the newly excavated site, which was about 2km or less from the coast when occupied by Neanderthals, contained a plethora of stone tools, roasted plant matter and remains from horses and deer, as well as from eels, sharks, seals, crabs and waterfowl, suggesting a diverse diet. View image in fullscreen Shells found in the cave, the largest of which is 5cm across. Photograph: Zilhao et al./Science Zilhão said the find also shed some light on Neanderthal fishing practices, noting that they must have had baskets or bags. “You cannot walk 2,000m with a catch of 10 or 20 kilos of shells in your hands,” he said, adding that the Neanderthal population also probably understood that shellfish collected at the wrong time could be toxic. The team say the dearth of other huge shell deposits in Europe could be down to a lack of preservation: shellfish could not be transported far from the coast, and hence many such deposits in northern Europe would have been destroyed as polar ice caps advanced, while elsewhere they may have been submerged as the sea rose to today’s levels. The stretch of Portuguese coast where the new find was made is perhaps the only location locally where such deposits could have been preserved, they say. South Africa, by contrast, experienced an uplift of the land, meaning many such deposits have been preserved. Dr Matthew Pope, a Neanderthal researcher at the UCL Institute of Archaeology who was not involved in the study, said its findings were significant. “We have increasingly recognised the sophistication of Neanderthal behaviour, but one thing that continued to mark out the behavioural evolution of modern humans in Africa was the appearance of systematic collection of marine resources, and this marked a difference between the two populations,” he said. “Evidence like this is important in showing Neanderthal populations had the capability for systematic exploitation of marine resources.” Explore more on these topics Neanderthals Anthropology Evolution Archaeology Portugal news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World US elections 2024 UK Climate crisis Ukraine Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak spread further into Portuguese care homes over the Easter weekend, with 100 new cases of COVID-19 reported in a single residence and care homes accounting for around one in eight of the country's 504 deaths. The death toll and 16,585 recorded cases are still a small fraction of the numbers in neighbouring Spain, but officials fear the disease could spread rapidly through care homes as it has in other parts of Europe. Eighty-three residents and 17 staff at a home for people with physical and mental disabilities in the northern town of Vila de Conde tested positive for coronavirus, the home's director Rui Maia told radio station Renascenca on Sunday. The majority are asymptomatic, Maia said, with just one hospitalised. Twenty-seven residents from a home for the elderly in the northern district of Aveiro were hospitalised with symptoms on Saturday. Last weekend, 15 residents in another home in the same area who had tested positive for the virus died. The labour minister said earlier this week that 61 of the people with COVID-19 who had died across Portugal were care home residents. No further care home deaths from the disease have been reported since. The government announced on 30 March that tests were to be made available to all care workers and suspected cases in homes across the country, but the distribution is still underway. Over 3,000 people have volunteered to assist in care homes as part of a programme launched on Monday, president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said on Friday. A hotel in Lisbon hosting 93 guests was evacuated on Saturday after three tested positive for the new coronavirus, news agency Lusa reported, with the remaining 90 re-housed in another hotel. Priests across the Catholic country broadcast Easter mass from empty churches to people's homes online on Saturday night and Sunday morning amid tight travel restrictions during the Easter period. The government closed all airports to commercial flights and banned domestic travel from April 9-13, urging people not to visit family in other areas. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said on Friday he would propose extending a national lockdown, currently in place until April 17, to May 1. Authorities emphasised that the country's low case toll did not mean restrictions could be eased quickly. In neighbouring Spain, the death toll has reached 16,972, with confirmed cases at 166,019. \"What happens in one European nation affects others,\" health minister Marta Temido told a news conference on Sunday. \"Our expectation of returning to normality has to be tempered until we have a vaccine,\" she said. \"We are a long way from beating this pandemic.\" Reporting by Victoria Waldersee; editing by Philippa Fletcher Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Ukraine attacks Moscow with 34 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital 2:47 PM UTC ANALYSIS Kamala Harris' Michigan loss highlights Democrats' weak spots 11:56 AM UTC Middle East category Dozens killed and wounded in Israeli strike in northern Gaza, medics say 3:54 PM UTC · Updated  ago United States category Republicans on brink of clinching US House control after taking Senate 1:17 PM UTC World Five killed in Turkish drone strikes on PKK members in northern Iraq Middle East category · November 10, 2024 · 4:01 PM UTC ·  ago Turkish drone strikes killed five members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan's counter-terrorism service and security sources said on Sunday.

Senior Socialist lawmaker Ana Catarina Mendes deemed the move \"hard but necessary\". Portugal has confirmed 9,034 coronavirus cases and 209 deaths, with health authorities expecting the outbreak to plateau at the end of May. Government measures to bolster the finances of families and businesses during the outbreak include support for salaries of workers whose jobs are on hold and credit lines for hard-hit industries like tourism, textiles and agriculture. Still, lawmakers in Thursday's debate appealed to companies and the financial sector to step up their support for families and businesses, with opposition leader Rui Rio stating it would be an \"embarrassment\" if banks posted profits in 2020 and 2021. \"Banks owe a lot to the Portuguese. Now it is their obligation to help,\" he said. \"They must not benefit from this crisis.\" Left-wing parties Left Bloc and Communist Party flagged that some workers were still being made to come to the office and many were losing their jobs despite government promises to prioritise keeping people in employment. \"We cannot allow the state of emergency to be a pretext for a law of the jungle in the lives and rights of workers,\" said Communist lawmaker Joao Oliveira.

Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras Eduardo Cabrita: houve “negligência grosseira e encobrimento grave” do SEF na morte de ucraniano Ministro anunciou mudanças no centro do aeroporto. Haverá reforço de vigilância e todas as salas terão câmaras de vídeo. As inquirições aos imigrantes serão gravadas. Joana Gorjão Henriques 8 de Abril de 2020, 12:14 Partilhar notícia Partilhar no Facebook Partilhar no WhatsApp Partilhar no Messenger Partilhar no Twitter Comentar Partilhar no Messenger Partilhar no LinkedIn Partilhar no Pinterest Enviar por email Guardar Comentar Alertas Foto LUSA/MÁRIO CRUZ O ministro da Administração Interna, Eduardo Cabrita, disse nesta quarta-feira que “jamais” esteve no Parlamento “por uma situação que mais contrariasse os valores essenciais  do Estado democrático\": a morte do ucraniano Ihor Homenyuk naquele Centro de Instalação Temporária (CIT) do Aeroporto de Lisboa, alegadamente por três inspectores do Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF) que o agrediram até à morte, segundo o mandado de busca que os constituiu arguidos na semana passada. Os três homens de 42, 43 e 47 anos estão em prisão domiciliária com pulseira electrónica. ​ “Não é o Portugal que conhecemos e de que nos orgulhamos nesta matéria”, referiu. O ministro disse não poder responder a algumas questões que têm que ver com o processo de investigação ao homicídio, mas não teve pudor em classificar aquilo que aconteceu, administrativamente no SEF, como “negligência grosseira e encobrimento grave”, que “terá consequências”. “Cabe à IGAI [Inspecção-Geral da Administração Interna] apurar as circunstâncias”, perceber o que ocorreu na manhã de 12 de Março, e no intervalo até à “consumação do seu falecimento”, nomeadamente “o que não foi feito e que pudesse ter levado a evitar, independentemente de erros graves e faltas inaceitáveis, este resultado extremo”. No mandado de detenção refere-se que um dos inspectores tinha um bastão que terá sido usado para agredir Ihor Homenyuk. O ministro foi peremptório ao afirmar que os bastões não são permitidos àqueles agentes. “Partilho da vossa indignação e da vossa angústia. Não deixarei de fazer tudo para que algo similar jamais se volte a repetir.” Eduardo Cabrita anunciou mudanças no CIT, que foram pedidas ao novo director do SEF Lisboa, Fernando Silva, e que poderão passar por acompanhamento “mais eficaz” pela Ordem dos Advogados (OA) dos imigrantes aos quais foi recusada entrada no país. O CIT, que acolhe os imigrantes a quem foi barrada a entrada e requerentes de asilo, está fechado até 30 de Abril. A OA emitiu, aliás, um comunicado na quarta-feira à tarde onde considera que as circunstâncias em que ocorreram esta morte devem ser investigadas de forma exemplar até às últimas consequências”. Algumas dessas mudanças são o reforço de vigilância e todas as salas passarão a ter câmaras de vídeo; as inquirições aos imigrantes serão gravadas; haverá uma “bolsa de intérpretes”. Além disso, os requerentes de protecção internacional vão “deixar de entrar” no CIT. “Serão reforçados os mecanismos de auditoria e segurança por entidades externas”, revelou. Em preparação, para ficar pronto no fim do mês, estará um novo regulamento, que será submetido à apreciação da provedora de Justiça. Eduardo Cabrita esteve esta quarta-feira n uma audição pedida pelo Bloco de Esquerda , na Comissão de Assuntos Constitucionais, Direitos, Liberdades e Garantias , presidida por Luís Marques Guedes (PSD). Referiu que o SEF instaurou imediatamente uma averiguação interna depois da morte do cidadão ucraniano. A deputada do BE Beatriz Gomes Dias chamou a estes locais “ offshores de impunidade” e fez várias perguntas ao ministro, nomeadamente sobre as mudanças no centro. Os deputados interrogaram Cabrita sobre várias questões relativas a esta morte mas também ao próprio funcionamento do centro do SEF. Segundo as informações que Cabrita obteve, foi no dia 17 de Março que o SEF transmitiu à IGAI e ao MAI a existência de uma morte, indicando que tinha decorrido na sequência de um ataque cardíaco. Transmitiu também que a certidão de óbito “refere paragem cardiorrespiratória, assinada por médico do INEM”. “Tenho conhecimento de que não é assim na manhã de 30 de Março no momento das detenções da PJ, sob coordenação” do Ministério Público, afirmou. Cabrita referiu ainda que, segundo o que sabe, Ihor Homenyuk chegou a Portugal a 10 de Março e foi sujeito aos “mecanismos de controlo normais”. Tendo chegado com visto de turista, mas confirmando-se que a sua intenção era trabalhar, foi deportado — mas recusou-se a entrar no avião que o levaria de volta. O ministro referiu o que diz o relatório do SEF e que o PÚBLICO já noticiou na semana passada, nomeadamente que Ihor foi encaminhado para o Hospital de Santa Maria depois de um ataque de epilepsia. Na sequência deste caso, e depois da detenção dos três inspectores pela Polícia Judiciária, foi demitida a direcção de fronteira de Lisboa do SEF (António Sérgio Henriques era director de Fronteiras e Amílcar Vicente, subdirector). O MAI anunciou que pediu à IGAI a abertura de um inquérito à direcção e ao funcionamento do CIT e a abertura de processos disciplinares ao director e subdirector de Fronteiras de Lisboa, bem como a todos os envolvidos nos factos. Na audição, Cabrita defendeu a direcção nacional do SEF dizendo que esta colaborou com todas as diligências que levaram à detenção dos arguidos pela PJ. Centro criticado por várias instituições internacionais Há anos que o CIT do aeroporto é criticado por várias instituições internacionais e nacionais e pela própria provedora de Justiça. Uma das grandes críticas tem sido a existência de crianças num espaço com capacidade para 58 pessoas e onde não há privacidade. Na sequência deste caso, a provedora de Justiça disse ao PÚBLICO que era “urgente” a criação de alternativas ao SEF do aeroporto — a provedora lembrou que em 2018 recebera denúncias de maus tratos e que as reportou ao SEF. Até agora, nem o SEF nem o MAI responderam à questão do PÚBLICO sobre qual tinha sido o desfecho dessas denúncias. Em entrevista ao PÚBLICO na altura, Maria Lúcia Amaral referiu-se ao CIT como um “ no man's land ” contemporâneo. Aliás, de acordo com documentos a que o PÚBLICO teve acesso, estavam menores no CIT na altura em que Ihor terá sido assassinado. Segundo o mandado de detenção, os três arguidos entraram na sala, algemaram o homem de 40 anos atrás das costas, amarraram-lhe os cotovelos com ligaduras, deram-lhe socos e pontapés e usaram ainda um bastão, “enquanto aos gritos lhe exigiam que permanecesse quieto”. Era 12 de Março, pelas 8h15. Foram 20 minutos, interrompidos por “alguns vigilantes”, a quem terão ameaçado — “Isto aqui é para ninguém ver” — e a quem terão dito “agora ele está sossegado” e “isto, hoje, já nem preciso de ir ao ginásio”, lê-se no mandado. A autópsia revelou a gravidade das agressões que Ihor sofreu: tinha múltiplas costelas partidas, os arguidos ter-se-ão sentado em cima dele, esmagando-lhe o tórax contra o solo, a caixa costal estava partida, o que lhe provocou dificuldades em respirar e posterior asfixia. Havia ainda marcas no corpo das bastonadas e dos pontapés. O seu óbito foi registado às 18h40, mais de dez horas depois do início da agressão. O motivo da morte evocado pelo SEF foi ataque cardíaco, em sequência de uma crise “de epilepsia”. Mas o médico legista que analisou o corpo percebeu que não podia ter sido essa a causa e alertou a Polícia Judiciária. O relatório do INEM diz que Ihor foi encontrado em “paragem cardiorrespiratória após crise convulsiva”. Na ficha do Instituto de Medicina Legal refere-se que o corpo foi encontrado na via pública, uma ficha que o mandado de detenção diz ter sido preenchida por um inspector. tp.ocilbup@hgj Sugerir correcção Leia os artigos que quiser, até ao fim.

FILE PHOTO: Portugal's Primer Minister Antonio Costa speaks during a news conference on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at Ajuda palace in Lisbon, Portugal March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo “What matters in this new phase is that the Portuguese know that containment remains important so we must take small steps and constantly evaluate,” he told a news conference. Portugal has reported 24,322 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 948 deaths, while in neighbouring Spain more than 23,000 people have died. The country declared a state of emergency on March 18 when the death toll was just two, with around 642 confirmed cases. It has conducted 370,000 coronavirus tests since March 1, one of the highest testing rates worldwide. Even before the state of emergency was imposed, the government closed schools and nightclubs, banned gatherings of large groups, suspended flights to Italy and halted tourism with Spain. Some restrictions will remain in place, Rebelo de Sousa said. “The end of the state of emergency is not the end of the outbreak, it’s not the end of control,” he said. The full plan will be announced on April 30. Newspaper Publico reported on Sunday that small neighbourhood shops will reopen on May 4, while childcare centres and big shopping malls will open on June 1. On April 18, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said he hoped to relax restrictions on schools, stores, restaurants and cultural spaces from May but to do so would require new rules to keep people safe. There may also be limits on the number of people visiting beaches, usually crowded during the summer, Costa said. At the time, he said it was not yet clear when events, such as music festivals, could take place but that cinemas might reopen sooner under new restrictions. Portuguese football league matches might be able to go ahead but behind closed doors or only allowing season ticket holders to attend matches. Costa said on Monday the widespread use of protective equipment would be essential as the economy reopens and people start leaving their homes. The pandemic is set to leave lasting scars on Portugal’s once bailed-out economy. The International Monetary Fund predicted the country’s gross domestic product will contract by 8% this year.

Efforts had been underway to move Rally Portugal to the end of October, potentially slotting in between Rally Germany and Rally GB, but a statement from the Automovel Club de Portugal issued on Thursday revealed these plans have now been abandoned. It becomes the second round to be cancelled outright after Rally Chile, which was scratched off the calendar due to social unrest in the country late last year. The ACP's statement read: \"After a joint assessment together with our partners, the various municipalities, national authorities and sponsors, all health and safety conditions needed to run the WRC Vodafone Rally de Portugal in a safe way are not achievable given the unpredictable situation that we live in these days, and also the uncertainty of opening the national borders or airspace. \"Due to this critical situation, the Automovel Club de Portugal is forced to cancel the Portuguese round of the 2020 FIA World Rally Championship. \"The Automovel Club de Portugal deeply regrets this decision. But it is the responsible decision bearing in mind the thousands of supporters, teams, municipalities, sponsors and all the people involved in the event, that was responsible in 2019 for an economic impact in the national economy of more than €142million.\" It added that the ACP has already applied for Rally Portugal to be given its usual May date on next year's WRC calendar. The opening three rounds of this year's schedule have been completed, although last month's Rally Mexico was cut short by a day in order to allow teams to return to Europe safely at a time of growing uncertainty surrounding international travel. As things stand, the Safari Rally in Kenya is due to be the next round of the 2020 WRC season on 16-19 July.

The total number of cases in the country reached 25,351, up 306 from a day earlier, DGS said. The number of recovered cases increased from 1,519 to 1,647, while that of people hospitalized dropped from 968 to 892. Meanwhile, the number of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) decreased from 172 to 154. Minister of Health Marta Temido said that the fatality rate in Portugal is at around 4 percent, but 14.2 percent in people over 70 years old. \"The numbers are still above what we would like but are much more controlled than they were 15 days ago,\" the minister said, adding that Portugal is now more \"ready\" to reopen slowly. Movement of people out of their own city is prohibited during the Labor Day holiday from Friday to Sunday. The country will start on Monday the reopening of businesses and services, as it moves to ease the lockdown measures imposed to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic since the declaration of the state of emergency on March 18.

This measure was taken, according to the ministry, to encourage the production of materials considered essential to control the novel coronavirus, such as visors, masks and alcohol gel. \"The non-repayable support of Portugal 2020 regional operational programs was extended to 108 million euros, aimed at companies that converted their production to respond to the challenges of the pandemic,\" the ministry said in a statement. Investments were made through the Norte 2020, Centro 2020, Lisbon 2020, Alentejo 2020 and CRESC Algarve programs, which are part of an incentive system for productive innovation and finance around 440 projects. According to official data, so far contracts have been signed with 195 production initiatives, which allocated 40 million euros (around 44.5 million dollars) from European funds, including the Portugal 2020 program (PT 2020), a partnership between Portugal and the European Commission. In addition, a program to support scientific research in the fight against the pandemic was launched, which is projected to invest 13 million euros (nearly 14.5 million), of which 3 million euros (around 3.3 million U.S. dollars) have already been allocated to 18 research projects. Portugal has reported a total of 32,700 cases and 1,424 deaths from COVID-19, with 14 new deaths and 200 more cases recorded over the last 24 hours, the health authorities said.

Issued on: 03/06/2020 - 16:11 Sergio Conceicao led Porto to the top of the Primeira Liga before play was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. MANUEL ARAÚJO/LUSA By: Paul Myers Follow Advertising Read more The battle between Porto and Benfica for the crown has been a familiar sight in Portuguese football for the best part of 20 years. Since Sporting hoisted the 2002 Primeira Liga, Porto or Benfica have lifted the title and before the season was suspended as part of Portugal's fight to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the duo had broken away from the pack. FC Braga were third, 13 points behind Benfica when professional sports were shut down in the country. The resumption in Portugal comes three weeks after the German Bundesliga became the first major European league to restart after the coronavirus lockdown. England’s Premier League, Spain’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A are all expected to relaunch their championships within the next three weeks. Legal fight But as those three leagues contemplate a comeback, three French clubs plan to ask judges to overturn the decision to end the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 season in April Amiens and Toulouse were both relegated when the Ligue de Football Professional declared the 2019/20 championship over while Lyon lost the chance to push for a place in next season’s European competitions. They will take their grievances to the Conseil d’Etat on Thursday. “What we’re arguing against is the change of rules while the competition is underway,” said Guillaume Tapie, who heads Amiens’ legal team. “According to the rules, relegation comes after the 38th match and not before. You don’t declare one team the winner after 66 of the 90 minutes,” he added. Lyon wants the resumption of matches. A decision from the Conseil d’Etat is expected within a week by which time the Bundesliga will have played its fourth round of games since its restart. Those games have gone ahead behind closed doors and teams have had to follow strict health measures. Similar medical protocols will apply in Portugal. Health chiefs suggested the matches should take place in a handful of stadiums. But that proposal was rejected and 16 of the 18 Primeira Liga clubs will play at their own grounds. Santa Clara, a club based on the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean will use the national team's training complex near Lisbon along with Belenenses.

That success has helped reassure international markets and other European countries that Portugal is no longer a threat to the continent’s financial stability.\nIt also earned Centeno election as chief of the eurogroup meetings of eurozone finance ministers. His term there is due to end next month.\nCenteno asked to leave and will be replaced by Secretary of State for the Budget Joao Leao, Prime Minister Antonio Costa told a news conference in Lisbon.\nCosta said Leao will oversee “continuity in (the government’s) policies.”\nJoao Leao has been part of Centeno’s team at the finance ministry since Centeno took office in 2015. He is set to take office on June 15.\nCenteno declined to say at the news conference what prompted his resignation and what his plans are.\nCenteno, a graduate of Harvard Business School, is widely expected to take over as governor of the Bank of Portugal.\nPortugal’s budget deficit stood at 0.2% of GDP last year, the lowest in more than four decades. The deficit fell from more than 11% in 2010, the year before it needed an international bailout of 78 billion euros. The financial discipline helped Portugal’s center-left Socialist government silence critics who feared the country would return to lax fiscal practices.\n\n\nBut signs of tension between Costa and Centeno had emerged in recent months, especially over another cash injection into a failed bank and over a post-pandemic economic recovery plan which Centeno reportedly wasn’t consulted about.\nCenteno’s departure was announced after the Cabinet approved a rejigged version of the 2020 state budget to take into account an economic downturn triggered by the new coronavirus pandemic.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Under the Portuguese Constitution, the other two levels are \"state of emergency\" and \"state of calamity\". On May 3, Portugal downgraded its coronavirus response to \"state of calamity\" from \"state of emergency,\" which was declared on March 18 and renewed twice, on April 2 and April 16. The downgrade \"does not mean to resume normality...we have to keep the rules,\" Costa said in a statement at the end of a Council of Ministers meeting. Costa said the downgrade will be possible because Portugal is experiencing a \"stable scenario\" in the rate of COVID-19 transmission and \"there was no significant increase in new cases.\" The exception will be the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon, which will move to the \"state of contingency\", an alternative level generally used in cities level, which is an intermediate state prescribed by the Basic Law of Civil Protection. Portugal registered six more deaths from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 1,549, in addition to 311 new infections, reaching 40,415 confirmed cases since the beginning of the pandemic.

EL PAÍS Carlos E. Cué Madrid - Jul 01, 2020 - 15:36 CEST Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Linkedin Copy link The border between Spain and Portugal was officially reopened on Wednesday in a ceremony led by Spain’s King Felipe VI and the president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The Spain-Portugal border, which is informally known as “la raya,”or the line, was closed for an unprecedented three and a half months due to the coronavirus crisis , which led to the imposition of strict travel restrictions. Its reopening is a symbolic sign that the worst of the crisis is now over. Both Spain and Portugal, however, continue to record new outbreaks of the coronavirus. In Spain, there are around 50 active outbreaks , all of which are considered under control; and in Portugal, parts of Greater Lisbon have reintroduced lockdown restrictions following a spike in cases. The border opening between two countries is not a threat, but rather an opportunity for common development Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa Before the ceremony, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez apologized to his Portuguese counterpart António Costa for having to maintain his distance. “Sorry António, but I can’t give you a hug,” he said to the Portuguese prime minister, who like Sánchez, belongs to a socialist party. King Felipe also apologized to De Sousa for not being able to shake his hand. “The border opening between our two countries is not a threat, but rather an opportunity for common development,” said Costa. “We all have to be very clear that until there is a vaccine we are going to have to live with Covid. That is the reality for Spain, Portugal and the rest of the world.” The first act took place in the Spanish city of Badajoz, inside its old Moorish citadel, the Alcazaba, where people had gathered to cheer in support of the monarchy. Protesters, however, were also present and called for “royal spending for schools and hospitals.” This act was followed by a ceremony at the castle of Elvas in Portugal. Portugal and Spain introduced extraordinary measures to curb coronavirus contagion at almost the same time. But while Portugal imposed a state of emergency before recording a single death, in Spain, 535 people had died from Covid-19 by the time the state of alarm was introduced. Portugal has been one of the countries which has best controlled the spread of the coronavirus, and the closure of its borders with Spain has played an important part of its strategy. Indeed, Portugal has taken the most cautious approach to reopening its borders of all countries in the European Union. While EU countries began opening up their borders from June 21 , Portugal decided to wait until July 1 in a bid to reduce outbreaks. The reopening of the Spain-Portugal border comes in time for the summer holiday period, when many Spanish tourists travel to beaches in the neighboring country for vacation. Safety measures Spain will ask all tourists to complete health forms before traveling to the country in order to make it easier to locate their contacts in the case of a contagion. That’s according to an order published in the Official State Gazette (BOE) on Wednesday. These forms will ask travelers for their contact address in Spain, previous travel experiences, and whether they are suffering from coronavirus-related symptoms in a bid to prevent imported cases. The order also stipulates that travelers will be subject to document and temperature controls when they arrive in Spain. The new order comes after the European Council formerly agreed on Tuesday to an initial “safe list” of 14 countries from which they will allow non-essential travel from July. The countries are Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. China will also be included if it reciprocates by allowing in EU travelers. The document is intended as a recommendation to ensure that EU members only allow the entry of residents from countries considered safe and promise not to unilaterally authorize entry from a nation that is not on the list. The list will be updated every two weeks to either add or remove countries based on their epidemiological situation . The Italian government, however, has indicated that it will maintain strict restrictions on travelers from outside the EU. With borders opening, Spain’s airport authority AENA announced that it had 1,482 flights scheduled for Wednesday – 743 arrivals and 739 departures. This is a sharp drop from last year’s figures, when 6,500 flights were scheduled for the same day. English version by Melissa Kitson .

Danilo opened the scoring for Juventus in the sixth minute when a corner found him unmarked on the edge of the box, and the defender drilled a powerful shot through a cluster of bodies into the net. Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga and Serie A top scorers 2019-20 Read more Juve appeared to be in control when Gonzalo Higuaín made it two six minutes later after latching on to a superb ball from Miralem Pjanic. The hosts have been in swashbuckling form, though, and a fine strike from Filip Djuricic on the half-hour started the comeback. Roberto De Zerbi’s side drew level early in the second half when Domenico Berardi curled a beautiful free kick inside the near post. Three minutes later the hosts were ahead, Francesco Caputo stealing in at the far post to steer in a wayward Berardi shot. Just after the hour mark, Juve were back level as defender Alex Sandro headed home from a corner. Maurizio Sarri’s side then pushed for a winner but Cristiano Ronaldo was kept quiet by the home defence. Instead, Sassuolo almost won it – but Wojciech Szczesny denied Mehdi Bourabia in stoppage time. The draw means Juventus have not won in their last three league games, conceding nine goals, but they are still seven points ahead of Atalanta. Lazio missed the chance to reclaim second spot and cut the gap to the top as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Udinese . Rodrigo De Paul struck the post late on for the hosts, but Lazio avoided a fourth straight defeat. Milan remain on course for a Europa League place after beating Parma 3-1, coming from behind to win for the fourth game in a row. Alberto Grassi set up Jasmin Kurtic to put the visitors in front at the San Siro, before Franck Kessié equalised after 55 minutes with a 25-yard rocket.

Calhanoglu added Milan’s third in the 77th minute.Stefano Pioli’s side moved level on points with Napoli , who were held to a 1-1 draw at Bologna . Kostas Manolas headed in an early opener, but Musa Barrow’s fifth goal in six games earned the hosts a point. Jordan Veretout and Edin Dzeko were on target in the first half for Roma in their 2-1 win over Verona , while Federico Bonazzoli scored his second acrobatic volley this week as Sampdoria beat Cagliari 3-0. Patrick Cutrone was on target for Fiorentina as they won 3-1 at relegation-threatened Lecce . Porto beat Sporting to win Primeira Liga Porto have won their 29th Portuguese title after second-half goals from captain Danilo Pereira and striker Moussa Marega earned a 2-0 home win over Sporting . View image in fullscreen Porto players celebrate in style despite the lack of fans at their home ground. Photograph: Miguel Riopa/AFP/Getty Images The hosts dominated the opening half, with Luis Díaz having his goal disallowed for handball and Sebastián Coates clearing the Colombian’s shot off the line. Jovane Cabral then headed over the bar from close range for the visitors with 34 minutes gone. Porto went ahead in the 64th minute as Danilo got ahead of his marker at the near post and headed home from Alex Telles’ corner. In stoppage time, Marega finished a fast counter-attack in style to kick-start the title celebrations. Sérgio Conceição’s side had expected a tight title battle with Benfica after they resumed the season just a point ahead at the top. But their fierce rivals have won just three of their eight games, allowing Porto to wrap up the title with two games to spare. They will face Benfica in the Cup final on 1 August.

As Portugal's consul in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes faced a moral dilemma. Should he obey government orders or listen to his own conscience and supply Jews with the visas that would allow them to escape from advancing German forces? Sousa Mendes' remarkable response means he is remembered as a hero by survivors and descendants of the thousands he helped to flee. But his initiative also spelt the end of a diplomatic career under Portuguese dictator AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar, and the rest of his life was spent in penury. It was not until 1986 that Sousa Mendes was reinstated posthumously into the diplomatic service. Finally, on 9 June, Portugal's parliament decided to recognise its disobedient diplomat with a monument bearing his name in the National Pantheon. Why Bordeaux? It was mid-June 1940 and Hitler's forces were days from completing victory over France. Paris fell on 14 June and an armistice was signed just over a week later. Portugal's diplomatic corps was under strict instruction from the right-wing Salazar dictatorship that visas should be issued to refugee Jews and stateless people only with express permission from Lisbon. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Salazar (far left) kept Portugal neutral during World War Two For those thronging Bordeaux's streets hoping to cross into Spain and escape Nazi persecution there was no time to wait. \"We heard the French had surrendered and the Germans were on the move,\" says Henri Dyner. He was three, but retains vivid memories of his Jewish family's flight from their home in Antwerp, as Nazi Germany attacked Belgium and invaded France and the Netherlands. \"What I remember is the sound of the bombing, which must have woken me, and my mother telling me it was thunder. Image source, Hulton Deutsch Image caption, The Nazi bombardment of Belgium began in May 1940 \"My parents turned on the radio and heard King Leopold telling Belgians we had been betrayed and attacked by the Germans. My father had been suspecting there could be a war since 1938. He had a plan, and a car,\" Mr Dyner, now a retired engineer living in New York, told the BBC. Eliezar Dyner, his wife Sprince and five other relatives, including a seven-month-old baby, drove away from the bombing and into France. \"My father avoided big roads, gave Paris a wide berth and stuck to the coast. He wanted to be only 10 miles ahead of the front all the time, because he thought it could be a quick war and why go too far when you might have to go back?\" After seeing German warplanes strafing French trenches and hearing the news of successive German victories, Henri's father realised by the time they reached Bordeaux there would be no return to Antwerp any time soon. Moral crisis and nervous breakdown In Bordeaux, the consul had struck up a friendship with a rabbi. Chaim Kruger had also fled the Nazi advance from his home in Belgium. Consul Sousa Mendes offered the rabbi and his immediate family safe passage across the Spanish border, but then suffered a \"moral crisis\", according to historian Mordecai Paldiel. Kruger refused the offer, as he could not abandon the thousands of other Jewish refugees in Bordeaux. Image source, Courtesy Sousa Mendes Foundation Image caption, Rabbi Chaim Kruger told the consul (R) he could not accept a visa and leave thousands of others behind In a letter dated 13 June 1940 Sousa Mendes wrote: \"Here the situation is horrible, and I am in bed because of a strong nervous breakdown.\" \"No-one really knows what went through his mind in those two or three days,\" says Dr Paldiel, who ran the Righteous Among the Nations department at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre for 25 years. \"Some say the duty of a diplomat is to obey orders from above, even if those instructions are not moral. \"Later on, in Lisbon, Sousa Mendes told a rabbi this: 'If so many Jews can suffer because of one Catholic, it's all right for one Catholic to suffer for many Jews.' He was talking about Hitler, of course.\" 'No more nationalities' Whatever did go through the diplomat's mind, Sousa Mendes emerged on Monday 17 June with a new determination. According to his son, Pedro Nuno de Sousa Mendes, \"he strode out of his bedroom, flung open the door to the chancellery, and announced in a loud voice: 'From now on I'm giving everyone visas. There will be no more nationalities, races or religions'.\" For Henri Dyner and his family, this was a lifesaver. Image source, Courtesy Sousa Mendes Foundation Image caption, Henri Dyner before his family fled Belgium By chance Henri's mother knew the consul from his time in Antwerp, where she was a secretary at the British consulate. The Dyner family had already tried and failed to obtain visas from US, British and Canadian authorities to leave France. Before his breakdown, Sousa Mendes had put them on a list in a request sent to the Salazar government. \"My mother recalls that he disappeared for a couple of days, and when he came out, his hair had gone grey,\" says Henri Dyner, who remembers queues of refugees outside the consulate in Bordeaux and camping in squares. \"My mother actually began to work for Sousa Mendes those days, helping with this kind of production line of visas all down a long table. Sousa Mendes saved our lives.\" Did Portugal's dictator Salazar order killing of rival? Turning Portuguese after centuries of exile Last witness to France's cheerleaders for the Nazis France's last Resistance hero from World War Two Corridor to Spain No-one knows for sure how many transit visas were issued, allowing refugees to pass from France into Spain and travel onward to Portugal. But estimates range between 10,000 and 30,000, and most sought to cross the Atlantic to a variety of American destinations. The US-based Sousa Mendes Foundation has identified some 3,800 recipients of these visas. Image source, Keystone/Getty Image Image caption, Refugees rushed desperately to cross into Spain as the Nazis advanced As if possessed with a sense of mission, the consul even signed visas on the road as crowds in Bordeaux began to form a human column southward towards the border town of Hendaye. He stopped at the consulate in Bayonne to issue more papers. The foreign ministry in Lisbon began sending cablegrams to Bordeaux, ordering him to desist, amid reports from colleagues that he had \"lost his senses\". Spanish authorities declared his visas invalid, but thousands had already made it across the Bidasoa river into Spain's Basque region. Who got out? Eventually, Sousa Mendes reported to his bosses in Lisbon on 8 July. Among those who escaped occupied France thanks to his visas were surrealist artist Salvador DalÃ­, filmmaker King Vidor, members of the Rothschild banking family and the majority of Belgium's future government-in-exile. Image caption, Henri Dyner returned to the \"bridge of freedom\" on the French-Spanish border Salazar's Portugal would later be praised for its role in allowing refugees to escape from Nazi occupation and repression, but Sousa Mendes was expelled from the diplomatic corps and left without a pension.

He died in misery as a pauper, and his children emigrated to try to find a future somewhere else,\" says Henri Dyner. Henri's family ended up in Brazil, before he moved to the US for professional reasons. But he remembers a man who had courage in his convictions. \"The way things are in the world today, we need more people prepared to stand up for what is right and take a stand.\" Who was Aristides de Sousa Mendes? 1885: Born into a well-to-do Portuguese family. He was an \"outgoing bon vivant\" and had 15 children, says grandson Gerald Mendes Salazar's decision to strip him of his job and pension \"condemned (him) to live the rest of his life in the most absolute misery\", he says Sousa Mendes survives thanks to a soup kitchen run by Lisbon's Jewish community 1954: He dies in obscurity, still disgraced in the eyes of Portugal's government 1966: Yad Vashem recognises him as Righteous Among Nations 1986: Posthumously awarded Order of Liberty 1988: Portuguese parliament posthumously withdraws disciplinary charges against him.

Canada, the USA, China and Thailand were also excluded from the “amber” and “green” lists of countries to which English holidaymakers can fly and avoid quarantine on their return to the UK from Friday July 10. Among those included on the lists were short-haul destinations such as Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Croatia and Cyprus, as well as long-haul locations including Australia, Barbados, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Vietnam. However, Portugal, where the Algarve is rated the third most popular European holiday spot for Britons, was left off because of a recent spike in Coronavirus cases in and around Lisbon. Portugal's foreign ministry said in a tweet it was \"absurd\" that Britain imposed quarantine on travellers coming from Portugal despite having 28 times more deaths from the coronavirus. Travellers can visit these 59 countries \"We hope that this decision, which seems to us profoundly unfair and wrong, from the British authorities is corrected as soon as possible,\" said Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva. \"It is a sad moment in bilateral relations because countries that are friends treat each other differently.\" João Fernandes, Algarve Tourism Board president, pointed to the low rate of the disease in his region, accounting for just 0.5 per cent of national cases. “We are talking about a country that is safe, which in May was referred to as an international example even by the United Kingdom itself.” The three million Britons who travel to Portugal - a traditional trading partner of the UK - account for nearly a fifth of all its tourists. The USA, Brazil, Sweden and Russia were also left off the list because of their comparatively high Coronavirus rates, which risked importing cases into the UK. On Friday Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the USA was not included as \"they have got very high numbers of infections\", despite the threat of a backlash from Donald Trump’s administration. The US already bans people entering the country from the UK and Europe. However, Greece, which Mr Shapps suggested only yesterday morning was not on the exempt lists, was included despite its suspension of flights from the UK until July 15. Sources suggested inter-Government talks had secured their resumption in 11 days. Some of the countries with the lowest rates of Covid-19 and rated “green” will continue to impose restrictions on Britons despite the UK lifting quarantine on them. These include Australia and New Zealand, which have effectively closed their borders and are expected to continue to remain shut until Christmas, Malta, Cyprus, Hungary, Barbados, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. Travellers to Ireland will also be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK as it is part of the Common Travel Area. But the Irish Government has indicated it expects to impose 14-day quarantine on Britons from July 9 when it opens its borders to a “green list” of overseas countries because of the UK's higher Covid-19 rate. Countries rated “amber” like France, the Netherlands, which had imposed quarantine on the UK, and Greece, are understood to have agreed, or be close to agreeing, reciprocal deals which will lift restrictions for holidaymakers on both legs of their journeys. Should quarantine plans be scrapped On Saturday the Foreign Office will update its advice against all but essential overseas travel for all of the 74 countries and territories. It technically means that foreign holidays will be possible for the first time in more than three months from Saturday although people would need to spend at least six days at their destination to avoid the need to quarantine when landing back in England. Passengers will still be required to provide contact information on arrival in England. Anyone self-isolating because they have arrived or returned from a green or amber country before July 10 will be able to stop from that date. The Department for Transport (DfT) said risk assessments were conducted by the Joint Biosecurity Centre in consultation with Public Health England and the chief medical officer, considering each country's prevalence of coronavirus, the number of new cases and the potential trajectory of the disease. Approved destinations pose \"a reduced risk to the public health of UK citizens\" but the list will be kept \"under constant review\", the DfT said. It means new destinations could be added to the “green” and “amber” lists before the next review date later this month, or removed if there is a major surge in coronavirus. Such outbreaks which would lead to the immediate reintroduction of quarantine for holidaymakers returning to the UK. In tandem, the Foreign Office lifted its ban on non-essential travel on a further fourteen countries because of the reduced risk from Coronavirus since it imposed the restrictions at the height of the pandemic. Ironically, this included Portugal but also Canada, with which the UK was unable to agree a deal to lift its tough restrictions on foreign visitors including those from Britain. Others included Slovakia, Slovenia, Thailand and Singapore, which have low rates of Coronavirus but which also impose tough quarantine or other curbs on international arrivals. People resident in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not part of the scheme because the UK Government was unable to convince the devolved administrations to sign off on the plan before it was made public. It descended into recriminations yesterday with political leaders of the administrations accusing the UK Government of chaotic last-minute changes to the lists and a lack of consultation. Scotland's First Minster Nicola Sturgeon said the UK Government's decision-making on air bridges had been \"shambolic\".   She said: \"When so much is at stake as it is right now we can't allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of, to be quite frank about it, another government's shambolic decision process.\" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakefordsaid dealing with the UK Government over the last few days was \"an utterly shambolic experience.” The three administrations will announce within days whether they will adopt the English plan or seek unilaterally to impose quarantine on their own country’s holidaymakers, a move that police said was unenforceable and aviation leaders warned could seriously damage the economy. There was even confusion last night when the DfT initially published its list of countries without its traffic light system of red, amber and green labels for destinations - then announced it would be doing so but only on an informal basis. The requirement for everyone arriving into the UK - bar a handful of exemptions - to self-isolate for 14 days was introduced on June 8. It was met with fierce criticism over the impact on the UK's travel, tourism and hospitality industries including a high court action. On Friday British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet announced they were dropping their legal action against the blanket quarantine. “The blanket quarantine was irrational and has seriously damaged the economy and the travel industry. Today’s publication of a list of countries is a first step. We look forward to the continued lifting of the quarantine from safe countries,” they said. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, yesterday backed one of the central contentions of the airlines’ claims. “Our advice has been clear that quarantine makes most sense and can be used effectively when people are coming from different countries with higher infection rates than the ones we have here and that’s where quarantine is a measure that would make a difference,” he said. A spokesman for trade association Airlines UK said: \"There's no doubt quarantine has had a devastating impact on our industry and whilst it's welcome the Government has removed its blanket ban, we would encourage rigour and science is applied in all future decisions surrounding our businesses.\" Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency and member of the Quash Quarantine campaign group, said: \"There are still several obstacles to be overcome, namely ensuring Scotland support the planned changes. But this is a welcome boost for the travel industry at such a critical time.\" Join the conversation Show comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

(AP Photo/Armando Franca)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLISBON, Portugal (AP) — At the Bairro do Zambujal housing project on the outskirts of Lisbon, the behavior of residents offers clues to why this part of Portugal has become a hot spot for new COVID-19 cases and how government efforts to stamp out the new coronavirus are being frustrated.\nA lot of people in the project that houses about 6,000 people disregard the recommendation from authorities to wear masks, says Maria Felicidade Nunes, president of the local residents’ association. \nSome local stores don’t heed rules on how many customers can be inside at one time. Young people huddle in large groups at local cafes, she says.\n“Some people are OK with the rules, but others just don’t accept them,” Nunes told The Associated Press.\nThe four- and five-story apartment blocks that make up Bairro do Zambujal provide low-cost housing for low-income families. They commonly house large families who escape their homes to hang out with local friends and relations.\nThe project lies in the Amadora district, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown Lisbon. It is one of five outlying zones in the Lisbon metropolitan area where the number of new virus cases has continued to climb while other parts of Portugal and Europe have seen theirs go down in recent weeks. \nFor Portugal, the spate of new infections is the elephant in the room as the government touts the country as a safe place for lockdown-weary Europeans to visit. \n\n\nBy moving quickly during the pandemic’s early days, Portugal avoided the exponential rates of infections and deaths reported by other European Union countries, including neighboring Spain.\nBut since emerging on May 2 from a state of emergency and 45-day lockdown, the country has recorded an average of 275 new cases a day. On Thursday, it reported 311 — 222 of them in the Lisbon metropolitan area.\nThe tally has shot the country of 10.3 million people to a place among the European countries with the most new infections. It has an overall incidence rate of 390 per 100,000 inhabitants. \n“It’s not a cause for alarm, but it’s obviously something to be concerned about,” said Dr. Ricardo Mexia, president of Portugal’s National Association of Public Health Doctors.\n“Some Lisbon hospitals are close to capacity,” Mexia told the AP, noting that outside the Lisbon region there are plenty of available hospital beds.\nOn average, around 70%-80% of the new confirmed cases reported daily are being detected in satellite towns, like Amadora, surrounding the Portuguese capital. Experts say a significant number of new infections are being discovered among low-income families. \nSome men kept working in construction and women used public transportation to reach jobs in the service industry even during the lockdown. They often can’t afford to stop working because they don’t have contracts and won’t get paid if they don’t turn up. \nHealth authorities have also identified nursing homes as incubators for outbreaks, largely due to staff bringing in the virus, as well as impromptu night-time gatherings of young people in parks and on beaches.\nFrustrated at being unable to extinguish the hot spots through aggressive testing, tracing and isolation, the Portuguese government on Thursday stepped up its response, reintroducing restrictions in 19 of the 118 parishes in the Lisbon metropolitan area identified as problematic. They are among the most densely populated parts of the metropolitan area, which encompasses almost 3 million people.\nA five-person limit on gatherings is being brought back in those parishes from July 1, and inhabitants can leave home only to go to work, shop, practice sports or help needy family members. Stores will have to close at 8 p.m.. \nConsuming alcohol outdoors is banned along with the sale of alcohol at gas stations, where young people often buy. More police are to patrol the streets and ensure that people wear masks inside stores. People gathering in groups of more than five face individual fines of up to 500 euros ($560).\nThe government argues that the relatively high number of new cases being discovered is due to its testing effort, with an average of 98,000 tests performed a week, and rejects suggestions that the outbreak is running out of control. Officials also note in Portugal’s defense that its COVID-19 mortality rate is relatively low, in European Union terms, at 149 per million inhabitants.\nFurthermore, the government points out that the country’s hospitalization rate for the coronavirus, at 2.9% of those infected, means that the public health service has coped with the outbreak. Overall, Portugal has reported just over 40,400 confirmed cases and 1,524 deaths.\nBut for Mexia, the doctors’ association president, the fault lies in authorities’ “excessive confidence” after Portugal avoided a dramatic number of cases in March and April. That overconfidence, he says, led to inadequate planning for anticipated outbreaks, including not having enough qualified workers to run contact tracing. \nA lot is riding on whether authorities can now make up for lost time and get a grip on the resurgence. Portugal’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism, and the government has marketed the country as open for business. \nMany hotels along the Algarve coast’s alluring beaches sport a government-sponsored “Clean&Safe” seal to reassure tourists. Officials trumpeted the recent selection of Lisbon to host the finals of European soccer’s elite tournament in August as a vote of confidence in Portugal — evidence, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said, that “Portugal is a safe destination.”\n“The problem right now,” wrote Ricardo Costa, editor of Expresso newspaper, on Tuesday, “is that some of the numbers contradict the (official) narrative of success, which is all about attracting tourists.”\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The train was travelling north from Lisbon to Braga, with scheduled stops in the cities of Coimbra and Porto. However, at about 15:30 (14:30GMT) it crashed into a railway maintenance machine in the town of Soure. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said that he offered \"his condolences to the families and friends of those killed\" in this \"serious accident\". The country's national relief operations authority CNOS told Reuters news agency that emergency services were at the scene. A spokesman said there were 163 rescue personnel, including firefighters, and two medical helicopters. There were 240 passengers on board the Alfa Pendular train, which is the fastest in Portugal, they said. A witness told Portuguese newspaper DiÃ¡rio de Noticias that there was panic inside the train at the time of the crash. \"I thought I was going to die,\" they said. \"The carriage took about 10 or 15 seconds to stop. People were screaming and lying on the ground. Then the carriage started to fill with dust. \"We were stuck inside the carriage, because the doors were destroyed. Someone managed to break one of them and we started to get out and help other people get out.\" Top stories Nation falls silent as King leads Remembrance ceremony Published 1 hour ago Six D-Day veterans pay tribute on poignant Remembrance Day Published 25 minutes ago Live .Â Trump and Netanyahu see eye to eye on Iran, Israeli PM says More to explore Hologram in Amsterdam window aims to solve sex worker's cold case murder Strictly's Chris McCausland praised for 'poignant' blackout dance imitating blindness 'My father never, ever talked about the war' Remembrance: Why do we wear poppies?

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal reported no coronavirus-related deaths on Monday from a day earlier for the first time since mid-March, when a lockdown was put in place, and the lowest number of new infections in almost three months. “It has been very difficult in recent times - we are very happy this happened,” the secretary of state for health, Antonio Sales, said as he teared up during a news conference. “I want to leave this message of hope to the Portuguese but I want to ask them to help us maintain these numbers,” he said. Portugal’s total confirmed cases rose by 106 from Sunday to 51,569, with 62% of new infections reported in and around Lisbon, where localised outbreaks on the outskirts have worried authorities for the past two months. The death toll remained unchanged at 1,738. The country, heavily dependent on tourism, began lifting restrictions imposed during a six-week lockdown on May 4 and was initially hailed as a success story in its fight against the disease. But the outbreaks around Lisbon forced the government to reinstate some measures in affected areas, and led several European nations, including Ireland, Belgium and Finland, to impose travel restrictions on Portugal. Portugal was also left off a list of dozens of countries Britain considered safe enough for travel without having to quarantine upon return. The need for holidaymakers returning to Britain from Portugal to quarantine for 14 days has particularly affected the Algarve, a region popular for its beaches and golf courses.

But first they have to eliminate four teams. Share full article Lisbon’s Estádio da Luz, the home of Benfica, will host this year’s Champions League final. Credit... Mario Cruz/EPA, via Shutterstock By Tariq Panja Published June 17, 2020 Updated Aug. 10, 2020 It will be the Champions League , but not like any version before it. Three months after it was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Champions League took its first concrete steps toward returning on Wednesday when officials from European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, announced that the competition would be completed as an eight-team knockout tournament in August in Portugal. Many details for the event, from the lineup of teams that will play to the health protocols to keep players and staff members from contracting or spreading the coronavirus, have not been finalized. All plans and procedures are subject to change. UEFA’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said he did not see a reason for a Plan B yet, and noted the organization was assessing the situation daily. At the moment, UEFA does not expect fans to be allowed into any of the games — per government limits on public gatherings — which could create a situation in which the tournament’s final stages, which are traditionally some of the most high-stakes, highest-rated and most emotional matches in club soccer, take place without their customary pageantry. In many ways, the challenge for UEFA, the tournament’s organizer, has been greater than that faced by any of the domestic sports championships that have recently resumed or are making plans to do so. Unlike the Premier League or the N.B.A., UEFA had to find a way to restart a partly finished international competition in which some teams had advanced further than others, and to complete it amid ongoing restrictions on cross-border travel and strict quarantine rules. The solution? A 12-day, one-and-done Champions League featuring eight teams that will be played in two stadiums in Portugal’s capital, Lisbon, and culminate in a final on Aug. 23 at Benfica’s Estádio da Luz.

John Phillips/Getty Images Nearly 50% of Brazilian doctors said they felt pressured by patients or their families to prescribe medicines for Covid-19 treatment, despite not having scientific evidence showing the drugs are effective, according to a survey released Sunday by the Medical Association of Sao Paulo State (APM). The APM surveyed 1,984 doctors across the country online and by phone between June 25 and July 2. According to the survey, misinformation about the effectiveness of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, both promoted by President Jair Bolsonaro, has interfered in coronavirus treatment. What are the findings: The survey shows that 49.8% of doctors said they have felt pressure from patients or family members to prescribe drugs without proof of its effectiveness; 50.4% of them said information about the drugs being shared on social media conflicts with scientific findings, leading to some patients questioning decisions made by health professionals. It also found that 69.2% of the doctors say encouraging the use of medicines without scientific support leads patients to treat the disease lightly, refuse to follow self- isolation rules and hygiene measures, and not to seek treatment by the appropriate health services. The Sao Paulo state-based APM is the biggest regional association of doctors of Brazil with 72,500 members, according to its website. The organization is an affiliate of the Brazilian Medical Association, which represents 350,000 physicians around the country. Link Copied!

One local infection was also found in Beijing, and the remaining local cases were found in Liaoning. On Tuesday, China also recorded a further 27 asymptomatic infections, which are not included in the tally of confirmed cases. This is the first time China has reported more than 100 new infections in a single day since April 12, when the country reported 108 new cases – most of which were imported. It is the third consecutive day China has reported the highest daily spike in local infections since early March. Link Copied! Colombia extends lockdown as mayor says eradicating the virus is \"impossible\" in the country From CNN's Stefano Pozzebon in Bogota, Colombia Bogota Mayor Claudia López Hernández. CNN Colombia will extend social distancing measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus through August 30, President Ivan Duque said Tuesday. It comes on the day the country reported its highest daily increase in new Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began. “The lockdown is extended through August 30, but in those cities with low Covid rates we are going to continue to partially reopen various economic sectors,” Duque said in his daily coronavirus briefing in Bogota, the country’s capital. This comes as the mayor of Bogota Claudia López Hernández told CNN Tuesday that eradicating the virus in Colombia “is impossible.” “Countries like ours, in Latin America, we must learn to mitigate the virus rather than suppress it,” Hernández told CNN. “In our situation, aiming to eradicate the virus is impossible.” The lockdown has been implemented nationwide in Colombia since March 25 to various degrees. Local administrators can apply specific lockdown measures in each city, as Colombia has pushed for a localized approach that sees only the most affected areas under strict quarantine, while large parts of the nation can operate freely. Colombia’s borders are currently shut until September 1. Colombia saw a highest daily spike of 10,284 new cases Tuesday, bringing its total confirmed cases to 267,385, according to the health ministry. At least 9,074 have died from the coronavirus in the country. Link Copied!

Redfield prepares to testify at a Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing on manufacturing a Coronavirus vaccine on Capitol Hill on July 2, in Washington. Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images The United States was slow in recognizing the coronavirus threat from Europe, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, admitted for the first time Tuesday in an interview with ABC News. “The introduction from Europe happened before we realized what was happening,” Redfield said. “By the time we realized (the) Europe threat and shut down travel to Europe, there was probably already two or three weeks of 60,000 people coming back every day from Europe,” he added. “That’s where the large seeding came in the United States.” Redfield also admitted that there have been problems with the federal response. “Yes, there’s been mistakes,” he said. “And, yes, we fail. We’re in it doing the best we can and we’re trying to make the best judgments we can.” He also said he’s optimistic that the country can get the upper hand in the battle against coronavirus. “I wish now we would come together and recognize and see the possibility that we can beat this pandemic,” he said. “We’re not powerless. We don’t have to wait for a vaccine, although I think we’re going to be successful sooner than many people think. We have the most powerful weapon in our hands right now, I mean it’s an enormously powerful weapon. It’s just a simple, flimsy mask,” Redfield said. “This virus can be defeated if people just wear a mask.” Link Copied!

Brazilian health ministry says it expects coronavirus vaccine distribution by end of December From Rodrigo Pedroso in São Paulo Brazil’s health ministry said it expects to start the distribution of 15.2 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca experimental vaccine against Covid-19 at the end of December if trials prove the vaccine is safe. According to Secretary of Health Surveillance Arnaldo Correia de Medeiros, the first batch of the vaccine should arrive in Brazil in the second week of December. The secretary did not specify where the vaccine would be coming from. “If the studies are successful, we will start the vaccination campaign in December,” Medeiros told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil Tuesday. Another 15.2 million doses are expected to arrive in the country in January and another 70 million doses of the vaccine should come between March and April. The secretary also said the elderly would be the first group to receive the vaccine. The vaccine purchase agreement with Oxford/AstraZeneca has not yet been signed by the Brazilian government. The health ministry informed CNN that negotiations of technical items regarding production and the technology transfer are still in discussion.

Birx sounds alarm for \"yellow zone\" states on Pence's call with governors From CNN's Betsy Klein White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx listens to President Donald Trump speak during a news conference about his administration's response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic at the White House on July 23 in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx on Tuesday provided some dire warnings for states that are in the task force-defined “yellow zone” for cases and test positivity, which she said are different from outbreaks across the country earlier this year. On a call Tuesday with Vice President Mike Pence and several governors, she said there has been “significant improvement” in “red zone” states Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona following orders to close bars, decrease indoor dining, and require the use of masks. The task force defines its “red zone” states as more than 100 cases per 100,000 people and more than 10% test positivity. But she said there are still rising cases and test positivity in other “red zone” states: Mississippi, Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia, Oklahoma, Georgia, Idaho, and Arkansas. Birx said “yellow zone” states, which the task force defines as having between 10 and 100 cases per 100,000 and 5-10% test positivity, have had a similar profile to “red zone” states: “Starting with the 20 to 30 year-olds presenting as a first wave.” “Remember, the majority of those are asymptomatic so if you expect to see hospitalizations, by the time you see hospitalization, your community spread is so widespread that you’ve flipped into a red state incredibly quickly,” Birx said. She said the task force is working with governors and mayors in the following places: Colorado, the District of Columbia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minneapolis, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, Ohio, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. The task force, Birx said, is talking with these places “about increasing mitigation efforts now because if we wait until increased hospitalizations it is really way too late. Because what we are experiencing now is really different than March and April, it’s very different from the outbreaks of May that was typically contained. This widespread community spread in the younger age group both rural and very urban and urban areas so by the time you see it up to 80-90% of your counties already have more than 10%.” Birx expressed concern for major metros like Chicago and Philadelphia, as well as California’s Central Valley, and applauded Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey’s mask mandate, which she said is having a “significant impact.” Pence reiterated that the administration does not want another closure — something, he said, “We don’t ever want to see again,” but pointed to studies that show that the use of masks, bar closures, limiting outdoor dining, and limiting social gatherings are having similar effect as sheltering in place earlier this year. He recommended governors in “yellow zone” states “take a hard look” at those four measures “whether it be on a county-by-county basis or a statewide basis.” “We’ll support your decision, but I think your big message to these states that may be emerging is don’t wait,” Pence said. Link Copied! Oregon issues new guidelines for reopening schools From CNN’s Andy Rose Oregon issued new guidelines Tuesday for when schools can bring kids back into the classroom. The guidelines will be based on how widespread Covid-19 is in the state. “Today in Oregon, we’re not where we need to be to reopen schools,” State Health Officer Dr. Dean Sidelinger said in a news conference. However, the state is offering districts a number of exceptions to allow children up to third grade in some counties to get in-person learning, while older children remain at home and are taught online. “This school year will not look like any other school year,” Gov. Kate Brown said. For schools that do allow students in the classroom, state guidelines require daily screenings for all children and staff. A school that is able to reopen would have to close again if its county’s positive test rate for coronavirus reaches double digits for a full week. “Opening school to in-person instruction is not a one-way journey,” said Colt Gill, deputy superintendent of public instruction. The state is devoting an additional $28 million of CARES Act funding to help schools pay for more digital learning. Link Copied!

Trump defends viral video with false coronavirus claims From CNN's Allison Malloy President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on Tuesday. Evan Vucci/AP President Trump defended his tweets in support of hydroxychloroquine saying that the drug is still “very positive” and called a doctor who was spreading conspiracy theories on Covid-19 in a now deleted video “very impressive.” When discussing the video that he retweeted Monday night featuring a group of doctors making false claims related to coronavirus , Trump said the thought were “very respected doctors.” “There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it and she’s had tremendous success with it. And they took her voice off — I don’t know why they took her off but they took her off. Maybe they had a good reason, maybe they didn’t,” he said. The video, published by the right-wing media outlet Breitbart News, featured a group of people wearing white lab coats calling themselves “America’s Frontline Doctors” staging a press conference in which one speaker who identifies herself as a doctor makes a number of dubious claims, including that “you don’t need masks” to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and that recent studies showing hydroxychloroquine is ineffective for the treatment of Covid-19 are “fake science” sponsored by “fake pharma companies.” When challenged on these claims by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Trump demurred saying, “She was on air along with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine and I thought she was very impressive in the sense that…she said she has tremendous success with hundreds of different patients and I thought her voice was an important voice but I know nothing about her.” Trump shared multiple versions of the video — which was deleted by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube — with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night despite the claims running counter to his own administration’s health experts. When pressed by Collins on this fact, Trump abruptly ended the news conference. But Trump once again stuck by his defense of hydroxychloroquine, telling reporters about his tweet: “I wasn’t making claims. It’s recommendations of many other people including doctors.” “I think it’s become very political. I happen to believe in it. I would take it — as you know I took it for a 14 day period. I’m here — I happen to think it works in the early stages. I know frontline medical people believe that too, some, many.” “It’s safe, it doesn’t cause problems. I had no problem,” Trump said adding, “It didn’t get me and it’s not going to hopefully hurt anybody,” Trump added. A study found that neither hydroxychloroquine alone nor hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin appeared to affect the condition of patients at the 15-day mark. Additionally, unusual heart rhythms and elevated liver-enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin, according to the study.

Alex Wong/Getty Images President Trump says his relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci is “very good” but wonders why the doctor’s approval rating is so high when his is so low. Speaking a day after he retweeted a message claiming Fauci had misled the public, Trump chalked up his own sinking numbers to his personality. But he said Fauci’s broad respect should transfer to the Trump administration — for whom Fauci works. “I get along with him very well and I agree with a lot of what he’s said,” Trump insisted. “It’s interesting: he’s got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it’s good,” the President went on. “Because remember: he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn’t have to be Dr. Fauci. He’s working with our administration. And for the most part we’ve done what he and others — and Dr. [Deborah] Birx and others — have recommended.” Trump continued: “And he’s got this high approval rating. So why don’t I have a high approval rating with respect — and the administration — with respect to the virus? We should have it very high.” “So it sort of is curious,” Trump said, “a man works for us, with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx also, very highly thought of — and yet, they’re highly thought of, but nobody likes me?” “It can only be my personality, that’s all,” he concluded.

Connecticut governor announces more than $43 million program to support virtual learning From CNN's Kristina Sgueglia Connecticut Gov. Ted Lamont speaks during Tuesday's news conference. WFSB Connecticut Gov.

Lamont said the funding is coming from the state’s portion of the federal CARES Act, as well as state emergency relief funds. It will be used to purchase 50,000 laptops for students, 12 months of internet access for 60,000 students, and creating free hotspots at 200 sites statewide. “In order to support remote learning needs for our learners, we need to make sure they are connected,” Connecticut Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona said in the statement. “Addressing the digital divide has become our priority since a device and connection are no longer luxuries. Once connected, they must also have access to high quality content to promote learning and social emotional development.” Link Copied! Trump to use Defense Production Act to turn Kodak into a pharmaceutical company From CNN's Nikki Carvajal President Donald Trump speaks during his White House news conference on Tuesday. Evan Vucci/AP President Trump said his administration will use the Defense Production Act to turn Kodak into a pharmaceutical company, an announcement he called “one of the most important deals in the history of US pharmaceutical industries.” “With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak pharmaceuticals,” the President said at a news conference. Trump called it a “different field” for the company known mostly for its cameras and film, saying they had “hired some of the best people in the world.” “It’s a breakthrough in bringing in pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States,” Trump said. Some context: The move is the 33rd time the Trump White House has used the DPA after facing criticism for not enacting it earlier in the pandemic. “Remember when you were saying I didn’t use it enough, I didn’t use it enough?” he asked reporters rhetorically, “and now you heard it’s the 33rd use. We don’t talk about it all the time, we used it and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren’t doing as we were asking them to do, and it came through as both a threat and a usage. But this is our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act.” The company will produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, Trump said, “using advanced manufacturing techniques Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost competitive and environmentally safe will be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries.” Watch more: Link Copied!

Pence touts \"encouraging trends\" in Sun Belt states From CNN's Betsy Klein Vice President Mike Pence arrives at Miami International Airport on Monday. Wilfredo Lee/AP Vice President Mike Pence held another weekly governors call Tuesday, the focus of which ranged from school reopening to vaccine development to what he described as “encouraging trends” in states experiencing rising cases. Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Robert Redfield, Dr. Stephen Hahn, Adm. Brett Giroir, and Pete Gaynor were also on the afternoon call. Pence touted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “very strong position” on returning to schools. “Virtually every governor on this call has already published plans to safely reopen their schools in whole or in part, and I just want you to know we are here to partner with you to effectuate that,” Pence told the governors in opening remarks, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. Redfield, Pence said, would address CDC recommendations to get kids physically back into classrooms. Pence said the task force is “beginning to see encouraging trends” in Sun Belt states with rising cases, praising the governors of Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California for their mitigation efforts, and calling their situations “a good learning opportunity for states that may see emerging positive cases.” He said he spoke with Florida Gov.

Flu vaccines are shipping to doctors' offices, but it's too soon to get one From CNN’s Maggie Fox A man gets a flu shot in Washington, DC, in January. Eva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images At least two companies that make influenza vaccines have started shipping them out to doctors’ offices, pharmacies and other customers in the United States, but it’s too soon for people to think about getting one. GlaxoSmithKline said Tuesday it started shipping some of the more than 50 million vaccines it expects to supply for this US flu season. Sanofi Pasteur, another pharmaceutical company, said last week it also started shipments for the US market, but did not say how many doses it expected to make. Why this matters: US health officials say it will be more important than ever to get a flu vaccine this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. It will be hard enough for hospitals and doctors to deal with one fast-spreading and potentially deadly respiratory virus, let alone two. Plus, no one knows what might happen if people get infected with both viruses at the same time. Because of this, Glaxo and Sanofi both say they are increasing their production to meet the expected growth in demand. “GSK expects to supply more than 50 million doses of its influenza vaccines for the US market in the 2020-21 season, an increase from the 46 million it distributed during the 2019-20 influenza season,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. But people will need to wait to get vaccinated. “While vaccine shipments to healthcare providers have begun, getting vaccinated in July or August is too early, especially for older people, because of the concern that protection may be reduced if there is too much time between when a vaccination is given and peak flu season. According to CDC, September and October are good times to get vaccinated. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue, even in January or later,” Sanofi said in its statement. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says while it takes two weeks for a flu vaccine to take full effect, people should not get one in summer. “Getting vaccinated early (for example, in July or August) is likely to be associated with reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu season, particularly among older adults,” the CDC says. The CDC recommends that just about everyone over the age of 6 months get a flu vaccine every year. The vaccine formulation changes from year to year to try to match the regular mutations of the virus and the changes in what’s circulating. Link Copied!

The governor’s office issued guidelines in early July outlining for spaces like hotels to be used for temporary student housing to allow colleges the time and space to properly handle social distancing in light of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re also working with the state on contract tracing efforts in partnership with all of our colleges along with testing,” Walsh said, emphasizing that these two elements will be “their most powerful tool in ensuring that the transmission rates remain low.” Walsh said he’s meeting with several college presidents to discuss their opening plans and many of them have been planning different scenarios.

Cooper said there have been at least 1,820 deaths in the state since the start of the pandemic. Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, said today is the highest day of statewide hospitalizations, but hospital space is still available. North Carolina has averaged around 29,000 tests per day over the past week. Cohen said North Carolina is seeing a direct correlation with the start of the statewide mask mandate and the stabilizing of trends in the state. “Seeing glimmers of potential progress does not mean we can let up, it means it’s time to double down,” Cohen said.

His remarks came just before Major League Baseball announced multiple postponements of upcoming games out of an abundance of caution after multiple Miami Marlins tested positive for Covid-19. “They [Miami Marlins] should follow the medical protocol,” Giménez said at a briefing. “If somebody’s been exposed, just like any other person, they need to be tested and self-quarantine for a while, that’s the normal protocol, that’s what we would ask them to do.” “I would assume that they would follow the medical protocols and I would assume they also follow the law unless they have some kind of exemption,” he added. The mayor said he doesn’t see how MLB teams will be able to contain the spread of the virus among their ball clubs if players are allowed to go back into the community after their games. Giménez thinks the National Basketball Association has “the right formula” by putting teams in an enclosed environment, often referred to as a “bubble,” in which the participants live, practice and play all games. He also doesn’t expect the county to suffer additional economic hardship if the Marlins’ season were to get postponed. “There’s no fans, so it’s all TV revenue,” Giménez said. “As far as the county is concerned, it has minimal impact on the county.” “They still owe us the rent, whether they play or they don’t,” he added.

Trump keeps seeking out unproven theories, even as aides try to shift focus back to the pandemic From CNN's Kevin Liptak President Donald Trump wears a face mask Monday as he tours the Bioprocess Innovation Center in Morrisville, North Carolina. Evan Vucci/AP Even as President Trump’s aides attempt to shift his focus back to coronavirus, the President continues to hear from a wide range of associates — including the CEO of a far-right television network — who are undermining the administration’s health experts and questioning their approach to the pandemic, people familiar with the conversations say. While Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci are speaking again after going more than a month without meeting, the President is also hearing from outside allies and even some inside the administration who have offered him competing advice and sometimes bad information, worrying some of his advisers who had once hoped to turn a page in the coronavirus response. Trump also continues to hear steady criticism of Fauci, who has resumed making television appearances after weeks off the national airwaves — earning him more irritation from Trump, according to the people familiar. The competing voices spilled into public view when Trump retweeted a message late Monday critical of Fauci that claimed the infectious disease expert had “misled the American public on many issues.” Fauci appeared hours later on ABC to say he would continue doing his job, despite the President’s attacks. A series of events earlier on Monday illustrated the dueling stream of voices influencing Trump as the outbreak continues to rage across the nation: A vaccine meeting: Midday, Fauci and others gathered in the Oval Office to update Trump on the 30,000-person phase three trial launched by Moderna. Trump later told reporters it was a “great meeting” and participants walked away believing the President was sincere in his efforts to convey more leadership on the outbreak. While the meeting focused almost exclusively on the vaccine trial, and not on Trump’s response to the virus more broadly, it seemed to participants like the President was engaged — unlike some previous meetings that became detailed with unrelated topics and complaints. A trip to North Carolina: But as the day progressed, Trump heard from several others who reinforced a different message than the one being offered by the administration’s health experts. His hawkish trade adviser Peter Navarro — who published an op-ed in USA Today last week trashing Fauci without running it past the White House but was never formally reprimanded — traveled alongside Trump to North Carolina, where the President broke with health experts by calling on governors to reopen. “I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening,” Trump said, countering the advice being offered by Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx for states to rethink how they are listing restrictions. A talk with an executive of a far-right network: The same day, Trump spoke with Robert Herring, the chief executive of far-right OANN, about an unproven anti-malarial that Trump has long touted and even took himself, despite a lack of clear evidence on its efficacy in preventing or treating Covid-19. “Yesterday, I had a chance to talk to President Trump about hydroxychloroquine,” Herring later wrote on Twitter. “I gave him a list of doctors we have interviewed. I know he wants to help & put people back to work. Hope he talks to real doctors & not Dr. ‘Farci.’ Remember: Trump has cited OANN as a new favorite television channel after becoming frustrated with Fox News’ willingness to interview Democrats. The channel, which is not distributed widely, often peddles wild conspiracies and false information. By Monday evening, Trump had taken the hydroxychloroquine message public, retweeting a series of videos that were later removed by Twitter for containing false and misleading information about mask-wearing and the unproven drug. Fauci said on ABC he agrees with the Food and Drug Administration that “the overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.” The mild rebuke from Fauci caused some Trump advisers to shake their heads, fearing another round of headlines pitting Trump against the well-respected disease expert. More on the Fauci-White House relationship: Last week, Trump said Fauci was a “nice guy” in an interview before his interviewer, Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports, said the doctor was “on my axe list because every time he talks and says the country should stay inside, my stocks tank.” “Well, he’d like to see it closed up for a couple of years, but that’s okay because I’m president, so I say, ‘Well, I appreciate your opinion, now give me another opinion, somebody please,’ “ Trump responded. Meanwhile, Navarro has sustained his attacks on Fauci, saying he doesn’t regret his unsanctioned op-ed and dinging the doctor for his first pitch last week at Nationals Park. Asked by reporters at the White House on Tuesday about the continued attacks on Fauci, Navarro stormed away. Link Copied! Philadelphia extends ban on indoor dining until September From CNN's Laura Ly The City of Philadelphia has extended their ban on indoor dining until Sept. 1 due to Covid-19 concerns, the city’s Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley announced at a press conference on Tuesday. “Indoor dining is inherently risky. People are indoors, where we know the risk is greater. People are not wearing masks because they’re eating and drinking,” Farley said. Farley spoke of clusters that have occurred in restaurants in other parts of the country and the state. Such clusters have not yet been reported in Philadelphia. “There have been clusters in restaurants that have occurred across the country, and in other counties in Pennsylvania. Now, we’re not seeing clusters occurring in Philadelphia involving spread in restaurants, but then again, we haven’t allowed indoor dining here,” Farley said. Link Copied!

Link Copied! Russia claims it will soon approve the world's first Covid-19 vaccine, but major questions remain From CNN's Matthew Chance CNN has learned that Russia intends to approve the world’s first coronavirus vaccine in less than two weeks, despite concerns about its safety, effectiveness and that the country has cut essential corners in development. Russian officials tell CNN they are working towards a date of August 10 or earlier for approval of the vaccine, which has been created by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute. “It’s a Sputnik moment,” said Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which is financing Russian vaccine research, referring to the successful 1957 launch of the world’s first satellite by the Soviet Union. “Americans were surprised when they heard Sputnik’s beeping. It’s the same with this vaccine. Russia will have got there first,” he added. But Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify its claimed safety or effectiveness. Critics say the country’s push for a vaccine comes amid political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force. There are also wide concerns human testing of the vaccine is incomplete. Russians scientists say the vaccine has been quick to develop because it is a modified version of a vaccine already created to fight against other diseases. Russia’s defense ministry says that Russian soldiers served as volunteers in human trials. In recorded comments provided to CNN, Alexander Ginsburg, the director of the project says he has already injected himself with the vaccine. Russian officials say the drug is being fast-tracked through registration because of the global pandemic and Russia’s own severe coronavirus problem. Russia now has more than 800,000 confirmed cases. “Our scientists focused not on being the first but on protecting people,” said Dmitriev, whose government fund is helping finance Russia’s vaccine program. “Russia marshaled its leadership position in vaccine development and its proven Ebola and MERS vaccine platform to bring the first safe and efficient solution to the world’s biggest problem,” he told CNN previously. The World Health Organization says there is no approved vaccine for MERS. Link Copied! New York suspends 45 businesses' liquor licenses for coronavirus violations From CNN's Elizabeth Hartfield New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks during the daily media briefing at the Office of the Governor of the State of New York on July 23 in New York City. Jeenah Moon/Getty Images About 45 businesses in New York have had their liquor licenses suspended for “egregious violations” of coronavirus regulations, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office announced in a statement on Tuesday, including 12 suspensions over the weekend in New York City. Over 100 business have been cited for violations – which can carry a fine of up to $10,000, according to the statement. A multi-agency task force conducted 644 compliance checks on Monday night and observed 26 additional violations, Cuomo’s office says. “New Yorkers have worked hard to flatten the curve, but the bars and restaurants that ignore public health guidance are disrespecting their sacrifices which have saved lives while allowing us to sustain the reopening of our economy,” Cuomo said in the statement. State Liquor Authority Chair Vincent Bradley said the SLA will continue to suspend licenses of those “who jeopardize lives” by violating the governor’s executive order. “Our communities, as well as the majority of restaurant and bar owners and staff, have endured great sacrifices to bend the curve, and the SLA will not hesitate to take immediate action against those who threaten the progress our state has made,” Bradley said in the statement.

Ron DeSantis, left, speaks during a news conference as Vice President Mike Pence at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Don Soffer Clinical Research Center on July 27 in Miami. Wilfredo Lee/AP At a roundtable in Orlando today with medical professionals, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state has seen “positive development over the last few months, generating improved outcomes in patient recovery.” Earlier today, Florida recorded 186 new deaths, breaking the previous record of 173 deaths on Thursday, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health. The statewide total resident death toll is at least 6,117 to date. DeSantis said the Covid-19 fatalities reported today were “probably reflective of infections and hospitalizations that have happened in the past, so it’s more of a lagging indicator.” DeSantis explained, “whereas, I think the ED visits and some of the hospital censuses is probably more of a leading indicator about where things are trending. And so as you have fewer ED visits, as you have fewer Covid-positive patients in the hospital, we think and I’m pretty sure with what the good work they’re doing, you’ll see mortality decrease as well.” A new shipment of 20,000 remdisivir vials is expected to be distributed across Florida hospitals today Medical professionals at today’s roundtable expressed concerned for non-Covid patients in need of treatment for other conditions keeping away from the hospital but ultimately need critical care. Hospital officials noted they have seen “a steady, but very consistent decline” in their census among Central Florida facilities. They peaked at 515 patients on July 19th.

In pre-recorded remarks for the National Food Policy Conference, Hahn said that although there are still a lot of questions about Covid-19, “what we do know is that the virus is not known to be transmitted via food or food packaging. It is much more likely to be spread through person-to-person transmission.” Hahn said that while the US food supply chain “remains strong,” the FDA and US Department of Agriculture are monitoring for potential nationwide and regional shortages. The agency has also provided flexibility on things such as packaging and label requirements to “help clear new paths to the retail market” for food producers who found themselves with a surplus due to schools and restaurants closing, Hahn explained. Link Copied! This California county added nearly 1,900 new cases From CNN's Stella Chan Kern County, situated in California’s Central Valley, reported 12 new deaths and 1,893 new coronavirus cases Tuesday morning, primarily due to delayed results from labs, public health director Matthew Constantine said this morning. “We’ve actually been told that some labs are holding asymptomatic nonessential worker samples until the turnaround time improves from health care workers and first responders, with an indefinite amount of time. So you can imagine contact tracing on something that is 19 days old is really difficult,” said Constantine at a Kern County Board of Supervisors meeting. He said contact tracing is hampered by missing or wrong information as well as the lab delays. Constantine said current modeling shows a slow increase in cases over time until a February peak which diminishes until next summer. He added that while intensive care units are nearing capacity, they are more limited by nurse staffing. “We’re actually talking about meeting with all the Central Valley counties that were identified by the governor and asking them what are we doing as a group because we all link together,” he said. More context: Gov. Gavin Newsom brought focus to the Central Valley on Monday and its eight counties as a state hotspot. The state is committing $52 million to the area comprising Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties. “The rising community transmission rates we are seeing, particularly among Latinos in the Central Valley, are concerning. This is alarming and we are taking action,” said Newsom. The money will be used to improve isolation protocols, testing protocols, and to enhance health care workers to provide more support and personnel. The county health department said last week it expects a large increase in positive reporting for the next few weeks, if not longer. Kern County has a total of 16,896 cases and 135 deaths.

Duke limiting on-campus housing in the fall to freshmen and sophomores From CNN's Elizabeth Stuart The entrance to the main Duke University campus is shown in Durham, North Carolina, on January 28, 2019. Gerry Broome/AP Duke University is scaling down its plans for welcoming back students on campus for the fall semester due to the growing number of Covid-19 cases in both North Carolina and the country, according to a note sent Sunday to the campus community. President Vincent E. Price said the decision was made to reduce the on-campus residential population by about 30% to provide a safe environment for students and staff. This marks a reversal of an earlier plan put out in June that would have welcomed back students from all years back to campus. “To achieve the necessary reduced density, Duke campus housing for the Fall 2020 semester will now be limited to first-year students, sophomores, and those students who have specific needs for campus housing because of their personal or academic situations,” Price said. Juniors and seniors will be given the option of remote-learning for the fall, and will have first priority for campus housing in the spring, the note said. According to the note, Duke’s plans for the spring semester are tentative “and will be based on the continuing course of the pandemic, medical guidance, prevailing local and national conditions, and our ability to conduct a safe and successful fall semester.” Link Copied! Moderna's chief medical officer expects vaccine candidate to be effective for those at risk of serious illness From CNN Health’s Wes Bruer Tal Zaks, chief medical officer of Moderna, says he expects the company’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate to be effective in those at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus. “We have an expectation that, elderly people and people with comorbidities, that their immune system is still going to respond to the vaccination,” Zaks said during the Disease Control and Prevention Summit on Tuesday. Though he said the data will ultimately prove whether it is effective for everyone, he said “there’s another more subtle explanation, which is, the more likely you are to get sick, the higher benefit typically people see from vaccines.” Zaks said that a quarter of the volunteers in the Moderna Phase 3 tria l, which began Monday morning, are expected be elderly or those with significant underlying illnesses such as diabetes “because that’s the population we need to know we’re protecting, but that’s also the population where the event rate of significant disease is going to be likely higher, and so that’s the population where actually I expect to see if anything is greater benefit.” Link Copied! Operation Warp Speed accelerating every part of vaccine development, except safety and efficacy, adviser says From CNN Health’s Naomi Thomas Moncef Slaoui listens as U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks about coronavirus vaccine development in the Rose Garden of the White House on May 15 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images The US government’s Operation Warp Speed is accelerating every aspect of vaccine development apart from the two most important: safety and efficacy, according to Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the operation’s chief adviser, who explained how the program worked to develop, manufacture and distribute a successful vaccine, and to do all that quickly. Speaking during a prerecorded keynote interview for the Disease Prevention and Control Summit on Tuesday, Slaoui said that they are accelerating the process by “taking financial risk, running things in parallel and taking platform technologies that are predictable in their behavior, but not curtailing the understanding of safety and efficacy of the vaccine.” Companies are modifying vaccine technologies that been tested already in people so they can move more quickly through the testing process, for instance. Plus, it is important to be able to speedily manufacture any new vaccine. “We’re selecting very carefully and thoughtfully vaccine technologies that are very likely to work, and work for us, because we know them somewhat,” Slaoui said. Secondly, the companies are “accelerating every single aspect of the development, except the two most critical ones, in terms of human safety and efficacy,” Slaoui said. All of this is being done for a portfolio of vaccines, Slaoui said, “because we want at least one of them to work. And, ideally, all of them to work.” Link Copied!

This northern England city is tightening coronavirus restrictions after a spike in infections From CNN's Sanam Mahoozi in London Tighter coronavirus measures have been introduced in Oldham, a city in northern England, after a sharp rise in infections there, the City Council said in a statement on Tuesday. Residents are being asked not to receive social visits at home and to keep two meters apart from friends and family when seeing them outside, according to the statement. Clinically vulnerable people whose shielding period was due to to end on July 31 are being asked to continue shielding until August 14, and care homes will not relax restrictions on visitors. Last week, some restrictions were dropped on care home visits in England, allowing one single visitor per resident. The new guidance is being issued in order to avoid a local lockdown, the council said, after the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 increased from 26 in the week ending on July 17, to 119 in the week ending July 25, according to the statement. “A significant proportion of recent cases involve multiple individuals testing positive within a household, showing that household spread is a real issue – especially in households with large families,” the statement said. A “large number” of recent cases were in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities — just over 65% cases in the last seven days, the council said on its website. “We’re urging residents to continue to take the risk of coronavirus seriously and to stick to the guidelines,” said Councillor Arooj Shah, deputy leader of the Oldham Council. “The best way to avoid infection is to limit contact with others as much as possible and to stay home wherever you can, including working from home. Limit contact with other people and respect social distancing where you do go out; keeping at least 2 meters from those not in your household and avoid shaking hands or hugging,” Shah added. “We know that people across Oldham desperately want to see their friends and family, and get back to normal. But these restrictions are essential if we are to stop the spread of Coronavirus and prevent a strict local lockdown being put in place, as we have seen elsewhere in the country.” The measures went into effect Tuesday and will continue for the next two weeks, the Oldham Council said in the statement.

South Dakota governor: \"Our schools should be open\" From CNN’s Gregory Lemos Kristi Noem, governor of South Dakota Governor, speaks during an event at Mount Rushmore National Memorial in Keystone, South Dakota, U.S., on Friday, July 3, 2020. Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday that schools in her state should be open. “The science is very clear on schools. Our schools should be open,” she said during a news conference. Noem cited a number of reasons including mental and emotional health, the limitations of remote learning, child abuse and neglect, as well as data that shows “children are at far greater risk of critical illnesses from influenza than they are Covid-19.” She quoted from Toronto Sick Kids saying, “The evidence is mounting that children may be less susceptible to this virus and may be less likely to transmit that virus to other. They also said the risks of infection and transmission in children, which appear to be minimal, need to be balanced with harms risks of school closure, which is impacting their physical and their mental health. On balance it is recommended that children return to schools.” Noem reiterated her position that she is against a statewide mask mandate and again cited Toronto Sick Kids saying, “It is impractical for a child to wear a mask for the duration of the school day.” She said the most efficient way to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in children is for them to wash their hands. The governor said teachers who have underlying health conditions have options like social distancing, masking, washing their hands or teaching online. She said she is discouraging schools from setting case thresholds “because they will be calling off school all the time.” Noem said schools should instead focus on hospitalizations as they consider when cancellation may be necessary. Noem also said schools in her state can expect more state and federal dollars to better equip them as they re-enter the classroom in the era of Covid-19. Link Copied!

New York state could host any major league baseball game that any teams want to play and they could play those games in our stadiums,” Cuomo said. Noting that New York state currently has one of the lowest Covid-19 infection rates in the country, Cuomo proposed that teams could fly into the state in private airplanes, go from the airport to the hotel where they would be quarantined and tested upon arrival, and then they could play ball in stadiums in the state assuming that they test negative. Afterwards, teams could then get on a plane and return home. “I offer to Major League Baseball, if you’re having problems playing in our states, come play here,” Cuomo said. “We have the ability to do it. We have the testing resources to do it,” he said, noting it would be great for the state economy, as well as for New Yorkers and Americans. Link Copied! Vermont will open schools for in-person classes in the fall From CNN's Artemis Moshtaghian Vermont Gov. Phil Scott will issue an executive order later this week setting Sept. 8 as a universal start date for students to return back to school in the fall. Scott said that he and Health Department Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine set a goal seven weeks ago to return to in-person instruction in the fall. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Levine said he is confident in opening schools. “We have achieved a stage of viral suppression that will allow us to open schools comfortably,” Levine said. The health commissioner said that if he were in Arizona, Texas, Florida or any other state facing high outbreaks of positive coronavirus cases, they would not be having the conversation about opening schools. Levine cited studies carried out around the world showing no significant transmission of Covid-19 within schools, that younger children are less likely to transmit Covid-19 and that adults in a family are more likely to “be the index case in the affected family.” “It is the youngest children up to age 9, who are not only at lowest risk, but stand to reap the most benefit from the in-person learning environment,” Levine said. He emphasized that there is not a clear cut one-size-fits-all approach to how schools plan to open and explained that each schools will be customizing solutions to fit their specific classroom and student body needs. In conjunction with the American Academy of Pediatrics Vermont Chapter, Levine issued a statement on Monday calling on schools in the state to prioritize in-person attendance for students in preschool through fifth grade.

Osaka governor Yoshifumi Yoshimura requested the citizens in the city to refrain from dining and drinking out with a group of more than 5 people between August 1 and August 20 in an effort to stop the infection from soaring further. Aichi prefecture also recorded its highest daily infection numbers at 110 cases on Tuesday, which is “a shocking number,” Aichi Governor Hideaki Ohmura said. On Tuesday, the southern city of Kumamoto raised its alert level after identifying 33 new infections, a record for the city. Tokyo also reported 236 new cases on Tuesday. The country’s latest figures: Japan reported at least 599 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the country’s Health Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. The total number of infections in Japan stand at 31,673 as of Monday, with two additional deaths reported. The nationwide infection totals for Tuesday – including the record numbers reported in various prefectures – will be released Wednesday morning local time by the ministry of health. Link Copied! Air traffic will not return to 2019 levels until 2024, air industry association says From CNN's Eoin McSweeney in London Passengers check their flight information on screens at the Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat airport in El Prat de Llobregat on July 6. Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images Air traffic will not return to 2019 levels until 2024, later than previously predicted, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a news conference on Tuesday. Despite a slight upturn, air travel in June was surprisingly weak and a much faster rebound had been expected, IATA said. There was almost no recovery in Europe and passenger numbers remain at all-time lows. Traffic is not growing as quickly as airlines are adding capacity, leading to greater cash burn. IATA expressed concern business travel levels will never return to pre-Covid-19 levels. New technologies and working from home could mean businesses cut back permanently on travel. Over the next couple of years, cargo could replace business travel as a major source of revenue. Testing is one of IATA’s preferred solutions to imposing quarantine, which it reiterated this week after the UK’s sudden decision to reintroduce such measures for travelers arriving from Spain. “We are in favor of introducing testing, especially between countries that have a different level of infection,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO, said. “But we do not see for the moment the testing system ready to accommodate the constraints of air travel.” Link Copied!

Funding for Covid-19 testing should be government's responsibility, airline industry says From CNN's Greg Wallace International Air Transport Association Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac speaks during the IATA global media day on December 8, 2014 in Geneva. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images The airline industry wants testing for passengers on international flights to be funded by governments, the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said Tuesday. IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac told reporters on a conference call that IATA believes testing “is very helpful” to prevent the spread of the coronavirus through travel, but it is concerned the cost of testing “could be a barrier to air travel if it was to be paid by the passengers.” “The contribution of the airlines is to have – to organize the testing with the airports, within the airport area to ensure that when the passenger comes to an airplane, he enters into a kind of safe bubble in which everybody will have been tested and tested negative,” de Juniac said. The testing would be a “kind of insurance that passengers who are flying are not infected, and that would minimize significantly the rate of virus transmission.” Executives with four major airlines – American, United, British Airways, and Lufthansa – recently asked US and European governments to reopen transatlantic travel without quarantine periods with a testing program. Those four airlines are IATA members. A coalition of U.S.-based airlines is also pushing the US Transportation Security Administration to begin government-organized temperature checking program. Link Copied!

If guidelines are followed carefully, as well as the fundamentals that Fauci outlined earlier – which include mask wearing, social distancing, closing bars in areas where there is viral activity, avoiding crowds and practicing hand hygiene – “I think we can prevent the surges that we’ve seen in the southern states,” he said. “Because we just can’t afford, yet again, another surge.” When asked whether there should be a coordinated national strategy for reopening, as some state governors have said they will not go along with plans that have been laid out by the administration, and the President has said that some states should be thinking about reopening, Fauci said that the guidelines “the way we put them out some time ago, that really is the national strategy.” These recommendations say that if you’re at a certain level, wait until you have a period of time over 14 days where it comes down, Fauci said, then continue to move through the phases, once the preceding one has been successfully achieved. “Obviously, as you mentioned, some states are not doing that,” Fauci said. “We would hope that they all now rethink at what happens when you don’t adhere to that. We’ve seen it in plain sight in the southern states that surged, so we’ve got to get back to a very prudent advance from one stage to another.” Link Copied!

Madrid makes mask use mandatory From CNN’s Laura Pérez Maestro in Spain Pedestrians wearing face masks walk past a shop window in Madrid, Spain, on Tuesday, July 28. Mariscal/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock The President of the Madrid regional government, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, announced at a news conference on Tuesday that the use of masks will be mandatory in Madrid in all indoor and outdoor spaces, including bar and restaurant terraces. The number of people meeting at these terraces will be limited to just 10, the same limit should be observed at private parties and meetings as well. The new measures will take effect starting Thursday. “Anyone attending will be registered and will have to provide ID an telephone numbers to ease tracing in case it is necessary,” she highlighted. The health counselor for the region, Enrique Ruiz Escudero, explained at the news conference that there has been a change in trend, with 500 infections registered this weekend, most of them in people under the age of 40. On that issue, Ayuso warned: “We are concerned about the behavior of many young people, not of all but of many, and it is important that they understand that they are also transmitters of the epidemic, that many have also fallen ill in these last few months, and above all, that they are putting in danger the lives of their neighbors, their relatives, but also their professional and academic future, if we continue having to fight the virus eternally”. She made an appeal to young people in Madrid to join this cause and change the trend. Other measures: Ayuso also announced the creation of what she has called the “Covid record card,” similar to a vaccination card in which it will be registered whether a person has had the disease and has antibodies. The objective is “to avoid confinement and be able to access gyms, museums, cinemas or any indoor place. The key is that people that can’t spread the virus can continue with their normal lives and take precautions to protect the most vulnerable”. These new measures taken by the capital mean that the use of masks are now mandatory in public places in the whole of Spain with the exception of the Canary Islands. Link Copied! Fauci \"cautiously optimistic\" about phase 3 Moderna vaccine trial From CNN's Health Gisela Crespo Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, listens during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on June 30 in Washington, DC. Al Drago/Pool/Getty Images) Following the announcement that the phase three clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine – developed by Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – has begun in the US , Dr. Anthony Fauci again said he is “cautiously optimistic” there will be an answer on whether a vaccine will work in the late fall or early winter. Speaking Tuesday on Good Morning America, the nation’s leading expert on infectious disease explained the results from the phase one trial were “enough for us to see the kind of response that this vaccine induces in individual[s]. And it induced the level of antibodies – which are the proteins that fight the virus – at a level that was quite high, in the sense of what was comparable if not better than what we see in the recovery from natural infection.” “That’s really one of the issues when you’re dealing with vaccines. If you can induce a response that’s least as good as natural infection, that is a good predictor that you’re going to have a vaccine that works. Obviously, the proof of the pudding is you’ve got to do the trial,” Fauci added. The large Moderna trial “will give us the answer and, yes, I am cautiously optimistic that as we get into the late fall and early winter, we will have an answer – and I believe it will be positive,” Fauci told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. More on the trial: The investigational vaccine was developed by the biotechnology company Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The trial is to be conducted at nearly 100 US research sites, according to Moderna. The first patient was dosed at a site in Savannah, Georgia. The trial is expected to enroll about 30,000 adult volunteers and evaluates the safety of the Moderna/NIH vaccine and whether it can prevent symptomatic Covid-19 after two doses, among other outcomes. Volunteers will receive either two 100-microgram injections of the vaccine or a placebo about 28 days apart. Investigators and participants will not know who has received the vaccine. Link Copied! Miami Beach mayor criticizes Florida governor over \"unprepared\" contact tracing From CNN's Adrienne Vogt Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber slammed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a letter over what he calls an “unprepared and understaffed contact tracing operation.” Only 17% to 18% of those testing positive with coronavirus in Miami-Dade County were contact-traced over the past two weeks, according to Gelber, adding that it was as low as 7% one day. Gelber said that while cases in the state seems to be leveling off, “they’re leveling off at a very, very, enormously high level.” Gelber told CNN’s John Berman that there’s a “concern for embarrassment” from state and national officials, so they downplay the facts. “When they hear the governor and they hear the President saying, ‘Don’t worry, this is fine, go out, you know, you don’t have to wear a mask, open up the economy,’ they believe that maybe this is a green light to do whatever you want, and that’s, I think, one of the reasons why we’ve had such difficulty in constraining the virus,” Gelber said. Watch: Miami Beach @MayorDanGelber criticized Florida governor for contact tracing issues, calling it “discouraging.” Gelber says only an average of 18% of the people who tested positive were called by contact tracers in the last two weeks.  “One day, it was as low as 7%.” pic.twitter.com/l8FNBfkNN0 — CNN This Morning with Kasie Hunt (@CNNThisMorning) July 28, 2020 Link Copied!

It’s absolutely vital therefore that we make the necessary preparations here in the UK as we are doing,” he added. Remember: At the start of the pandemic, the UK government was accused of acting too slowly to implement a lockdown or restrictions on travelers. Asked about the possibility that the length of the quarantine period may be reduced, Johnson said: “We are always looking at ways in which we can mitigate the impact of the quarantine, try to help people, try to make sure that science is working to help travelers and holidaymakers.” However, he added: “At the moment we’ve got to stick with the guidance we are giving.” Link Copied!

I go along with the FDA. The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease,” Fauci said on Good Morning America Tuesday. Fauci said there were other measures everyone should take to protect themselves, including wearing masks. “We should all be wearing masks outside,” he said. “There are fundamental things we should be doing, particularly if you happen to be in an area where there’s viral activity.” Fauci said that in addition to wearing masks, people should continue social distancing, avoid crowds and practice good hand hygiene. The expert also said that officials should close bars in areas where there was evidence of viral activity. Link Copied! It's just past 1 p.m. in London and 8 a.m. in New York.

The decision was taken due to high Covid-19 infection rates and local closures in the affected areas, the government said in an updated travel advisory. Germany’s decision follows a similar move by British officials at the weekend, which has caused a rift between Madrid and London. On Saturday, the UK advised against non-essential travel to mainland Spain. Its warning was extended on Monday to warn against non-essential travel to the Balearic and Canary islands. Travelers returning from the country will also have to quarantine for 14 days. “The decisions that have been made by the United Kingdom are misfit,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Monday, during an interview with Spanish broadcaster TeleCinco. “We wish them every success in managing this outbreak but we’ve seen a very sharp increase in cases in Spain,” UK minister for local government Simon Clarke said in response to Sánchez’s comments. “A 75% increase in cases [was] reported between the middle of last week and the end of last week, that’s why we took the action that we have.” Spain has recorded more than 272,000 coronavirus cases and 28,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

While there’s still no guarantee the vaccines being developed will prove effective, at least one vaccine trial in the US has entered its third phase. In the meantime, health officials are urging states to implement stricter measures after weeks of surges in new cases following reopenings that mostly began in May.

Opinion: Why the national security adviser's Covid-19 infection is a national security problem From CNN's Samantha Vinograd National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien attends a briefing on Enhanced Narcotics Operations at the US Southern Command on July 10 in Doral, Florida. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Editor’s note: Samantha Vinograd is a CNN national security analyst. She is a senior adviser at the University of Delaware’s Biden Institute, which is not affiliated with the Biden campaign. Vinograd served on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council from 2009 to 2013 and at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. With coronavirus casualties at sickening levels, Americans learned on Monday that no one is safe from Covid-19 – not even the man who’s supposed to be keeping Americans safe. News that US National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has tested positive for the virus presents an immediate health risk within the walls of the White House while serving as a worrisome metaphor for the administration’s coronavirus crisis management more generally. If the government couldn’t keep a top-ranking official like O’Brien healthy, that doesn’t instill confidence it can do the same for us. O’Brien’s Covid-19 diagnosis is a near-term health emergency. While others at the White House, including one of President Donald Trump’s personal valets, have tested positive in the past, O’Brien’s exposure is particularly alarming based on the personnel that he should be regularly engaging with, not to mention the close quarters he operates in. The nature of how the White House is structured, alongside the demands of O’Brien’s job, mean that critical US government personnel may have been exposed to the virus, including Trump himself. Typically, a national security adviser engages with the President, vice president, chief of staff, and other cabinet officials daily, including during the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) in the Oval Office, National Security Council meetings in the Situation Room (I’ve been in my fair share – the room is usually pretty packed), in-person foreign leader prep calls and more. I can tell you from experience: social distancing isn’t an option in a lot of these settings without extraordinary measures.

Just don’t do it in the middle of a pandemic,” Willing said. “The Supreme Court Justice himself described the situation in New South Wales itself as on a knife-edge.” “Find another way to express your views,” he said. Five of those arrested were issued with a fine of 1,000 Australian dollars ($713) for breaches of the Covid-19 public health order that currently bans crowds of more than 20 people. The sixth arrestee was issued with a criminal infringement notice for foul language. In June, tens of thousands of protesters turned out for a similar Black Lives Matter demonstration in Sydney, after a successful appeal against a NSW Supreme Court injunction. Link Copied! Even countries that got Covid-19 under control are now struggling. That's worrying for the rest of the world Analysis from CNN's James Griffiths The coronavirus is “easily the most severe” public health emergency the World Health Organization (WHO) has ever faced, its director-general said Monday , as countries that previously appeared to have the pandemic under control recorded an uptick in cases. Across the Asia-Pacific region, where countries were among the first hit by the virus and the first to contain it, there have been new and in some cases seemingly unexplained increases in the number of infections. Governments that had previously been lauded for their response to the pandemic now seem to be struggling. All this is concerning news for those where the first wave of the virus has yet to come fully under control, let alone in the disaster zones of the United States and Brazil. It’s especially scary as there are only a few more weeks of summer left in parts of the northern hemisphere, and many epidemiologists expect the virus to peak again in winter . What happened? Many of the most recent waves of the virus, in Hong Kong, Australia, China and elsewhere, have come as a surprise to officials. While there are a number of flaws to point out in various governments’ responses, the numbers did not explode until very recently – potentially because a more virulent strain of the virus had been introduced, or that cases were simply building up undetected and suddenly reached a tipping point. Hard task ahead: The difficulty even countries in Asia-Pacific – the region of the world with perhaps the best coronavirus response – are having points to the potentially insurmountable task of getting the virus under control in other parts of the world, at least until a vaccine becomes available.

Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube scrub platforms of viral video making false coronavirus claims From CNN's Jon Passantino and Oliver Darcy A video featuring a group of doctors making false and dubious claims related to the coronavirus was removed by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube after going viral online Monday. The video, published by the right-wing media outlet Breitbart News, featured a group of people wearing white lab coats calling themselves “America’s Frontline Doctors” staging a press conference in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC. US President Donald Trump shared multiple versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night despite the dubious claims running counter to his administration’s own public health experts. Spokespersons for the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. During the press conference, a speaker who identifies herself as a doctor makes a number of dubious claims, including that “you don’t need masks” to prevent spread of the coronavirus, and that recent studies showing hydroxychloroquine is ineffective for the treatment of Covid-19 are “fake science” sponsored by “fake pharma companies.” “This virus has a cure, it’s called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,” the woman claims. “You don’t need masks, there is a cure.” The claims run contrary to multiple studies on the anti-malarial drug and advice from public health officials to prevent spread of the virus.

Trump and GOP senators again put economic openings ahead of suppressing virus Analysis from CNN's Stephen Collinson US President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House on July 24 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images US President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill are still fighting the pandemic they wish existed, rather than a virus that unfolds at its own pace and is oblivious to their artificial political and economic timetables. Despite his supposed turn to taking the coronavirus more seriously, Trump on Monday warned some governors should be quicker in opening up their states, ignoring the fact his previous advice on such lines helped spark a surge in cases in the sunbelt. New stimulus bill: The Senate Republican Party meanwhile split over a new $1 trillion stimulus bill, with some conservatives warning that maintaining federal unemployment benefits at current rates would deter a return to work as the virus rages and delay the restoration of economy. Still, the impasse predated exceedingly difficult negotiations with Democrats and will inevitably degenerate into a hyper-partisan struggle given the stakes of the approaching election. But any delay could could see millions of Americans who lost jobs in lockdowns deprived of most of a $600 a week federal government lifeline – that has already paid out for the last time at previous levels. It also emerged Monday that Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien, who works in the President’s mask-free West Wing, tested positive for the coronavirus, in a sign of how flaunting basic precautions leaves no one safe from infection even if such steps are politically unpalatable. Crisis continues: The machinations in Washington unfolded against a backdrop of a crisis that is nowhere near fading despite Trump’s upbeat rhetoric. While there are signs the latest explosion of sickness in southern and western states may be cresting, the situation remains dire. By late Monday night, the daily toll stood at 53,972 new infections and 581 reported deaths.

This comes after the country reported 11 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Monday evening, including four healthcare workers. A total of 16 new cases had been reported in the past three days, the news report said. About 80,000 tourists are stranded in Da Nang. Earlier, domestic airlines were asked to increase the number of flights to evacuate them, but they had to depart before midnight Tuesday local time, according to Chinhphu. Reemergence of the virus: Da Nang witnessed a surge in cases since July 25, after the country had reported no local infections for 100 days. Authorities suspended road passenger transport both within the city and to and from Da Nang, except for the transportation of patients, workers, experts for business establishments, food, and goods. Reimposed restrictions: In a series of social-distancing measures imposed from midnight Tuesday, residents in six districts of Da Nang are required to stay at home. They can go out for food, medicine, emergencies and work. When they are out, they are required to keep a distance of at least 2 meters from each other.

Australia's Victorian government has \"no confidence\" for safety of Covid-19 patients in elderly care homes From CNN's Angus Watson in Sydney The government of Australia’s Victoria state is transferring elderly care residents into public and private hospitals to protect them from Covid-19, Premier Daniel Andrews said Tuesday. Around 200 patients have already been moved from aged care homes, where there are 769 active cases. All but the most serious surgeries have been suspended to make space for the at-risk individuals. “I cannot stand here and tell you that I have confidence that staff and management across a number of private sector aged care facilities are about to provide the care that is appropriate to keep their residents safe,” Andrews said on Thursday. “The sickest people must get treated quickest … we owe it to these residents, we owe it to their families,” he said. Victoria announced 384 new Covid-19 cases from 18,521 tests conducted Monday, down on Sunday’s daily high count of 532. There are 4,775 active cases in Victoria, among whom 414 are health workers. The Victorian government believes that Covid-19 patients refusing to isolate are driving the spread of the disease, despite a stay-at-home order imposed on metro Melbourne and the neighboring Mitchell Shire. Soldiers employed to knock on the doors of Covid-19 patients to enforce quarantine and contact tracing are “sadly finding some people who are positive who are not at home, which is a real concern,” Andrews said.

Nearly 7 million more children could suffer from acute malnutrition due to Covid-19 pandemic, analysis says From CNN's Gisela Crespo Nearly 7 million more children worldwide could suffer from acute malnutrition due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis published Monday in the Lancet medical journal. Disruptions in mobility and food systems caused by even relatively short lockdowns will result in a decrease of nearly 8% of gross national income (GNI) per capita compared to pre-pandemic projections. A drop in the GNI per capita is associated with a rise in acute malnutrition or child wasting, which is low weight for height and a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). These projections suggest a 14% increase in the number of children under 5 with moderate or severe wasting, meaning an additional 6.7 million could be affected this year compared to pre-pandemic projections, UNICEF said. Nearly 130,000 additional deaths from wasting in children under 5 are projected, with more than half of them occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. Increased risk of malnutrition: Covid-19  “is expected to increase the risk of all forms of malnutrition,” the team at the Standing Together for Nutrition consortium wrote, adding their estimates are likely to be conservative as the duration of the pandemic is unknown. Nutrition services hit: Covid-19 has resulted in a 30% reduction of essential nutrition services in low and middle-income countries, leaders of four United Nations agencies said in accompanying comments. Some of these countries have seen a complete shutdown of these services during lockdown. The UN estimates a minimum of $2.4 billion is needed to treat and prevent child wasting. Call for urgent action: The UN called for five “urgent actions” to protect children’s right to nutrition during the pandemic, including maintaining school meals and expanding social protections that include diet services. “We are issuing a call for action to protect children’s right to nutrition in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires a swift response and investments from governments, donors, the private sector, and the UN,” four UN leaders wrote in a commentary in the Lancet. Link Copied! Late-stage vaccine trials can't be sped up, expert says From CNN's Shelby Lin Erdman Vaccine maker Moderna started its final, phase 3 trial of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States Monday, and this is the stage that can’t be sped up, a top vaccine expert said. Development of a coronavirus vaccine has been extremely fast so far, Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Typically vaccine development programs take 15 years on average. This vaccine development program is probably going to take a year and a half,” Offit said. But the last part, the Phase 3 trial, will have to be taken more slowly, he said. “The proof is in the pudding. The Phase 3 trial’s the pudding and now you’re going to test hopefully 10, 15 or 20 thousand people that will get this vaccine, 15,000 people that will get placebo and you’ll see to what extent this is really safe and you’ll see to what extent it’s effective.” Data on whether the Moderna vaccine prevents infection should be available by the end of the year, and, if all goes well, it should be available for use by early 2021, although the vaccination process will take months. “I’m willing to wait to see the data,” Offit said. Mitigate risk: Offit said the Phase 3 trial helps to mitigate any sense of risk. “If you test it on 10,000 or 15,000 people and you find that it’s safe, you can say it doesn’t have an uncommon side-effect problem,” he said. But very rare side-effects won’t become obvious until after the vaccine is on the market, he said. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech also said Monday they were about to start a phase 2/3 trial of their experimental coronavirus vaccine in the US. Link Copied! Trump says governors should be opening up states From CNN's Kevin Liptak Even as coronavirus cases increase across the United States – and as members of his administration encourage some states to reverse their reopenings – US President Donald Trump said Monday that some governors need to loosen restrictions. “I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening,” Trump said, without specifying which states should be opening. The message doesn’t align with what members of the White House coronavirus task force have advised governors in states where cases are increasing. Health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx have said states with spiking case counts should close bars and indoor restaurants, among other restrictions. Trump offered a more optimistic view, saying that rapid development of a vaccine and therapeutics to treat coronavirus would help spur an economic resurgence. “I think the recovery’s been very strong,” Trump said.

Data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) confirmed its previous estimate that, between April and June, gross domestic product shrank 16.3% from a year earlier and 13.9% from the preceding quarter. It gave a breakdown of GDP components such as domestic and external demand.

It was the sector worst affected by the pandemic. Exports of goods and services fell by around 40% from a year earlier to 13.3 billion euros in the second quarter of 2020, the data showed. Exports of just services, which are predominantly tourism-related, plunged 56% to around 3 billion euros.

Though tourism activity picked up in July from the previous month, according to a separate INE release, the coronavirus outbreak still devastated the industry as travel restrictions kept visitors from Britain - Portugal's largest market - away until late August. The number of foreign tourists visiting Portugal in July was down 83% from a year earlier to around 305,800, while in June the fall was of 96%. Portugal's unemployment rate rose to 8.1% in July from 7.3% in June, according to INE. \"We have to get the country out of the economic recession and fight unemployment,\" Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. \"We are going to respond to this crisis with the same determination we had to overcome the previous one\" in 2010-14, he said.

        "text": "Sections\nCool Finds\nThe 66-foot wide circle of wooden posts predates the British monument by several hundred years\n\nTheresa Machemer\n\nCorrespondent\nArchaeologists in southern Portugal have discovered the remains of a Stonehenge-like, 4,500-year-old monument constructed not out of stone, but wood.\nToday, all that’s left of the structure is its approximately 66-foot wide foundation, which is punctuated by holes where wooden posts once stood in several concentric rings. Like Stonehenge, the monument was built to line up with the rising sun on the summer solstice. But the Portuguese site—the first of its kind found on the Iberian Peninsula, says archaeologist António Valera to the Lusa News Agency—is actually several hundred years older than Stonehenge.\n“We interpret it as a ceremonial place and prefer to refer to it as timber circles” rather than the catchier but less accurate “Woodhenge,” Valera, who led the excavations for archaeology company Era Arqueologia, tells Live Science’s Owen Jarus.\nThe prehistoric monument sits in a much larger archaeological landscape called the Perdigões complex. First identified in 1996, when a local vineyard decided to till new land for growing grapes, the 40-acre archaeological site is located in southern Portugal’s Evora district. Excavations suggest travelers from across the region convened there for ceremonies, festivals and burials between 3500 and 2000 B.C., writes Ed Whelan for Ancient Origins.\nAs the Portugal News reports, archaeologists found the timber circles at the center of a complex of ditches in the Perdigões complex. Per Live Science, the researchers estimate that they’ve uncovered about a third of the structure’s foundation. Additional finds include animal bones and pottery shards.\n“A possible access to the interior of this structure is oriented towards the summer solstice, reinforcing its cosmological character,” Valera tells the Portugal News.\nOther monolithic monuments around Europe share a similar alignment, he adds, “underlining the close relationship between these architectures and the Neolithic views of the world.\"\nGiven the strong resemblance between the timber circles and wooden monuments discovered in central Europe and the British Isles, the archaeologists suggest that late Stone Age peoples may have interacted with, seen or shared the Portuguese monuments’ designs. Examples of similar monumental structures include Woodhenge, a Neolithic site near Stonehenge that also boasted concentric rings of timber posts; the stone circle at Avebury in southwest England; and the Callanish Stones on Scotland’s Isle of Lewis.\nAs Valera says to the Portugal News, “This discovery reinforces the already high scientific importance of the Perdigões enclosure complex in the international context of European Neolithic studies while increasing its heritage relevance.”\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nTheresa Machemer\n| READ MORE\n\nTheresa Machemer is a freelance writer based in Washington DC.

The overall number is likely to be substantially higher as many workers stopped looking for jobs in the lockdown, meaning they are left off unemployment statistics. “The evolution of the labour market continues to be marked by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the National Statistics Institute (INE) said in a statement. Around 180,000 jobs have gone since February, a month before a six-week long lockdown, the INE data showed. In addition, the roughly 877,000 workers on furlough are not included in INE’s unemployment data. The scheme allows firms to temporarily suspend jobs or reduce working hours instead of firing workers. The indicator of labour under-utilisation - which, in addition to the unemployed, includes part-time workers and those currently inactive - reached 820,000 people in June, INE said. Women and those under 25 have been hit the hardest, with the jobless rate among Portugal’s young people up 4.2 percentage points to 25.6% in June. Unemployment had been falling as Portugal slowly recovered from a debt crisis, but is likely to hit 9.6% this year due to the health crisis, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last month. The tourism-dependent economy grew 2.2% in 2019 while unemployment was near record lows at 6.5%, but lockdowns at home and abroad have kept visitors away and shuttered many businesses. The southern Algarve region, usually packed with visitors but now nearly deserted, was badly hit, with the number of registered unemployed in June jumping 231% to more than 26,000 people, figures from the Institute of Employment and Professional Training (IEFP) showed last week.

The countries named in the complaint include the 27 member nations of the European Union plus the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.\nThe six Portuguese range in age between 12 and 21. Four of them live in central Portugal, where wildfires blamed in part on climate change killed more than 100 people in 2017. The two others live in Lisbon, an Atlantic coastal city threatened by rising sea levels.\nIf the activists win their case at the court in Strasbourg, France, the countries would be legally bound to cut emissions in line with the requirements of the 2015 Paris climate accord. They would also have to address their role in overseas emissions, including by their multinational companies.\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\"We see this case as buttressing the Paris agreement,\" Gerry Liston, a Global Legal Action Network legal officer, said during an online news conference.\nScientists say the man-made emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide must end by 2050 at the latest to avoid pushing global temperatures beyond the increase threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set out in the Paris climate accord.\nThe Portuguese case echoes one brought in the Netherlands by the environmental group Urgenda on behalf of 900 Dutch citizens concerned about government inaction on climate change.\nThose plaintiffs argued that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change was a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. In December, the Supreme Court in The Hague ruled in their favor.\nAlso, 16 children, including teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, last year filed a complaint with the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child to protest lack of government action on the climate crisis.\nThe Associated Press\n© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

The increase brought the cumulative total to 59,943, the health authority DGS said. Portugal, with 10 million people, has reported just 1,838 deaths so far, a far lower rate per capita than in many European countries including neighboring Spain. It initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic, but a wave of localized outbreaks in Lisbon has worried authorities and forced them to re-impose some restrictions. The majority of the new coronavirus cases registered on Saturday were in and around Lisbon and across the northern region, where the country’s second biggest city Porto is located. Stricter measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak will be introduced across Portugal from mid-September as students return to schools and many workers go back to the office, although details have yet to be announced.

Todos testaram negativo, incluindo António Costa - só falta saber resultados de Augusto Santos Silva e do ministro do Ambiente O ministro do Ensino Superior, Manuel Heitor, está infetado com covid-19. Este domingo ao final da tarde foi detetado o primeiro caso de infecção por covid-19 entre os membros do Governo. O ministro em causa é Manuel Heitor, o responsável governamental pelo ensino superior e ciência. Numa nota emitida já na madrugada de segunda-feira, o Governo afirma que o ministro \"não tem sintomas e encontra-se em confinamento domiciliário.\" Entretanto, antes das oito da manhã de segunda-feira, uma nova nota do Governo informou que António Costa e todos os outros ministros já com testes conhecidos tiveram resultado negativo. Restam em isolamento, aguardando resultados o MNE Augusto Santos Silva e o ministro do Ambiente. \"Por determinação da DGS ficarão em confinamento, apesar de testarem negativo, o ministro do Planeamento e a ministra do Trabalho Solidariedade e Segurança Social que ladeiam o MCTES na reunião do Conselho de Ministros\", acrescenta a mesma nota. De acordo com informações avançadas pelo Jornal de Notícias, o ministro do Ensino Superior terá tido um encontro com a Comissária Europeia da Inovação, Maryia Gabriel, que este sábado confirmou estar infetada com covid-19. Ver Twitter Alguns dos governantes com assento no Conselho de Ministros já terão sido testados e os restantes elementos com presença neste órgão vão ser testados esta segunda-feira. Ainda de acordo com a nota do Governo, \"todos os membros do Governo que participaram na reunião do Conselho de Ministros da passada quinta-feira estão a ser testados, mesmo os que não tiveram um contacto próximo com o ministro Manuel Heitor\". Os governantes estiveram reunidos presencialmente em São Bento na última quinta-feira, para aprovação da proposta de lei de Orçamento de Estado para 2021. Manuel Heitor era naturalmente um desses ministros presentes no encontro. Este domingo, o Conselho de Ministros voltou a reunir-se, mas num encontro virtual e à distância. Além do primeiro-ministro, e de Manuel Heitor, integram o Governo 18 ministros. Os resultados dos testes serão conhecidos até ao início da manhá de segunda-feira e posteriormente divulgados, adianta o Executivo. Manuel Heitor tem 62 anos, é Professor Catedrático no Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisboa, sendo doutorado pelo Imperial College de Londres em Engenharia Mecânica. É ministro da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior desde 2015, tendo transitado do primeiro para o segundo Governo de António Costa. Heitor teve dois eventos públicos nos últimos dias: na apresentação da “Coleção Ciência & Conhecimento”, em Óbidos, onde esteve de máscara até discursar (ao ar livre); e na comemoração dos 40 anos do Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores (INESC), em Lisboa.

PS perdeu a maioria, PSD aumentou os votos e entram três novos partidos na assembleia legislativa.

O PS, que governa a região há 24 anos, perdeu a maioria absoluta que detinha há duas décadas. Pela primeira vez, Vasco Cordeiro vai ter de governar em minoria, naquele que será o seu último mandato à frente do executivo açoriano. Foi a noite eleitoral mais imprevisível dos últimos anos nos Açores. Habitualmente, a partir do início da noite já se conhece o resultado eleitoral. Há 24 anos que o PS vence as eleições regionais, há 20 anos com maioria absoluta. Desta vez, não foi assim. Em 2020, as contas fizeram-se até ao fim, ilha a ilha, freguesia a freguesia . No final, o PS perdeu a maioria absoluta. Os socialistas obtiveram 39,13%, o PSD 33,74%, o CDS 5,51%, o Chega 5,06%, o BE 3,82%, o PPM 2,34%, a Iniciativa Liberal 1,93% e o PAN 1,93%. Aumentar Na distribuição de mandatos, o PS consegue 25, o PSD 21, o CDS três, o Chega dois, o Bloco de Esquerda dois, o PPM dois, a Iniciativa Liberal um e o PAN outro. De fora do parlamento regional fica a CDU. Vasco Cordeiro, líder do PS-Açores e actual presidente do governo regional, parte para o seu último mandato permitido pela lei mais fragilizado. Foi em 1996, aquando da primeira vitória socialista na região, que Carlos César venceu com maioria relativa. Em 2016, no total, o PS teve 46,4% (30 deputados) e o PSD 30,9% (19 deputados). A maioria absoluta nos Açores consegue-se com 29 deputados. Aumentar A luta pelo terceiro lugar foi renhida. O CDS ganhou no limite e conseguiu mais um deputado do que o  Chega, que elegeu dois. André Ventura esteve uma semana em campanha nos Açores e obteve os frutos disso. O Bloco de Esquerda, apesar de ter ficado atrás do partido de André Ventura, manteve os mesmos dois deputados que teve na legislatura anterior. O PPM, que já tem um deputado desde 2008 no Corvo, conseguiu outro deputado, eleito pelas Flores. CDU desaparece, abstenção diminui A Assembleia Legislativa Regional dos Açores vai ficar mais repartida do que nunca. Além do Chega, vão entrar a Iniciativa Liberal e o PAN. Ambos elegeram pelo círculo de compensação. Um dos maiores derrotados da noite foi a CDU. Na última legislatura, obteve um deputado, eleito pelas Flores. Nas eleições de 2020, perde o deputado e praticamente desaparece do mapa político açoriano. Uma das vitórias da noite foi a redução da abstenção. Em 2016, a taxa de abstenção foi a mais elevada de sempre em eleições regionais (59,6%). Em 2020, a abstenção situou-se nos 55%. Os próximos dias vão ser interessantes na política açoriana. Vasco Cordeiro vai encarar uma situação nova: como governar com maioria relativa? Em 1996, o PS governou com o CDS, mas desta vez os centristas não chegarão para assegurar uma maioria aos socialistas. Por outro lado, José Manuel Bolieiro, líder do PSD-Açores, realçou ao longo da campanha que era um homem de consensos e que o partido logo tomaria uma posição após os resultados. Ao longo da campanha, pairou no ar a possibilidade de uma “geringonça” de direita. E os resultados permitem isso: é preciso PSD juntar-se a CDS, Chega, PPM e Iniciativa Liberal. É preciso uma coligação de cinco partidos para ter a maioria absoluta. Uma coisa é certa: à partida para essas eleições, todos os partidos tinham como objectivo acabar com a maioria socialista. E conseguiram. Vinte anos depois. Sugerir correcção Leia os artigos que quiser, até ao fim. Com uma assinatura PÚBLICO tem acesso ilimitado a todos os conteúdos e cancela quando quiser.

Luke Slater live updates 25 October 2020 4:10pm GMT Comment:  It is a relief to see Lewis Hamilton dethrone Michael Schumacher as F1's most successful driver Lewis Hamilton has been crowned the most victorious driver in Formula One history following his crushing 92nd career win in Sunday's Portuguese Grand Prix. A fortnight after he drew level with Michael Schumacher in Germany , Hamilton now stands alone in the record books after taking the chequered flag at Portimao 25.5 seconds clear of Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton is poised to become the sport's most successful driver of all time as early as next month, with a seventh world championship certain to follow this season. The Englishman's victory here moved him 77 points clear of Bottas with just 130 points to play for. Red Bull's Max Verstappen finished third ahead of the Ferrari driver of Charles Leclerc. Hamilton said afterwards: \"It is going to take some time to fully sink in. I cannot find the words at the moment. Lewis Hamilton vs Michael Schumacher: Weighing up the skills and achievements of two of F1's greats \"My dad is here, which is amazing, and my step-mum Linda too and my dog Roscoe so it is a blessed day. \"I could have only ever dreamed of being where I am today. didn't have a magic ball when I came to Mercedes but here I am and as a team we are trying to make the most of it.\" The Briton added: \"I had cramp in my right calf so I was lifting down the straight because it felt like it was about to pull but I had to get through it.\" Hugs from Dad 😍 #PortugueseGP 🇵🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/AKsjGur8Tr — Formula 1 (@F1) October 25, 2020 Hamilton was an 11-year-old boy dominating Britain's karting scene the last time a Formula One grand prix was staged in Portugal in 1996. Little did Hamilton know then, that 24 years later he would break F1's all-time win record - a tally many thought would never be bettered following Schumacher's 91st win at the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix. For the opening six laps, Hamilton's quest for history appeared in grave danger following a bizarre start to the 12th of 17 rounds under overcast and blustery Algarve skies. After taking pole on Saturday, Hamilton retained the lead on the downhill gallop to the opening bend, but halfway round the first lap he had fallen to third, passed by Bottas and then McLaren's Carlos Sainz, who started seventh. A smattering of rain drops and cooler conditions meant Hamilton was off the mark in getting his medium-compound rubber up to speed, and team-mate Bottas, on the same rubber was also struggling. Indeed, by the end of a frantic first lap - which also saw Verstappen collide with Racing Point's Sergio Perez at the fourth corner - Sainz, starting on the speedier soft tyres, had taken the lead. The briefest of showers soon abated and normal order started to resume, with Bottas retaking the lead on lap six and Hamilton moving past Sainz to take second on the ensuing lap. At that stage, Bottas appeared in control, but it was not long before Hamilton's brilliance came to the fore. On laps 17, 18 and 19, Hamilton set a hat-trick of fastest laps and Bottas's two-second lead had evaporated. Then, on the run down to Turn 1 on lap 20, Hamilton cruised round the outside of Bottas to lead the grand prix. LAP 20/66 Hamilton passes Bottas and retakes the lead! #PortugueseGP 🇵🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/1J3kHNPpTE — Formula 1 (@F1) October 25, 2020 Over the course of nine spellbinding laps, Hamilton opened up a seven-second lead over the Finn and with that, any chance Bottas had of stopping Hamilton from rewriting F1's record books was over. The Mercedes machine is in a class of one this year and with Hamilton at the wheel, he has no competition. The Englishman pulled in for his solitary change of tyres with 26 laps remaining before lapping the entire field up to Leclerc in fourth. It was a devastating display and one befitting of this great British talent. Despite his accident with Verstappen on the first lap, Perez turned in a wonderful recovery drive. He finished seventh. AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly took fifth ahead of early leader Sainz. Lance Stroll, who missed the last race with an illness which was later diagnosed as coronavirus, endured a miserable afternoon. Portuguese Grand Prix First, he was penalised five seconds for crashing into Lando Norris at the first corner - relegating the young Briton way down the order - before he was handed an additional five-second penalty for exceeding track limits. His Racing Point team later retired him from the race. 3:12PM Well, that was an enjoyable afternoon W hat a drive from Hamilton.

He was flawless today after he took the lead. He had to fight but he had it all in his pocket, really. Bottas absolutely hammered. Verstappen in that no-man's land, Leclerc superb for fourth.

G asly tries it around the outside in turn one this time, Gasly up into fifth now! Great move. Bold. The soft tyres haven't worked for Perez here. I think he's a sitting duck here. Great race, though. 2:41PM Lap 63 of 66 - Gasly closing right up on Perez F eints one way and the other and Perez keeps his spot with some aggressive defending... I wouldn't be surprised to hear some complaints from Gasly there. Sainz closing up on the back of this battle. \"These guys!\" Gasly proclaims on the radio. That was nearly a huge crash. But it wasn't... 2:39PM Lap 62 of 66 - Sainz closing up on Gasly A nd Gasly closing up on Perez. Close to DRS range for both. This could be the battle to watch.

But Norris is fighting back... and steams past coming out of the hairpin. Perez is having an absolute stormer today, I was right after all. 2:33PM Lap 58 of 66 - Sainz closing on Gasly A nd Ocon closing on Sainz. Hamilton has cramp, he says. Presumably in his legs. 2:32PM Lap 57 of 66 - Looking like a decent battle for the middle points positions V ettel now into the points, chasing both Renaults. 2:31PM Lap 56 of 66 - Hamilton leading by 16.3s Y eah, it's been one of those afternoons.

Where would Ocon come out when he stops? Eigth or ninth I think. Sixth is possible for him today, I think. 2:21PM Lap 49 of 66 - Albon not having a great day, it has to be said B ut a 1.8s pit stop from the Red Bull mechanics just then. Hamilton puts in another fastest lap. Russell closing up on Giovinazzi in 13th. Hamilton leads by 14.5s. 2:20PM Lap 48 of 66 - Bottas finds some pace B ut far too little and far too late.

Just 7.2s at the moment, having taking 0.7s out on the last lap. 2:16PM Lap 45 of 66 - Hamilton asks about rain, again N othing significant, he's told. Gasly gets Ricciardo for seventh, Ocon ahead next. Hamilton flying, setting another fastest lap. He's going to have a pit stop on Bottas by the end of this race. 2:14PM Lap 44 of 66 - Verstappen goes quickest in S2 H amilton quickest in S2. He leads by 13.2s now... that's huge. Bottas has just not been in the same race since he lost the lead. 2:13PM Lap 43 of 66 - Bottas struggling to get his tyres working A nd Hamilton extends his lead to 11.3s. Norris told he has a slow puncture. 2:12PM Lap 42 of 66 - Bottas nearly loses his front wing leaving the pits T hat pit exit can be treacherous... and Giovinazzi and Russell go right across his front wing as they speed into turn one. Would have to see a replay to see how close it was but it looked it on initial viewing. LAP 41/42 of 66 Hamilton comes into the pits and is followed by his team mate (📸) the following lap - both drivers are now on the hard compound tyre.

Bottas thinking of going onto the soft tyres. Not sure it'll work but staying on the same tyres is really unlikely to work, either. Grosjean picks up a five second penalty for track limits.

Hamilton's lead is back up to 8.7s. 2:04PM Lap 37 of 66 - Bottas claws back a bit of time J ust under a second. Think Hamilton is in traffic, though? Possibly. Russell finally pits, only Ocon and the Mercedes yet to stop now. 2:03PM Lap 36 of 66 - Stroll pits for a change of tyres and his 10s penalty I do wonder if Russell and Williams could pull out a maverick strategy and nab some points here? Think it might take a safety car for that, as it stands. No retirements yet. 2:02PM Lap 35 of 66 - Hamilton's lead has stabilised T o just under nine seconds. Brilliant driving from him, though. 2:01PM Lap 34 of 66 - Ocon and Perez duelling for P5 G reat to see. Good, clean fighting from the two men who had such a trouble relationship at Force India together. Good, clean, fair and hard racing there for the whole first sector.

Barely a hair's width to separate them in qualifying, Hamilton pulling out pole at the death. Bottas gets in the lead and keeps it for a few laps before Hamilton launches an attack, takes the lead and builds a massive lead in absolutely no time as Bottas has absolutely no answer. 1:53PM Lap 28 of 66 - A few spots out in the pit lane B ut, again, nothing significant.

Stroll went off the track to try that move... 1:38PM Lap 17 of 66 - Gasly and Sainz getting close A nd Verstappen's front right is looking very angry indeed.

He's through at the start of the lap, Bottas has no grip... what's going on with these Mercedes cars? Has Sainz just been able to turn the tyres on? This is fantastic racing! 1:15PM THE 2020 PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX IS GO! B ottas sets up aggressively, pointing towards Hamilton... They're away and it's a fine, fine start from Hamilton but it's a poor start from Bottas, who drops behind Verstappen going into turn one... but the Finn fights back into second and pushes Verstappen wide... Verstappen tags Perez, sends him spinning and into the barriers... So many lock ups, Verstappen is dropping back and back and back, Bottas retakes the lead as Hamilton struggles! Sainz now up into second past Hamilton... the rain is getting heavier and there's no grip at all out there... it's like an ice rink. 1:13PM Formation lap is go, by the way H amilton says the grip doesn't feel great. The cars form up on the grid... 1:12PM A few spits and spots out there B ut nothing significant. The track is slippy enough as it is and without too much running from support series this weekend it could become a little greasy quite quickly. 1:09PM Starting tyre types I n the top 10 only Hamilton, Bottas and Leclerc are on mediums, the rest on softs. Outside the top 10 only Raikkonen (16th, softs) and Magnussen (19th, hards) are not on fresh mediums. 1:06PM Strategy chat from Pirelli I expect some divergence today. #Fit4F1 Strategy predictions for tomorrow’s race. 🔮🏁 #PortugueseGP 🇵🇹 #F1 pic.twitter.com/iV0DBaX04o — Pirelli Motorsport (@pirellisport) October 24, 2020 1:00PM 10 minutes until lights out P redictions?

I wonder if that will count against those starting on the mediums? That's both Mercedes and Leclerc in the top 10, by the way. 12:35PM How's the weather looking? Overcast. Chilly. Windy.

It's the second entirely-new-to-F1 track in this strange and unusual season and, like Mugello, it's not a bad one to watch the current crop of cars on. How good it will be to watch them race on it remains to be seen, though I am sceptical that we will see much — if any — overtaking that comes without the aid of the dreaded Drag Reduction System. After a fairly stop/start and almost chaotic few practice sessions with many spins and offs from a variety of drivers, qualifying itself turned out to be fairly entertaining. Lewis Hamilton pulled out a fine lap at the very death — his second on a set of medium tyres — to deny Valtteri Bottas pole position, once again. Max Verstappen, again, was third for Red Bull. Credit: Dan Istitene - Formula 1 H ere's what Hamilton had to say after his 97th career pole position: Yes, we’ve got a great car but you’ve got to drive the nuts off it to pull out a lap and Valtteri has been so quick this weekend. As you’ve seen, he’s topped every session. So I’ve just been digging and digging and digging to find that extra time. At the end there I chose to do three laps, to give me a chance to have a stab at beating his time. I think he decided to do one, so I was like ‘OK, this could provide me an opportunity’ and it worked. That last lap it got better and better as I went through it. Bottas, meanwhile, must have felt fairly downbeat after being quicker than Hamilton, or so he thought, for much of the weekend. Both Mercedes drivers, interestingly, decided to opt for the medium tyres on their second run in Q3, although Hamilton had enough time for two quick laps. Bottas only had enough time for one. Previously in the qualifying the medium actually felt a tiny bit quicker than the soft and that was the reason and then it was choosing if we do two timed laps with a cool-down in between or just one timed lap. With one timed lap you can have less fuel in the car but you might struggle with the tyre warm-up. I went with that. It was my decision to go for one timed because it worked in Q2 but apparently it seems like doing two timed laps for Lewis was better. A few other decent performances down the grid, too. Charles Leclerc qualified fourth, an entire 11 spots quicker than Sebastian Vettel. Sergio Perez, who does not yet have a drive for 2021, was fifth for Racing Point, well ahead of his team-mate too. George Russell once more pulled out a superb lap to put his Williams into Q2. He will start 14th. The race begins at 1.10pm GMT, and I'll be here for all the build-up, latest updates and reaction from the race.

Access was strictly limited as the pilgrims, clad in masks to ward off potential infection from the pandemic, descended on the square in front of the Basilica of the Rosary. Authorities, mindful of the fact the site had had to remain closed for months earlier this year, had limited numbers to a maximum 6,000, and in the event some 4,000 turned up, a spokesman told AFP. Each had to stand away from the next person in a square marked out with circles for social distancing. May 13, when most of Europe was in virus lockdown, marked the first of several occasions that three Portuguese children declared they saw a vision of the Angel of Our Lady of Fatima in 1917. October 13th that year marked the third apparition to the trio, who lived in a small village just outside Fatima. Tuesday's restrictions were brought in to avoid a repeat of the large numbers who visited the site a month ago. Regional bishop Jose Ornelas, said in his homily that the restrictions were unavoidable. He called on pilgrims to adopt a responsable attitude in the face a pandemic \"come to change radically the lives of all humanity\". Fatima is one of the world's most popular Catholic pilgrimage sites, with some 6.3 million visitors last year. © 2020 AFP Advertising Most read 1 ‘Time to boycott all men’: The 4B movement going viral after Trump's victory EXPLAINER Americas 2 The bells of Notre Dame cathedral ring out for first time since 2019 fire Europe 3 Israeli police detain two French Consulate gendarmes in Jerusalem Middle East 4 Who are the key figures of Donald Trump's new inner circle?

But the country registered it's highest daily number of new cases since the pandemic began Wednesday, with 2,072.

Controls will be stepped up to ensure enforcement.\nFor now, weddings and baptisms are exempt from the five-people maximum rule. They're limited to 50 people but subject to social distancing and mask-use rules.\nPortugal’s border with Spain, which is registering double the number of cases per 100,000 people, will remain open, Costa insisted.\nHow the Portuguese Socialist leader upset the odds to win a rare majority government.\nSocialist Party wins absolute majority, but far right makes gains.\nAntónio Costa looks set for third term. \nSocialists’ poll lead narrows in runup to Sunday’s legislative vote.",

Oliveira won from pole position for his second victory of the season, finishing ahead of Jack Miller and Franco Morbidelli. \"It's unreal. You dream about these kinds of races, and to finally be able to win, it's incredible,\" Oliveira said. \"It's extra special because my family didn't get to see live my first win, and they get to see it live here. An incredible day for me, very emotional.\" Oliveira had clinched his first MotoGP career win at Austria's Styrian GP in August. Joan Mir, who secured his first world title last weekend, did not finish the race at the Algarve International Circuit because of an apparent mechanical problem. Morbidelli ended the championship in second place, with Alex Rins third. \"A great way to finish this championship, with a podium,\" Morbidelli said. \"Miguel was untouchable today.\" Sunday's race gave Ducati its first constructors' championship since 2007. It was the final MotoGP race for Andrea Dovizioso, Cal Crutchlow and Tito Rabat. Valentino Rossi finished 15th in the championship in his final season with Yamaha. The Italian was 12th in the season-ending race. Italian rider Enea Bastianini won the Moto2 title with a fifth-place finish Sunday, while Spaniard Albert Arenas won the Moto3 championship with a 12th-place result. The MotoGP season was shortened and had its calendar severely altered because of the coronavirus pandemic, with all races outside Europe canceled. This year's title race was wide open after six-time MotoGP champion Marc Marquez was sidelined because of an injury. There were nine different winners in 14 races, with five first-time winners. Morbidelli and Fabio Quartararo won the most races, with three each. The 25-year-old Oliveira, who started from pole position for the first time in his career, was the only other two-time winner.

Em dia de luto nacional, as mais altas entidades do Estado participaram numa curta \"cerimónia do içar da bandeira nacional em dia de luto nacional e homenagem a todos os falecidos, em especial às vítimas da pandemia da doença covid-19\", que durou cerca de três minutos. Em Portugal, já morreram mais de 2.500 pessoas com esta doença provocada por um novo coronavírus, e nos últimos dias tem havido entre 30 e 40 mortes em cada 24 horas. O Presidente da República, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, chegou à Praça Afonso de Albuquerque, em frente à entrada do Palácio de Belém, em Lisboa, onde o trânsito foi temporariamente cortado, pelas 10:00 horas, dando início à cerimónia. No local, estavam já o presidente da Assembleia da República, Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, o primeiro-ministro, António Costa, e também os presidentes do Tribunal Constitucional, Manuel da Costa Andrade, do Supremo Tribunal de Justiça, António Piçarra, e do Tribunal de Contas, José Tavares, e uma guarda de honra composta por militares do esquadrão presidencial. A presidente do Supremo Tribunal Administrativo, Dulce Neto, não pôde estar presente. A bandeira nacional foi primeiro içada até ao topo, ao som do hino nacional, e depois colocada a meia haste, em silêncio. Em seguida, as entidades presentes guardaram um minuto de silêncio. O Governo decidiu em 22 de outubro declarar esta segunda-feira, 02 de novembro, Dia de Finados, \"como dia de luto nacional, como forma de prestar homenagem a todos os falecidos, em especial às vítimas da pandemia da doença covid-19\", lê-se no comunicado dessa reunião do Conselho de Ministros. Este decreto foi aprovado na mesma reunião em que o Governo decidiu restringir a circulação entre concelhos do território entre 30 de outubro e 03 de novembro - abrangendo o Dia de Todos os Santos, feriado nacional, e o Dia de Finados. Em Portugal, os primeiros casos de infeção com o novo coronavírus responsável pela covid-19 foram detetados no dia 02 de março e até agora já morreram 2.544 pessoas com esta doença, de acordo com a Direção-Geral da Saúde (DGS), num total de 144.341 casos de infeção contabilizados. Na sexta-feira, Portugal atingiu números nunca vistos desde o início da epidemia: 4.656 novos casos de infeção, 40 mortes e 275 internados em cuidados intensivos em 24 horas, e no sábado morreram mais 39 pessoas e houve um novo máximo de 286 doentes internados em cuidados intensivos, segundo a DGS. No domingo, a DGS anunciou que nas últimas 24 horas houve mais 37 mortes associadas à covid-19 e 3.062 novos casos de infeção. O número de internados em cuidados intensivos baixou para 284, mas o total de internados ultrapassou os 2000, sendo agora de 2.122.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal will impose localised night-time curfews from Monday to contain the spread of the coronavirus as the number of cases reached a record high, Prime Minister Antonio Costa announced in the early hours of Sunday. \"We cannot have the slightest doubt that everything must be done to contain the pandemic,\" Costa told a news conference. \"If we fail to do so, we must increasingly adopt more restrictive measures and compromise the month of December.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue The overnight curfew, from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., will come into force across 121 of the country's 308 municipalities, including Lisbon and Porto, on Monday as the country enters a 15-day state of emergency. Night workers are exempted. Costa also announced those in the 121 municipalities - home to about 70% of Portugal's population - will not be able to leave their homes between 1 p.m. and 5 a.m. during the next two weekends - on both Saturday and Sunday. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Some commercial outlets will close during these times but restaurants will be allowed to provide takeaway services, Costa said, admitting the weekend measure will inevitably hit the sector hard. The initial state of emergency, which under Portuguese law can be extended indefinitely in 15-day periods, was declared in March and lasted six weeks. It restricted the movement of people and led thousands of businesses to suspend activities. Portugal, with just over 10 million people, has recorded a comparatively low 173,540 cases and 2,848 deaths but it reached 6,640 cases on Saturday, the highest daily figure since the pandemic started. Testing has also increased. A total of 2,420 people are in hospital, with 366 in intensive care units (ICUs) - more than the April peak of 271. The healthcare system, which prior to the pandemic had the lowest number of critical care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe, can accommodate 800 COVID-19 patients in ICUs.

It is alleged that Ihor Homenyuk, after two days in custody following his arrival without a visa and refusal to board a flight home, was beaten and asphyxiated by three officers who tied his arms and legs to restrain him. Prosecutors, who have charged three officers with murder, said that when Homenyuk was on the ground the men “used an extendable baton and kicks to hit the victim in the torso. The offenders left the victim on the ground, cuffed and with his feet tied.” Eduardo Cabrita, the home affairs minister, last week announced the resignation of the head of Portugal’s SEF border service as part of a restructuring plan to more clearly separate police and administrative functions in dealing with immigrants. He also agreed to send compensation to the victim’s family. The opposition have called for Cabrita to go too, claiming he failed to have the incident properly investigated and for six months failed to offer support to Homenyuk’s loved ones. The minister said at a press conference last week that he had talked to the Ukrainian ambassador and extended his condolences to Homenyuk’s family. He is due to face questioning by a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. Duarte Marques, an MP with the opposition Social Democrats, said: “It’s shameful that the Portuguese government has taken this many months to take this decision and only took it because of media pressure.” A home affairs ministry internal inquiry found that Homenyuk had convulsions a day before his death but SEF officers failed to provide him with epilepsy medicine. The report, seen by the Guardian, details how Homenyuk was tied up with tape for more than seven hours without access to food or a bathroom, which led him to go into a “slow asphyxia … which ultimately resulted in his death.” His handcuffs were only removed during CPR, according to the document, and an autopsy revealed bruises, fractured ribs and bootmarks. According to the report, several other SEF workers including a nurse entered the room several times during the hours when Homenyuk was allegedly beaten, and heard his screams but failed to stop or report the incident. The report concludes that officers “omitted the truth purposely to avoid any criminal or disciplinary action”. The death was initially attributed to a heart attack, but a postmortem examination and a police investigation concluded that the cause of death was “severe traumatic injuries” sustained during the alleged assault, according to the public prosecutor. Cabrita then ordered the internal inquiry and fired the director and sub-director of Lisbon’s border management. The airport detention centre underwent what he called “radical change” before it reopened. Marques said the measures, which included installing panic buttons in holding cells, were not enough to address what he called “structural problems” in SEF’s treatment of migrants and the conditions in its detention centres. “Those who were there and are still there have to go. And if the minister doesn’t fire SEF’s board, he has to give his own place up,” he said. SEF refused to comment, but the union for SEF workers said in a statement last week that the “problem is not in who works for SEF […] it is absolutely clear that the known circumstances of what happened are in clear contradiction of the usual conduct of SEF officers.” The Portuguese prime minister, António Costa, has said he has “total trust” in Cabrita. The minister himself has said he has a “clear conscience” and full confidence in those now leading SEF. He said Homenyuk’s death was “completely unacceptable and something that goes completely against Portugal’s respect for human rights”, adding that the country was a “champion in the way it welcomes migrants”. Oksana Homenyuk, the victim’s widow, feels differently. She hasn’t told her children about the circumstances of their father’s death. “I never thought something like this could happen in a European country, where human rights are above all,” she said in an interview with the Portuguese broadcaster SIC. “Every time I hear the word Portugal … I developed a hatred against that country, I can’t even say that word. So many people saw him, so many people saw it and nobody helped. I still can’t believe it.” Pedro Neto, the director of Amnesty International in Portugal, said Homenyuk’s death might be an “isolated case” but reports of torture and mistreatment of immigrants by SEF suggested a systemic problem. The EU’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture has identified “a considerable number of credible allegations of ill-treatment by police officers” in Portugal, which it says are “not infrequent and not the result of a few rogue officers”.

REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's announcement on Monday that he was running for office again in next month's election may have been long anticipated - but confirming his candidacy at a Lisbon bakery was not. Rebelo de Sousa, known for his fondness for selfies and sometimes light-hearted media appearances, had been hoping to make the announcement at a bookshop, but with most businesses shut due to coronavirus rules, he opted for a video from a well-known bakery near his office. \"This is the portrait of the times of restrictions we live in,\" said Rebelo de Sousa, 71, who his tipped to win a second term. \"I'm a candidate ... because we have a pandemic to face, we have an economic and social crisis to overcome.\" First elected in 2016, Rebelo de Sousa, a law professor, TV commentator and former leader of opposition party Social Democrats (PSD), is popular among the Portuguese, rarely missing a social gathering. Still, he has been criticised in the past for some of his conservative views on issues such as abortion and on occasion for not holding the government and parties to account, most recently when PSD struck a political agreement with far-right party Chega in the Azores archipelago. Rebelo de Sousa is running against eight candidates, including Ana Gomes, a former European Parliament member, and Andre Ventura, Chega's leader and former soccer commentator. In a survey by pollsters Aximage for TSF radio and Jornal de Noticias newspaper, Rebelo de Sousa was in the lead on voting intentions, with 62.1%, followed by Gomes on 16.3% and Ventura getting 6.6%.

        "text": "Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nFUNCHAL, Portugal (AP) — Cristiano Ronaldo now has an international airport named after him.\nThe Real Madrid striker was joined Wednesday by dozens of guests and hundreds of fans in his native Madeira Islands for an official ceremony renaming the local airport as Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo.\nPortugal’s president and the prime minister flew to the island and unveiled a commemorative plaque outside the terminal entrance, above an odd-looking bust of Ronaldo that attracted attention because it hardly does the handsome footballer justice.\nThe bronze bust squashes the player’s eyes close together, and the cheeky raised-eyebrow smile more resembles a leer. The face is also unusually chubby, in contrast to Ronaldo’s chiseled looks.\nRonaldo didn’t seem to be bothered by the look of the bust, but the weird-looking statue quickly went viral on social media.\nAn image of Ronaldo was also added to the airport’s main facade.\nThe 32-year-old Ronaldo is a local hero in Madeira, where he is seen as a rags-to-riches success. He already has a statue, a museum and a hotel named for him in Madeira.\n“You know how proud I am of my roots, my homeland,” Ronaldo, wearing a dark suit and tie, said in a speech.\nThe four-time player of the year has made a record 138 national team appearances for Portugal and is the team’s top scorer with 71 goals.\nThe name change was decided by the Madeira regional government after Portugal won the 2016 European Championship. Critics said a more distinguished historical figure would be more appropriate. Petitions were started for and against the change.\n\n\nRonaldo acknowledged that it was rare for a public figure to be honored while still alive, saying he was aware that some people didn’t agree with the change.\nHowever, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the tribute was legitimate because it was decided by an elected government.\nRebelo de Sousa said in his speech that Ronaldo is “an example of excellence” and “projects Madeira and Portugal across the world far more than anybody else.”\nRonaldo is not the first soccer player with his name on an airport. In Northern Ireland, an airport was renamed George Best Belfast City Airport in 2006, a year after the local player and former Manchester United winger died.\nIn Funchal, the regional government provided transport to the outdoor ceremony for schoolchildren and elderly people at care homes. Also present were players and officials from the local Andorinha soccer club, where Ronaldo started when he was 7 years old.\nTourism is the economic mainstay of Madeira, which lies about 500 kilometers (310 miles) off the northwest coast of Africa. About 2.5 million passengers use the airport annually. The terminal is a low, two-story building next to an oceanside runway where landings are famous for sometimes being hairy because of crosswinds.\nOn Tuesday, Ronaldo scored a goal in Portugal’s 3-2 loss to Sweden in a friendly that marked the player’s first match with the national team in his hometown of Funchal, where he grew up sharing a room with his older brother and two older sisters before moving to the mainland to join the youth squads of Sporting Lisbon.\nFrom there, he made it to Manchester United and eventually to Real Madrid, becoming one of the world’s biggest soccer stars. He received his fourth world player of the year award in January.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

Goncalo Amaral was ordered to pay €500,000 (£429,000) in compensation to Kate and Gerry McCann in 2015 by a Lisbon court over claims he made in his book and documentary about Madeleine, who vanished on the Algarve in 2007. The decision was overturned following an appeal last year but the McCanns took the case to Portugal’s supreme court, which has now found against them. While the judges’ official ruling is yet to be published, lawyers for the McCanns have been informed of their decision. “What we have been told by our lawyers is obviously extremely disappointing,” the couple said in a statement. “It is eight years since we brought the action and in that time the landscape has dramatically changed, namely there is now a joint Metropolitan police-Policia Judiciaria investigation which is what we’ve always wanted. “The police in both countries continue to work on the basis that there is no evidence that Madeleine has come to physical harm. We will, of course, be discussing the implications of the supreme court ruling with our lawyers in due course.” Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on 3 May 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance, released the book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body.

Photograph: Mario Cruz/EPA United Nations This article is more than 7 years old Will António Guterres be the UN's best ever secretary general? This article is more than 7 years old Cultured and consensual, the Portuguese politician has had the perfect preparation for the United Nations’ top job Angelique Chrisafis and Julian Borger Sun 1 Jan 2017 07.00 GMT Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 08.23 GMT Share W hen António Guterres resigned halfway through his second term as Portuguese prime minister in 2002 because his minority government was floundering, he did something unusual for a man who had seen the highest reaches of power. Several times a week, he went to slum neighbourhoods on the edge of Lisbon to give free maths tuition to children. “He never allowed a journalist to go with him or let himself be filmed or photographed, and he never let journalists talk to any of his students,” said Ricardo Costa, editor-in-chief of the Portuguese SIC News, who covered Guterres’s political career. The former prime minister told his surprised students that what he was doing was personal and not for show. The Portuguese socialist, who becomes the next UN secretary general on Sunday, is an intellectual who grew up under Portugal ’s dictatorship and came of age with the 1974 revolution that ended 48 years of authoritarian rule. Crucial to understanding Guterres, 67, is his Christian faith: his progressive Catholicism always informed his brand of social democratic politics. In the heady days of Portugal’s revolution, it was rare to be a practising Catholic in a new Socialist party where many members had Marxist backgrounds. But Guterres, a star engineering student who grew a moustache in honour of the Chilean left’s Salvador Allende, would eventually become a modernising leader, arguing that his mission was social justice and equality. On the Portuguese left, faith was a delicate issue that required discretion. Under Guterres, the country held a referendum in 1998 on a proposal to liberalise the strict abortion laws. Socialist MPs had a free vote and, as prime minister, Guterres chose not to officially campaign. But it was publicly known that he opposed changing the law, which irked many in his party. The no vote against liberalising the abortion law narrowly won, but turnout was so low that the result was not binding. Abortion laws were finally relaxed in 2007 after a second referendum. Born in Lisbon, Guterres spent stretches of his childhood with relatives in the countryside, where he saw the poverty of rural life under the dictatorship, and later volunteered with Catholic student groups on social projects in the capital. In 1976, the young engineering lecturer was elected a Socialist MP in Portugal’s first democratic vote since the revolution. In parliament, he was a fearsome orator. Such was his talent for verbally destroying political opponents, he became known as “the talking pickaxe”. View image in fullscreen Tony Blair shares a laugh with António Guterres at the start of the Congress of the Socialist International in Paris in November 1999. Photograph: Laurent Rebours/AP Guterres became prime minister in 1995. His campaign slogan was “heart and reason”, a cry for more humanism and social politics. Three years earlier he had taken over the Socialist party and modernised it, although he remained to the left of contemporaries such as Tony Blair . For years he led the Socialist International international grouping of leftwing parties. With Portugal’s rapid economic growth and nearly full employment, Guterres was able to set up a guaranteed minimum income and nursery schooling for all. But he had failed to win an absolute majority and was condemned to preside over a tricky minority government. He had to rely on his skill for consensus, always having to negotiate with the opposition parties if he wanted to get anything passed – something he later argued was perfect training for running the UN. “He was a skilful person – very smart, very quick to understand the other point of view and very focused on having solutions – that’s why it worked,” said António Vitorino, Guterres’s deputy prime minister and defence minister. Guterres was furiously hardworking. But behind this was a backdrop of family tragedy. His wife, Luísa Guimarães e Melo, a psychiatrist with whom he had two children, had been critically ill for most of his time in government and was undergoing treatment at a London hospital. “It was one of the hardest moments of his political life,” Vitorino said. “Every Friday morning, he took a plane to London, spent the weekend there in a very desperate situation and then on Monday morning he was back at work. I was his deputy prime minister, I was amazed. I could never have done what he was doing.” In 1998, Guterres’s wife died. The following year, he threw himself into the general elections. He had hoped to win an outright majority but the Socialists ended up one MP short and began a second minority government. This time, a slowdown in the economy made things harder. Guterres, privately growing disillusioned with internal party politics, turned increasingly to his interest in international diplomacy. He had already won praise for his role in resolving the crisis in Timor-Leste , a former Portuguese colony, which had erupted into violence in 1999 after a referendum vote in favour of independence from Indonesia. Guterres led diplomatic efforts to convince the UN to intervene to restore peace. In 2000, when Portugal took the rotating presidency of the European Union , its success was attributed to Guterres’s ability to get big leaders to agree and smaller leaders to be heard. View image in fullscreen António Guterres is cheered after his party won Portugal’s general elections in October 1999. Photograph: Armando Franca/AP “He did something very original: he looked at what every country wanted and set up an agenda that could be interesting for everyone,” said Francisco Seixas da Costa, a Portuguese diplomat who served as Guterres’s European affairs secretary. “Small countries disappear in the decision-making process so we tried to listen to their interests.” Guterres managed to talk down powerful leaders at loggerheads. “At the European council, I remember a conflict between Jacques Chirac and Helmut Kohl over one issue,” Seixas da Costa said. “Guterres asked for the floor. I was sitting next to him, I was afraid it might be naive. But he took the floor and made a proposal that covered both their interests, and it was a success. It worked. He had a fantastic capacity to moderate and create links and bridges.” In 2002, halfway through his second term as prime minister, Guterres abruptly resigned after the Socialists suffered a drubbing in local elections. He famously said he wanted to avoid the country falling into a “political swamp” and that he had discovered “politics has its limits”. At the time he was unpopular, criticised for too much compromise and too much dialogue. But over the years since his departure, polls showed he was increasingly liked and seen as fair, serious and honest – a possible contender for Portuguese president, although he never wanted to return to national politics, preferring, he said, to make a difference on the world stage. His decade serving as UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) from 2005 to 2015 was seen in Portugal as an obvious fit for his personality: socially engaged but seeking common ground. Guterres – who speaks Portuguese, English, French and Spanish and is now remarried to Catarina Vaz Pinto, who works at Lisbon city hall – was known in political circles for enthusiastic, cultured conversations on everything from ancient Greece to Middle Eastern culture, opera to geography. Whenever he had free time during visits to Washington as UNHCR chief, he would get the organisation’s regional representative, Michel Gabaudan, to take him to Politics & Prose or another of the city’s bookshops. “He’s an avid reader of history, and his pleasure was, if we had an hour, to go to a bookshop, so we would have access to books in English that weren’t easy to get in Geneva,” said Gabaudan, now president of Refugees International. “I’m sure this immense knowledge of past and ancient history did inform his political judgment.” Guterres also took a broad approach to the UNHCR’s responsibilities. The organisation grew dramatically under his management, and not just because the number of the world’s refugees soared in the 21st century. He broadened the categories of people the UNHCR would seek to protect, including internally displaced people and migrants forced from their homes by natural disasters and climate change. He preferred the all-encompassing phrase “people on the move”. He managed to persuade donors to fund the expansion by retaining their confidence that the money was well spent, and to do that he cut overheads.

Photograph: Radu Sigheti/Reuters “Like all UN organisations, as the organisation had grown up, it had become a little bit top-heavy and one of his first actions was really to slim down headquarters fairly substantially. He sent people back to the field and he put some of the services in much cheaper places than Geneva,” Gabaudan said. “He never thought the details of finance were just for the technicians. I saw him looking at spreadsheets faster than his financial officer, spotting the line or column where we had a problem. So he was really as much hands-on about how the organisation worked as he was the top political figure and spokesman for refugees.” When Justin Forsyth was chief executive of Save the Children UK, he travelled with Guterres to refugee camps in Lebanon, and recalled Guterres meeting a group of children. “The thing that struck me was him cross-legged on the floor of a tent talking to children. He really listens and he asks questions and he’s very moved by what he hears. He gets his hands dirty,” said Forsyth, the new deputy executive director of Unicef, the UN children’s charity. Guterres’s tenure as high commissioner has attracted some criticism. Some former officials said he should have spoken out more strongly in defence of refugee rights enshrined in the 1951 refugee convention. “His record is very mixed, particularly on protection. His tenure was a rough time for the protection of refugees,” a former senior UN official said. He pointed to Thailand forcibly repatriating ethnic Uighurs to China despite the risk they would face persecution. He argued that a tripartite agreement the UNHCR made with Kenya and Somalia on the voluntary return of Somali refugees had paved the way for the reported forced repatriations now under way in Kenya aimed at emptying its biggest camp, at Dadaab. The former official said the EU’s deal with Turkey to repatriate refugees, also widely seen as a violation of basic principles of refugee protection, was largely negotiated while Guterres was at the helm, even if it was only signed in March this year, three months after he left. “His style is to make general statements on the issue but not to directly challenge governments on their actions,” the former official said. “It raises concerns on what he would be like as secretary general.” Jeff Crisp, who was head of UNHCR policy development and evaluation under Guterres and is now a research associate at the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre, said not all the criticisms could be pointed at the secretary general designate. He said the UNHCR did push back against infringements of refugee rights by European states and had been strongly critical of the EU-Turkey deal. And he argued the tendency to address abuses by authoritarian states by behind-the-scenes persuasion had historically been the “institutional approach” taken by the UNHCR, before and after Guterres. “I think you have to understand that UNHCR’s public criticism of states is very carefully calibrated and in general the more liberal a state is, the more publicly the UNHCR will criticise it,” Crisp said. View image in fullscreen Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, and Guterres speak during a meeting in Madrid. Photograph: AFP/Getty Adaptable, consensual, affable, intellectual, Guterres is perhaps better qualified than any of his nine predecessors for the world’s most demanding job. But one of his deftest skills he learned not from the hurly burly of Portuguese politics, nor from the harrowing years at the UNHCR, but from his first wife. At a Guardian event last June in which he debated with rivals for the secretary general job, he said her psychoanalytical insights were highly valuable. “She taught me something that was extremely useful for all my political activities. When two people are together, they are not two but six. What each one is, what each one thinks he or she is and what each one thinks the other is,” he said. “And what is true for people is also true for countries and organisations. One of the roles of the secretary general when dealing with the different key actors in each scenario is to bring these six into two. That the misunderstandings disappear and the false perceptions disappear. Perceptions are essential in politics.” Explore more on these topics United Nations Portugal Europe features Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank successfully completed the takeover of Portugal's second-largest listed lender, Banco BPI, paying 645 million euros ($690 million) to raise its stake to 84.5 percent from 45 percent, the two banks said on Wednesday. \"This acquisition has a lot of financial logic, we're talking about two institutions that complete each other perfectly,\" CEO of Caixabank, Gonzalo Cortazar, told a news conference, adding that the Portuguese market \"has potential\". The takeover took nearly two years to complete and was designed to boost Caixabank revenues outside Spain, where it faces stiff competition for lending. The Barcelona-based lender was one of Spain's most acquisitive banks during the financial crisis, and has struggled to offset falling profitability at home by buying smaller savings banks. It launched its first bid for BPI in 2015 at 1.329 euros per share, but opposition by some shareholders, notably Angolan investor Isabel dos Santos, forced it to withdraw that bid last year, only to make a lower final offer of 1.134 euros a share. Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's president, had a stake of about 20 percent in the Portuguese bank. It was not immediately clear whether she was fully bought out. BPI CEO Fernando Ulrich will step down, but Caixabank proposed that he be elected chairman of the board at BPI, which will keep its decision-making centre in Portugal. Caixabank has said it expects savings of up to 84 million euros a year from merger synergies, including up to 45 million euros from 900 layoffs as businesses are combined. Caixabank ended 2016 with a fully-loaded capital ratio - a measure of a bank's strength under the strictest capital rules - of 12.4 percent and expected the ratio to fall by up to 80-140 basis points, depending on the take-up of the BPI bid. Although not immune to problems affecting Portugal's notoriously fragile banking sector, BPI has long finished paying off its state loans, while its larger rivals Millennium bcp and state-owned CGD still owe money to the state. BPI had a 33 percent rise in 2016 net profit as net interest income rose while impairments for bad loans fell sharply. Its fully-loaded capital ratio at the end of 2016 was 11.1 percent. Before the completion of the takeover, BPI handed control of its lucrative Angolan unit BFA to Angolan telecoms firm Unitel to meet requirements by the European Central Bank on risky exposure to the Angolan economy. Dos Santos also indirectly controls Unitel and the BFA deal was seen as a way of winning her approval for the takeover. Shares in BPI closed 6.58 percent lower before the announcement, on expectations it would drop out of Lisbon's PSI20 leading stock index. Caixabank shares fell 1 percent.

The new entity would rank above the central bank, the CMVM stock market regulator and the authority which supervises insurance and pension funds. The changes, which would take the responsibility of bank rescues and oversight of overall financial stability away from the Bank of Portugal, could potentially go against efforts to assign more banking sector supervision in the eurozone to European institutions. Finance Minister Mario Centeno said the change was necessary after recent high-profile bank failures \"oblige us to return to question the efficiency of the supervisory system.\" Centeno told parliament the new supervisor would be independent and replace two existing councils that oversee the financial system. They include members from the central bank, finance ministry and market regulators. \"This new entity would have ultimate responsibility for financial stability and should function as the macroprudential authority and national resolution authority,\" Centeno said. The proposal comes after a series of high-profile bank collapses in recent years, including Portugal's largest private sector bank Banco Espirito Santo (BES) in 2014 and Madeira-based Banif in 2015. The state injected 3.9 billion euros into the rescue of BES and 2.2 billion euros into Banif. The central bank has faced criticism at home for failing to foresee those failures. The minister said the bank failures \"gave evidence of various failures in financial regulation and supervision, weakening the credibility of national authorities which were responsible for the relevant functions.\" The Bank of Portugal is currently the institution which carries out bank rescues, and is now in the final stage of selling Novo Banco, the 'good bank' which was created after the collapse of Banco Espirito Santo in 2014.

Leg one had featured six different rally leaders in as many stages and a point where eight cars were within 8.9 seconds in a constantly fluctuating battle up front. That began to break up on Friday afternoon, when Jari-Matti Latvala rolled his Toyota while second, Kris Meeke broke his Citroen's suspension while pushing to get back into the lead and Hayden Paddon's Hyundai was stopped by an electrical glitch for 11 minutes while a close third. Ott Tanak emerged from that chaos in the lead, despite slightly damaging his M-Sport Ford on Friday's penultimate full-length stage. Ogier had been as low as eighth while running first on the road, but started making progress through Friday afternoon. A stage win on Saturday's opener brought him up to second and to within 1.1s of his rally-leading team-mate. Tanak immediately fought back with a blistering time on the next stage that brought his lead back up to six seconds, but then on the stage after that he broke his Fiesta's rear suspension and tumbled out of victory contention. That left Ogier free to control the rest of the event. Neuville made his way through to second ahead of Hyundai team-mate Dani Sordo despite initially struggling with his smooth driving style on a rally that favoured a more sideways approach. That left him a baffled 12th on Friday morning before he adjusted his approach and regained ground. Tanak recovered to fourth - and secured three bonus points for the fastest time on the Powerstage - ahead of Craig Breen, who was in the lead fight before breaking a damper in his Citroen on Friday afternoon. Elfyn Evans was also in the thick of things early on, before two punctures - one of which he readily admitted he caused by going off the road - consigned him to sixth. Evans was not the only DMACK World Rally Car runner this time as Mads Ostberg made an eleventh-hour switch for his privately-entered Ford. A puncture dropped Ostberg back on Friday and he finished eighth. Toyota's first event with a three-car line-up brought seventh, ninth and 10th with Juho Hanninen, the delayed Latvala and Esapekka Lappi on his first start for the manufacturer. Newcomer Lappi matched Hanninen's pace for much of the weekend but a holed intercooler, struggling to restart after stalling once and then suspension damage cost him ground. Meeke and Paddon spent the weekend running well down the order under Rally2 after their Friday dramas, while Stephane Lefebvre was also well outside the points in the third Citroen following a leg one crash. Andreas Mikkelsen had utterly dominated WRC2 for Skoda and held a lead of more than three minutes, before a roll on the Powerstage gifted victory to his team-mate Pontus Tidemand.

Media caption, Gareth Roberts: 'You could hear the roar of the fire coming... we just sat and waited to die' Portugal has declared three days of mourning for the 62 victims of one of the country's deadliest forest fires. Four children are among the victims, many of whom were found dead inside their cars as they tried to flee the central forested region of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande. Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze on several fronts. Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it \"the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires\". He said it was thought to have been sparked by a lightning strike. Portugal fire survivor: 'I should have died' In pictures: Portugal forest fire Four firefighters are among the 54 people injured in the fire, which is raging in several parts of a mountainous area some 200km north-east of the capital Lisbon.

Media caption, Residents watch on as their homes blaze in Pedrogao Grande Image source, Reuters Image caption, The wildfires spread fast on Saturday, and across several fronts There are fears the death toll could rise, as a number of people are still missing. The period of national mourning ends on Tuesday. Bodies found inside cars Emergency service workers were battling 156 fires across the country on Sunday, Prime Minister Costa said, adding that most of the victims had died in just one of them. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that most had died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two were killed in a road accident related to the fires. Thirty bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway. Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway. Image source, EPA Image caption, Some of the hundreds of firefighters tackling the blaze were injured Image source, EPA Image caption, More than 50 people were injured More than 1,600 firefighters are fighting five of the main fires, supported by about 400 vehicles and 18 aircraft, Portugal's PÃºblico reports. According to the prime minister, just 11 fires are still active but he said the authorities were \"particularly worried about two of them\". They have sent two army battalions to help the emergency services. 'I could have died, I should have died' - fire survivor's tale As the power went off, the flames hit hard, a fiery red tornado passed the windows. We crouched on the floor for a good hour, trying to breathe, praying, crying. I am not ashamed to say it: I was praying, we were all praying. I am not religious, but at that time, you couldn't do anything else. I said: \"It can't end like this.\" I just started crying and got emotional - I was no use to anyone for 20 minutes. Eventually the fire passed and we emerged to see the smouldering remains of the village. Miraculously, our house and the one next door did not burn. The devastation was indescribable. People, bewildered, remains of homes burning uncontrollably, concrete posts exploding over roads. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. After the fire passed, it should still have been bright, but it was dark. There was a strange film over everyone's eyes. You could hear gas canisters exploding, see blue flashes going off. There was just a strange silence. There was a lull, a strange feeling. It then turned to relief, there was crying. Read more from Gareth Roberts, a Brit who survived the fires France has offered three firefighting planes, while Spain has already sent two water-bombing aircraft to help tackle the fires. The European Union has also promised to provide firefighting aircraft. Dozens of people who fled their homes have been taken in by residents of the nearby municipality of Ansiao. Pope Francis, who visited Portugal last month, mentioned the victims in his weekly address: \"I express my closeness to the beloved people of Portugal following the devastating fire.\" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: \"Solidarity with Portugal, hit by terrible fires. Our thoughts are with victims. France makes its aid available to Portugal.\" Image source, AFP/Getty Images Image caption, Firefighters pause as the wildfire continues behind them The fires began on Saturday during an intense heatwave and rainless thunderstorms, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. Police say lightning striking a tree may have caused the fire. \"This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,\" Valdemar Alves, the mayor of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency. \"I am completely stunned by the number of deaths.\" Are you in the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area?

        "text": "New chief will succeed incumbent President Jeroen Dijsselbloem in January, when the Dutchman’s mandate for the highly influential post ends.\t\t\t\nPortugal’s Finance Minister Mário Centeno will be the next president of the Eurogroup, after clinching a majority vote from his 18 eurozone peers in Brussels on Monday.\nCenteno will succeed the incumbent President Jeroen Dijsselbloem in the new year when the Dutchman’s mandate for the highly influential post ends. The term of the Eurogroup presidency is two and a half years.\nWhen he takes over on January 13, Centeno will be the first holder of the post from southern Europe and the first from one of the countries forced into a bailout by the euro crisis. The elevation of the 5o-year-old economist with a Harvard PhD is in part an acknowledgement of Portugal’s achievements in putting its economic house in order.\nOn Centeno’s watch, Portugal has seen unemployment tumble by over half since its 2013 peak to 8.5 percent — below the eurozone average. Growth is forecast at 2.6 percent his year, compared to 0.9 percent in 2014 when the country began to pull out of recession. In May, the European Commission removed Portugal from its excessive deficit blacklist for the first time since 2009.\nThe Eurogroup is an informal but powerful gathering of 19 eurozone finance ministers, who meet once a month to discuss major economic and monetary policies that cut across the bloc.\nThe finance ministers of Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Slovakia all announced their official bids for the presidency on Thursday, sparking surprise and uproar across the eurozone as backroom political deals got underway.\nTwo major tasks face the new president once he takes over.\nGreece is approaching the end of its €86 billion bailout program next summer and the new Eurogroup head will be responsible for overseeing that exit, while handling sensitive talks over debt relief to satisfy demands from the International Monetary Fund.\nCenteno will also have the tricky job of developing a common strategy for the future reform of the eurozone’s governance, like revamping the EU’s bailout arm and the potential creation of a new budget for the single currency bloc.\nCenteno gave a humble acceptance speech, saying that it was “an honor to be the next chair of the Eurogroup” and that he looked forward to working with his peers “to form a consensus” on the eurozone’s future.\nThe Council announced Centeno’s win following two rounds of voting, which eventually saw he and his counterpart from Luxembourg, Pierre Gramegna, in the final round.\nGermany’s acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier told reporters after the vote that Centeno had won the election “with a great majority,” but the Council said the final vote tally will not be made public.\nLatvia’s Dana Reizniece-Ozola withdrew her candidacy after the first round. As the next session of voting was about to start, Gramegna suddenly called for recess so that discussions could be held before the second round. Ministers withdrew for a 25-minute break.\nOnce they reconvened, Slovakia’s Peter Kažimír announced that he would withdraw from the race without explanation — leaving Gramegna and Centeno as the two final contenders for the coveted position. Kažimír’s own socialist camp had already agreed to back Centeno before the Slovak decided to mount a challenge anyway.\nCenteno quickly emerged victorious in the final voting.\nPortugal’s finance minister still faces one more election. The eurozone’s bailout arm, the European Stability Mechanism, will soon lose Dijsselbloem as chair of its board of governors.\nThe ESM’s chair is usually the same person as the head of the Eurogroup, but the other finance ministers on the board will still vote on Dijsselbloem’s successor in the coming months.\nKlaus Regling, the ESM’s managing director, brushed off any potential upset in this vote and told reporters that he had “no doubt that the result is very easy to foresee.”\nPaul Ames contributed reporting from Lisbon.\nInvestigation centers on reported payoff deal between former president of EIB and senior official.\nInvestigators raided Werner Hoyer’s house as part of an “abuse of influence” investigation.\nThe bid by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally to form the next French government challenges the European Commission to punish a country it has always let off the hook.\nBut idea remains under discussion ahead of G7 summit next week.",

The theft from the Tancos military complex, 60 miles (100km) north-east of Lisbon, was discovered last Wednesday. Reports suggest the complex’s CCTV system has been broken for the past two years. Portugal’s defence minister, José Azeredo Lopes, said the thieves cut through a perimeter fence, and he described the operation as “very professional” and a serious security breach. Lopes said Portugal’s partners in Nato and the EU had been informed of the incident. On Monday the Spanish news site El Español published an inventory of the missing items that it had obtained from Spanish counter-terrorism sources. Among the items were 1,450 9mm cartridges, 18 teargas grenades, 150 hand grenades, 44 anti-tank grenades and 264 units of plastic explosives. It said when Lopes was asked about the danger of the weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, he replied: “There’s no doubt that this material is now on its way into the illegal arms market and could later be used for many different purposes, such as [terrorism].” El Español said the Portuguese authorities had admitted that the video surveillance system had been out of commission for two years, and it said the military was stepping up security at its arsenals and would rebuild the perimeter fence at Tanco and install new CCTV apparatus. It said investigators were looking into whether the thieves used inside information on the arsenal’s contents. “Whoever stole the weapons knew what was in the stores,” said General Frederico Rovisco Duarte, the army’s chief of staff. “When they chose the two stores … which aren’t the closest ones to the entrance, conclusions have to be drawn.” Five military commanders have been suspended after the theft, although Rovisco Duarte said there was no suggestion that any of them had been involved in the crime. Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has called for a thorough investigation, saying: “There should be no doubt that this needs to be investigated all the way to the end when it comes to facts and responsibilities.” Explore more on these topics Portugal Europe news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

REUTERS/Hugo Correia/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON (Reuters) - Former Portuguese prime minister Jose Socrates was indicted on graft and money laundering charges on Wednesday in a vast corruption investigation that he has dismissed as politically-motivated. Socrates has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and his lawyer Joao Araujo said he would fight the charges contained in the more than 4,000-page indictment. \"The 4,000 pages are part of a spectacle, they only serve to make believe that there is something, when there is nothing,\" Araujo told reporters. The indictment, issued after a four-year inquiry, accuses Socrates of playing a pivotal role and receiving millions of euros in a scheme involving the disgraced former heads of the Espirito Santo banking empire and Portugal Telecom. Both entities have since ceased to exist, inflicting billions of euros in losses on taxpayers and shareholders, and their former top brass have been accused of other crimes in separate investigations. Socrates, a Socialist prime minister from 2005 to 2011, is charged with three counts of passive corruption while holding political office, 16 counts of money-laundering, nine counts of forging documents and three counts of tax fraud, committed between 2006 and 2015. A trial date has not yet been set. Prosecutors said Socrates gave illicit commercial benefits to a construction company, LENA, in return for payments received via middlemen, who were also indicted, via a Swiss bank account. A former top-level manager at state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos has also been charged with facilitating payments. Ricardo Salgado, former CEO of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) and head of the Espirito Santo banking family, is charged with paying Socrates to sway Portugal Telecom to follow a strategy defined by Salgado. Salgado is also accused of paying Portugal Telecom's former CEO Zeinal Bava and chairman Henrique Granadeiro - both of whom were also indicted. BES, which was a major shareholder in Portugal Telecom, collapsed in 2014 under a mountain of debt, causing a default of nearly 1 billion euros at Portugal Telecom, which has since been sold off. A total of 19 people and nine firms in the construction, resort development, consulting and investment sectors have been indicted. Salgado, the former Portugal Telecom executives and LENA have denied any wrongdoing. Socrates resigned as prime minister in the middle of his second four-year term in 2011 as an escalating debt crisis forced him to request an international bailout, which imposed painful austerity measures on Portugal. He was arrested in 2014 and spent months in prison before being shifted to house arrest. The Socialists regained power in 2015 under Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who was a minister in Socrates' first cabinet.

        "text": "Ex-PM Pedro Passos Coelho to go in December.\t\t\t\nLISBON — Portugal’s former Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho announced Tuesday he was stepping down as leader of Portugal’s main center-right opposition party, following its drubbing at the hands of the governing Socialists in local elections.\n“This result gives me no room to maneuver,” Passos Coelho told a news conference after a meeting of the national council of his Social Democratic Party (PSD). “We have to find a new path for the future.”\nHe acknowledged Sunday’s result was the worst ever for the Social Democrats. They fell to a humiliating third place in Lisbon and Porto, won mayoral office in only two of the country’s 15 most populous cities and captured just 98 out of 308 city halls.\nPassos Coelho will stay on until the party picks a new leader early December.\nWhoever takes over will face the task of overcoming the legacy of unpopularity associated with the austerity policies followed by Passos Coelho as prime minister from 2011 to 2015.\nAlthough his strict application of measures to reduce the budget deficit in line with eurozone demands are credited by some with saving the economy from collapse during the darkest days of the European debt crisis, they are also widely blamed for record levels of unemployment, falling living standards and widespread hardship.\nBy late 2015, however, the economy was slowly beginning to pick up. Passos Coelho’s center-right coalition actually came first in the parliamentary election held in October that year. Then he was outflanked by Socialist leader António Costa, who formed a minority government with the backing of the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc.\nWith Costa as prime minister, the economy soared, with growth expected to hit 3 percent this year, unemployment falling, and exports and tourism booming.\nPassos Coelho remained fatally associated in the minds of many voters with the grim austerity era. Sunday’s election showed the party’s power-brokers the PSD had to change to survive.\n“His time is up,” Ângelo Correia, an influential PSD insider, told Antena 1 radio Tuesday.\nLeading the race to take over as opposition leader is Rui Rio, 60, a party veteran who served as mayor of Porto from 2001 to 2013. Outside the national government, he’s less sullied with the taint of austerity.\nHe’s likely to face younger challengers, including Paulo Rangel, 49, a member of the European Parliament; Luís Montenegro, 44, the Social Democrats’ deputy parliamentary leader who is close to Passos Coelho; and party Vice President Marco António Costa, 50 (no relation to the prime minister).\nAnother veteran, Pedro Santana Lopes, who had an unhappy seven-month stint as prime minister in 2005, was reported to be pondering a comeback.\nRiding high in the polls, Prime Minister Costa can, for now, sit back and watch the maneuvering in the opposition. But the PSD’s next leader could present him with a bigger challenge than the unpopular Passos Coelho.\nCosta also faces the prospect of discomfort on the left, with signs the Communists and Left Bloc are taking a harder line with the government following their disappointing showing in Sunday’s election.\nHow the Portuguese Socialist leader upset the odds to win a rare majority government.\nSocialist Party wins absolute majority, but far right makes gains.\nAntónio Costa looks set for third term. \nSocialists’ poll lead narrows in runup to Sunday’s legislative vote.",

Constanca Urbano de Sousa handed her resignation to socialist prime minister Antonio Costa Wednesday, bowing to increasing political pressure as the death toll mounted . “After this summer, nothing can remain as before,” said Costa, who initially resisted the demand for Urbano de Sousa to go before backing down while admitting the state service providers had made “serious errors” in tackling the problem. “If you want me to apologise, then I apologise,” Costa said speaking in parliament while Urbano de Sousa lamented in a resignation letter not having “the political and personal conditions necessary to carry out my functions.” View image in fullscreen Constanca Urbano de Sousa attends a parliament debate in Lisbon. Photograph: Armando Franca/AP She will be replaced by deputy prime minister Eduardo Cabrita, the government announced on Wednesday. On Sunday, a series of deadly wildfires broke out in the centre and north of the country which killed 42 people and injured another 71, the civil protection agency said. Similar huge blazes in June killed 64 people and injured 250 near the central Pedrogao Grande region, in what were the deadliest wildfires in the country’s history. In all, some 280,000 hectares (690,000 acres) of forest in Portugal’s central Pinhal interior region have been laid waste so far this year in the country’s worst natural disaster in living memory, according to European monitors. One-month-old baby among at least 32 killed in Portugal and Spain fires Read more The fires have prompted a rural exodus, said professor Rui Amaro Alves, a specialist in land management at the Castelo Branco Polytechnic Institute. “Those who have stayed behind are mainly the elderly in scores of little villages right in the forest,” Alves said. With so many having fled the land lies all but abandoned and recent severe drought afflicting the area has only exacerbated the problem. Most of the area is home to pine and eucalyptus, with the increasingly dominant latter, a mainstay of the paper industry, especially flammable. Carlos Fonseca, a 42-year-old biologist who owns land in the area, noted that areas where strawberry trees had been planted in place of eucalyptus had proved more resistant to the flames and said such measures should be taken “on a larger scale.” After the tragedy in June, the government came under mounting criticism for failing to develop a coherent strategy to fight forest fires, which has further sharpened over its inability to prevent another devastating disaster in recent days. On Tuesday evening, hundreds gathered in Lisbon under the pouring rain to demonstrate their anger over the government’s failings, shouting “Shame!” and “Resign!” in a protest organised through Facebook. “A hundred people are dead and nobody is taking responsibility... We need answers!” one demonstrator said on national television. On Monday, promised to prevent new tragedies by carrying out “fundamental reforms” in forest management and firefighting. But a day later, conservative President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the socialist government should “bear all the consequences of this tragedy”. Portugal on Tuesday began three days of national mourning for the victims.

The two sunbathers, a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl, died while others ran into the sea when the plane came down on Wednesday. Hundreds of sunbathers were on the popular São João da Caparica beach, 12 miles (20km) to the south of Lisbon, at the time. Officials said they were not aware of any other injuries. “A plane with two people on board made an emergency landing on São João da Caparica beach, striking two sunbathers and causing their deaths,” Portugal’s national maritime authority said in a statement. “It happened very fast, there was no chance to prepare ... to run,” Enrique Coelho, who was playing with his son at the beach and saw the plane crash, told local media. The victims were hit by the plane, the commander of the port of Lisbon, Jose Isabel, confirmed. The two occupants of the plane were unhurt and were being questioned by officers from Portugal’s national maritime police. The small aircraft, a Cessna, appeared to be in difficulty and wobbled as it skimmed low over the sunbathers, scattering them and spreading panic on the beach, witnesses said. The plane appeared to have a partly broken left wing, which hung lower than the right wing, according to Portuguese TV pictures. Local reports said the aircraft was registered to a flying school in Torres Vedras. The Portuguese newspaper Diário de Notícias reported that the Aerocondor aviation school in Cascais had confirmed the aircraft – a Cessna CS–AVA – was “on a training flight with one student and one senior instructor”, who had “high experience and thousands of hours of flying time”. The dead girl was with her parents, who were unhurt, witnesses told local media. The plane passed over the dead man’s legs as he sunbathed on a towel, they said.One witness, Rita Rogado, 20, told the Público newspaper that the plane crashed right by the sea, dragging her along for a few metres in the sand. Some sunbathers said the plane appeared to be gliding, as they heard no engine noise. This article was amended on 3 August 2017. An earlier version said São João da Caparica beach was 20 miles south of Lisbon. This has been corrected to 12 miles.

Five people were in intensive care after contracting the severe form of pneumonia while interned at the São Francisco Xavier hospital in Lisbon's western Restelo area. Most of the 34 confirmed cases involved elderly people with other chronic conditions. The authorities said experts were working to establish the source of the bacteria and it was still too early to say whether it was inside the hospital itself. In 2014, Portugal's worst ever outbreak - also one of the world's largest - of Legionnaires' disease killed 10 people and infected a total of 336 people. It was traced back to industrial cooling towers at the Vila Franca de Xira area just northeast of Lisbon. Most of those infected lived or worked in the area. The disease is contracted by breathing in a mist or vapour contaminated with the Legionella bacteria, which can grow in cooling towers, showers, spas, hot tubs and other water sources. It is not transmitted directly from person to person. Elderly people and those in poor health are the most vulnerable. The illness is named after a 1976 outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia, which killed 34 people.

The wildfires in central Portugal left 64 people dead and more than 200 injured . The Data Protection Commission insists that only the families of the victims should be allowed to read the 96 pages of Chapter Six, which details how people died in or escaped from the fires, citing the constitutional right to privacy.

        "text": "Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nThis 2003 electron microscope image made available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows mature, oval-shaped monkeypox virions, left, and spherical immature virions, right, obtained from a sample of human skin associated with the 2003 prairie dog outbreak. Monkeypox, a disease that rarely appears outside Africa, has been identified by European and American health authorities in recent days. (Cynthia S. Goldsmith, Russell Regner/CDC via AP)\nLISBON, Portugal (AP) — Portuguese health authorities on Wednesday confirmed five cases of monkeypox in young men, and Britain announced two more new cases, marking an unusual outbreak in Europe of a disease typically limited to Africa. \nPortugal’s General Directorate for Health said that it was also investigating 15 suspected cases and that all were identified this month in the area around the capital, Lisbon.\nAll the Portuguese cases involve men, most of them young, authorities said. They have skin lesions and were reported to be in stable condition. Officials did not say if the men had a history of travel to Africa or any links with recent cases in Britain or elsewhere. \nIn the U.S. on Wednesday, state health officials in Massachusetts reported a case of monkeypox in a resident who had traveled to Canada, and investigators are looking into whether it is connected to the European outbreaks.\nBritish health authorities said Wednesday they had identified two new cases of monkeypox, one in London and another in southeast England. They said that neither patient had previously traveled to Africa and that it was possible they were infected in the U.K. The cases had no known links to other previously confirmed patients, suggesting there may be multiple chains of monkeypox transmission happening in the country. \nDr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser of Britain’s Health Security Agency, said the latest cases, alongside the other infections reported in Europe, “confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities.” \n\n\nThe agency said recent cases had been seen “predominantly in gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men,” although it noted it was unclear how exactly people had been infected. \nMonkeypox has not previously been documented to have spread through sex, but can be transmitted through close contact with infected people, their clothing or bedsheets.\nEarlier this week the U.K. agency reported four cases of monkeypox they said had been spread among gay and bisexual men in London. The agency said the risk to the general population “remains low.”\nHealth authorities in Spain’s central Madrid region said late Wednesday that they were assessing 23 possible cases of monkeypox. They said that all of the suspected cases are young men and that the majority of them had sex with other men. \nThe disease belongs to a family of viruses that includes smallpox. Most people recover from monkeypox within weeks, but the World Health Organization says the disease is fatal for up to one in 10 infected people. Sporadic cases of monkeypox have been seen previously in countries including Britain and the U.S., but nearly all have been in people who were likely infected during their travels in Africa.\nDr. Ibrahim Soce Fall, the WHO’s assistant director-general for emergency response, said the spread of monkeypox in the U.K. needed to be investigated to understand how the disease was being transmitted among men who have sex with other men. \nFall said health officials also still need a better understanding of how monkeypox spreads in general, even in the countries where it is endemic. \nHe noted that while there were more than 6,000 reported cases in Congo and about 3,000 cases in Nigeria last year, there are still “so many unknowns in terms of the dynamics of transmission.” \nBritain previously reported three earlier cases of monkeypox, two involving people who lived in the same household and the third someone who had traveled to Nigeria, where the disease occurs frequently in animals.\nThe virus has typically spread to people from infected animals like rodents, although human-to-human transmission has been known to occur. \nSome British experts said it was too soon to conclude that monkeypox had spread through sexual contact, although the outbreak there suggested that possibility. \n“The recent cases suggest a potentially novel means of spread,” Neil Mabbott, a disease expert at the University of Edinburgh, said, adding that related viruses were known to spread via sex. \nKeith Neal, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Nottingham, said the transmission might not have occurred through sexual activity but just “the close contact associated with sexual intercourse.” \nMonkeypox typically causes fever, chills, a rash and lesions on the face or genitals resembling those caused by smallpox. A vaccine developed against smallpox has been approved for monkeypox, and several anti-virals also appear to be effective. \nCheng reported from London.

REUTERS/Pedro Nunes [1/5] Portugal's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PS) Secretary General Antonio Costa speaks to media before the announcement of the results of the general elections, in Lisbon, Portugal, January 30, 2022. REUTERS/Pedro Nunes Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Defying all odds, Portugal's centre-left Socialists won an outright parliamentary majority in Sunday's snap general election, securing a strong new mandate for Prime Minister Antonio Costa, a champion of balanced public accounts. The result, boosted by a higher than expected turnout despite the coronavirus pandemic, comes as a surprise after the Socialists had lost most of their advantage in recent opinion polls, and means Portugal will have a stable government to oversee the application of EU pandemic recovery funds. The vote was called in November after Costa's hard-left former Communist and Left Bloc allies joined the right in striking down his minority government's budget. The two far left parties paid the price, losing more than a half of their seats, according to exit polls. After last week's opinion polls Costa had himself acknowledged that Portuguese did not want to give him a full majority and said he was prepared to strike alliances with like-minded parties, which is no longer necessary. \"An absolute majority doesn't mean absolute power. It doesn't mean to govern alone. It's an increased responsibility and it means to govern with and for all Portuguese,\" Costa said in his victory speech. Before the final results came in, Costa said the party had won 117 or 118 seats in the 230-seat parliament, up from 108 won in the 2019 election, and his supporters erupted in loud celebrations, singing old revolutionary anthem \"Grandola\" and waving flags. Costa, who came to power in 2015 in the aftermath of a 2011-14 debt crisis, has presided over a period of steady economic growth that helped shrink the budget deficit and even eke out a small surplus in 2019, before the pandemic struck. Still, Portugal remains western Europe's poorest country and relies on EU pandemic recovery funds. Economist Filipe Garcia, head Informacao de Mercados Financeiros consultants in Porto, said investors would likely appreciate Costa's new strong mandate, given the government's record cutting of the budget deficit. \"Furthermore, the Socialists will not need to compromise (with other parties), which guarantees stability and a clear line of action. The biggest challenge will be to promote potential growth,\" he said. The centre-right Social Democrats came a distant second at below 30% of the vote, according to provisional results, against the Socialists' around 42%. The far-right Chega emerged as the third-largest parliamentary force making a big leap from just one seat in the previous legislature to at least 11. A stable government would bode well for Portugal's access to a 16.6-billion-euro ($18.7 billion) package of EU pandemic recovery aid and its success in channelling funds into projects to boost economic growth. With more than a tenth of Portugal's 10 million people estimated to be isolating due to COVID-19, the government had allowed infected people to leave isolation and cast ballots in person , opens new tab , and electoral officials donned protection suits in the afternoon to receive them. Turnout was on track to beat 2019's record low 49% participation. As in many European countries, infections have spiked, although vaccination has kept deaths and hospitalisations lower than in earlier waves. Sign up here.

They pose a threat to our national security. It’s in our mutual interests to maintain diplomatic ties, but we will not accept Russian espionage on Danish soil.”\nSwedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde announced at a press briefing Tuesday that the country would also expel three Russian diplomats, because “they have not acted in accordance with the Vienna Convention and conducted illegal intelligence activities in Sweden.” \nLinde did not rule out more diplomats being sent back to Moscow, but said such a decision would have to be examined in light of Sweden’s interests in keeping diplomats in Russia.\nLatvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs announced that his country would close the two Russian consular posts in Daugavpils and Liepāja. “The diplomatic staff of those Consulates General are declared persona non grata in Latvia,” a statement read. Thirteen Russian diplomats are being expelled. Its Baltic neighbor Estonia expelled 14 staff from its consulates, including seven diplomats. They have until April 30 to leave the country.\nSpain, meanwhile, said it would expel 25 Russian envoys, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday.\nThey are the latest European countries to expel Russian diplomats. On Monday, the German government made a similar move and sent 40 diplomats back to Moscow, while France kicked out 35 diplomats, saying that their activities were “against our national interests.”\nOn Tuesday, France’s EU Minister Clément Beaune said that the expulsions “were already discussed and looked at” in consultation with other countries including Germany, but that it was “not only directly related to [the atrocities committed by Russian troops in] Bucha.”\nBeaune added that “in some territories, there are people presented as diplomats who were, or could be, threatening our essential interests.”\nLithuania, meanwhile, expelled on Monday Russia’s ambassador to Vilnius and recalled its top envoy to Moscow. \nGiorgio Leali and Victor Jack contributed reporting.\nThis article has been updated.\nHer reappointment could be approved in mid-December, but the U.S. or another WTO member could still object.\nMEPs resort to mutually assured destruction to get Jessika Roswall and Hadja Lahbib through their parliamentary hearings.\n“Tariff Man” gives the EU flashbacks after conflict-ridden first term.\nTrump may cut Europe out of America’s subsidy splurge, but EU industries aren’t seeing many benefits yet anyway.",

PJ did not identify the suspect, who according to local media is Portuguese. In a statement, the agency said he had multiple illegal weapons in his possession, as well as other objects that could have been used to carry out the attack. \"The suspect, who was arrested in 'flagrante delicto' for the possession of the weapons, was also charged with the crime of terrorism,\" it said. The police said the suspect's target were students of the faculty of sciences of Universidade de Lisboa, the largest university in the country. The suspect hoped to conduct the attack on Friday but PJ said it managed to stop him before he moved forward with the plan. \"Given the seriousness of the suspicions, the highest priority was given to the investigation, which allowed (PJ) to stop the criminal activity in the early hours of today,\" it said, adding he would appear before a judge on Friday. Portugal is ranked the fourth most peaceful country in the world by the Global Peace Index, and attacks of this kind are extremely rare. Publico newspaper, citing a PJ source, said the suspect was an avid consumer of information about school shootings that often take place in the United States. Sign up here.

More than 11,000 people have been forced to leave France's south-western Gironde region in the past few days. Dozens of fires are burning in Portugal and Spain where temperatures have surged above 40C. At least 281 deaths in both countries were linked to the heat and several towns in western Spain were evacuated. Portuguese villagers were also told to flee when flames crossed the border from Spain. The head of France's firefighters' federation has warned of the impact global warming is having on civil protection. \"It's firefighters, civil security who deal with the effects on a daily basis - and these effects aren't in 2030, they're right now,\" said Grégory Allione. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Firefighters in Spain fought to protect the town of Monsagro as fires erupted further south in the Monfragüe national park, home to rare species of birds. The main N-5 route in Cáceres just east of the park was cut off when a forest fire reached the road. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter .

The Carlos III Health Institute said on Thursday that at least 43 people had died during the first two days of the latest heatwave, on Sunday and Monday, because of the heat. Health officials in Portugal recorded 238 deaths more than normal since 7 July which they attributed to the very hot and very dry conditions. The worst affected are the elderly, children and people with chronic diseases. Emergency officials said 187 had been injured because of the fires in the past week.

Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said an electric car was responsible for the fire at La Teste-de-Buch but prosecutors said a second fire at Landiras in the Gironde region was being classified as criminal. One holidaymaker, Matthias, told BFMTV how he and his son had been told to escape immediately: \"We started packing our things but the lady told us, no, you have to leave everything as it is.

Our morale is still good but fatigue sets in fast. That's why we're calling for a target of 250,000 volunteer firefighters,\" Mr Allione told RMC TV. Italy and Croatia have also reported forest fires this week, and eight people had to jump into the sea at Bibione on the Adriatic coast to escape the fire and smoke. Strong winds have greatly increased the risk of wildfires in five regions in Greece , civil protection officials have warned. Central Greece, Attica and Crete are among the areas most at risk and the fire brigade said they had counted 51 forest fires in the past 24 hours. Fires were reported in Crete and on the mainland in Attica on Friday.

More than 1000 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, were battling two massive blazes in south-western France that have been fanned by scorching heat, tinder-box conditions and strong winds. Fires burn out of control near Landiras, south of Bordeaux.

Some 13 wildfires were also burning out of control across the country. In Spain, the Environment Ministry said firefighters were tackling 17 wildfires. Officials were worried about the effects on people’s health and on healthcare systems already challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. From July 7 to July 13, Portugal registered 238 excess deaths due to the heatwave, the country’s DGS health authority said. “In this specific case, the excess can be attributed to the heatwave. In the last few days we have had very high, extreme temperatures ... and for a very long period,” DGS chief Graça Freitas told Lusa news agency. Firefighters resting in the mountains of Alvaiazere, Portugal.

The World Meteorological Organisation said the heatwave would trap atmospheric pollutants, degrading the air quality, especially in towns and cities.

A man finds shade in London. The British Met Office says temperatures won’t peak until next week. Credit: AP “Exceptional, perhaps record-breaking temperatures are likely early next week,” Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said. “Nights are also likely to be exceptionally warm, especially in urban areas. This is likely to lead to widespread impacts on people and infrastructure.” The highest recorded temperature in Britain was 38.7 degrees in Cambridge on July 25, 2019. That record could fall. Hannah Cloke, climate expert at the University of Reading, said the heatwave showed climate change is here and there is an urgent need to adapt. “We are seeing these problems now and they are going to get worse. We need to do something now,” she said. “It’s harder to cope with these types of temperatures in the UK because we’re just not used to them.” A Canadair CL-415 firefighting aircraft – brought in from Italy – in action near Gesteira de Baixo in Portugal.

Loading Some 7350 hectares of land have been burnt and authorities said the fires had not yet been stabilised. In Spain, the wildfires that have been burning in parts of Extremadura, which borders Portugal, and the central Castille and Leon region forced the evacuation of more small villages on Friday. The flames were threatening a 16th-century monastery and a national park. In Catalonia in the north-east, authorities suspended camping and sporting activities around 275 towns and villages to prevent fire risks and restricted farm work involving machinery. Areas of Galicia and Extremadura remained on extreme alert for temperatures expected to touch 44 degrees.

By Christine Theodorou and Teddy Grant July 19, 2022, 5:35 AM 1:45 Firefighters work against a wildfire near Landiras, southwestern France, July 16, 2022. SDIS 33 via AP As Western Europe experiences a record-breaking heat wave, Spain and Portugal have reported at least 1,169 heat-related deaths, according to each country's ministry of health. At least 510 people died from heat-related issues in Spain between July 10 and July 18, the country's health ministry said. Of those deaths, 273 were recorded on Friday, officials said. Another 659 heat-related deaths were recorded in Portugal between July 7 and July 17, local officials said. Thousands of firefighters were having trouble containing forest fires in France, Spain and Portugal that have destroyed thousands of acres of land. The fires have forced thousands of people to evacuate to safety, as extreme heat grips the region. In southern France, more than 14,000 people were forced to flee as fires spread to more than 27,180 acres of land. The country's Interior Ministry also issued red alerts for heat waves for 15 French departments and orange alerts for 51 departments on Sunday. France, reached a high of 40.8 degrees Celsius -- 105.44 Fahrenheit -- on Sunday. Temperatures remained high on Monday and Tuesday, but were expected to break by Wednesday. The number of people who died of heat-related deaths is unknown, but France's Ministry of Health told ABC News that information on the number of casualties will be released at the end of the month. Thousands of firefighters battle wildfires in Europe A woman watches as wildfire advances near a residential area in Alhaurin de la Torre, Malaga, Spain, July 16, 2022. Gregorio Marrero/AP Firefighters in Spain were fighting 30 active fires, mostly in Castilla y Leon, Galicia and Andalusia, Interior Ministry and Catalan Authorities said. Temperatures on Sunday were forecast to reach 42 C (107.6 F) in three provinces in the country, prompting the state meteorological agency to issue \"extreme risk\" alerts. In Mijas, Spain, in the municipality of Malaga, 3,000 people have fled due to fires. More than 22,000 acres of land are at risk of being burned in the Mijas province as firefighters struggle to contain the flames. Wildfires are happening earlier in the season, ending later and becoming more frequent because of climate change, the European Union said in a report last year. Firefighters work against a wildfire near Landiras, southwestern France, July 16, 2022. SDIS 33 via AP \"Climate change is aggravating the situation, making countries more prone to wildfires and increasing the intensity of such events,\" the report said. The sweltering heat is also expected to take hold of other parts of Europe in the coming days. Areas of England are expected to hit 40 C (104 F) on Tuesday.

In northern Portugal , a pilot died when his waterbombing plane crashed in the Foz Coa area, near the Spanish border. The Portuguese authorities say at least 238 people have died from the heat over the past week. Fires are ravaging areas of France's south-western Gironde region, where over 12,000 people have been evacuated. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to carbon emissions. The French weather service has forecast temperatures of up to 41 degrees in parts of the country's south on Sunday and new heat records are predicted for Monday. Late on Saturday the country placed 22 more regional departments mostly along its Atlantic coast on high orange alert. One resident in south-west France described the forest fires as feeling \"post-apocalyptic\" - \"I've never seen this before,\" Karyn, who lives near Teste-de-Buch, told news agency AFP. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said fires had so far burned 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) of land and praised firefighters' \"remarkable courage\". Manon Jacquart was evacuated on Wednesday and slept in a shelter Christophe Nader and his son-in-law spoke to the BBC at a shelter near Teste-de-Buch, having been forced to abandoned their house in the village of Cazaux with nothing more than the clothes they were wearing. He told the BBC he hoped to get back there to rescue their cat. Hundreds of people from the danger zone were at the temporary shelter, which has provided beds. \"Everything went so fast - the fire too, was big, big, big,\" Manon Jacquart, 27, told the BBC. She was evacuated from the campsite she works at early on Wednesday morning, and slept at a shelter near La Teste-de-Buch, on France's west coast. \"I'm just worried, I'm afraid… I'm trying to be as strong as I can but I'm not ok… I want to forget this week,\" she said. Meanwhile in the Alps climbers are being urged to postpone their trips to Mont Blanc due to the risk of rock falls caused by \"exceptional climatic conditions\". Since Tuesday, temperatures have soared to 47C in Portugal and above 40C in Spain , leaving the countryside bone dry and fuelling the fires. Portuguese weather forecasters say temperatures will continue hovering above 40C before dropping next week. Why is it so hot (in under 60 seconds)? The Portuguese pilot who died was flying solo in a Fire Boss amphibious plane. Portugal's fire hotspots are in the north - east of the city of Porto. Fires have destroyed 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of land this year - the largest area since the summer of 2017, when Portugal suffered devastating fires in which some 100 people died. Gemma Suarez, a Spanish farmer evacuated from Casas de Miravete, sobbed as she told Reuters news agency: \"What a night. We haven't slept all night. \"A social worker came to see me to go pick up my elderly uncle. We spent the night in Navalmoral but we didn't sleep at all. I have never seen such a big fire.\" In southern Spain, holidaymakers on the beach in Torremolinos saw big plumes of smoke rising in the hills, where several aircraft were tackling the blaze. Ashley Baker, a Briton who lives in Mijas, told the BBC that the fire appeared more threatening on Friday, but since then the wind had blown it away from his area. Ashley Baker Southern Spain: Fires in the Mijas hills are not far from holiday homes Planes have been a dropping fire retardant substance, as helicopters shuttle to and from the coast, collecting seawater to douse the flames. \"There are about 40 houses in our area, everyone was really nervous and standing outside or on balconies watching it,\" Mr Baker said. \"Even now there are fires at the top of the mountains. It moved away from here, I'm very relieved. When you live in the hills, it's very scary - all the road signs are giving you updates all the time about extreme fire risks.\" Other parts of the Mediterranean are affected too. In Italy , the government has declared a state of emergency in the desiccated Po Valley - the country's longest river is no more than a trickle in some places. In Greece , firefighters are tackling blazes in the Feriza area, about 50km (31 miles) south-east of Athens, and near Rethymno, on the north coast of Crete. Seven villages have been evacuated near Rethymno. In northern Morocco , several villages had to be evacuated as fires swept through the Larache, Ouezzane, Taza and Tetouan provinces. One village was totally destroyed in the Ksar El Kebir area and at least one person died in a blaze. Are you in an area that has been affected by the wildfires?

Foreign Minister Yvan Gil in a statement said the vandalism was coordinated by grassroots groups known as “comanditos” — meaning small commandos — but he did not offer any evidence to back up the accusation, which comes three days after Maduro was sworn in to a third six-year term, despite credible evidence of his election defeat. Gil said he has asked the authorities in Portugal, Germany, Spain, Colombia and Costa Rica to expedite their investigations “to find those responsible and to ensure the integrity of our facilities.” He did not say when exactly the diplomatic facilities were vandalized. The main opposition coalition did not immediately respond to the minister’s accusations. Law enforcement authorities in Lisbon, Portugal, are investigating a weekend attack with a small incendiary device that caused some minor damage on the façade of Venezuela’s consulate in that city. Portugal’s Foreign Ministry in a statement Sunday called it and “intolerable act” and said it was reinforcing security in the area.

According to official data by the diplomatic mission in the country, at least around 200,000 Portuguese nationals are registered in the country – a figure that does not include the descendants already born in Venezuela. Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry on Monday released images of the alleged vandalism that Gil announced. One shows hanging from a building a Venezuelan flag spraypainted with the word “Edmundo,” which is the first name of the opposition candidate recognized by several governments as the legitimate winner of Venezuela’s July presidential election. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike in previous contests, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts to back the announced result. The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online — showing its candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a more than a two-to-one margin. U.N. experts and the U.S.-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro’s government to observe the election, said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate . The comanditos groups were formed by supporters of the main opposition coalition to encourage voter participation and organize other efforts for the July presidential election.",

Os resultados centralizados pelos partidos à medida que o escrutínio de aproximava do final já indicavam que Miguel Albuquerque podia fazer maioria com o CDS. Era a convição no quartel-general do PSD-Madeira. IL também elege um deputado. Às 21h, ainda não estavam fechadas todas as freguesias - só ficariam meia hora depois - já o PSD Madeira antecipava a eleição de 23 deputados, apenas um aquém da maioria, com os dados que os partidos iam centralizando. Nesse momento, as contas já em cima da mesa apontavam para o JPP com 11 deputados, o PS com 8, o Chega com 3, o CDS com 1 e a IL com 1. Neste cenário, o PSD consegue formar maioria (24) com o CDS, a solução mais fácil para Albuquerque. À direita, a IL também elege 1 - mas tinha posto como condição para viabilizar um governo PSD que não fosse Miguel Albuquerque a liderá-lo. Neste momento, faltava apurar uma freguesia e atribuir 8 mandatos, estando atribuídos 39. Esta edição tem 34 páginas sobre o Papa Francisco, que morreu na segunda-feira de Pascoela e vai ficar na História como um dos mais influentes.

Se compararmos a Igreja Católica com o Islão sunita (o xiita é diferente), percebe-se também uma enorme vantagem da primeira, o poder de interpretar. Os Papas interpretam a doutrina com uma considerável latitude, o que lhes permite adaptar-se aos tempos. Numa instituição conservadora por excelência, a Igreja Católica, o Papa Francisco foi um progressista, sem dúvida. Ele era um magnífico-simples-porteiro que abria portas com alegria.",

Presidente da República pede uma campanha digna e elevada, que não abra portas a uma ditadura. É oficial. O Presidente da República dissolve o Parlamento e marca eleições legislativas antecipadas para 18 de maio , cumprindo assim o período mínimo de 55 dias que tem de mediar entre os dois atos, anunciou o chefe de Estado esta quinta-feira, numa comunicação ao país, a partir do Palácio de Belém. Presidente da República pede uma campanha digna e elevada, que não abra portas a uma ditadura. Face ao “ choque não tanto sobre políticas quanto sobre a confiabilidade, ou seja, a ética da pessoa exercendo a função de primeiro-ministro” , ao Presidente da República, “o primeiro interessado na estabilidade e na dispensa de novas eleições, e que tudo fez ao seu alcance para o salvaguardar, não restava senão anunciar a dissolução da Assembleia da República e a convocação de eleições para o dia 18 de maio de 2025 , a data preferida pela maioria dos partidos”, afirmou Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Marcelo dissolve Parlamento e marca eleições para 18 de maio Ler Mais “Os partidos, ouvidos após a demissão do Governo, pronunciaram-se por unanimidade pela dissuasão da Assembleia da República e convocação de eleições. Embora, todos, como caminho que não desejavam, mas imposto pela realidade”, salientou. O mesmo “parecer unânime” foi dado pelo Conselho de Estad o , “não desejando mas tendo de aceitar a saída determinada pela realidade”. A decisão foi comunicada depois de ter ouvido os partidos com assento parlamentar e o Conselho de Estado. Nesta última reunião, que decorreu esta quinta-feira, entre as 15h e 18h, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa terá dito que foi contra a opção de Luís Montenegro de apresentar uma moção de confiança , que acabou por ser rejeitada, ditando a queda do Governo. De salientar que o primeiro-ministro demissionário tem lugar por inerência no órgão consultivo de Marcelo, pelo que ouviu do próprio a sua discordância. Também o líder do PS, Pedro Nuno Santos, que tanto insistiu para que Montenegro retirasse a moção de confiança, integra o Conselho de Estado, por ter sido eleito pelo Parlamento. Em pouco mais de um ano, os portugueses voltam a ser chamados às urnas para eleger os 230 deputados à Assembleia da República, de onde sairá um novo Governo. Uma crise política que surge na sequência do chumbo da moção de confiança apresentada pelo Governo de Luís Montenegro que provocou a demissão do Executivo. Inicialmente, Marcelo ainda equacionava a data de 11 de maio, mas, atendendo aos pedidos de alguns partidos como BE, CDS e PAN, decidiu adiar para 18 de maio , de modo a dar mais tempo às forças políticas para se organizarem e também para não coincidir com as habituais peregrinações a Fátima que se realizam por volta do dia 13. Definida a data de 18 de maio, a campanha eleitoral deverá decorrer entre 4 e 16 de maio. Embora discordando de novas eleições, o Presidente da República reconhecer que “não havia meio caminho”. “Este panorama aparecia, neste termos, pela primeira vez na nossa democracia”, sublinhou. Marcelo reconheceu que “muito provavelmente ninguém esperava e que ninguém queria” esta “terceira eleição para Assembleia da República em quatro anos”. E alertou que “começam agora a correr dois meses de debate eleitoral”, sendo “ inevitável que o tema da crise ocupe parte do debate em particular nas primeiras semanas”. Um “debate que pode e deve pesar e pesar bem os sinais e riscos para a democracia de situações de confronto, em que não é possível haver consenso nem que parcial seja porque se trata de conduzir a becos de natureza pessoal e ética que não têm saída que não sejam as eleições” avisou. Marcelo salientou que seria “um desperdício imperdoável não discutir aquilo que tanto preocupa no dia a dia dos portugueses nestes e nos próximos tempos”, designadamente num “quadro de paz e de guerra e de uma muito difícil situação económica internacional”. O Presidente da República garantiu ainda todas as condições “para que se não pare a execução do Plano de Recuperação e Resiliência , mesmo com Governo de gestão, sem atropelo, claro, das regras eleitorais”. “Qual o objetivo? Permitir uma transição, se possível, tão pacífica como a vivida em 2024. Só que agora em dois meses e meio e não em cinco, como então”, afirmou. E alertou para o tom do debate da campanha eleitoral e o risco da ascensão de populismos: “Impõe-se que haja um debate eleitoral claro, frontal, esclarecedor, mas sereno, digno, elevado, tolerante, respeitador da diferença e do pluralismo. Que fortaleça, não enfraqueça a democracia. Não abra, ainda mais, a porta a experiências que se sabe como começam e se sabe como acabam”. Por fim, fez um apelo: “ Um debate que dê força a quem nos vier a representar na Assembleia da República, que dê força a quem nos vier a governar, que dê força aos portugueses para controlarem os seus representantes e os seus governantes, que dê força à democracia e, com ela, e a sua capacidade de enfrentar e superar crises, que só a democracia tem, não a ditadura”. A atual crise política teve início em fevereiro com a publicação de uma notícia, pelo Correio da Manhã , sobre a empresa familiar de Luís Montenegro, Spinumviva, detida à altura pelos filhos e pela mulher, com quem é casado em comunhão de adquiridos , – e que passou na semana passada apenas para os filhos de ambos – levantando dú vidas sobre o cumprimento do regime de incompatibilidades e impedimentos dos titulares de cargos públicos e políticos. Depois de mais de duas semanas de notícias – incluindo a do Expresso de que o grupo Solverde pagava uma avença mensal de 4.500 euros à Spinumviva – de duas moções de censura ao Governo, de Chega e PCP, ambas rejeitadas, e do anúncio do PS de que iria apresentar uma comissão de inquérito , o primeiro-ministro anunciou a 5 de março a apresentação de uma moção de confiança ao Governo. O texto foi rejeitado na terça-feira com os votos contra do PS, Chega, BE, PCP, Livre e deputada única do PAN, Inês Sousa Real. A favor estiveram o PSD, CDS-PP e a Iniciativa Liberal. Segundo a Constituição, a não aprovação de uma moção de confiança implica a demissão do Executivo, o que aconteceu um ano e um dia depois da vitória da coligação AD nas legislativas antecipadas de 10 de março. O XXIV Governo Constitucional tornou-se o segundo Executivo na história da democracia a cair na sequência da apresentação de uma moção de confiança , depois do I Governo Constitucional, em 1977, dirigido pelo socialista Mário Soares.

The operation also included the Portuguese Air Force and Navy and Spain’s Civil Guard, along with assistance from the United States’ DEA and British authorities. Portuguese police described the crew as allegedly belonging to an international criminal organization. They said that the operation happened recently, without specifying the date.

The government’s fall marks the worst spell of political instability since Portugal adopted a democratic system more than 50 years ago in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship. A string of minority governments has been unable to forge alliances that might ensure the administration completes its constitutional four-year term without opposition parties teaming up to bring it down. A new election, likely in May, pitches the country of 10.6 million people into months of political uncertainty just as it is in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds. The European continent, meanwhile, is facing immediate challenges to its security and economy . Voter discontent with a return to the polls could play into the hands of the radical-right populist party Chega (Enough), which has fed off frustration with mainstream parties. Portugal has been caught up in the rising European tide of populism , with Chega surging into third place in last year’s election. RELATED COVERAGE Mourinho’s quest for title in Turkey among tight races across European soccer leagues Spain and France need penalty shootouts to join Germany and Portugal in Nations League semifinals Europe and Canada are eyeing alternatives to American-made fighter jets. Here’s why The government asked for the confidence vote, saying it was needed to “dispel uncertainty” about its own future amid a simmering political crisis that has focused on Social Democrat Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and distracted attention from government policy. After more than three hours of at times loud debate and following dramatic late twists as the government tabled proposals to avoid its defeat, the government called an hourlong recess and lawmakers went into a huddle. The government said it made a last-minute offer to the Socialists. Silence fell on the chamber after the result was announced. “Things are how they are. We gave our all,” Montenegro, the prime minister, told reporters as he left the National Assembly, Portugal’s parliament. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos, the leader of the largest opposition party, described the government’s conduct as “shameful,” saying it resorted to “maneuvers, games, tricks” to survive. The controversy has revolved around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Montenegro’s family law firm. Montenegro, who says he’ll stand for reelection, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became Social Democratic leader in 2022 and has not been involved in its running. It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government, among other sources of revenue. The exact vote count wasn’t immediately available, but the speaker of parliament Jose Pedro Aguiar-Branco said the center-right government was defeated. The government, a two-party alliance led by the Social Democratic Party in power for less than a year, had just 80 seats in the current 230-seat legislature. An overwhelming majority of opposition lawmakers had vowed to vote against it. The center-left Socialists and Chega, which together hold 128 seats, voted against the government. Opposition parties have demanded more detailed explanations from Montenegro, and the Socialist Party wants a parliamentary inquiry that would dog the government for months. The Social Democrats are hoping that economic growth estimated at 1.9% last year, compared with the EU’s 0.8% average, and a jobless rate of 6.4%, roughly the EU average, will keep their support firm. The next general election in Portugal was scheduled for January 2028.",

Pina - RTP Ouvir Um sismo de magnitude 4.7 na escala da Richter fez esta segunda-feira a terra tremer nas regiões de Lisboa e Setúbal. O epicentro foi na zona do Seixal, a cerca de 24 quilómetros de distância da capital. VER MAIS Segundo a Autoridade Nacional de Emergência e Proteção Civil (ANEPC), até ao momento não foram registados danos pessoais ou materiais na sequência do sismo. \"Não há registo de danos pessoais ou materiais até ao momento\" , referiu a Proteção Civil em comunicado ao início da tarde. “Hoje, dia 17 de fevereiro, pelas 13h24 (hora local), foi registado nas estações da Rede Sísmica do Continente um sismo de magnitude 4.7 (Richter) e cujo epicentro se localizou a oeste do Seixal”, acrescentou. Em Fernão Ferro, Seixal, a RTP falou com moradores e comerciantes que disseram ter sentido a terra a tremer. O Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) informou, por sua vez, que pelas 13h24 “foi registado nas estações da Rede Sísmica do Continente um sismo de magnitude 4.7 (Richter) e cujo epicentro se localizou a cerca de 14 quilómetros a Sudoeste de Seixal”. “Este sismo, de acordo com a informação disponível até ao momento, não causou danos pessoais ou materiais e foi sentido com intensidade máxima V/VI (instrumental) (escala de Mercalli modificada) no concelho de Almada e Sesimbra ”, acrescenta a entidade. \"Foi ainda sentido com menor intensidade nos concelhos de Odemira (Beja), Coimbra (Coimbra), Albufeira, Portimão (Faro), Alcobaça, Leiria (Leiria), Cascais, Lisboa, Loures, Mafra, Oeiras, Vila Franca de Xira, Amadora, Odivelas (Lisboa), Abrantes (Santarém), Barreiro, Moita, Palmela, Seixal, Sesimbra, Setúbal e Sines (Setúbal)\". O sismo foi sentido na praia da Fonte da Telha, principalmente quem estava no areal ou nos estabelecimentos à beira mar. Os surfistas que estavam no mar não se aperceberam, mas a escola náutica da praia suspendeu temporariamente as aulas. Réplicas são expectáveis Em entrevista à RTP, o antigo presidente do IPMA Miguel Miranda sublinhou que este abalo aconteceu na linha da zona de praia da Fonte da Telha, por isso não foram registados danos, ao contrário do que poderia suceder se o sismo fosse num local de densa construção. Miguel Miranda lembrou ainda que, nestas situações, são expectáveis réplicas. Num comunicado, o IPMA explica que a localização do epicentro de um sismo “é um processo físico e matemático complexo que depende do conjunto de dados, dos algoritmos e dos modelos de propagação das ondas sísmicas”. “Agências diferentes podem produzir resultados ligeiramente diferentes. Do mesmo modo, as determinações preliminares são habitualmente corrigidas posteriormente, pela integração de mais informação”, adianta a nota. Carlos Moedas considera que \"não há motivos para alerta\" e deixou \"uma mensagem de tranquilidade\" à população da Grande Lisboa . O presidente da Câmara apelou a que se mantenha a calma, em caso de réplicas, e que os lisboetas tenham os kits de emergência caso seja necessário. \"Não tivemos registos de nenhum dano, nem nenhum pedido de ajuda\" , afirmou o presidente da Câmara de Lisboa, que confirmou que, apesar disso, houve quem contactasse os serviços autárquicos. No sentido de deixar uma \"mensagem de tranquilidade para os lisboetas\", Carlos Moedas relembrou que nos últimos três anos foi lançado um sistema \"de controlo e de alerta de tsunami\" e foi revisto o plano de emergência do município. Em caso de haver um sismo, \"o que as pessoas devem fazer logo é proteger-se de imediato\". \"É a primeira coisa que as pessoas devem fazer\", frisou Moedas, acrescentando que só devem sair quando o sismo \"estabiliza\" e dirigir-se para \"um espaço amplo\" e para um dos 86 pontos preparados da cidade. O autarca apelou ainda a que as pessoas mantenham a calma, em caso de réplicas, mas que tenham os kits de emergência preparados.

It was the first full-year of economic growth in Portugal since 2010. Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho's centre-right government, which faces a general election at the end of the year, and the European Commission had predicted the Portuguese economy would expand by 1% last year. Portuguese economic growth accelerated at the end of 2014, expanding 0.5% in the fourth quarter after growing by 0.3% in the previous three months. The improvement in economic activity was due to \"a recovery in household consumption and, to a lesser extent, investments,\" the statistics office said in a statement. The figures from the statistics office confirmed provisional figures for the period published on February 13. Portugal in May exited a three-year, €78 billion bailout programme from the European Union and International Monetary Fund but the government still has to cut spending to meet budget targets. It forecasts GDP will grow by 1.5% in 2015 while unemployment will decline to 13.4%.

This was despite the incumbent party's vote share falling to 44.36%. For almost 40 years of regional elections in Madeira, the PSD/M has won consecutive absolute majorities without once losing power. The result of the 2015 election reinforced the tendency over the last 40 years of politics in Madeira: the emergence of a viable electoral challenger to the ruling party continues to be unlikely and the incumbent continues to mobilize the regional electorate and win the electoral contest. Key Words: Regional elections Madeira predominant-party system Disclosure Statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author. Notes 1 The Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (CRP) establishes the principle of decentralization. There exist municipalities ( municípios ), parishes ( freguesias ), and administrative regions. The administrative regions remain a ‘wishful thinking' issue within the structure of the State, as they have yet to come into existence, 40 years after being approved by the Constitution. The Comissões de Coordenação (CCDRs, Regional Coordinating Commissions) are the coordinating bodies on the Portuguese mainland, appointed by the national government with no democratic basis. The regionalization issue (on the mainland) continues to be a major unsolved challenge of the organization of the State (Magone, Citation 2010 ). 2 In 1995, the National Statistical Institute reported as GDP per capita (annual %) per region (NUTS II), the following values: Norte (7.4%), Centro (7.4%), Lisbon (12.1%), Algarve (9.6%), Alentejo (8.1%), Azores (7.1%), and Madeira (7.5%). For the year 2010, the National Statistical Institute registered as GDP per capita per region, the following values: Norte (13.1%), Centro (13.5%), Lisbon (22.7%), Algarve (16.8%), Alentejo (15%), Azores (15.3%), and Madeira (21.1%). In the period 1995–2000, the GDP's real growth, in these three regional economies, was on average superior to the EU's (27). The EU (27) registered 3.1%, compared to 4.1% in the Azores and 9.4% in Madeira. During the period 2001–2007, the EU registered 2.3%; the Azores 2.1% and Madeira 4.2%. http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/studies/pdf/rup_growth/rup_growth_sum_pt.pdf . 3 The electoral competitiveness refers to the difference between the top two parties' vote percentage in a given district (Blais and Lago, Citation 2009 ). Elections are more competitive when there are many parties in competition (fragmentation), when they differ strongly from one another in ideological terms (polarization), and when the threshold of representation is lower (proportionality).

Many Sephardic Jews were killed, forced to convert to Christianity or leave at the end of the 15th Century. Parliament paved the way for a change in citizenship laws two years ago, but the move needed Cabinet approval. From now on, descendants of Sephardic Jews who can prove a strong link to Portugal can apply for a passport. Proof can be brought, the government says, through a combination of surname, language spoken in the family or evidence of direct descent. Ancient presence Thousands of Sephardic Jews were forced off the Iberian peninsula, first from Spain and then from Portugal. Some of those who fled to other parts of Europe or to America continued to speak a form of Portuguese in their new communities. The Portuguese government acknowledges that Jews lived in the region long before the Portuguese kingdom was founded in the 12th Century. \"There is no possibility to amend what was done,\" says Portuguese Justice Minister Paula Teixera da Cruz, adding that the law change was \"an attribution of a right\". Portugal's Jewish community which once numbered in the tens of thousands has shrunk to just 1,000 - most of them Ashkenazim with roots in Eastern Europe. Neighbouring Spain is still debating a similar law to address its treatment of Jews in the past.

Hundreds of the creatures probably died when a lake dried up, leaving a huge jumble of bones which is now being excavated in southern Portugal. Although related to modern salamanders, the two-metre beast probably lived more like a crocodile, snapping up fish and scrapping with rivals on the shore. The find is reported in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology , external . Nobody's pet \"It's basically a salamander that's the size of a car,\" said Dr Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who led the research. \"It's one of those creatures from the distant past that looks like an alien - but it actually has quite a lot of relevance. These kind of big amphibians were the ancestral stock that modern frogs, salamanders and newts came from.\" Image source, Joana Bruno Image caption, The animals had very flattened heads and lots of sharp teeth But unlike the mostly small and cute amphibians we know today, Metoposaurus algarvensis sat, rather heavily, at the top of the food chain. \"[It] had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head, which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut,\" Dr Brusatte said. In the late Triassic period, when dinosaurs and mammals were still small and marginal, it was monsters like this which were \"the big dogs\", he told BBC News. Other, related species were even bigger, stretching up to 10m in length - more like a bus than car. Together these species dominated the supercontinent Pangaea, which was only beginning to split into today's land masses. Dangerous waters \"These big amphibians were some of the main predators and denizens of that world. So our earliest ancestors and the earliest dinosaurs would have had to deal with these guys in their formative years,\" Dr Brusatte explained. Image source, Octavio Mateus Image caption, Dr Brusatte and his colleagues excavated the fossils in Portugal Mostly their big jaws were used to munch fish, and being amphibians they were unable to venture far from water. But Dr Brusatte imagines M. algaryensis would have posed a big, ugly threat to any early mammals or dinosaurs that got too close. \"Like people down in Louisiana or Florida today: 'Stay away from the water or the crocs might get you!' I think that's what it would have been like with the earliest dinosaurs.\" In spite of their dominance, this and related species of outsized amphibian all died out in the late Triassic when the world was rocked by millennia of savage volcanic eruptions. \"In a way it was the death of these things that allowed the dinosaurs and mammals to take over,\" Dr Brusatte said. And in that turbulent climate, smaller scale exterminations - such as the one captured in the ancient Portuguese lake bed - were common. A car-sized salamander could hardly strike out for a far-off lake if its own waterway dried up. That makes \"big mass graves of monstrous amphibians\" a known feature of the Triassic, Dr Brusatte said. At the dig in the Algarve, he and his colleagues have explored only a small fraction of the area. They have found fossilised bones from at least 10 individuals and expect to find hundreds more. \"That's a pretty neat thing, because it means we have a lot of fossils that can really tell us about how big this guy was, about what its biology was like, about the world that it inhabited.\" Image source, O Mateus, R Butler, S Brusatte Image caption, The team has already excavated bones - like these skull fragments - from at least 10 animals Susan Evans is a professor of palaeontology at University College London. She told BBC News the new Metoposaurus was an impressive specimen, and noteworthy as the first such find in southern Europe. She added, however, that similar animals are already well-known within the field. \"It's a well-preserved specimen and it's a new locality, but these things have been found in quite a lot of places,\" Prof Evans said. And although the salamander is indeed this critter's closest living relative, she emphasised that they are far from  kissing cousins. \"They're relatives of salamanders in the same way that the duck-billed platypus is a distant relative of ours,\" she said.

The government denied any involvement, but the resignation could add to unease surrounding Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho who has been under fire for failing to pay taxes on time in the past. The scandal has already affected his party's popularity ahead of the autumn election. The union of tax workers has complained that dozens of revenue service employees who had accessed the tax records of certain individuals, including the prime minister, faced disciplinary action by the tax authority. The finance ministry said in a short statement that the resignation of Antonio Brigas Afonso, head of the tax revenue service, had been accepted. \"The government never approved or decided on the elaboration of any list of tax payers. It has not handed any list of taxpayers to the revenue service and never gave such instructions,\" State Secretary for Taxes Paulo Nuncio told reporters. He said that Brigas Afonso had told him last month that no such list existed in his service, but on Monday confirmed there had been \"internal procedures and proposals within the revenue service on this matter, all without the government's knowledge\". The government ordered an investigation and Nuncio said he was ready to testify before parliament on the situation. Paulo Ralha, head of the tax workers union, said he had \"clear information\" that Nuncio had himself given a list of privileged taxpayers to the revenue service. He called for an inspection of revenue service computer data to see if there were special filters applied to certain records. Passos Coelho, who has imposed huge tax hikes and toughened penalties for back taxes since coming to power in 2011, acknowledged earlier this month that he had in the past failed to pay taxes and social security contributions in time, but denied having had any privileged treatment. He said that he ultimately always paid what he owed, with fines and interest. The government's clampdown on tax evasion is credited with boosting its budget in the past few years under a bailout.

And that is what I'll fight for.\" Passos Coelho, whose Social Democrats rule in a coalition with the smaller rightist CDS-PP party, said he expected voters to look for stability after Portugal's emergence from a debt crisis and recession under his austerity-minded government. He said the two parties would decide shortly on whether to run on the same ticket or separately. Portugal's election is expected in September or October. A survey of voting intentions by Eurosondagem pollsters published on Saturday showed that the coalition, with 35 percent support, was so close to the centre-left Socialists, on 37.5 percent, that they were inside the margin of error to make a statistical draw. In a Eurosondagem poll earlier this month the Socialists led by 4.5 percentage points. The new survey gave projections showing the ruling coalition, if it runs on one ticket, winning between 98 and 103 parliament seats versus 100 to 105 for the Socialists. If the two parties run separately they would likely win fewer seats. Despite anti-austerity talk by the Socialists, analysts expect them to continue budget consolidation if they win the election. Portugal has not seen the kind of mass support for a radical anti-bailout party as in Spain or Greece. The centre-right coalition government elected in 2011 has imposed painful austerity including tax hikes, wage and pension cuts that stoked the worst recession since the 1970s. But Lisbon exited the bailout last May and the economy is growing again. Some Portuguese analysts have raised the prospect of a centrist coalition between the Socialists and the centre-right Social Democrats after the election. Asked about such a possibility, Passos Coelho said: \"I'm not closing any doors, but I'm not going to draw scenarios.\" Other parties represented in parliament were far behind the leaders in the Eurosondagem poll. The Communist-Greens alliance were on 9.6 percent and the Left Bloc on 4.2 percent. Eurosondagem surveyed 1,515 people between Feb 18 and 25. The margin of error was 2.52 percentage points.

Afp VIRGINIA LÓPEZ Especial para EL MUNDO Lisboa Actualizado: 12/01/2015 15:22 horas 0 Alberto Joao Jardim era hasta hoy el político portugués que llevaba más tiempo en el poder . Casi 37 años al frente del gobierno regional de la isla de Madeira. En Portugal se le conoce por sus polémicas declaraciones y también por el populismo con el que ha gobernado en Madeira con diez mayorías absolutas consecutivas. Siempre ha defendido el bienestar de los madeirenses aunque para ello aumentase de forma descomunal la deuda pública del archipiélago. Y lo volvería a hacer, dijo Jardim, sin pelos en la lengua en plena crisis portuguesa. Y aunque la austeridad también llegó a la isla, con subida de impuestos y otros recortes, al final, Alberto Joao Jardim se va de la política por su propio pie y podría volver en breve , pues ya ha admitido presentarse a las elecciones para presidente de Portugal, que se celebran en 2016. Hoy, Alberto Joao Jardim presentó la dimisión oficial de su cargo, aunque ya lo había anunciado en diciembre. Lo ha hecho un día después de que su partido eligiese a su sucesor, Miguel Albuquerque. Era el candidato de Jardim , quien incluso quería que éste lo sucediera en el gobierno regional hasta octubre, cuando estaban previstas las elecciones regionales. Pero Albuquerque ha optado por la celebración de elecciones anticipadas en el archipiélago luso, para así \"tener una base de legitimidad democrática con la que gobernar\". Gobernar Madeira no será una tarea fácil, con una astronómica deuda que durante años ha estado oculta . En septiembre de 2011 se descubrió que desde 2008, el gobierno liderado por Jardim había ocultado el registro oficial de una parte de la deuda pública de Madeira. Entonces, Jardim reconoció que la deuda era más de mil millones superior al valor oficialmente divulgado. En plena crisis en Portugal, con la Troika llamando a la puerta, el entonces ministro de Finanzas, Vitor Gaspar, dio el valor exacto de la deuda madeirense: 6.300 millones de euros, lo que obligó a un ajuste financiero. Ni la astronómica deuda hizo tambalear el poder de Jardim, que en Portugal es conocido por su afición a los carnavales de Madeira, en los que participa activamente. O su insistencia en seguir invirtiendo en los fuegos artificiales de la Nochevieja pues es uno de los destinos más elegidos por los portugueses para celebrar el cotillón. Pero a pesar de seguir contando con el apoyo popular, Jardim tuvo que tomar medidas impopulares, como la subida de impuestos . Con un país en recesión y con rescate, también Madeira tuvo que subir el IVA, del 16% al 22% (aún así, Jardim consiguió quedarse un punto por debajo del resto del país). Han sido constantes sus ataques al gobierno central - sobre todo en la época del socialista José Sócrates - insistiendo en que no defendían los intereses de Madeira, la única región autonómica de Portugal, junto a las islas Azores. De hecho, con Sócrates, Jardim incluso presentó su dimisión para convocar elecciones anticipadas, cuando el primer ministro socialista alteró la Ley de Financiación Regional y le redujo el montante estatal en 500 millones de euros. Volvió a vencer con mayoría absoluta, aunque más ajustada. Desde la oposición aseguran que la deuda en Madeira se mantiene en los 6.000 millones, aunque en septiembre pasado desde el gobierno de Jardim garantizan que ha bajado a los 4.000 millones . Ahora, sin el populista Jardim, los madeirenses ahora decidirán si quieren seguir la línea del Partido Socialdemócrata de su sucesor, Albuquerque, o si prefieren que la isla \"naranja\" cambie de color después de toda haberse pasado toda la democracia bajo el mando de Jardim. 0 ¿Te ha resultado interesante?

On Wednesday, the governing centre-right coalition backed the move to introduce fees during a final, heated session of parliament that prompted jeers from opposition lawmakers. The debate was briefly interrupted by women’s rights activists, who shouted “shame, shame” from the gallery. Abortion rights around the world – interactive Read more The parliament also adopted other amendments to the abortion law, including a requirement that women get psychological and social counselling and advice on family planning before ending a pregnancy. “The final session of the legislature was exploited … to humiliate Portuguese women,” said Greens MP Heloisa Apolonia. But Carlos Abreu Amorim, a member of the governing Social Democrats (PSD), argued that the changes were “not a question of removing the right to abortion, but to improve the conditions in which women take these difficult decisions”. Abortion remains a controversial subject in majority Catholic Portugal, where it has faced vocal opposition from the Church. Portuguese women have had the legal right to an abortion paid for by the state up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy since it was approved by a referendum in 2007 . Before then, women faced up to three years in prison for having an abortion, except in cases of rape or if there was danger to the health of the mother or foetus.

The opposition plans to reverse pay and pensions cuts. https://p.dw.com/p/1H3b9 Image: picture-alliance/AP Photo/A.Franca Advertisement Portugal's Socialist Party forged an unprecedented pact with the Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc to take down the center-right government of Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in a parliamentary vote on Tuesday. The no-confidence motion drafted by the Socialists garnered 123 of 230 votes. Prime Minister Coelho won the most votes during the parliamentary elections in October, but lost the absolute majority his coalition had held since 2011. Still, following the country's political conventions, he was sworn back into office last week by the president. Tuesday's vote makes his new administration the most short-lived in Portugal's history. \"The taboo has ended, the wall has been broken,\"said Socialist leader Antonio Costa. If the leftist alliance forms a new government, it would be the first ruling coalition to include the Communists and the Left Bloc in the modern political history of Portugal. The country only returned to democracy in 1974, after decades of right-wing dictatorship. Portugal's president, Anibal Cavaco Silvo, must first meet with party representatives before any change to the government can take place. Until then, the prime minister will remain in power. Austerity 'destroyed' lives Portugal requested a 78-billion-euro ($88-billion) bailout in 2011 and only left the scheme in May 2014, with the previous Coelho administration pushing through harsh budget cuts. Austerity seemed to be showing its first results in 2015, with the economy growing 1.5 percent in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. The unemployment rate has also fallen to around 12 percent, compared to 17.5 percent in early 2013. The opposition, however, claims that austerity has hit the middle class too hard, and \"destroyed millions of Portuguese lives,\" according to the Communist Party official Jeronimo de Sousa. The opposition lawmakers intend to roll back tax cuts, as well as cuts in pay, pensions and public services. They also speculated about restoring several public holidays that were cut to boost productivity. Greece as a cautionary tale At the same time, the Socialist party has repeatedly stated they would keep in line with European budget rules. \"All the conditions have been met to ensure a stable, responsible, consistent and lasting government,\" Socialist Party leader Antonio Costa said late Sunday. Many observers, however, fear that a left-wing government would bring instability to the markets and spook investors, damaging the fragile economic recovery. Coelho's finance minister, Maria Luis Albuquerque, warned on Tuesday that failure to reduce the budget deficit could provoke an even more serious debt crisis and a new bailout. \"We don't need to imagine the consequences; it's enough to look at the recent experience of Greece and the cost of their attempt to end austerity ... More recession, more poverty, more jobless and more dependence on European and IMF lenders,\" she told the lawmakers. Turmoil in Portugal could also boost the far-left in the neighboring Spain, where elections are set for the December 20. dj/kms (AFP, Reuters, AP) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Portugal's Socialists reject new minority government Portugal's Socialists reject new minority government The Socialist Party has urged its members to withhold support for the center-right's attempt at minority rule.

Support for the far right has revived in Portugal in recent years but a large crowd took to the streets of the capital, carrying carnations, waving national flags and shouting: \"April 25 - always. Fascism -never again!\" Sign up here. Antonio Oliveira Salazar ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, but the arch-conservative, authoritarian rule lasted a further six years under his successor Marcelo Caetano, crumbling only on April 25, 1974. The almost bloodless revolution was conducted by a group of junior army officers who wanted democracy and to put an end to long-running wars against independence movements in African colonies. The military coup by the \" Captains of April \" group brought about rapid decolonisation. Thursday's celebrations began in Lisbon’s Commerce Square on the edge of the River Tagus where two frigates sat moored as military vehicles and more than 400 soldiers paraded by, singing the national anthem as fighter jets roared overhead. Joao Marcelino, 74, said the recent \"very strong\" rise of the populist far right in Portugal, echoing trends elsewhere within the 27-nation European Union, was worrying because it \"does not bring good solutions for any country\". \"I'm worried that, after 50 years of democracy, people are not enlightened...but the far right is advancing because the mainstream parties are not developing our country,\" he said. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa told parliament that everyone \"must recognise the vital force of democracy and have the humility and intelligence to always prefer democracy, even if imperfect, to dictatorship\". Though its multi-party democracy has proven stable and the country's infrastructure has been greatly modernised since 1974, aided by EU membership and development funds, Portugal remains Western Europe's poorest state.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more Discontent over a housing crisis unleashed by steadily rising rents has boosted the far right, as have low wages, sagging healthcare and cases of alleged corruption involving the mainstream parties. Jose Duarte, 29, said that celebrating the revolution this year had gained in importance because of the rise of the far right, which he hoped would be temporary. \"The far right can be fought by all of us with the legacy of those who made the April 25 (revolution),\" he said. 'ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM' Lisbon University political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto said that while most Portuguese embrace liberal democracy and are proud of the April 25 revolution, the growing popularity of the populist, anti-immigration Chega was the \"elephant in the room\" at this year's Carnation Revolution celebrations. \"Chega attracts those who have a revisionist view of history with the idea that colonialism and the empire were not bad, and that the glorious Portuguese past and its symbols should be valued,\" Costa Pinto said. Chega makes frequent public use of Salazar's motto \"God, patriotism and family\", to which the party has added \"work\". Chega leader Andre Ventura has denied that he or his party is fascist, while being anti-establishment and wanting to change Portugal's constitution. \"Fifty years ago we had a revolution that gave us freedom, but along the way our dignity was taken away from us,\" Ventura told parliament on Thursday, accusing the ruling Social Democrats and main opposition Socialists of failing to end poverty. Founded in 2019, Chega is Portugal's third largest party, having quadrupled its cohort of lawmakers to 50 in March's parliamentary election .

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Luís Montenegro promised to lower taxes for the middle class | Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP via Getty Images April 2, 2024 8:16 pm CET By Aitor Hernández-Morales Center-right leader Luís Montenegro was sworn in as Portugal’s new prime minister in Lisbon’s Ajuda Palace on Tuesday, ushering in a minority government that will have difficulty passing legislation in the country’s fractured parliament. “The Portuguese people voted for political change,” Montenegro said. “Our intention is to respect their will … And to be focused on solving the people’s problems .” The new prime minister promised to lower taxes for the middle class and foster friendlier conditions for business, with the ultimate aim of luring back the nearly one-third of Portugal’s younger citizens who have migrated abroad in search of better-paying jobs. He added that he would also seek to carry out structural reforms to guarantee the survival of the country’s public services and implement measures to address the housing crisis. Advertisement Advertisement Montenegro additionally said his government would seek to present a comprehensive plan to fight corruption and make the Portuguese government more transparent. The announcement comes six months after his predecessor, António Costa , resigned after his official residence was raided by police in the midst of an influence-peddling probe. But it’s unclear how Montenegro’s Democratic Alliance coalition will pass the bills needed to make his promises a reality. While the center right narrowly won last month’s snap national election, it fell far short of securing the 116 seats required to form a governing majority in the Portuguese parliament. Meanwhile, the far-right Chega party performed above expectations to net 50 of the legislative body’s 230 seats. Because Montenegro has vowed to not make any deals with Chega, his Democratic Alliance will be obliged to seek support from the Socialist Party, which has governed the country for the past eight years. Piecemeal agreements between the country’s two largest parties appear possible. After Chega refused to back the center-right candidate to preside over the Portuguese parliament last week, Montenegro’s lawmakers were able to forge a deal with their center-left counterparts to split the speakership, with each party’s candidate serving as speaker for two years. Similarly, Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos has indicated that he is open to helping the new minority government amend the country’s budget to increase funding for teachers, police and healthcare workers. But long-term collaboration appears unlikely. Santos has made clear that he has no intention of serving as Montenegro’s crutch, and the left wing of the Socialist Party is unlikely to lend its support to the center-right’s budget proposal for 2025. Advertisement Advertisement In 2022, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa dissolved parliament and called snap elections after Prime Minister António Costa’s budget proposal was rejected by a majority of lawmakers. But Rebelo de Sousa has expressed no desire to send voters back to the polls before his mandate expires in 2026, and he’s likely to push the country’s centrist parties to work together to avoid an electoral scenario in which the far right could make further gains by campaigning against ineffective mainstream political forces. After swearing Montenegro in, Rebelo de Sousa said that although Portuguese electors had chosen to “switch hemispheres” after 8 years of Socialist Party rule and entrust the government to the center-right instead of the center-left, they had also deliberately chosen “the moderates over the radicals.” “You have the backing of the President of the Republic,” Rebelo de Sousa told Montenegro. “But you lack that backing in the parliament, and you will have to achieve it by building consensus.” Montenegro, for his part, challenged the Socialist Party to decide whether it would work with his government to pass legislation that would benefit the general public, or whether it would vote with the far-right in order to reject its proposals. “You must be clear about whether you want to be part of the democratic opposition, or if you want to help block democracy,” he said. Advertisement Advertisement The new government has a distinctly EU flavor: Four of the cabinet’s 17 ministers were drafted from the European Parliament, among them European People’s Party Vice President Paulo Rangel , who has been named foreign minister. Montenegro’s chief of staff, diplomat Pedro Perestrelo Pinto, is also a Brussels veteran who previously served in Portugal’s Permanent Representation to the EU. The selection has been interpreted as a sign that the new prime minister wants to underscore Portugal’s pro-European positions and further strengthen Lisbon’s relationship with Brussels.

No total, os socialistas elegem oito eurodeputados e a AD sete. VER MAIS Em terceiro lugar ficou o Chega, que recolheu 9,79 por cento dos votos e dois mandatos , mas também este com pouca diferença para o partido seguinte: a Iniciativa Liberal alcançou o quarto lugar com 9,07 por cento e também dois mandatos . Segue-se o Bloco de Esquerda (4,24 por cento, um eurodeputado eleito) e o PCP (4,12 por cento e um mandato) . Seguem-se, sem mandatos eleitos, o Livre (3,75 por cento), o ADN (1,37 por cento) e o PAN (1,21 por cento). Os restantes partidos não chegaram a um por cento dos votos. Marta Temido: “Os portugueses confiaram no projeto da Europa que temos” A cabeça de lista do partido vencedor nestas eleições afirmou, na reação aos resultados, que a campanha do PS demonstra a forma como o partido está na política: “Junto das pessoas, com as pessoas, a trabalhar pelas pessoas e para as pessoas” . “Os portugueses confiaram no projeto da Europa que temos”, declarou Marta Temido. “O PS conseguiu hoje mais votos do que nas últimas eleições europeias, e eu agradeço-vos por terem respondido ao meu apelo de transformarem a gratidão e a esperança que recebemos nas ruas em votos nas urnas e em mandatos no Parlamento Europeu”, acrescentou. Antes, também em discurso na sede do PS, o secretário-geral do partido considerou que Marta Temido “foi uma grande candidata” e fez uma campanha “fabulosa”, destacando o facto de ter sido a primeira mulher a vencer uma campanha nacional para as europeias . O líder socialista aproveitou para lançar críticas a Luís Montenegro pela sua atuação na campanha eleitoral. “O Governo nacionalizou esta eleição. Não tenho memória de ter visto um Governo tão envolvido numa campanha para as europeias como nestas”, acusou. Bugalho assume derrota No seu discurso, Sebastião Bugalho declarou que este não foi um dia de derrota para a Aliança Democrática . No entanto, o cabeça de lista da AD disse assumir com humildade democrática que a vitória foi de Marta Temido. O primeiro-ministro, acompanhado de Sebastião Bugalho, também admitiu a vitória do PS, afirmando que a AD não cumpriu os objetivos para estas europeias . Luís Montenegro elogiou os portugueses que votaram e ainda deixou palavras de apreço por José Luís Carneiro, antigo ministro da Administração Interna, que deu início ao processo de voto em mobilidade. \"O objetivo da AD sempre que entra numa eleição é para ter pelo menos mais um voto que qualquer outra fora partidária. E quero assumir como líder desta coligação que nós não cumprimos esse objetivo\" , afirmou. Chega propõe-se ir \"com tudo\" para Bruxelas O cabeça de lista do Chega admitiu que o partido não alcançou os seus objetivos. \"Não vim para ter um tacho, não vim para ser promovido a qualquer coisa, não vim para ter um futuro, porque eu tenho um passado\" . António Tânger-Corrêa garantiu também que o Chega vai para Bruxelas \"com tudo\". O cabeça de lista garantiu que vai \"representar Portugal\" apesar de lamentar a eleição de apenas dois eurodeputados por parte do Chega. \"Nós vamos para lá para fazer a diferença, nós vamos para lá negociar, nós vamos para lá principalmente para representar aquilo que Portugal precisa: os nossos agricultores, os nossos pescadores, os nossos industriais, os nossos produtores, os nossos portugueses que até agora têm sido desprezados\". André Ventura também reconheceu que o Chega não teve um dia bom nestas europeias mas deixou farpas à Iniciativa Liberal por ter pensado ter ficado em terceiro lugar . \"Era ver o entusiasmo deles ao início da noite, ao ultrapassarem o Chega. O frenesim por todas as televisões, jornais e sedes partidárias para no fim da noite se perceber o óbvio: o Chega não venceu mas ninguém nos ultrapassou em ranking de forças políticas\". João Cotrim de Figueiredo: \"Em cinco anos estamos em todos os parlamentos\" O cabeça de lista da Iniciativa Liberal às eleições europeias, João Cotrim de Figueiredo, celebrou esta noite o \"melhor resultado eleitoral de sempre\" do partido . \"Em cinco anos estamos em todos os parlamentos, em cinco anos desmentimos aqueles velhos do Restelo que diziam que o liberalismo não tinha hipóteses em Portugal. Tem, tem sim!\", exclamou, sob um grande aplauso. \"Hoje provámos, crescemos, crescemos muito e vamos continuar a crescer\", acrescentou, liderando o entusiasmo da assistência na palavra de ordem \"o liberalismo funciona e faz falta a Portugal\". \"Viemos para ficar, viemos para fazer de Portugal um país mais liberal, e estamos aqui para nunca dar tréguas nem aos socialistas nem aos populistas\" , frisou Cotrim. A Iniciativa Liberal obteve um dos melhores resultados da noite, com 9,07 por cento dos votos, ultrapassando a votação obtida nas eleições legislativas e elegendo dois eurodeputados, o mesmo número que o Chega, apesar de este se manter como terceira força política. Catarina Martins: mandato do BE “será pela paz” A cabeça de lista do BE declarou que, numas eleições “muito difíceis e num momento complicado em toda a Europa, o Bloco de Esquerda mantém representação no Parlamento Europeu”. “A Europa vive um momento difícil. Viemos a esta campanha a saber do perigo da extrema-direita” , frisou Catarina Martins. A candidata sublinhou que “o mandato do Bloco de Esquerda no Parlamento Europeu será um mandato pela paz e pelo fim do genocídio na Palestina”. “Não aceitamos o Pacto das Migrações e a vergonha criminalização da imigração, da mesma forma que não aceitaremos nenhum recuo nas liberdades e nos direitos das mulheres ou de ninguém”, vincou. “A nossa Europa e o nosso país é de iguais e é pela igualdade que lutamos sempre” . A coordenadora do partido, Mariana Mortágua, afirmou por sua vez que “a inteligência, a determinação, a energia, a competência” com que Catarina Martins fez esta campanha são as mesmas que vão “levar para o Parlamento Europeu onde vai representar a esquerda”. A bloquista falou ainda numa “derrota da extrema-direita face aos resultados das legislativas”. João Oliveira prometeu fazer ouvir a voz do povo João Oliveira falou aos simpatizantes comunistas depois de a CDU ter confirmado a sua eleição nestas Europeias, prometendo continuar a fazer ouvir a voz do povo quando estiver em Estrasburgo. O cabeça de lista comunista agradeceu a quem fez a \"opção corajosa\" de votar na coligação, \"contrariando o obscurantismo, o conformismo com que se procurava condicionar e aprisionar as consciências\" . \"Não se deixaram condicionar pelo medo, pelos dogmas, sejam eles os do neoliberalismo ou do militarismo, ou pela lógica da política de confrontação como única saída para as relações entre os povos\", declarou. Livre, ADN e PAN sem mandatos O Livre apontou uma \"grande polarização\" das europeias . Rui Tavares sublinhou que o partido ficou perto de eleger Francisco Paupério e falou numa noite “triste”. \"É uma noite triste para o Livre. Valorizamos o que conseguimos (...), mas há também frustração por não conseguir a eleição e uma derrota em que o Livre, com um resultado muito perto dos 4%, não consegue eleger\" , lamentou. \"É o tipo de resultado que, em qualquer cenário normal, nos permitiria estar aqui a fazer a festa. Infelizmente não estamos. É uma noite em que o Livre perde as eleições e eu quero assumir essa derrota\", disse o porta-voz, perante dezenas de apoiantes no Teatro da Luz, onde o partido acompanhou a noite eleitoral. Joana Amaral Dias, candidata do ADN, garantiu que o partido honrará “todos os votos” . No PAN, Inês Sousa Real considerou que os resultados desta eleição são um percalço no percurso do partido. O candidato Pedro Fidalgo Marques assumiu a derrota. \"O nosso mandato foi perdido em 2020 e o objetivo de o resgatar era um objetivo difícil, mas nós nunca voltamos as costas a objetivos e a tarefas difíceis, porque quem ficaria a perder e quem ficou a perder foram as causas que o PAN representa\" , salientou o cabeça de lista.

Parts of the country have been ablaze since the weekend, with temperatures in some areas topping 30C (86F). The northern and central parts have been worst affected. The firefighters - two women and a man - died while tackling a blaze in Tábua in Coimbra, central Portugal, the country's civil protection authority said . More than 5,000 firefighters have been tackling the wildfires that Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro said are \"raging across the country\". Ten thousand hectares (37 sq miles) have already been burned between Porto and Aveiro in the north, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said on Monday. André Fernandes, Portugal's national civil protection commander, said that there were 65 fires in progress at 13:00 local time (13:00 BST) on Tuesday. Local media reported that hospitals in affected areas have received people with burns, breathing difficulties and other injuries from the fires. At least 12 firefighters have been injured, two seriously, reports say. Police have shut motorways, including the main road between the capital, Lisbon, and Porto, and dozens of houses have been destroyed by the fire. Many schools in Gondomar, an area near central Porto, closed on Tuesday, its mayor said. Vehicle caught fire Portugal's civil protection authority named the three firefighters who died as Sonia Cláudia Melo, Paulo Jorge Santos, and Susana Cristina Carvalho. The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, said that he was “deeply saddened” by the deaths and Montenegro issued a note of condolence . Mr Fernandes said the vehicle caught fire but that it wasn't clear whether it had crashed beforehand, according to the news agency, AP. Two more firefighters were injured during the incident, he added . Montenegro had previously said that firefighter João Silva had died of \"a sudden illness\" while battling a blaze in Oliveira de Azeméis. The EU said it would send eight firefighting planes to Portugal to help it tackle the severe blazes. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was \"urgently mobilising\" and urged other member states to send further assistance. Montenegro also thanked France, Greece, Italy and Spain for their \"rapid and essential help in combating this scourge\" in a post on X. Portugal already owns 30 water bombers - and has deployed over 1,500 fire engines - but authorities said the complex situation required additional support. EPA Wildfires have affected Portugal for several days Several fires that broke out in the Aveiro region over the weekend forced about 70 residents to flee, the civil protection authority has said. \"The situation is not out of control, but it is very complex,\" Fernandes said. Portugal and neighbouring Spain have recorded fewer wildfires this year, largely due to a wet and rainy start to the year. But they remain vulnerable to blazes due to hot and dry conditions. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless rapid efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions are made.

The Saudi bid was the only candidate and was acclaimed by the applause of more than 200 FIFA member federations. They took part remotely in an online meeting hosted in Zurich by the soccer body’s president Gianni Infantino. “The vote of the congress is loud and clear,” said Infantino, who had asked officials on a bank of screens to clap their hands at head level to show their support. The decision was combined with approving the only candidate to host the 2030 World Cup. Spain, Portugal and Morocco will co-host in a six-nation project, with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay each getting one of the 104 games. AP AUDIO: FIFA names Saudi Arabia as 2034 World Cup host; Spain, Portugal and Morocco to co-host 2030 edition AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on the FIFA World Cup host for 2034. The South American connection will mark the centenary of Uruguay hosting the first World Cup in 1930. The decisions complete a mostly opaque 15-month bid process which Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk. RELATED COVERAGE Alguacil to step down as Real Sociedad coach at end of season Lecce says its Serie A match at Atalanta to be postponed following death of physio Real Madrid loses injured Camavinga for Copa del Rey final against Barcelona “We look forward to hosting an exceptional and unprecedented edition of the FIFA World Cup by harnessing our strengths and capabilities to bring joy to football fans around the world,” Prince Mohammed said in a statement. FIFA and Saudi officials have said hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women, with Infantino on Wednesday calling the World Cup a “unique catalyst for positive social change and unity.” “I fully trust our hosts to address all open points in this process, and deliver a World Cup that meets the world’s expectations,” the FIFA president said. An international collective of rights groups said FIFA made a “reckless decision” to approve Saudi Arabia without getting public assurances, and the Football Supporters Europe group said it was “the day football truly lost its mind.” A fast-track path to victory was cleared last year by FIFA accepting the three-continent hosting plan for the 2030 World Cup . It meant only soccer federations in Asia and Oceania were eligible for the 2034 contest, and FIFA gave countries less than four weeks to declare a bid. Only Saudi Arabia did. The win will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament. Amnesty International said awarding the tournament to Saudi Arabia represents “a moment of great danger” for human rights. “FIFA’s reckless decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia without ensuring adequate human rights protections are in place will put many lives at risk,” said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Labor Rights and Sport.” One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters (yards) above the ground in Neom — a futuristic city that does not yet exist — and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh. During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record that was widely criticized this year at the United Nations . Saudi and international rights groups and activists warned FIFA it has not learned the lessons of Qatar’s much-criticized preparations to host the 2022 World Cup. “At every stage of this bidding process, FIFA has shown its commitment to human rights to be a sham,” Cockburn said. The kingdom plans to spend tens of billion of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince’s sweeping Vision 2030 project that aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. “It’s amazing. The infrastructure, the stadiums, the conditions for the fans and everything. After what I see, I’m more convinced that 2034 will be the best World Cup ever,” Cristiano Ronaldo said in a recorded package posted on X. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has been part of Saudi Arabia’s lavish spending on soccer — stunning the sport when agreeing to sign for Al Nassr in 2022 for a record-breaking salary reportedly worth up to $200 million a year. Critics have accused Saudi Arabia of “sportswashing” the kingdom’s reputation. The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 — aligning with the organizer of sport’s most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project . The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, though some from women international players. The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase. FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco , and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States that is a pet project for Infantino. North American soccer body CONCACAF signed a multi-year deal with PIF, Saudi stadiums host Super Cup games for Italy and Spain, and nearly 50 FIFA member federations have signed working agreements with Saudi counterparts. Lavish spending by PIF-owned Saudi clubs in the past two years buying and paying players – including Cristiano Ronaldo , Neymar, Karim Benzema and Sadio Mané – put hundreds of millions of dollars into European soccer. That influence could be key in talks to agree which months to play the 2034 World Cup. The November-December slot taken by Qatar in 2022 to avoid extreme midsummer heat is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games. Still, January 2034 could be an option — and likely better for European clubs and leagues —after the International Olympic Committee said it saw few issues in clashing with the Salt Lake Winter Games opening Feb. 10, 2034. The IOC also has a major commercial deal with Saudi Arabia , to host the new Esports Olympics. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer GRAHAM DUNBAR Dunbar is an Associated Press sports news reporter in Geneva, Switzerland.

REUTERS/Pedro Nunes Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LISBON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament on Friday gave final approval to the centre-right minority government's 2025 budget bill, which promises to lift growth and generate a small surplus despite tax cuts for youths and businesses and hikes in wages and pensions. The bill passed with only 80 votes in favour from the alliance that supports the government because the Socialist Party, which has 78 seats in parliament, abstained, as it did in the previous reading of the bill. Sign up here. The remaining 72 lawmakers, including those from the far-right Chega , voted against. The vote represents some relief for the minority government, which many analysts had expected to struggle to survive after it took over in April, raising the prospect of a third snap election in as many years. The leader of the Socialists in parliament, Alexandra Leitão, said that her party's abstention, allowing the budget to pass, was purely to avoid a fresh political crisis. She said the government should now \"put an end to excuses, diversionary manoeuvres and victimisation\", referring to its complaints of being blocked from legislating by the opposition. The leader of Chega, Andre Ventura, said the Socialists were now \"the crutch\" of the Social Democrat-led government, accusing both parties of collusion and \"not caring about the fight against corruption\". Before the vote, Chega unfurled banners down the facade of the parliamentary building in which it denounced the increase of politicians' wages in the budget as shameful. The complaint refers to the reversal of a 5% salary cut imposed in 2010, a year before Portugal received a bailout . The banners were later removed by order of the president of parliament. The budget expects economic growth to pick-up slightly to 2.1% in 2025. It aims for a surplus of 0.3% of GDP next year, despite the majority of young people having a total exemption from paying personal income tax and reducing the general corporate tax to 20% from 21% now. Infrastructure Minister Miguel Pinto Luz said that the margin available for more fiscal stimulus \"is conditioned by the need to keep the public accounts balance and public debt on a downward path\". Public servants will have salary hikes between 2.15% and 6.9% next year and pensions will be increased by around 3.9%, above the 2.3% estimated inflation in 2025.

Most of the arson attacks involved trash containers and street equipment. ‘Our society, despite the social, economic and cultural problems and inequalities that still afflict it, is a generally peaceful society and wants to remain so,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said in a statement Wednesday.",

Governo de Miguel Albuquerque cai Joana Abrantes Gomes 17 Dezembro 2024 2 A moção de censura contra o Governo liderado por Miguel Albuquerque, que foi apresentada pelo Chega-Madeira no início de novembro, foi aprovada esta manhã com 26 votos a favor. Os deputados do Chega, do Juntos Pelo Povo (JPP), do PS, do PAN e da Iniciativa Liberal (IL) na Assembleia Regional da Madeira juntaram-se esta terça-feira no voto favorável à moção de censura contra o Governo liderado por Miguel Albuquerque, confirmando, assim, o desfecho que já era dado como certo há semanas. É a primeira vez que um Executivo regional é derrubado com base neste tipo de iniciativa. A moção de censura ao Governo de Miguel Albuquerque foi apresentada no dia 6 de novembro pelo Chega-Madeira, que a justificou com os processos judiciais em que o líder madeirense e quatro secretários regionais foram constituídos arguidos nos últimos meses. Orçamento chumba na Madeira. “Só saio com moção de censura” Ler Mais A aprovação da moção de censura acontece depois de, na semana passada, o Parlamento madeirense ter chumbado o Orçamento e o plano da região autónoma para 2025 , com os votos contra dos 26 deputados do PS, JPP, Chega, Iniciativa Liberal e PAN. Só os 21 parlamentares do PSD e do CDS votaram a favor de ambos os documentos. Desde 2015 que a região autónoma é liderada por Miguel Albuquerque, do PSD. O presidente dos sociais-democratas da Madeira, em coligação com o CDS, venceu sem maioria absoluta as eleições regionais de setembro de 2023, mas o arquipélago foi novamente às urnas passados oito meses, na sequência da demissão de Albuquerque por ter sido constituído arguido num processo de suspeitas de corrupção. Nas eleições antecipadas de 26 de maio, o líder do PSD-Madeira voltou a vencer, mas novamente sem maioria, o que ditou a continuação da crise política no arquipélago. Agora, ainda que a Constituição não obrigue a novo escrutínio eleitoral, o cenário mais apontado é o de avançar para as terceiras eleições em ano e meio na Madeira , e Miguel Albuquerque, que foi reeleito presidente do partido em março, já assumiu que será recandidato . “Se a oposição, por motivos fúteis, quer deitar o Governo abaixo, só há uma solução e essa solução — nós assumimos integralmente — é devolver a voz ao povo madeirense e irmos outra vez a votos”, afirmou, no início deste mês. Se se concretizar uma nova ida às urnas, porém, não se afiguram alterações significativas à composição do Parlamento regional, que atualmente é constituído por 19 deputados do PSD, 11 do PS, nove do JPP, quatro do Chega, dois do CDS-PP, um da IL e um do PAN. Em declarações aos jornalistas após a aprovação da iniciativa apresentada pelo Chega, Miguel Albuquerque disse que as eleições devem acontecer “o mais rapidamente possível”, por considerar que “não há condições para refrear o desenvolvimento económico da Madeira”. O ainda Presidente do Executivo regional, que vai manter-se em funções até à formação de um novo Governo, revelou também que, para já, não há planos para a realização um Congresso extraordinário para eleger um novo líder do PSD-Madeira. Já o líder parlamentar do Chega no Parlamento madeirense, Miguel Castro, reiterou o “momento histórico” na vida política do arquipélago. A aprovação da moção de censura “é um sinal de que este Governo já não estava nas condições de governar”, sublinhou, adiantando que o partido não tem “qualquer problema em ir para eleições”.
