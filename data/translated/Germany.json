The Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to François Ozon’s French drama “By the Grace of God,” a fact-based account of the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal behind the ongoing trial of Philippe Barbarin, the archbishop of Lyon. Accepting the award, Lapid said “Synonyms,” which stars Tom Mercier, would likely be considered “scandalous” in Israel and France – the pic skewers stereotypes from both nations – but added that it was ultimately a celebration.

German filmmaker Angela Schanelec won best director for her drama about a troubled family, ”I Was at Home, But.” In another win for a German film, the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize went to Nora Fingscheidt’s “System Crasher,” about a disturbed young girl who yearns to be with her mother as she falls through Germany’s child welfare system. The six-person festival jury, headed by French actress Juliette Binoche, awarded the best actor and actress Silver Bears to the stars of Wang Xiaoshuai’s Chinese drama “So Long, My Son,” Wang Jingchun and Yong Mei, respectively. Maurizio Braucci, Claudio Giovannesi and Roberto Saviano won best screenplay for their examination of troubled youth in “Piranhas.” Receiving the Silver Bear, Giovannesi, who also directed, dedicated the award to the young people of Naples and to Italy, saying he hoped that “art, culture and eduction will once again become a priority in the country.” The Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution went to Danish cinematographer Rasmus Videbæk for his work on Hans Petter Moland’s Scandinavian title “Out Stealing Horses.” Suhaib Gasmelbari took the Berlinale Glashütte Original – Documentary Award for “Talking About Trees,” which chronicles the efforts of a group of film enthusiasts to revive an old cinema in Sudan. Mehmet Akif Büyükatalay won Best First Feature for “Oray,” a German film about a young Muslim man in Cologne struggling with religion and marriage. The awards ceremony marked the end of Dieter Kosslick’s career as Berlinale director after 18 years. In an emotional farewell, Kosslick received a standing ovation at the start of the ceremony, held at the Berlinale Palast. Kosslick then introduced the Berlinale’s new co-chiefs, Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian, who officially take the helm in June. Saturday’s ceremony began just hours after the first news reports of the death of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who was commemorated at the ceremony. “We think about those who can’t be here tonight. Bruno Ganz is in the sky over Berlin,” said host Anke Engelke in a nod to one of Ganz’s most beloved films, “Wings of Desire.” Wim Wenders’ 1987 classic is known in German as “Der Himmel über Berlin,” or “The Sky Over Berlin.” This year’s festival was marred by the cancellation of Zhang Yimou’s “One Second,” a drama set during China’s Cultural Revolution, due to a “technical reasons,” which reduced the number of competition titles to 16. Speaking for the jury, Binoche expressed regret at not being able to see the it, adding, “We hope to see the film soon in cinemas.” Some 400 films unspooled in all of the festival’s various sections this year. With approximately half a million admissions and more than 300,000 tickets sold, the Berlinale is one of the largest publicly attended film festivals in the world. See the full list of winners below.

        "text": "LONDON — At first, there was complete silence from officials. As rumors spread on social media, police had nothing to say about allegations of mass sexual assaults and other crimes carried out on New Year's Eve in the German city of Cologne. It was only days later that officials reported that hundreds of women were victims of assault in Cologne, Hamburg and other German cities.\n\nBut numbers that are now emerging are likely to shock a country still coming to terms with what happened in Cologne more than half a year ago. According to a leaked police document, published by Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters NDR and WDR, the previous estimates have to be dramatically revised — upward.\n\nAuthorities now think that on New Year's Eve, more than 1,200 women were sexually assaulted in various German cities, including more than 600 in Cologne and about 400 in Hamburg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 2,000 men were allegedly involved, and 120 suspects — about half of them foreign nationals who had only recently arrived in Germany — have been identified.\n\nOnly four have been convicted, but more trials are underway.\n\nOn Thursday, a court in Cologne sentenced two men in the New Year's Eve assaults. Hussein A., a 21-year-old Iraqi, and Hassan T., a 26-year-old Algerian, were handed suspended one-year sentences. Both arrived in Germany in the past two years, a court spokesman said. He declined to specify whether the two had sought asylum.\n\nOfficials have linked the sexual assaults to the influx of refugees. \"There is a connection between the emergence of this phenomenon and the rapid migration in 2015,\" Holger Münch, president of the German Federal Crime Police Office, told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Many suspects had originally come to Germany from North African countries rather than Syria, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also predicted that many of the New Year's Eve perpetrators will never be convicted. \"We have to presume that many of those crimes will never be fully investigated.\" Germany has relatively low CCTV coverage, which makes it more difficult for investigators to identify suspects.\n\nAlthough it is not expected that significantly more CCTV cameras will be installed in the foreseeable future, other measures have been taken. Germany's Parliament passed a stricter sexual-assault law last week that will make it easier for courts to sentence those who facilitate or are involved in assaults.\n\nThe new law will be based on the premise that \"no means no,\" meaning that sexual assault can be punished as rape if the offender ignores the \"discernible contrary will\" of the victim.\n\nProtesters marched through the central train station in Cologne to call for an end to violence against women after dozens of attacks on New Year's Eve. (Video: Facebook/Rote Antifa [Essen])\n\nLawmakers were facing intense pressure to pass the new legislation, particularly in the wake of the Cologne assaults. Most of the perpetrators in that city stand accused of groping and facilitating sex assaults as part of a group — accusations that were difficult to prosecute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stricter law is also supposed to make it easier for refugees to be deported if they are convicted in sex-assault cases — an aspect of the new law that activists and advocates for refugees have harshly criticized.\n\nHalina Wawzyniak, a lawmaker from the Left Party, told The Washington Post last week that immigration issues and sexual-assault cases should not be linked, as refugees could end up facing a \"double punishment\" by being deported. \"The debate used to be about 'no means no' — now all that is being talked about in social networks are foreigners again,\" she said.",

There is no hope of finding any survivors, French police said on Tuesday. “There is no need for any rescue operations, everyone is dead,” said a police officer in the town of Le Vernet, near the crash site. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in the evening that one of the black boxes from the plane was found. Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane reports from Berlin Search teams have been struggling to work in the remote mountainous area where the aircraft crashed. Germanwings said the Flight 4U9525 plane, which was travelling from Barcelona in Spain to Dusseldorf in Germany, started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes. Germanwings executive Thomas Winkelmann said that the pilot had “more than 10 years of experience” and some 6,000 flying hours on an Airbus jet under his belt. “The aircraft’s contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers ended at 10:53am (9:57GMT) at an altitude of about 6,000 feet (approximately 1,825 metres). The plane then crashed,” Winkelmann told reporters. Advertisement He said that routine maintenance of the aircraft had been performed by Lufthansa Technik and there were no abnormalities with it. In a live briefing earlier, French President Francois Hollande said: “There were German and Turkish victims. There should be no French victims but I am not completely certain … We are in mourning,” he said. “It’s a tragedy on our soil.” TIMELINE: Major air disasters A spokesman for Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said that some 45 people travelling on the plane had Spanish surnames. Sixteen children and two teachers from a high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany are believed to be among the dead. “There is a strong suspicion” that the students and teachers were on the doomed airplane, said the spokeswoman from the town in North Rhine-Westphalia state. “We don’t have any official confirmation yet.” ‘A loud noise, then nothing’ The owner of a camping site in Alpes-de-Hautes-Provence said he heard the plane come down. “There was a loud noise and then suddenly nothing.

Lutz Bachmann, 41, a butcher’s son from Dresden and co-founder of the organisation, was seen as Pegida’s figurehead and his resignation throws the future of the group into doubt. The picture of Bachmann posing as Hitler after a session at his hairdresser, complete with a Hitler hairstyle dyed black and parted on the right and a toothbrush moustache, went viral on Wednesday after it was published by , a local newspaper, the Dresden Morgenpost. Pegida’s popularity has led to widespread fears that Germany is in the grip of a new breed of far-right ideologues, and the picture raised questions about the group’s allegiance to the far-right scene. The image, which had appeared on Bachmann’s Facebook page, was accompanied by the line: “He’s Back,” after Timur Vermes’ best-selling 2012 satirical novel of the same name about Hitler. Bachmann, a publicity agent, deleted his profile shortly after being contacted by the Morgenpost. A Morgenpost reader discovered the photograph, along with what appeared to be a closed Facebook conversation between Bachmann and one of his Facebook contacts, in which he described immigrants as “cattle”, “scumbags” and “trash”. The comments were posted on 19 September, aroundabout two months before the first Pegida march in Dresden. State prosecutors said on Wednesday they had begun investigating Bachmann on charges of sedition. He resigned after a meeting of the 12 members of Pegida’s leadership committee at which Bachmann apologised for the picture A statement is expected to follow on Wednesday evening. Pegida spokeswoman Kathrin Oertel, told Spiegel Online Bachmann’s resignation was the “only possibilty for the movement”. “As an association, we reject the Facebook postings made by Lutz Bachmann in September which have now come to light in the strongest possible terms. They do nothing to nurture trust in Pegida’s goals or its protagonists.” A spokesman for Bernd Lucke, the head of the political party Alternative für Deutschland, an anti-euro party which has publicly expressed an allegiance with the aims of Pegida, said that with his “sad utterings and disgusting jokes”, Bachmann had “embarrassed the people of Pegida who have been compelled by honest concerns to take to the streets”. Responding to the picture, Bachmann told Wednesday’s Bild : “I took the photo at the hairdresser’s, for the publication of the audiobook of the satire He’s Back … you need to be able to joke about yourself now and then”. Asked about the derogatory comments he allegedly made about immigrants, Bachmann replied: “We don’t comment about private matters.” Bachmann, who has multiple convictions for burglary, assault and drug possession, was said by German intelligence services to be a target for Islamist terrorists who said on social media sites they intended to kill him. For that reason, a planned Pegida demonstration in Dresden on Monday, which would have been the group’s 13th, was cancelled. Pegida, which has been growing from strength to strength and at its last gathering attracted 25,000 supporters, has vowed to meet again next week in the east German city. But it is unclear whether it has a future without Bachmann, who was by far its best orator, and had garnered a popular following. Legida, the group’s Leipzig offshoot, will meet on Wednesday evening, with about 100,000 pro- and counter-protesters expected to gather. Nineteen counter-demonstrations and vigils have been registered with authorities. But town officials have banned the Legida marchers from taking the historical route through the city used for the peaceful anti-communist protests of 1989, which started in Leipzig and led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Anger is already high among former dissidents that the movement has hijacked the phrase “Wir sind das Volk” or “We are the people” that was chanted 25 years ago. In Pegida’s first ever press conference in Dresden on Monday, Bachmann and Oertel, insisted that the group was not racist, and later in a heated television discussion distanced themselves from footage showing Pegida demonstrators delivering racist remarks. Bachmann has always been keen to stress his pro-foreigner credentials, showing photographs on his Facebook site of his Turkish best man, and saying he has “Muslim friends”. Meanwhile a Catholic priest who took part in a demonstration organised by the Pegida-offshoot group Dügida in the western city of Duisburg on Monday has been banned from preaching by his religious elders, after he compared the movement to the Crusades.

Germany will donate six multi-purpose helicopters to Ukraine, Berlin said on Tuesday, boosting Kyiv's assets in the Black Sea against Russia's naval fleet. Kyiv will receive six Sea King Mk41 helicopters from the German armed forces, which are expected to arrive in the country in the next six months, the German Defense Ministry said. The Sea King is a \"a proven and robust helicopter that will help the Ukrainians in many areas: from reconnaissance over the Black Sea to transporting soldiers,\" said German Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius. Germany announced the planned delivery of the helicopters at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, with around 50 of Kyiv's allies coordinating support for the country. \"It is the first German delivery of its kind,\" Pistorius added. \"Thank you, Germany!\" Ukraine's defense ministry said in a post to X. \"Together, we are stronger!\" Berlin describes the Sea King as a \"workhorse of naval aviation\" and they have been operational since the mid-1970s. Originally designed to transport troops and equipment and to conduct sea rescue missions, the Sea King has a range of around 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). The all-weather, amphibious helicopters can be kitted out with heavy machine guns for special forces missions, Germany said. The Sea Kings will improve Ukraine's airborne and naval aviation capabilities in and around the Black Sea, a key battleground in the nearly two year-old war. Kyiv has mounted repeated attacks against Moscow's Black Sea fleet, partly based on the annexed Crimean Peninsula, using its special forces to carry out amphibious landings on the territory. Ukraine has managed to largely stop Russia's fleet operating in the western Black Sea, its missiles and drones making the area dangerous for Moscow's naval forces, the British Defense Ministry said on Monday. Earlier this month, Australia said it would not send its now-retired fleet of Taipan helicopters to Ukraine, despite a request from Kyiv to take them on. Australia retired the Taipans in 2023 after a fatal training exercise crash that killed four people. \"The Ukrainians desperately need military helicopters,\" Michael Shoebridge, the director of defense and security think tank, Strategic Analysis Australia, told Sky News Australia. However, the helicopters are not in \"flying condition,\" said Australia's defense industry minister, Pat Conroy. Germany's Pistorius said on Tuesday that Berlin would also supplement Ukraine's air defenses, delivering more IRIT-T systems and Gepard anti-aircraft guns as part of the €6 billion ($6.5 billion) of military aid committed to Kyiv since February 2022. Germany is Europe's biggest contributor of military equipment to Ukraine, but has faced criticism over its refusal to send long-range Taurus missiles to the country. Maintaining Ukraine's air defenses is a \"number 1 priority,\" the German defense minister added. Germany and France said in November they would take the lead in strengthening Ukraine's air defenses, bolstering Kyiv's ground-based network. Ukraine uses a variety of air defense systems, ranging from the U.S.-provided Patriots that have intercepted Russian hypersonic missiles, to large-caliber machine guns that have often been used to shoot down the Iranian-designed Shahed kamikaze drones that Moscow frequently launches at the war-torn country. \"This year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend frontline positions, which will have an impact on the strategic situation and the war effort as a whole,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday.

        "text": "News Politics German court bans funding for extreme-right party, fueling debate on AfD Coming at a time of mass protests against the far-right Alternative for Germany, the ruling is stoking debate about using legal means to stop the party’s rise. Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Co-leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel and AfD member Bernd Baumann | John Mcdougall/AFP via Getty Images January 23, 2024 6:11 pm CET By James Angelos BERLIN — Germany’s top court ruled in favor of cutting state funding for an extreme-right party in a decision that is likely to further fuel an already strident debate in the country about whether legal steps should be taken to rein in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). In a landmark ruling Tuesday, the Constitutional Court said state financing for a marginal, extremist party known as Die Heimat , or The Homeland — previously known as the National Democratic Party or NPD — could be cut because the party “shows disdain for the free democratic basic order” and aims to replace German democracy with an authoritarian state based on Nazi-era notions of a racially unified Volksgemeinschaft , or “people’s community.” The decision is amplifying an impassioned debate in Germany about whether to undertake a legal effort to counter the AfD. For weeks, politicians have weighed in on the possibility of an outright prohibition of the party. Tuesday’s court decision is now sparking discussion on the possibility of revoking the party’s state funding. Advertisement Advertisement The court decision “would also be a blueprint for the AfD,” Markus Söder, the conservative Bavarian premier, said in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt ahead of the ruling. The domestic debate about what to do about the AfD has grown all the more intense since a report earlier this month revealed that members of party were present at a secret meeting of right-wing extremists in a hotel near the city of Potsdam in which a “master plan” to deport foreigners and “unassimilated citizens” en masse was discussed. Many in Germany drew parallels to similar plans made by the Nazis. That revelation prompted huge protests in Germany against right-wing radicalism and the AfD in recent days. Last weekend alone, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Germany. In Berlin, demonstrators assembled in front of the Bundestag and chanted: “All of Berlin hates the AfD!” The AfD has continued to rise in polls even as it has steadily become more extreme. The party is now polling at 23 percent, according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls , and in the regions of the former East Germany, where three state elections will be held in September, the party is leading . Germany’s constitution has long allowed for the prohibition of parties that “seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order.” In 2017, lawmakers amended the constitution to make possible the revocation of state funding for such parties. Tuesday’s ruling marks the first time the law was put into practice. The legal possibility of banning or revoking a party’s funding is an outgrowth of Germany’s Nazi past. In Tuesday’s ruling, the court referred to the notion of Germany as a “militant democracy,” a rough concept that means the state has legal means to restrict the freedoms of authoritarian parties to prevent them from using instruments of democracy to gain power. Advertisement Advertisement The legal hurdles for banning or cutting state funding for a party remain very high. In 2017, Germany’s top court decided against a ban of the NPD, arguing that, while the party intended to undermine democracy, it was so marginal it had no chance of actually doing so. In 2021, the party did so poorly in the federal election that it lost state funding. Prior to that, however, the party received considerable amounts of state money; in 2016, for instance, the party received €1.1 million. Tuesday’s ruling ensures it cannot get funding for a six-year period. “Even if the constitutional hurdles for future proceedings remain high, we now have another instrument to protect our democracy,” said Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, following the ruling. Many mainstream politicians fear that any effort to ban the AfD or restrict its funding would be a dire tactical mistake, serving only to strengthen the party by allowing its leaders to depict their opponents as suppressing the democratic will of AfD voters.

Public outcry followed revelations that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had discussed plans to mass deport immigrants. Tens of thousands of people have gathered across Germany to protest against a far-right political party and its stance against migrants. People protested in several cities and small towns on Saturday, with some mocking the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party with signs saying “Facism is not an alternative”, German media reported. The protests come following an outcry after it was revealed that AfD members held a meeting with far-right activists and discussed plans to mass deport foreigners. Police said some 35,000 people joined a call under the banner “Defend democracy – Frankfurt against the AfD”, marching in the financial heart of Germany. A similar number, some carrying posters like “Nazis out”, turned up in the northern city of Hanover. Protests were also held in cities including Braunschweig, Erfurt and Kassel and many smaller towns, mirroring mobilisation every day over the past week. Some 50,000 people demonstrated in Hamburg, Germany’s second-largest city, on Friday, police said. In all, demonstrations have been called in about 100 locations across Germany from Friday through the weekend, including in Berlin on Sunday. Politicians, churches, and Bundesliga coaches have urged people to stand up against the AfD.    On January 10, a report by investigative outlet Correctiv, revealed that AfD members had discussed the expulsion of immigrants and “non-assimilated citizens” at a meeting with other far-right activists. Among the participants at the talks was Martin Sellner, a leader of Austria’s Identitarian Movement, which subscribes to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory that claims there is a plot by non-white migrants to replace Europe’s “native” white population. News of the far-right gathering sent shockwaves across Germany at a time when the AfD is polling second in nationwide surveys, just months before three major regional elections in eastern Germany where their support is strongest. The anti-immigration party confirmed the presence of its members at the meeting, but has denied taking on the “remigration” project championed by Sellner. Co-leader Alice Weidel parted ways with one of her advisers who participated in the talks. But leading politicians, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who joined a demonstration last weekend, said any plan to expel immigrants or citizens alike amounted to “an attack against our democracy, and in turn, on all of us”. He urged “all to take a stand – for cohesion, for tolerance, for our democratic Germany”. Members of the country’s business industry also voiced their concerns. “If everything is true as reported, then that is absolutely disgusting,” said Siemens Energy’s supervisory board chairman Joe Kaeser in an interview with Reuters published on Saturday, Kaeser’s comments come after leaders of German companies, including chip manufacturer Infineon and chemicals maker Evonik voiced their concerns earlier this week. Highlighting lessons from Germany’s history, Kaeser warned of the damage to Germany’s image around the world and called on German businesses to publicly warn of the consequences.

Hier lest ihr, welche Rechte sie im Deutschen Bundestag künftig  haben. Die fraktionslosen Abgeordneten stimmen über die Rechtsstellung der parlamentarischen Gruppen Die Linke und BSW ab. © picture alliance/dpa | Britta Pedersen Der Bundestag hat am Freitag, 2. Februar 2024, die Rechtsstellung der parlamentarischen Gruppen Die Linke und BSW (kurz für: „Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht – Für Vernunft und Gerechtigkeit“) geregelt und einen entsprechenden Gruppenstatus beschlossen. Das Plenum hat mit der Mehrheit von SPD, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen und FDP gegen die Stimmen von CDU/CSU und AfD jeweils zwei dazu vorgelegte Beschlussempfehlungen ( 20/10219 , 20/10220 ) des Ältestenrates angenommen. Der Ältestenrat hatte am Donnerstag, 1. Februar, empfohlen, 28 fraktionslose Abgeordnete als Gruppe Die Linke und zehn Abgeordnete als Gruppe BSW anzuerkennen. Zwei zu den Empfehlungen vorgelegte Änderungsanträge mehrerer fraktionsloser Abgeordneter ( 20/10236 , 20/10237 ) wurden hingegen mit der breiten Mehrheit von SPD, Grünen, FDP, CDU/CSU und AfD abgelehnt. In den Vorlagen hatten sich die Abgeordneten unter anderem gegen eine Beschränkung des Fragerechts gegenüber der Bundesregierung gewendet. Hintergrund der Regelung ist die Auflösung der einstigen Fraktion Die Linke im vergangenen Jahr. Nachdem mehrere Abgeordnete die Fraktion verlassen hatten und dadurch die Mindeststärke von 37 Mitgliedern nicht mehr gegeben war, trat die Fraktion am 6. Dezember 2023 in einen sogenannten Liquidationsprozess ein. Die einstigen Parlamentarierinnen und Parlamentarier der Bundestagsfraktion sind seitdem fraktionslose Mitglieder des Deutschen Bundestages. Mit der Anerkennung als Gruppe waren für fraktionslose Abgeordnete in der Vergangenheit deutlich mehr Ressourcen und parlamentarische Rechte verbunden als ohne diesen Status. Rechtsstellung der Gruppen Die Linke und BSW Die Geschäftsordnung des Bundestages ermöglicht Abgeordneten, die sich zusammenschließen wollen, die Fraktionsmindeststärke aber nicht erreichen, die Anerkennung als Gruppe. Die 28 Abgeordneten der Linken hatten diese Anerkennung am 1. Dezember, die zehn BSW-Abgeordneten am 12. Dezember 2023 bei Bundestagspräsidentin Bärbel Bas beantragt. Beide Gruppen unterscheiden sich im Hinblick auf ihre Rechtsstellung nur dadurch, dass die Gruppe Die Linke bis zu zwei Aktuelle Stunden und die Gruppe BSW eine Aktuelle Stunde pro Jahr verlangen kann. Im Plenum sollen die Abgeordneten der Gruppe Die Linke vom Präsidium aus gesehen links von der SPD-Fraktion platziert werden, die Abgeordneten der Gruppe BSW links außen neben den Abgeordneten der Gruppe Die Linke. Ausschüsse, Fragerecht und Redezeit Beide Gruppen sollen ordentliche und stellvertretende Mitglieder in die Fachausschüsse und gegebenenfalls in deren Unterausschüsse entsenden können und dort die gleichen Rechte haben wie die von den Fraktionen entsandten Mitglieder. Das Gleiche soll für die Mitgliedschaft in Untersuchungsausschüssen und Enquete-Kommissionen gelten. Ebenso sollen beide Gruppen mit jeweils einem Mitglied im Ältestenrat vertreten sein können und dort Stimmrecht bei Beschlüssen über innere Angelegenheiten des Deutschen Bundestages besitzen. Darüber hinaus dürfen die Gruppen Gesetzentwürfe, Anträge sowie Entschließungsanträge einbringen und pro Kalendermonat bis zu insgesamt zehn Große oder Kleine Anfragen stellen. Sie können verlangen, dass ihre Vorlagen auf die Tagesordnung gesetzt werden und dass gegebenenfalls Zwischenberichte zu ihren Vorlagen erstattet werden. Auch dürfen sie der Ausschussüberweisung ihrer Entschließungsanträge widersprechen. Geschäftsordnungsanträge sollen gestellt werden können, wenn sie von mindestens 37 Abgeordneten unterstützt werden. Die Redezeit der Gruppen soll sich an ihrer jeweiligen Stärke im Verhältnis zu den Fraktionen und nach näherer Vereinbarung im Ältestenrat orientieren. Die Vorsitzenden der Gruppen sollen die gleichen Rechte haben wie Fraktionsvorsitzende. Für ihre parlamentarische Arbeit sollen die Gruppen Geld- und Sachleistungen aus dem Bundeshaushalt erhalten, und zwar die Hälfte des den Fraktionen nach dem Abgeordnetengesetz zustehenden Grundbetrags einschließlich des Oppositionszuschlags. In vorherigen Legislaturperioden konnten Gruppen keine namentlichen Abstimmungen verlangen oder beantragen und ein Regierungsmitglied herbeirufen.",

The clinic where the incident took place, Luisenhospital, is located in Aachen, a city which borders Belgium with around 252,000 residents. Speaking about the incident, a police statement claimed a 65-year-old woman \"barricaded herself\" inside one of the rooms at the clinic. Aachen Police said in a statement: \"According to current information, a female (65) entered the hospital in the afternoon. Shortly afterwards, employees noticed smoke developing near the woman. The 65-year-old has now barricaded herself in a room. The surrounding rooms have been evacuated. Special forces are on site.\" The area around the hospital was cordoned off by police officers, who asked people to avoid the area while the incident was ongoing. At around 10am GMT (11pm local time), several hours after emergency services were called to the scene, police managed to take the woman outside the clinic, local media including Stern.de and Bild and the German news agency DPA reported.

Laut Polizei wurden Beamte verletzt. Die Grünen haben ihre Veranstaltung zum Politischen Aschermittwoch im baden-württembergischen Biberach abgesagt. Als Grund nannte der Vorsitzende des Kreisverbands Biberach, Michael Gross, aggressive Stimmungen bei Demonstrationen im Umfeld. Ein Sprecher der zuständigen Polizei in Ulm bestätigte, dass es von Teilen der Demonstranten zu \"aggressiven Protestaktionen\" gekommen sei. Polizisten und Polizeifahrzeuge seien mit Gegenständen beworfen worden. Dabei seien drei Polizisten leicht verletzt und ein Polizeiwagen beschädigt worden. Wie der Polizeisprecher sagte, setzten die Polizisten Pfefferspray und Schlagstöcke ein. Ein Tatverdächtiger wurde demnach festgenommen. Politischer Aschermittwoch: Aufgeheizte Stimmung durch Bauernproteste Johannes Reichart, BR, tagesthemen, 14.02.2024 22:15 Uhr Stadthalle nicht zu erreichen Protestierende hatten die Straße zuvor mit Pflastersteinen und Sandsäcken blockiert. Der Vorstand des Kreisbauernverbandes, Karl Endriß, sagte, an die Stadthalle sei kein Herankommen, da überall drumherum Demonstrierende stünden. Im Vorfeld der Veranstaltung hatte es massive Proteste und Blockaden unter anderem von Landwirten gegeben. Der Landesbauernverband in Baden-Württemberg hat nach eigener Auskunft nicht zu den Protesten aufgerufen oder diese im Vorfeld unterstützt. Dutzende Traktoren auf Zufahrtsstraßen Seit dem Morgen hatten Bauern in Biberach protestiert und Straßen blockiert. Auf den Zufahrtsstraßen zur Stadthalle standen Dutzende Traktoren. Vor der Halle wurde ein großer Misthaufen abgeladen. Zu hören waren lautes Gehupe und Musik. Zu den Protesten hatten laut Endriß verschiedene Gruppierungen aufgerufen. Unter den Demonstrierenden seien hauptsächlich Bauern, aber auch Fuhrunternehmer seien beteiligt. Die Bühne in Biberach bleibt leer: Die Grünen mussten ihre Veranstaltung absagen, weil der Protest vor der Halle zu groß war. Özdemir: \"Das waren Einzelne\" Bundesagrarminister Cem Özdemir kritisierte die Vorgänge in Biberach, nahm das Gros der Bauern aber ausdrücklich in Schutz: \"Die, die da jetzt über die Stränge geschlagen haben, das ist nicht die deutsche Landwirtschaft. Das waren Einzelne, die sich da so benommen haben\", sagte der Grünen-Politiker. Die Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten hätten der Landwirtschaft und den Anliegen der Landwirtschaft so keinen Gefallen getan. Özdemir hatte sich bei einer nahegelegenen angemeldeten Demonstration den Landwirtinnen und Landwirten gestellt und mit ihnen über ihre Anliegen diskutiert. Dort habe er den Umgang als sehr fair und anständig wahrgenommen. Die Ampel ist seit Wochen das Ziel scharfer Kritik von Bauernverbänden. Entzündet hatte diese sich an den Beschlüssen der Bundesregierung, im Zuge von Sparmaßnahmen Steuervorteile für Bauern abzuschaffen. Özdemir selbst hatte Teile dieser Beschlüsse kritisiert. reportage 15.01.2024 Bauernprotest in Berlin Sie wollen mehr Bei der Großdemo der Bauern in Berlin wird klar: Die Proteste werden weitergehen. mehr Faeser verurteilt \"Gepöbel und Gewalt\" Auch Bundesinnenministerin Nancy Faeser (SPD) kritisierte die Tumulte in Biberach. \"Wenn eine politische Veranstaltung wegen Gepöbel und Gewalt abgesagt werden muss, dann ist eine rote Linie überschritten\", sagte die Ministerin. Legitimer Protest ende dann, wenn Menschen eingeschüchtert und bedroht würden. Die Gewalt gegen Einsatzkräfte der Polizei müsse deutliche strafrechtliche Konsequenzen für die Täter haben, sagte Faeser. Sie warnte davor, das Geschehen zu verharmlosen und forderte: \"Die zunehmende Vergiftung von Debatten und die Hetze gegenüber demokratisch gewählten Politikerinnen und Politikern muss ein Ende haben.\" Dazu gehöre zuerst, \"verbal abzurüsten\", denn politische Aggression komme nicht aus dem Nichts, sondern fange mit der Sprache an. Grüne treffen sich seit Jahren in Biberach Die Grünen treffen sich seit Jahren in Biberach, wo in diesem Jahr wieder viel Bundesprominenz erwartet wurde. Neben Özdemir, der als aussichtsreicher Kandidat für die Nachfolge von Ministerpräsident Winfried Kretschmann gilt, sollten die Bundesvorsitzende Ricarda Lang und Grünen-Urgestein Jürgen Trittin ans Rednerpult treten. Auch Kretschmann sollte dabei sein. Der Vorfall in Biberach reiht sich ein in mehrere massiv kritisierten Aktionen. Zuletzt hatten Bauern durch Blockaden die Auslieferungen von Zeitungen verhindert . Am Donnerstag vergangener Woche hatten diese etwa mit Traktoren in Bremerhaven aus \"Unzufriedenheit der Teilnehmenden mit der Berichterstattung über die zurückliegenden Protestaktionen\" eine Druckerei blockiert. Protestierende einer Blockade in Hamburg rechnete die Polizei laut Hamburger Abendblatt der \"Querdenker\"-Szene zu.

        "text": "A participant holds a lit joint during the annual Hemp Parade on August 12, 2023 in Berlin, Germany. Omer Messinger/Getty Images Berlin CNN — Germany’s lower house of parliament voted to legalize cannabis for limited recreational use on Friday despite warnings from the opposition and medical authorities. The new rules mean adults can possess small amounts for personal use but the drug remains banned for under 18s. In total, 407 German lawmakers voted in favor of the new regulation, 226 lawmakers voted against and four lawmakers abstained from Friday’s vote. The passage of the bill follows a controversial national debate about the pros and cons of allowing easier access to the drug. The move makes Germany the third country in Europe – after Malta and Luxembourg – to legalize the drug for recreational use, removing cannabis from the official list of banned substances. The Netherlands bans possession of drugs but some municipalities permit them to be sold in coffee shops under its so-called policy of toleration. In other countries, like Australia and the US, rules vary in different localities. Under the new legislation, put forward by Germany’s ruling coalition party, adults can cultivate up to three plants for private consumption and be allowed to possess 50g at one time at home, and 25g in public, starting from April 1. From July 1, cannabis would also be available in licensed not-for-profit clubs with no more than 500 members – all of whom would have to be adults. Only club members would be allowed to consume their output. “The aim is to crack down on the black market and drugs-related crime, reduce the amount of dealing and cut the number of users,” Germany’s Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said ahead of the vote. The German government said that cannabis would remain illegal for minors and highly restricted for young adults, adding that consuming the drug near schools and playgrounds would be illegal. ”Child and youth protection is at the heart of what this law is meant to achieve,” Lauterbach said. “Nobody should misunderstand this law: cannabis consumption is being legalized, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous,” Germany’s health minister said. Germany’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the country’s largest opposition party, has opposed the new legislation. CDU Lawmaker Tino Sorge said in a statement published Thursday, “Instead of protecting children and young people, the coalition is acting like a state drug dealer.” There has also been considerable criticism of the plans from the German Medical Associations (GMA). “The legalization of cannabis leads to more consumption and trivializes the associated risks. Cannabis can be addictive and cause serious developmental damage. This country does not need cannabis legalization,” President of the GMA Klaus Reinhardt said Friday before the vote.",

Days after he was deported from Switzerland, Martin Sellner, a leader of Austria’s ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement, posted a video of himself on X reading out a letter to his lawyer that he said was from authorities in the city of Potsdam. The letter said Sellner was barred “with immediate effect” from entering Germany for the next three years and could be stopped or deported if he tried to enter the country. If he happened to be on German soil, it added, he would have to leave within a month. Ursula von der Leyen vows never to work with Europe’s far-right parties Read more A spokesperson for the city authorities confirmed to Agence France-Presse that an EU citizen had been served with a “ban on their freedom of movement in Germany” but declined to name them for privacy reasons. “We have to show that the state is not powerless and will use its legitimate means,” Mike Schubert, the mayor of Potsdam, said in a statement. Germany has seen a wave of huge demonstrations against extremism and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, some of whose members attended the November meeting in Potsdam, since reports of it emerged in January. Sellner gave a presentation at the event, attended by neo-Nazis, other extremists and business backers, on the practicalities of carrying out the mass deportations – referred to in far-right circles as “remigration” – of migrants, asylum seekers and German citizens of foreign origin deemed to have failed to integrate. Swiss police said on Sunday they had prevented a far-right gathering organised by the far-right, anti-Islam and anti-immigration group Junge Tat at which Sellner was due to speak, adding that he had been arrested and deported. Sellner, who received donations from and communicated with the Christchurch terrorist Brenton Tarrant before the two mass shootings at mosques in 2019 that left 51 people dead, recently had his account on X restored . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Michael Probst/AP Berlin CNN — Huge crowds of protesters have descended on cities in Germany as calls for a ban on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) gain momentum. Tens of thousands had already braved sub-zero temperatures during the week to protest against the party after it emerged senior AfD members discussed a plan to deport migrants en masse in revelations that have been compared to the Nazi era. Public anger continued throughout weekend. Crowds of up to 35,000 gathered in Frankfurt on Saturday under the banner “Defend democracy – Frankfurt against the AfD,” while a similar number of people turned out in the northern city of Hanover, the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported. Significant crowds were also seen in Stuttgard, Dortmund and Nuremberg. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people again took to the streets, with rallies in Berlin, Munich and Cologne, as well as in the cities of Leipzig and Dresden, which are considered more traditional AfD voting strongholds, according to Reuters. Nearly 100,000 people attended the rally in Munich at its peak on Sunday, local police said. Nearly 30,000 people gathered at the beginning of the Berlin protest, with more people arriving as the event continued, according to Reuters. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has welcomed the protests as “good and right.” In a video message issued Friday night, Scholz said that he tries to imagine “how the more than 20 million citizens who have a history of migration feel” about the deportation plan. A ‘master plan’ for deportation Many Germans are outraged by reports that senior members of the AfD discussed a ”master plan” for the mass deportation of German asylum-seekers and German citizens of foreign origin during a meeting late last year. The gathering of AfD members, neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists took place at a lakeside hotel outside the city of Potsdam on November 25. It did not come to light until January 10, when the meeting was revealed by the investigative journalism network Correctiv, sparking a wave of protests across Germany. In its report uncovering the private meeting, Correctiv wrote: “The events that will occur today at the hotel Landhaus Adlon will seem like a dystopian drama. Only they’re real. “And they will show what can happen when the frontmen of right-wing extremist ideas, representatives of the AfD and wealthy sympathisers come together.” “The meeting was meant to remain secret at all costs,” the report said. The AfD denies that such plans are part of its policy and the AfD leadership has sought to distance itself from the gathering, calling it a “private event and not an AfD party event.” People hold a banner that reads: \"Never again is now! You have to do anti-fascism yourself,\" in Erfurt on Saturday. Jacob Schroeter/dpa/AP People protest in Frankfurt on Saturday, holding a banner reading \"Never again 1933!\" Michael Probst/AP Alice Weidel, the co-chair of the party, announced Monday that she was parting ways with her adviser Roland Hartwig – who, according to Correctiv, participated in the talks. The AfD told CNN that the two “separated with mutual agreement.” However, the idea of a “mass deportation plan” was openly supported by one AfD representative in the state of Brandenberg. René Springer took to his account on X to write: “We will return foreigners to their homeland. Millions of times. This is not a secret plan. It’s a promise. “For more security. For more justice. To preserve our identity. For Germany.” Many have pointed out that the mass deportation plan is evocative of the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945, when millions were transported against their will to concentration, forced labor and extermination camps. “The plans to expel millions of people are reminiscent of the darkest chapter in German history,” Christian Dürr, parliamentary group leader of the neoliberal Free Democrats Party (FDP), wrote on X. Rika von Gierke, a spokesperson and activist preparing for a demonstration in Frankfurt on Saturday, told CNN that the AfD’s plans “bring back terrible memories.” “I saw a banner yesterday which said, ‘Now is the time to show what we would have done instead of our grandparents.’ “There are parallels. It’s definitely time to take a stand against the right and start opposing the anti-democratic forces.” She added that members of the AfD had been “making concrete plans to deport millions of people from Germany. We clearly see that these plans are inhumane and an attack on our democracy and the rule of law and on many of our fellow citizens.” Kazin Abaci, a protest organizer from Hamburg, told CNN that the demonstrations are important “because we are dealing with a very strong right-wing extremism and neo-Nazi networks in Germany.” He continued: “This meeting in Potsdam has shown once again how urgent it is that not only politicians speak out, but that a strong signal is sent from the middle of society to defend democracy and our state.” Chancellor Scholz and Foreign Minister Baerbock are pictured at the \"Potsdam defends itself\" demonstrations. Sebastian Christoph Gollnow/picture alliance/dpa/Getty Images Asked whether he thought the protests would encourage people to stop voting for the AfD, Abaci was hopeful. “There is a core group of AfD voters who vote for this party out of conviction, but there are of course also voters who have voted for AfD out of protest. “But now is the time for them to wake up and realize that we are not dealing with a protest party, but with a right-wing extremist party. Our rally could help these people to finally wake up.” Rallies in Potsdam Sunday were attended by Scholz, the chancellor, as well as Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Baerbock said she was there as someone who “stands for democracy and against old and new fascism,” while Scholz this week thanked the demonstrators for taking to the streets “against racism, hate speech and in favour of our liberal democracy.” Paving a way to outlaw the AfD could prove difficult and risks backfiring.  German politicians this week discussed the possibility of calling on the constitutional court to implement a ban. The German constitution says that parties that seek to undermine the “free democratic basic order” should be deemed unconstitutional. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck told the magazine Stern that “the damage that a failed attempt would cause would be massive.” “Which is why if a case is put, it would have to absolutely 100% stand up in court. It’s something you have to consider very carefully,” he adds. Many see public displays of backlash against the AfD as crucial, as the far-right party has recently enjoyed record-high polling and is expected to make major gains in regional elections in the eastern states of Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg this year. According to a recent survey published by opinion research institute Forsa, the AfD is currently polling above 30% in all three states – comfortably higher than its rivals.

De bus raakte in de buurt van de stad Leipzig van de weg en kwam op z'n kant in de berm terecht. Volgens de Duitse omroep MDR was de bus onderweg van Berlijn naar Zürich, toen hij om 09.45 uur vlak bij een verkeersplein van de weg raakte. Waardoor dat gebeurde is onbekend. Uit politieonderzoek is inmiddels wel duidelijk geworden dat er geen andere voertuigen bij het ongeluk betrokken waren. De politie en de hulpdiensten rukten massaal uit. De ziekenhuizen in Leipzig hebben allemaal ruimte vrijgemaakt om de gewonden te kunnen behandelen. In de dubbeldekker zaten 53 reizigers en twee chauffeurs, laat Flixbus weten.

REUTERS/Matthias Rietschel/ File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary German MEP injured while putting up campaign posters Scholz, EU leaders join chorus of condemnation Number of attacks on politicians in Germany rising BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Union leaders denounced on Saturday a recent spate of attacks on politicians in Germany, including one that sent a member of the European Parliament to hospital with serious injuries. Matthias Ecke, 41, a member of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was hit and kicked on Friday by a group of four people while putting up posters in Dresden, capital of the eastern state of Saxony, police said. An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation. Sign up here. Shortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as severe. \"Democracy is threatened by this kind of thing,\" Scholz told a convention of European socialists in Berlin. The attacks exemplify increased violence in Germany in recent years, often from the far-right, targeting especially leftist politicians. The BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer, a conservative, said such aggression and attempts at intimidation recalled the darkest era of German history, a reference to Nazi rule. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German conservative minister, and the Italian head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, both condemned the attack on Ecke. \"The culprits must be brought to account,\" von der Leyen said on X. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser vowed \"tough action and further protective measures\" in response to the attacks. FAR-RIGHT SUPPORT The heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement in which they blamed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) for the rise in violence. \"These people and their supporters bear responsibility for what is happening in this country,\" they said. The AfD did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment. The AfD has seen a surge in support in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide. It is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September. Nationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January. Greens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420. Theresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere. The Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.

Authorities have searched the homes and workplaces of the two suspects who stand accused of working for a foreign secret service. One of them, identified as Dieter S., had since October 2023 discussed possible plots with a person linked to the Russian secret service, prosecutors said on Thursday. Sign up here. Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest suppliers of military aid since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and is a major target for Russian spying operations, authorities have said. \"We can never accept that such espionage activities take place in Germany,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told a news conference following an informal EU summit in Brussels. \"So we also have our own defense mechanisms to uncover them, as we always do,\" he added. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said suspicions that Putin was \"recruiting agents from us to carry out attacks on German soil is extremely serious. We will not allow Putin to bring his terror to Germany\". Germany summoned the Russian ambassador over the arrests. The Russian embassy in Germany referred to the incident as a \"provocation\" and said that Berlin had provided no evidence of the detainees' links to Russia. \"We reject attempts to find the involvement of Russian special services in the development of alleged plans to attack military facilities located in Germany, including American military bases, as absurd and ridiculous,\" the embassy said on its Facebook page. loading The Kremlin had earlier said it had no information about the issue. ATTACKS ON MILITARY FACILITIES Dieter S. had been prepared to carry out bomb and arson attacks on military facilities, including those operated by U.S. forces, prosecutors said, adding that he took photos and videos of military transport and equipment. A second person, Alexander J., began helping him from March at the latest, prosecutors said. According to Spiegel magazine, the facilities included the Grafenwoehr army base in the southern state of Bavaria, where Ukrainian soldiers receive training to use U.S. Abrams tanks . U.S., allied and partner training missions at Grafenwoehr, including the training of Ukrainians, continue, a U.S. military spokesperson said, but referred inquiries about the arrests to the German authorities. The prosecutors suspect Dieter S., whose last name has not been disclosed due to German privacy laws, was a fighter for Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine from December 2014 to September 2016 in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. He was in possession of a firearm, prosecutors said. In a separate case, prosecutors last month charged an officer in Germany's military procurement agency with attempting to pass secret information to Russian intelligence. News of Thursday's arrests coincided with a surprise trip by German Economy Minister Robert Habeck to Ukraine. Germany also issued an urgent appeal this week for countries to help shore up Ukraine's air defences as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. \"We will continue to provide massive support to Ukraine and will not allow ourselves to be intimidated,\" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said.

The law is supported by the government and had already passed in the Bundestag , but it could have been derailed by Bundesrat, which is made up of delegates from Germany's 16 state governments. Some representatives in the chamber argued about negative consequences of the law, and a motion on Friday to send the law to a mediation committee threatened to delay the enforcement of the law. However, the motion did not receive enough votes, clearing the way for cannabis to become legal on April 1. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach advocated for the policy again on Friday, arguing that previous drug policy had failed and led to a black market. What does the new law allow? Adults aged 18 and over will be allowed to carry up to 25 grams of cannabis for their own consumption. Public consumption will be allowed, so long as it is not within sight of children or near sports facilities. It will also be prohibited in pedestrian zones between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. Adults will also be allowed store up to 50 grams of the drug at home, as well as keep three plants for home cultivation. Special cannabis clubs will be allowed to grow and purchase the drug on a limited basis from July 1. The clubs can have up to 500 members.

The judges at the court in Münster said the designation was appropriate and did not violate the constitution or European law. \"The court finds there is sufficient evidence that the AfD pursues goals that run against the human dignity of certain groups and against democracy,\" they wrote. \"There are grounds to suspect at least part of the party wants to accord second-rank status to German citizens with a migration background.\" The party criticized the decision, claiming that the proceedings lacked \"sufficient clarification of the facts.\" It said it would \"of course\" lodge another appeal. Germany's AfD classified as potential threat to democracy To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video What does the decision mean? The status makes it easier for the domestic intelligence agency BfV to investigate and surveil AfD members or recruit informants from within the organization. DW correspondent Simon Young, reporting from Münster, said the court likened the status to a \"smoke alarm\" to mean that if an alarm went off in a house, police would break down the door to see if there was a fire. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser , a Social Democrat , welcomed the decision. \"Today's ruling shows that we are a defensive democracy,\" she said. The AfD unsuccessfully challenged the designation at a lower court in the western city of Cologne in 2022. It can still appeal the decision on a federal level. How popular is the AfD in Germany? The AfD is topping opinion polls in several eastern states, such as Saxony, that are due to hold elections later this year. It is also polling nationally at around 20% amid high dissatisfaction with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's left-leaning ruling coalition. However, the party is less popular in some major cities and western parts of Germany. The party has increasingly come under scrutiny from government agencies amid allegations linking it to espionage on behalf of Russia and China . \"It remains to be seen if this decision by the court puts any dent in that [popularity] or possibly, as some suggest, it might even embolden some supporters of the far-right AfD,\" DW's Young said.

Franziska Giffey, the city’s top economic official, a former mayor and an ex-federal minister, was attacked at an event in a Berlin library on Tuesday by a man who approached her from behind and hit her with a bag containing a hard device, police said. Giffey was taken to a hospital and treated for head and neck pain, police said. A 74-year-old man was detained and police searched his home, police said. They said the suspect was known to police, but did not give any indication for a motive. Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner strongly condemned the attack. “Anyone who attacks politicians is attacking our democracy,” said Wegner, according to German news agency dpa. “We will not tolerate this. We will oppose all forms of violence, hatred and agitation and protect our democracy.” Giffey wrote on Instagram that “we live in a free and democratic country in which everyone is free to express their opinion ... and yet there is a clear limit. And that is violence against people who hold a different opinion, for whatever reason, in whatever form.” RELATED COVERAGE Police in central Germany hunt for a suspect on the run after 2 people were shot dead A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor “They are a transgression of boundaries that we as a society must resolutely oppose,” she said. Later on Wednesday, Giffey, protected by several bodyguards, told reporters at a public event in Berlin that she was feeling fine but that “we also have to make it possible for us to live in a country where those who bear social and political responsibility can move freely.” Last week, a candidate from the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz was beaten up in the eastern city of Dresden while campaigning for next month’s election for the European Parliament and had to undergo surgery. Police detained four suspects, aged between 17 and 18, and said that the same group had apparently attacked a Greens party worker minutes before they attacked Matthias Ecke. At least one of the teens is said to be linked to far-right groups, security officials said. Also on Tuesday, a 47-year-old Green Party politician was attacked by two people while putting up election posters in Dresden, dpa reported. The incidents have raised political tensions in Germany. Both government and opposition parties say their members and supporters have faced a wave of physical and verbal attacks in recent months, and have called on police to step up protection for politicians and election rallies. In February, the German Parliament said in a report there were a total of 2,790 attacks on elected representatives in 2023. Representatives of The Greens were disproportionally affected in 1,219 cases, those from the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, in 478 cases and representatives of the SPD in 420 cases. The country’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, who is a member of The Greens, was prevented from disembarking a ferry for hours by a group of angry farmers in January, and the vice president of the German Parliament, Katrin Goering-Eckardt, also from The Greens, was prevented from leaving an event in the state of Brandenburg last week when an angry crowd blocked her car. Germany’s federal interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said after a special meeting of the country’s 16 state interior ministers on the issue of violence on Tuesday that possible measures included tightening Germany’s criminal law in order to “punish anti-democratic acts more severely,” Many of the incidents have taken place in the former communist east of the country, where Scholz’s government is deeply unpopular. The Interior Ministry in the state of Saxony said it had registered 112 election-related crimes so far this year, including 30 against elected officials or representatives. Mainstream parties have accused AfD of links to violent neo-Nazi groups and of fomenting an intimidating political climate . One of its leaders, Bjoern Hoecke, is currently on trial for using a banned Nazi slogan. Alternative for Germany, which campaigns against immigration and European integration, is expected to make gains in the European polls as well as in elections in Saxony and two other eastern German states in the fall.

A court has convicted one of the best known figures in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of using a Nazi slogan in a speech and ordered him to pay a fine. Judges fined Bjorn Hocke 13,000 euros ($14,000) on Tuesday for using the phrase “Alles fur Deutschland” (“Everything for Germany”) during a 2021 campaign rally. Once a motto of the Sturmabteilung, or SA, paramilitary group, which played a key role in Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, the phrase is illegal in modern-day Germany along with the Nazi salute and other slogans and symbols from that era. Hocke argued that it is an “everyday saying”. He testified at the trial that he is “completely innocent”. The former history teacher described himself as a “law-abiding citizen”. The verdict was delivered months before regional elections in the eastern state of Thuringia, in which Hocke plans to run for governor. The charge can carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison. Prosecutors had sought a six-month suspended sentence while defence lawyers argued for an acquittal. The 52-year-old Hocke is an influential figure on the hard right of the AfD and is considered an “extremist” by German intelligence services. He previously called Berlin’s Holocaust memorial a “monument of shame”. He has led the AfD’s regional branch in Thuringia since 2013, the year the party was founded, and is due to lead its campaign in state elections set for September 1. A party tribunal in 2018 rejected a bid to have him expelled. Prosecutor Benedikt Bernzen said in Tuesday’s closing arguments that Hocke had used Nazi vocabulary “strategically and systematically” in the past. Hocke accused prosecutors of not looking for exonerating circumstances and argued that freedom of opinion is limited in Germany.             Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Germany far-right party: AfD launches campaign for European elections The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has banned Maximilian Krah, its leading candidate in European elections, from further campaign activities after his comments that members of the SS (Schutzstaffel), the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party, were “not all criminals”. A party spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that the AfD ’s federal steering committee had banned the politician from making public appearances before elections for the European Parliament , scheduled for June 6-9. Krah had told Italian newspaper La Repubblica last weekend: “I will never say that everyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal.” Posting on X on Wednesday, Krah said his statements were being “misused as a pretext to harm our party”, declaring that he would refrain from further election campaign appearances and would resign as a member of the party’s steering committee. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Rally , said her party needed to make a “clean break” with the AfD, suggesting it had become too toxic an ally ahead of the elections. “Now it’s no longer time to distance ourselves – it’s time to make a clean break with this movement,” Le Pen told Europe 1 radio. “The AfD goes from provocation to provocation.”    The split comes after the AfD, which had become Germany’s second most popular party before local and European elections this year, has come under intense scrutiny over its policies and allegations that it harbours agents for Russia and China. Krah found himself at the centre of the crisis after one of his aides in the European Parliament was arrested on suspicion of spying for China . Krah and another AfD candidate for the European Union elections, Petr Bystron, have also denied allegations they accepted money to spread pro-Russian positions on a Moscow-financed news website. German prosecutors have launched a preliminary investigation against Krah over reports of suspicious payments received from China and Russia. Last week, a German court ruled that domestic security services could continue to keep the AfD under surveillance as a potentially “extremist” party. Polls suggest that nationalist and eurosceptic parties will win a record number of votes in June. Voters are expected to punish mainstream parties over high inflation, immigration policy, and inadequate housing and healthcare.             Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Erpenbeck is the first German writer to win, while Hofmann is the first male translator to win. The £50,000 prize money will be split equally between the pair. View image in fullscreen Kairos by Jenny Erpenbeck, translated by Michael Hofmann. Photograph: PR Erpenbeck and Hofmann were announced as the winners at a ceremony held at the Tate Modern in London, sponsored by the Italian luxury fashion house Maison Valentino. Kairos tells the story of a relationship set against the collapse of East Germany. The novel is a “richly textured evocation of a tormented love affair, the entanglement of personal and national transformations”, said judging chair and broadcaster Eleanor Wachtel. Hofmann’s translation “captures the eloquence and eccentricities of Erpenbeck’s writing, the rhythm of its run-on sentences, the expanse of her emotional vocabulary”, she added. Erpenbeck said: “Thirty years have passed since the country in which I was born is gone, so I could dare to look back and take my time to carefully research what I lived through without really being aware of it.” “I got this idea to make a collage of this love story and the historic story”, she added. This gave her the opportunity to examine how things “meant to be true and great” and that had “utopian potential” could turn into “totally failed communication.” Hofmann said: “I was really lucky to be asked to do this book … And I thank Jenny for trusting me.” Wachtel said the judging decision was reached with “considerable consensus”, and that the final judging conversation took half an hour. “I was actually surprised at the ultimate unanimity … this was the book that everyone turned to when it came to the crunch.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Her second, The End of Days, won the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2015 , which was the precursor to the International Booker prize. Her third, Go, Went, Gone, was longlisted for the International Booker prize in 2018. Hofmann has also won the Independent foreign fiction prize – in 1995, for his translation of his father Gert Hofmann’s novel, The Film Explainer. He was a judge for the International Booker prize in 2018, the year that Erpenbeck was previously longlisted. “Kairos is one of the bleakest and most beautiful novels I have ever read,” wrote Natasha Walter in her Guardian review of the novel. “The dark nature of [the] relationship finds expression in Erpenbeck’s characteristically unyielding style. The novel is written in the present tense, a technique that can be flattening when used by lesser writers. In an elegant translation by Michael Hofmann, here it creates a claustrophobic intensity.” The other books shortlisted for the prize were Not a River by Selva Almada, translated by Annie McDermott; The Details by Ia Genberg , translated by Kira Josefsson; Mater 2-10 by Hwang Sok-yong , translated by Sora Kim-Russell and Youngjae Josephine Bae; What I’d Rather Not Think About by Jente Posthuma, translated by Sarah Timmer Harvey; and Crooked Plow by Itamar Vieira Junior, translated by Johnny Lorenz. Wachtel was joined on the judging panel by poet Natalie Diaz, novelist Romesh Gunesekera, visual artist William Kentridge, and writer, editor and translator Aaron Robertson.

        "text": "'Slightly crazy' German group on trial for coup plot 21 May 2024 Share Save Jessica Parker Berlin Correspondent Reporting from Frankfurt, Germany Share Save Boris Roessler/Pool via REUTERS Had the coup succeeded, Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss would alleged have been earmarked as \"head of state\" It’s an alleged coup plot featuring a German aristocrat, a “massive arsenal” of weapons and the belief that Queen Elizabeth II’s death might have been a secret “signal” to act. The trial of nine men and women allegedly connected to the so-called Reichsbürger movement got under way on Tuesday with those accused of being ringleaders appearing before judges. Prosecutors say they hatched a conspiracy to violently overthrow the German government and accuse them of being members of a \"terrorist organisation\". Investigators say the plotters had planned to storm the Reichstag and that they were conspiracy theorists who believed the country was being run by a “deep state”. “They’re not terrorists. They’re slightly crazy,\" said defence lawyer Roman von Alvensleben. \"They’ve followed conspiracy theories and they found each other during corona in their resistance against corona measures.” The hearing in Frankfurt on Tuesday is the highest profile of three trials following nationwide raids in 2022. The case is seen as highly significant because of both its size and the potential insights it could give into far-right networks. The Reichsbürger, or citizens of the Reich, is a loose, disparate group that denies the legitimacy of the modern German state – even claiming it was installed by the victorious Allied powers after World War Two. Domestic intelligence has estimated that around 23,000 people follow the movement which displays \"antisemitic attitudes\" and a “high affinity” for weapons. It’s alleged that those on trial followed Reichsbürger narratives and drew up plans for an armed group to enter the national parliament in Berlin and arrest MPs on what was called “Day X”. According to the indictment, there were discussions about whether the death of the late Queen Elizabeth II was a “signal”. Much of the attention has focused on Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, a real estate developer from Frankfurt who is descended from an aristocratic family, the House of Reuss. It’s alleged the 72-year-old held meetings of the group’s \"central council\" at his home in east Germany and was earmarked as the \"head of state\", had the coup succeeded. But his lawyer, Roman von Alvensleben, said that while Prince Reuss had invited people to his castle for political discussions, he was incapable of being behind such a scheme. “He denies he was ever violent. He denies that he ever wanted to kill people or made any plans to do so,\" he said. According to the indictment, he’d have been responsible for negotiating a peace treaty with the Allies – and had appeared at the Russian consulate in Leipzig, as part of attempts to reach out to Moscow. Also standing trial is former judge and MP for the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, Birgit Malsack-Winkemann. Prosecutors say she used her access rights to parliamentary properties to “smuggle” in co-conspirators to scout the area – and was responsible for the justice department on the group’s central council. Their plans to reorganise Germany’s political structures would have involved a take-over of institutions at a state and local level. It is alleged that members were aware that this would “involve killing people”. The \"council\" was to act as the central body while a \"military arm\" – consisting of 286 units – would have enforced the new order nationwide. Prosecutors say the group had access to a “massive arsenal” of weapons including firearms, ammunition as well as night vision devices and handcuffs. The association also had financial resources of around 500,000 euros, according to the indictment. Over time, members are said to have become “increasingly isolated” from the outside world. Jan Rathje, a senior researcher at the extremism monitoring agency CeMAS, says conspiratorial, sovereigntist movements can be dated back to a wish by some former Nazis to re-establish a National Socialist German Reich. He says that the Reichsbürger movement, which has a violent, far-right tradition, has been dangerously underestimated. “People always thought these were crazy people just writing crazy letters to the government,” he adds. Mr Rathje says that even though the alleged coup attempt would likely not have succeeded, people still could have been seriously hurt. “On a symbolic level, this would have been a success for these radical forces because they would have struck against the government in a violent way and this might promote the idea that the government is weak.” The trials – split into three because of the case’s size – are taking place in Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Munich.

The suspects, who are 24 and 18 years old, were detained during separate police operations in the state of Baden-Wuerttember earlier this month, German news agency dpa reported, citing state prosecutors and police. The pair discussed “the killing of one or more visitors in the attack on the synagogue followed by death as martyrs, whereby the two persons wanted to be shot to death by police,” authorities said in a joint statement. The pair could face charges including conspiracy to commit murder. Police uncovered the plot when they searched the home of the older suspect on May 3.

Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party on Wednesday, May 22, 2024, banned Krah for next month’s European election from making any further public campaign appearances and said he would resign from the party’s board immediately. The public demotion came after Krah told an Italian newspaper that not all members of the Nazis’ elite SS unit, which was involved in major war crimes during World War II, were war criminals. (AP Photo/Jean-Francois Badias, File) Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — A German far-right party hoping for big gains in upcoming European elections suffered a another setback on Thursday when it was kicked out of its group in the European Parliament. The Identity and Democracy group said it was expelling lawmakers from the Alternative for Germany party with immediate effect because of growing controversy surrounding its lead candidate in the June 6-9 polls. “The ID Group no longer wants to be associated with the incidents involving Maximilian Krah,” it said in a statement released by Italy’s La Lega, a member of the group. The expulsion of the German party from its European Union umbrella group exposed deep rifts within the far right across the 27-nation bloc little more than two weeks ahead of elections in which they were supposed to surge. It was not immediately clear whether the spat would influence voters. A swing to the right could raise questions about the bloc’s future direction in issues from climate protection and immigration to support for Ukraine. The Alternative for Germany, or AfD, said it remained “optimistic about the election evening and the days to follow.” RELATED COVERAGE Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo announces he will leave club, return to Germany after 2025 season Photos of a German nutcracker maker focused on the US amid Trump’s tariffs “To be politically effective in Brussels, cooperation with aligned parties is essential. We are therefore confident that we will continue to have reliable partners at our side in the new legislative period,” co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said in a statement. They did not indicate who they could team up with ahead of the vote. In an attempt to ward off Thursday’s split, the AfD on Wednesday banned Krah from making campaign appearances after he told an Italian newspaper that not all members of the Nazis’ elite SS unit, which was involved in major war crimes during World War II, were war criminals. The party said his missteps had led to “massive damage” and that he would resign from its board. However, he remains a candidate for the European election. Krah, 47, had already been under scrutiny after authorities in Brussels searched his offices at the European Parliament in connection with one of his assistants who was arrested last month on suspicion of spying for China. German media have alleged that Krah has had personal ties to China and also Russia. AfD had been riding high in opinion polls in Germany last year and also hopes to make big gains in state election in the east of the country in the fall. However, it has become less popular this year after millions of Germans protested against its radical far-right stance and as the negative headlines have mounted. Last month, the No. 2 on AfD’s list for the European Parliament election, Petr Bystron, denied allegations that he may have received money from a pro-Russian network. According to German media reports, the AfD relations with some of its allies in the Identity and Democracy group have been strained for months, particularly with France’s National Rally and its leader Marine Le Pen. Jordan Bardella, National Rally’s top European election candidate, said Wednesday that “I think that the AfD, with whom we have worked together in the European Parliament for five years, has crossed lines that are red lines for me,” German news agency dpa reported.",

The 54-year-old defendant, identified only as Thomas H. in line with German privacy rules, worked for the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support and had the military rank of captain. The Duesseldorf state court convicted him of espionage and violating official secrets. The man acted of his own accord when he provided internal documents to the Russian consulate in Bonn in May 2023 to be forwarded to Russian intelligence, the court found. He also offered his cooperation and further documents from the German military, the Bundeswehr. The court said the defendant, who had no previous convictions, had admitted to most of the case against him, cooperated with the investigation and regretted his actions. It also noted that he had significant health problems at the time. The defendant testified last month that he had been motivated by fear of a nuclear escalation of the war in Ukraine, German news agency dpa reported. He said he had been following a pro-Russian influencer at the time and a social media post prompted him to approach the Russian consulate.

The defendant said he applied for membership in the far-right Alternative for Germany party around the same time but later decided to leave. The verdict follows a pair of recent arrests that underlined concern about Russian espionage in Germany, which is one of Ukraine’s leading weapons suppliers.

Dpa reported that a candidate with the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, reportedly caught somebody trying to tear down an election poster on Tuesday evening. When he confronted that person, he was attacked with a boxcutter. Dpa reported that the candidate was still in a hospital with non-life-threatening cuts. The candidate, who was campaigning for Sunday’s local elections in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Mannheim is located, was not identified. The attacker was detained, dpa reported. The mayor of Mannheim sharply condemned the attack. “This cowardly act is despicable and cannot be justified by anything,” Christian Specht said. “Anyone who attacks election candidates is calling into question our free, equal, universal, direct and secret elections — and therefore the basis of our democracy.” “The hatred and willingness to use violence that is currently taking hold in our society is intolerable,” he added.

On Friday, a 25-year-old Afghan man stabbed several members of a group that describes itself as opposing “political Islam.” The group, Pax Europa, describes itself as an organization that informs the public about the dangers posed by the “increasing spread and influence of political Islam.” Michael Stuerzenberger, an anti-Islamist activist who is one of the group’s leading figures and has spoken at its events, was among those wounded. The attacker was still in the hospital. Tuesday’s attack is the latest in a series on politicians in the country that has raised concern over rising political violence in Germany. Last month, Franziska Giffey, Berlin’s top economic official, a former mayor and an ex-federal minister, was attacked at an event in a local library by a man who approached her from behind and hit her with a bag containing a hard device, police said. A week before that, a candidate from the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz was beaten up in the eastern city of Dresden while campaigning for this week’s election for the European Parliament and had to undergo surgery. Both government and opposition parties say their members and supporters have faced a wave of physical and verbal attacks in recent months, and have called on police to step up protection for politicians and election rallies. In February, the German Parliament said in a report there were a total of 2,790 attacks on elected representatives in 2023. Representatives of The Greens were disproportionally affected in 1,219 cases, those from AfD in 478 cases and representatives of the SPD in 420 cases. The country’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, who is a member of The Greens, was prevented from disembarking a ferry for hours by a group of angry farmers in January, and the vice president of the German Parliament, Katrin Goering-Eckardt, also from The Greens, was prevented from leaving an event in the state of Brandenburg last week when an angry crowd blocked her car.

The measures would have banned EU member states from re-exporting Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) from EU ports and financing planned Arctic and Baltic LNG terminals. German officials reportedly expressed concern about an expanded measure that would force EU companies to guarantee their customers cannot go on to sell sanctioned goods to Russia. This restriction previously only applied to firearms, military equipment, and dual-use goods with both a military and civilian application. Berlin is concerned that the expansion of this measure to non-dual-use civilian products, such as chemicals or metalworking equipment, could harm German small businesses. Belgium was forced to split talks on the new sanctions package into two separate discussions following Germany's opposition to new sanctions against Belarus. Both France and Germany opposed EU sanctions on Belarus , which were introduced to close a trade loophole that has allowed Russia to import luxury cars and other banned goods produced in Western countries. This latest package would have been the 14th round of EU sanctions against Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. An anonymous source told Politico that the European Commission is now working with the German chancellery to convince Berlin to lift the veto.

Tens of thousands of people opposed to the AfD gathered in the city of Essen, local media reported, with police drafted in from around the country in a bid to prevent disorder. Local police said two officers were \"kicked in the head\", seriously injured and taken to hospital during the violence, which began in the early hours of Saturday morning before the official demonstration had started. The AfD's conference comes weeks after it shocked Germany's political establishment by coming second in European elections , winning 16% of all votes and beating the ruling centre-left party. EPA Batons and tear gas were used to control crowds outside the venue Disorder broke out at dawn on Saturday when a group of protesters attempted to reach the Grugahalle music venue where the meeting was due to be held. Delegates were seen being ushered towards the venue by riot police after some protesters attempted to prevent the conference from beginning by blocking the road. Police in Essen said two of its riot officers were seriously injured. \"The officers were kicked while they were still lying on the ground,\" the force said. \"[They] had to be taken to hospital. [We] are currently evaluating video recordings to identify the perpetrators.\" The force said a further seven officers suffered minor injuries. Police said they had used batons and tear gas to control crowds and had made \"several\" arrests as of midday. As many as 100,000 people were expected to take part in the demonstrations over the weekend, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported. Reuters It was the first annual meeting since AfD secured 15 seats in the European Parliament The two-day AfD event was set to involve around 600 delegates and began as planned at mid-morning on Saturday. The party's co-president Alice Weidel opened the meeting by telling delegates: \"We are here and we will stay.\" She was re-elected as co-leader alongside Tino Chrupalla. Counter-demonstrators marched through Essen on Friday, the eve of the conference, and more demonstrations are expected on Sunday. Authorities in Essen had attempted to block the AfD from meeting in the city but a court ruled the party should be allowed to. Reuters Over the weekend, as many as 100,000 people are expected to take part in the demonstrations The AfD, which primarily draws its support from regions in eastern Germany, came fourth in the European Union parliamentary elections in North-Rhine Westphalia, the state where Essen is located. However, it performed ahead of expectations nationally despite a scandal-hit campaign, which included its lead candidate downplaying the crimes of the Nazis during World War Two. AfD candidates secured 15 of Germany's 96 seats in the parliament, coming second only to the country's largest opposition party, the centre-right CDU/CSU.

Das teilte die Pressestelle der neonazistischen Partei am Montagabend mit. Die Meldung ist garniert mit einem Bild von einem Handschlag, eine Hand blau, für die AfD, und eine gelb, für »Die Heimat«. Demnach wird es in der Stadtverordnetenversammlung Lauchhammer künftig die gemeinsame Fraktion »AfDplus« geben, im Kreistag die Fraktion »Heimat & Zukunft«. Aus der rechtsextremistischen AfD Brandenburg war auf Anfrage zunächst niemand zu erreichen. Es wäre die erste offizielle Koalition der beiden Parteien. Die »Heimat« steht auf der Unvereinbarkeitsliste der AfD, also jener Liste, wonach Menschen nicht Mitglied der AfD werden können, wenn sie in einer der genannten Organisationen sind. Und womit die AfD eigentlich beweisen wollte, dass sie mit Rechtsextremisten keine gemeinsame Sache macht. Allerdings gab es immer wieder Vernetzungen personeller Art, über die auch der SPIEGEL berichtete . Und die NPD hatte 2016 ihre Wählerinnen und Wähler gebeten, die Erststimmen doch an die AfD zu geben. Neonazi darf Fraktion mit AfD anführen In beiden Fällen geht es um Thomas Gürtler von der »Heimat«, der in beide Gremien gewählt worden war und laut seiner Partei nun gemeinsam mit der AfD als Fraktion auftreten darf. In der Stadtverordnetenversammlung wird die »AfDplus«-Fraktion damit zweitstärkste Kraft, feiert die »Heimat« den Schritt in ihrer Mitteilung. Gürtler sagt, dass es sich um einen »Meilenstein nicht nur für unsere Region« handele. Anhören Extern anhören Im Kreistag soll Neonazi Gürtler die Fraktion »Heimat & Zukunft« sogar anführen dürfen.

        "text": "Politics Germany Germany's new law backs deportations for terrorism praise 06/26/2024 June 26, 2024 Germany's government has agreed on a draft law to deport those promoting 'terrorist crimes,' including social media likes. The legislation aims to counter Islamist and anti-Semitic hate crimes. https://p.dw.com/p/4hX8N Critics have likened the measures to tactics employed by authoritarian regimes Image: Daniel Kubirski/picture alliance Advertisement German government ministers on Wednesday agreed on draft legislation to simplify the deportation process for individuals who express support for terrorism, Germany's Interior Ministry said. The move comes in reaction to online hate posts that celebrated the Hamas attack on Israel and other terrorist incidents. What is the proposed deportation change? The draft law would allow deportation if someone is considered to have approved of a single terrorist offense. No criminal conviction would be necessary for an individual to be deported. Expressions of approval could include not only posting of hateful content on social media but also marking a hate post with a \"like\" or other positive reaction on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. Chancellor Olaf Scholz had announced plans to change the law, allowing deportations to countries such as Afghanistan and Syria, after a deadly knife attack on an anti-Islam rally in Mannheim, in which a policeman died . Promoting and praising terrorism was a \"slap in the face for the victims, their families and our democratic order\", he said. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser put forward the changes, arguing that Berlin was \"taking tough action against Islamist and anti-Semitic hate crime online.\" \"It is very clear to us that Islamist agitators who are mentally living in the Stone Age have no place in our country,\" Faeser told the Funke media group before Wednesday's cabinet meeting. \"Anyone who does not have a German passport and glorifies terrorist acts here must — wherever possible — be expelled.\" Concern about freedom of speech The draft law, which still needs to be passed by parliament, says that glorifying acts of terror online fuels a climate of violence, which can encourage extremists and violent criminals. However, critics say the draft excessively clamps down on freedom of speech and said the measures were similar to tactics used by authoritarian regimes. Clara Bünger of the socialist Left Party in parliament said the move was the culmination of a worrying trend. Bünger said that persecution of individuals for a simple \"like\" on social media, in such countries as Turkey and Russia, had understandably been met with condemnation from German politicians. \"However, Germany itself has long been moving in this direction,\" she added. The measure comes amid rising concern about migration and security and a surge in support for the anti-migrant far-right Alternative for Germany party. rc/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement",

Die Person sei nicht trotz Kenntnis der Anordnung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts ausgeliefert worden, sagte die stellvertretende Behördenleiterin Simone Herbeth am Mittwoch im Rechtsausschuss des Berliner Abgeordnetenhauses. \"Die Auslieferung war abgeschlossen, bevor die Entscheidung aus Karlsruhe bei uns eingegangen ist\", so die Leitende Oberstaatsanwältin. Die Behörde habe auch keine Informationen dazu gehabt, dass die Verteidigung eine einstweilige Verfügung gegen die Auslieferung anstrebe, so Herbeth. Zugleich betonte sie, dass das Berliner Kammergericht der Auslieferung erst zugestimmt hätte, nachdem Ungarn bestimmte Garantien gegeben habe. Demnach gibt es die Zusage, dass die Person bei einer Verurteilung ihre Haftstrafe verbüßen kann. Zudem dürften deutsche Diplomaten die Bedingungen der Untersuchungshaft jederzeit kontrollieren. Ein mutmaßliches Mitglied einer linksextremistischen Gruppe ist nach Ungarn ausgeliefert worden. Das Bundesverfassungsgericht wollte die Auslieferung stoppen, doch eine Eilentscheidung kam zu spät. Der Fall wirft Fragen auf. Von Max Bauer, ARD-Rechtsredaktion Maja T., 23, in Jena geboren, sich selbst als non-binär identifizierend, ist in der Nacht zum 28. Juni nach Ungarn ausgeliefert worden. Die Behörden dort werfen Maja T. vor, seit 2017 Mitglied einer kriminellen Vereinigung zu sein, deren Ziel es gewesen sein soll, Sympathisanten der extremen Rechten anzugreifen. Maja T. wurde im Dezember 2023 in Berlin festgenommen und saß in Sachsen in Haft. Die Bundesanwaltschaft ermittelt deswegen ebenfalls gegen Maja T.. Aufgrund des Auslieferungsersuchens aus Ungarn stellte sie ihr Verfahren zurück. Nachdem Ungarn die geforderten Garantien gegeben hat, habe das Kammergericht Berlin am Donnerstagnachmittag der Auslieferung zugestimmt, die die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft beantragt hatte. Diese wurde in Windeseile mit einem Hubschrauber vollzogen. Ab 6:50 Uhr befand sich die Person laut Herbeth \"nicht mehr auf deutschem Hoheitsgebiet\", sondern in Österreich. Damit habe die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft nicht mehr reagieren können auf die Entscheidung der Karlsruher Richter. Am Freitagmorgen haben die Berliner Behörden eine mutmaßlich linksextremistische Person an Ungarn ausgeliefert. Nach verhängter Strafe sollte sie nach Deutschland zurückgebracht werden. Das Bundesverfassungsgericht fordert eine frühere Rückkehr. Diese haben die Auslieferung untersagt - allerdings erst am Freitagvormittag. Kritiker reden von einer \"Nacht und Nebel-Aktion\". Laut Staatsanwältin Herbeth wählte die sächsische Polizei als Transportmittel einen Hubschrauber wegen möglicher Sicherheitsrisiken etwa durch Störungen aus der linken Szene. Für die Fraktionen von Linke und Grünen blieb deren Angaben zufolge unverständlich, warum die Auslieferung mit einer derartigen Eile vollzogen wurde, ohne die Entscheidung des höchsten deutschen Gerichts im Eilverfahren abzuwarten. \"Die Behörden haben hier bewusst Tempo gemacht, um einen erwartbaren Eilbeschluss des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zuvorzukommen\", sagte der rechtspolitische Sprecher der Linken, Sebastian Schlüsselburg am Mittwoch. Die Grünen verwiesen vor allem auf die Gefahren für Maja T. angesichts dessen, dass Ungarn \"ein offen queerfeindlicher Staat\" sei. Die Justizsenatorin Felor Badenberg (CDU) äußerte sich bislang nicht zu dem Vorgang. Schlüsselburg forderte sie auf, Stellung zu beziehen. Er kündigte an, den Fall am Donnerstag in der Sitzung des Abgeordnetenhauses erneut zu thematisieren.

Soll ich? mir machen solche Täter Angst seit wann gibt es ein Grundrecht darauf straffrei Gewalttaten zu begehen? genau so ! doch, wenn sie dort Straftaten begehen schon Danke, besser hätte ich es auch nicht sagen können Ein demokratischer Rechtsstaat ist Ungarn schon lange nicht mehr. \"Erstaunlich eigentlich...\" ist vielmehr dass eine bestimmte Klientel von dem staatlicherseits begangenen Rechtsbruch ablenken will. Bis zur einer Verurteilung in einem rechtsstaatlichen Verfahren gilt nämlich die Unschuldsvermutung. Klar ist hingegen der begangene Rechtsbruch Berliner Behörden. Mir macht es mehr Angst wenn staatliche Behörden, die mit einer unglaublichen Machtfülle ausgestattet sind, schwere Straftaten begehen. Möglicherweise absichtlich. Es ist schon erstaunlich, in einem Zusammenhang wird mit dem Wort deportieren ein großes Szenario gezeichnet und im anderen Zusammenhang wird beschwichtigt.. Sollte ich in meinem ersten Kommentar, Ihrer Ansicht nach,gegen die Netiquette des RBB verstoßen haben, so wenden Sie sich an den RBB. Danke Niemand spricht mehr über die begangenen Gewalttaten. Erstaunlich eigentlich... \"Die Auslieferung einer Straftäterin ist nach Recht und Gesetz abgelaufen.\" Das sieht das höchste deutsche Gericht eben nicht. Man wollte die Auslieferung nicht nur verhindern, es fordert auch die Rückholung von Maja T. \"Allerdings forderte noch am Freitagvormittag das Bundesverfassungsgericht im Eilverfahren, die Auslieferung müsse wieder rückgängig gemacht werden. Die Berliner Generalstaatsanwaltschaft müsse erwirken, dass der deutsche Staatsangehörige zurück in die Bundesrepublik gebracht wird, entschied das Gericht am Freitagvormittag in Karlsruhe.\" Die Berliner Behörden haben demnach ganz klar Rechtsbeugung begangen und die Verantwortlichen müssen zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden. Genau das ist keine Demokratie wenn die Rechte eines Angeklagten mit einer \"Nacht und Nebel Aktion\" unterlaufen werden. Zu einer Demokratie gehören nämlich auch die Wahrung der Rechte, auch für Tatverdächtige. Sie und andere betreiben hier eine unzulässige Vorverurteilung. Zur Güte, schauen Sie bitte erstmal was das lat./franz. Wort \"deportieren\" auf Deutsch bedeutet und ob Meinungen wie beispielsweise auch ihre vom \"Medienstaatsvertrag\" unberührt sind. Genau das ist Demokratie! Wenn jemand Verbrechen begeht, muss er sich vor Gericht dafür verantworten, auch im Ausland. Heulen hilft nichts, nur weil die eigene politische Überzeugung angekratzt wird. Vor Gericht sind alle gleich. Unser Rechtssystem gehört zu den Errungenschaften der Demkratie. Beim \"büßen\" ist es in diesem Fall leider zu erwarten, dass Maja T. keinen fairen Prozess bekommt, vielleicht nicht einmal faire Haftbedingungen. Daher auch das Unverständnis für diese \"Nacht und Nebel-Aktion\"... Was soll diese Empörung. Die Auslieferung einer Straftäterin ist nach Recht und Gesetz abgelaufen. Es gibt zum Glück (noch) keine \"Sonderrechte\" für \"Linke\" und \"Grüne\". Und mir machen Leute Angst, die andere Menschen einfach so verletzen, zusammenschlagen und auch deren Tod in Kauf nehmen. Und auch Leute die sowas relativieren. Wäre die überstellte Person dem rechten Spektrum zuzuordnen, würden diejenigen, die sich jetzt beklagen jubeln. \"Aus der Gefängnisszelle mit einem Hubschrauber\". Was heute alles technisch möglich ist? Und zu Ihrer Rechtsauffassung: Niemand wurde deportiert. Es wurde einem Auslieferungsantrag stattgegeben. Welche Inhalte der RBB so veröffentlicht? Wenn hier Kommentare veröffentlicht werden, deren Inhalte der deutschen Justiz indirekt Rechtsbeugung vorgeworfen wird, wird der Medienstaatsvertrag und das Neutralitätsgebot komplett ignoriert. mir nicht, ist in einem Rechtsstaat so. Wer Straftaten begeht muss in dem Land dafür büßen.      © Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg © rbb Impressum | Datenschutz",

Höcke was convicted for the second time Monday of knowingly using a Nazi slogan at a political event. (Hendrik Schmidt/dpa via AP) Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — A high-profile politician in the far-right Alternative for Germany party was convicted for the second time Monday of knowingly using a Nazi slogan at a political event. Björn Höcke, who plans to run for governor in the eastern state of Thuringia in September, was fined for using the banned Nazi slogan “Everything for Germany.” The Halle Regional Court found the 52-year-old guilty of using signs of unconstitutional and terrorist organizations and sentenced him to a fine of 130 daily rates of 130 euros each — or 16,900 euros ($18,000) — German news agency dpa reported. An appeal against the ruling is possible. The conviction won’t block him from running in the election. The charge of using symbols of an unconstitutional organization can carry a fine or up to three years in prison. Höcke was already fined 13,000 euros in May, also for using symbols of an unconstitutional organization, a verdict that his lawyers are appealing. The earlier case centered on a speech in Merseburg in May 2021 in which Höcke used the phrase “Everything for Germany!” Judges last month agreed with prosecutors’ argument that the former history teacher was aware of its origin as a slogan of the Nazis’ SA stormtroopers.

They alleged that Höcke said “Everything for ...” and encouraged the audience to shout “Germany!” Höcke again insisted that he did nothing wrong, dpa reported. “I am also completely innocent in this case,” he said. “I know I will be convicted. But that doesn’t feel fair to me.” Höcke questioned whether using the phrase of such everyday words constitutes a criminal offense. In his ruling on Monday, Judge Jan Stengel said a video of the speech in Gera showed Höcke’s “mimic approval” — meaning he had wanted people in the audience to complete the banned slogan, dpa reported. Alternative for Germany has built a strong core of support, particularly in the formerly communist east — including Thuringia . The party’s strength in that region helped propel it to a second-place finish in the European Parliament election earlier this month, taking 15.9% of the vote despite recent scandals and setbacks.",

La Roja won all seven games without needing penalties, a record at a European Championship. A 2-1 win over England in the final made them European champions for an unprecedented fourth time. And they did it the hard way, beating every other European nation who have ever won a World Cup - Italy, Germany, France and England, plus beaten 2018 finalists Croatia - on the way to glory in Berlin. In Rodri they had the player of the tournament. In teenage sensation Lamine Yamal they had the young player of the tournament. Dani Olmo shared the Golden Boot. Yamal had the most assists. It is easy to forget they did not come into the tournament as one of the absolute favourites, with England and France the two tipped for glory. Even England boss Gareth Southgate admitted Spain were deserved champions. \"Congratulations to Spain. They deserved a win not only tonight, but across the whole tournament,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It was not the same style of Spain team which dominated football more than a decade ago - winning Euros 2008 and 2012, and the 2010 World Cup. That team was based on passing teams off the park - with geniuses Xavi and Andres Iniesta in midfield - but wingers are crucial to this team. Nico Williams scored the opener and substitute Mikel Oyarzabal netted the late winner - with Yamal setting up Williams' goal. Williams and Yamal, good friends, had their birthdays on Friday and Saturday - turning 22 and 17 respectively. Barcelona's Yamal is the youngest player to ever play at, score at, assist at and win a European Championship. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton, who won one cap for England, said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It is a good thing for football that Spain won the tournament with the brand they have played.\" BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who used to play for Barcelona, said:  \"It is a hard defeat for England to take but in some ways, it is a victory for attacking football.\" Former Spain midfielder Juan Mata, on BBC One, added: \"We played great football, always tried to win the games and I think we deserve to win this tournament, \"We have young players and older players. It is not only a team for the present, but also a team for the future. \"They are playing such a high level now. \"We are so proud of them and really believe they can keep growing and believing and keep winning trophies.\" Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague said: \"Spain surprised me again. \"They said 'we are going at it without fear by being brave and courageous' - that is what has won them the tournament.\" 'Spain a team compared to the individuals of England' This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Spain lift Euro 2024 trophy England boss Southgate was criticised for his perceived negative tactics at times this summer - although dissenting voices quietened as they went deeper into the tournament. They changed formation midway through the Euros and often improved when players like Ollie Watkins and Cole Palmer, who scored big goals, came off the bench. Southgate had the Premier League's player of the year Phil Foden, La Liga's player of the year Jude Bellingham and the Bundesliga's top scorer Harry Kane in his squad. Spain, in contrast, had two centre-backs who will be playing in Saudi Arabia next season and several players from sixth-placed La Liga side Real Sociedad. Marc Cucurella, much-maligned at Chelsea, ended up being the tournament's best left-back. Only one player from each of Real Madrid and Barcelona were in Spain's starting XI. Sutton said: \"Spain played the beautiful game and England didn't. Spain are a team. England are bits and pieces.\" Ex-England defender Micah Richards agreed: \"What's great about this Spain team, they know their roles and how to fit in. With England at times, we're sort of just getting our best players on the pitch. \"This Spanish side just managed to find a way and pick the players who are going to impact in this system.\" Former England defender Matt Upson, who scored against Germany at the 2010 World Cup, said: \"Spanish subs come on and you see more of the same - it is a system. \"We want an English player to come on and change it - that speaks a lot for the two teams.\" De la Fuente deserves much credit This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Ferdinand, Mata & Richards discuss all three goals from Euro 2024 final This is the peak of Luis de la Fuente's career for sure. The 63-year-old has been Spain's senior manager since 2022, having previously managed several of the current first team with the under-19s, U21s and U23s. This is his third European Championship win with his nation - having won with the U19s and U21s, and now the senior team. In that successful U19s team in 2015 were Rodri, who was named the best player of Euro 2024, Mikel Merino, who scored the winner against Germany in the quarter-finals, and first-choice keeper Unai Simon. The hero of the final Oyarzabal, Merino, three-goal Olmo and regular starter Fabian Ruiz all featured in the U21s final in 2019. De la Fuente has never managed in La Liga and was sacked from his last club job, Alaves, after just four months in 2011. \"De la Fuente knew most of these players from the academies and they are growing as a team,\" said Mata. \"He deserves all the credit - him, his assistants and the players.\" Balague added: \"He is a manager who doesn't want the attention and has taken the national football level to a new height. \"Spain have beaten everyone put in front of them - that is not easy to do.\" Related topics Spain UEFA Euro 2024 Football More on this story Euro 2024 highlights Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

Hendrik Schmidt/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Berlin CNN — Germany summoned Turkey’s ambassador in Berlin Thursday in a tit for tat over a controversial gesture made by a Turkish soccer player celebrating a goal at the European Championship , according to the German foreign ministry. A spiraling diplomatic row erupted after Turkish defender Merih Demiral made an alleged ultra-nationalist gesture – also known as a ‘wolf salute,’ which is associated with the Turkish right-wing extremist group “Grey Wolves” – during his team’s win over Austria on Tuesday. “The Turkish ambassador was summoned this morning,” the ministry said in a statement to CNN, a day after Turkey recalled the German ambassador in Ankara. German representatives discussed the incident with the Turkish ambassador in Berlin, the ministry added. UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, announced in a statement on Wednesday that it is investigating Demiral’s “alleged inappropriate behavior” and sparked condemnation from German leaders, but Ankara immediately branded Berlin’s reaction as “xenophobia” and summoned Germany’s ambassador. 02 July 2024, Saxony, Leipzig: Soccer, UEFA Euro 2024, EM, sterreich - Turkey, final round, round of 16, Leipzig Stadium, Merih Demiral from Turkey plays the ball.

Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned Wednesday “the symbols of Turkish right-wing extremists have no place in our stadiums” and said that “using the European football championships as a platform for racism is completely unacceptable.” Faeser added that the “Grey Wolves” group is under surveillance in Germany. CNN’s German affiliate network NTV reported Thursday that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is set to come to Berlin on Saturday for Turkey’s game against the Netherlands. Following Turkey’s 2-1 round of 16 victory against Austria, Demiral posted a picture of himself making the controversial gesture on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Happy is one who calls themselves a Turk,” the defender captioned the post. “I had a certain specific celebration in mind. That’s what I did. It has to do with the Turkish identity because I’m very proud to be a Turk. And I felt that to the fullest after the second goal, so I ended up doing that gesture,” Demiral told reporters after the game. “I’m very happy that I did that.” In a statement on Wednesday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that it is “unacceptable” for UEFA to open a disciplinary investigation against Demiral. “While the ‘grey wolf’ sign is not a banned symbol in Germany, the reactions shown to Mr. Demiral by the German authorities are itself xenophobia,” it said. “We condemn the politically motivated reactions to the use of a historical and cultural symbol in a way that does not target anyone during the celebration of joy at a sports event.” CNN’s Thomas Schlachter and Isil Sariyuce contributed reporting.",

The coalition parties have agreed on a draft budget. (Kay Nietfeld/dpa via AP) By STEPHEN GRAHAM Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — The German government said Friday it has reached agreement on the budget for 2025 and a stimulus package for Europe’s largest economy, easing a monthslong squabble that threatened to upend Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left coalition. Scholz, a Social Democrat, and leaders of the Free Democrats and Greens reached agreement on plans including higher spending on defense and affordable housing after marathon talks that dragged into the early hours of Friday. Scholz said ministers would formally approve the plan at a Cabinet meeting later this month. By balancing security, social cohesion and economic growth, Scholz said the budget was designed to reassure citizens unsettled by the war in Ukraine, the impacts of climate change and irregular migration, and offer an alternative to the “divisive” policies of far-right parties making gains across Europe. “We don’t need ‘either-or’ politics,” Scholz said. “We need support for Ukraine and stable pensions, the modernization of industry and affordable energy, a strong army and good roads and stable bridges.” Scholz replaced long-serving conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel after federal elections in 2011, heading a coalition built around a program of modernization and digitalization in areas including climate protection, infrastructure and research. RELATED COVERAGE NFL draft suits give prospects another way to cash in on their fame, flash their style on red carpet Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo announces he will leave club, return to Germany after 2025 season To help pay for it, the administration sidestepped rules limiting public borrowing by repurposing 60 billion euros ($65 billion) in unspent emergency credits raised for measures to soften the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. But that maneuver was ruled illegal in November 2023 by the Federal Constitutional Court, prompting a government scramble to seek spending cuts in areas from farm subsidies to overseas development aid. The squeeze opened rifts within the Social Democrats and between the financially conservative Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens, with the latter calling for parliament to suspend the so-called “debt brake” and allow more emergency borrowing, including to keep supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. The disagreements had fueled speculation that the already unpopular government could collapse and prompt a snap parliamentary election in which Germany could follow other European countries by swinging toward the political right. Opposition leaders said Friday they were skeptical of the government’s budget arithmetic, especially its ability to fund an expanded defense budget, and forecast that coalition partners would fall out again over the details. Friedrich Merz, Merkel’s successor at the helm of the Christian Democratic Union, dismissed the deal as “a truce for an exhausted coalition. ... When we return in September from the parliamentary break, then the arguments will really get going.” Scholz, however, said the coalition leaders had thrashed out a budget that respected the borrowing limits while still funding priority areas for all three parties. To support economic growth, the government plans to create incentives for investment, including by allowing companies to write down the value of assets more quickly, support for research and development, reduce bureaucracy and promote the development of renewable energy. Scholz also said the government would continue to meet the NATO target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense, even after his defense minister failed to push through a sharper increase. Germany is the second-largest provider of arms to Ukraine behind the United States. “Germany must be an anchor of stability in Europe,” he said. “As a country at the heart of the continent with strategic importance, economic power and political weight, we must not turn away from the world.”",

The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said. The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature. When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US. For more than six months, Russia has been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe, largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism — all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv. But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west. Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German manufacturer of the vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine’s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine in the coming weeks , an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow’s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel. Employees work at a production line as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Defence Minister Boris Pistorius attend the groundbreaking ceremony for a new munitions factory of German defense contractor Rheinmetall on February 12 in Unterluess, Germany. Fabian Bimmer/Pool/Getty Images The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign — one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe. “We’re seeing sabotage, we’re seeing assassination plots, we’re seeing arson. We’re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,” a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. “I believe very much that we’re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.” The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement, “Russia’s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. “The United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,” she said. “We have also been clear that Russia’s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.” The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement, “Russia’s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. “The United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,” she said. “We have also been clear that Russia’s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.” German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN’s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it shows how Russia is “waging a hybrid war of aggression” on European allies. “We have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,” Baerbock said. In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin “will not be intimidated by the Russian threats﻿,” emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at “undermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.” A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment. “The necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,” Hoffman said. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing Russia’s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion among NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc’s 75th anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country. But the campaign — and in particular Russia’s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil — has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all. Russia’s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a shotgun approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland, CNN has reported , a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company. Some analysts have referred to the effort as a “hybrid” campaign, one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia’s sabotage efforts that way. “I fundamentally reject the idea that what we’re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of ‘hybrid’, I think of … defacing monuments,” the senior NATO official said. “Things that meet that traditional definition of ‘below the threshold of armed conflict.’” Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations — lethal action — “I’m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that ‘hybrid’ implies,” the official said. It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy. Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat’s car: US military bases across Europe were placed on a heightened state of alert last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed actors were considering carrying out sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw’s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And French authorities last month detained a Russian-Ukrainian man who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow.

Dariusz Borowicz/Agencja Wyborcza.pl/Reuters “They’re doing it now because they believe that as there are a number of elections happening throughout the west, that this is a prime opportunity to try to undermine public support for Ukraine,” the senior NATO official said. The official also said that Russia sees a window of opportunity before additional weapons and ammunition promised by the west arrive on the battlefield in Ukraine. For Russia, this “is a prime time to target the west in these types of operations to try to undermine support and prevent the flow of weapons there.” CNN’s Zachary Cohen, Nadine Schmidt and Chris Stern contributed to this report.",

Issued on: 03/07/2024 - 14:59 3 min Suspects were arrested in Sweden and Germany over alleged 2012 abuses over Syrian protests, similar to the one shown in this image © - / SHAAM NEWS NETWORK/AFP The arrests, five in Germany and three in Sweden, represent the latest attempt to pursue justice for the victims of abuses committed in Syria's civil war. The suspects detained on Wednesday are accused of taking part in a \"violent crackdown on a peaceful anti-government protest\" in the Al-Yarmouk district in Damascus on July 13, 2012, Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said. It said the four stateless Syrian Palestinians and Syrian national detained in Germany were \"strongly suspected of killing and attempting to kill civilians, qualified as crimes against humanity and war crimes\". It named the Syrian Palestinians as Jihad A., Mahmoud A., Sameer S. and Wael S. and said that they were part of a pro-Assad militia called the \"Free Palestine Movement\" (FPM). The Syrian national, identified as Mazhar J., is believed to have worked for Syrian military intelligence. \"They and other accessories specifically targeted the civilian protesters, shooting at them\", resulting in six deaths and other serious injuries, the prosecutor said. The war between Assad's troops and armed opposition groups, including Islamic State, erupted after the government repressed peaceful pro-democracy protests in 2011. It has killed more than half a million people, forced millions to flee their homes and ravaged Syria's economy as well as its infrastructure. Wednesday's arrests took place as a result of work carried out by an investigation team named \"Caesar\" after a defector who worked as a photographer for Syrian military police. In 2013 he smuggled more than 50,000 photographs out of Syria, many of them documenting the deaths of prisoners in detention centres or military hospitals. 'Severe and repeated' abuse German prosecutors said that those arrested in Sweden also belonged to the FPM and participated in the crimes on July 13, 2012. Ulrika Bentelius Egelrud, the Swedish prosecutor in charge of the investigation, said the suspects were arrested thanks to \"good cooperation with Germany, Eurojust and Europol\". German prosecutors say the four Syrian Palestinians also \"physically abused civilians from Al Yarmouk severely and repeatedly\" between mid-2012 and 2014, including at militia checkpoints on the outskirts of the district, inhabited predominantly by Palestinians. Mahmoud A. is accused of turning over one individual to Syrian military intelligence to be incarcerated and tortured. Prosecutors also say that he threatened a woman at a checkpoint with rape and that he forced her \"to pay with family jewels for the release of her minor son\". Three people arrested at a checkpoint in Yarmouk and turned over to military intelligence by Mahmoud A. and others were allegedly killed as part of \"a scheduled mass execution\" in April 2013. Germany let in hundreds of thousands of Syrians during the 2015-16 refugee influx and has arrested several Syrians since on its soil over crimes committed in their country. It has used the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of certain serious crimes -- regardless of where they took place -- to try Syrians over atrocities committed during the country's civil war. One of the most high profile cases to be brought to trial was that of a former Syrian colonel who was found guilty in January 2022 of crimes against humanity committed in Damascus. In recent years there have also been several investigations in Germany, Austria, Norway, France and Sweden targeting people suspected of crimes in Syria's civil war -- particularly those committed by pro-Assad forces.

It wasn’t immediately clear whether President Alexander Lukashenko’s decision means that the capital punishment will be replaced with life in prison for Rico Krieger, as it’s usually done in Belarus in such cases, or whether he will be released. A Telegram channel that reports Lukashenko’s decisions didn’t offer specifics. The German Foreign Ministry confirmed that the man had been pardoned and said that “this news is a relief.” It did not elaborate. Earlier on Tuesday, Lukashenko called a meeting to discuss the appeal from Krieger, who was convicted and sentenced to capital punishment in June. Krieger’s lawyer Vladimir Gorbach, who took part in the meeting, told the Belarusian state TV that Lukashenko said he would consider Krieger’s request for pardon and announce his decision later. Krieger has been in custody since his arrest in October 2023. Belarusian state media reported that he has been accused of photographing some of the country’s military facilities and of staging an explosion at a railway station on orders from Ukrainian special services. RELATED COVERAGE Belarusian leader calls journalists ‘enemies of our state’ and imprisons dozens of them Lithuanians bid farewell to 4 US soldiers who died during training exercise US and Lithuanian forces struggle to drain swamp to recover 4 soldiers in submerged armored vehicle Belarus is the only country in Europe to carry out capital punishment. Human rights activists noted that the accusations against Krieger came amid relentless political repressions in Belarus. More than 35,000 people have been arrested and thousands were beaten in police custody in a brutal crackdown on protests ignited by Lukashenko’s re-election in an August 2020 presidential vote that the opposition saw as a sham. Pavel Sapelka of Belarus’ Viasna human rights group said that Krieger could have fallen victim to a provocation by Belarus’ top security agency that still goes under its Soviet name KGB, noting that some Belarusians have been convicted and sentenced for their remarks made on messaging chats that were created by KGB officers posing as Ukrainians. Krieger’s sentencing has raised speculation that Belarusian authorities could have acted in sync with Russian spy agencies eager to prepare a possible swap involving Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to hint at an exchange involving Krasikov when he was asked about the possibility of releasing Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Earlier this month, Gershkovich was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in maximum security prison on espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government have dismissed as fabricated. Belarus’ Foreign Ministry has said it was in touch with German officials about Krieger’s fate and has “proposed specific solutions for the existing options for the development of the situation.” Germany’s Foreign Ministry has said that the German government is concerned about the case and has been providing the man with consular support. It hasn’t given further details. — Associated Press writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed. YURAS KARMANAU Karmanau is an Associated Press journalist covering Belarus and the CIS countries.

Interior Minister Nancy Faeser banned Compact magazine and the company that publishes it, Compact-Magazin GmbH, as well as a film production company, Conspect Film. Police raided properties and apartments in four German regions linked to the organizations, their management and shareholders, her ministry said. Faeser described Compact as “a central mouthpiece of the right-wing extremist scene.” She said in a statement that “this magazine agitates in an unspeakable way against Jews, against people with a history of migration and against our parliamentary democracy.” “Our signal is clear: We will not allow who belongs in Germany and who doesn’t to be defined by ethnicity.” Faeser added. Compact is run by far-right figure Jürgen Elsässer and produces the monthly magazine of the same name, which has a circulation of about 40,000, as well as an online video channel, Compact TV. It also runs an online shop selling books, CDs, DVDs and other merchandise.

The southern German town of Wiesbaden, known for spas and hot springs, will now serve as a site of NATO's efforts to support the Ukrainian military. There, NATO has launched a new command centre to plan, coordinate, and arrange the delivery of security assistance for Ukraine. The command centre, located at a former US Army base, will coordinate training and equipment donations to Ukraine and will be organised and led by a three-star general. It’s the centrepiece of the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine plan, which was announced when alliance leaders met for an anniversary summit in Washington last week. The base will comprise approximately 700 personnel from NATO allied nations and select partners. NATO says the command centre in Germany will enhance its support of Ukraine but not make the alliance a party to the conflict. A Ukrainian MP within President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s party, who is also fighting in the military, said the centre is an extremely welcomed sign. “We must certainly meet those people who have produced those munitions and try to train us,\" said Servant of the People party's Sviatoslav Yurash, explaining how NATO training has been invaluable on the frontline. The centre was discussed at last week’s NATO summit in Washington when the alliance also declared that Ukraine was on an irreversible path to membership of the organisation. One foreign policy expert cautioned that although positive, there were potential limits to the extent the alliance would allow Ukraine to enter. “It will hopefully inspire confidence in NATO’s support for Ukraine but at the same time, everyone knows including Ukrainian politicians that US domestic politics will decide Ukraine’s NATO membership,” said Leonard Schuette, senior researcher at Munich Security Conference. Officials have stated that Ukraine could only enter the alliance once the war with Russia on its territory was over. During the summit, the US also announced it would deploy long-range missiles in Germany. When fully developed, these conventional long-range fire units will include SM-6, Tomahawk, and developmental hypersonic weapons, which have significantly longer ranges than current land-based systems in Europe. Green MP Sebastian Schaefer, who sits on the parliamentary defence committee, told Euronews that Germany should focus on re-arming itself. “This is one of the realities of the 21st century. It’s not a very good thing to see, but it’s just necessary. It would be much wiser if we would live together in peace on this planet. But this is currently not the case so we need to prepare,” Schaefer said. Despite this, Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said that the ruling coalition approved less than a fifth of the increase he had requested for its military.   Browse today's tags",

Another dual citizen, a 54-year-old woman who was tried as a co-defendant, was given a suspended sentence of a year and nine months.

Judges found that, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the defendant tried to dodge European Union sanctions by stating in invoices and shipping documents that the components were going to recipients in Hong Kong, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — but all the deliveries went to Russia.

The ruling by the top administrative court of North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany’s most populous, was announced Monday. Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said Tuesday it was “a decision that one can understand, if one assumes that there are now regions in this country that are very dangerous but also other areas where there isn’t necessary a danger to life.” It wasn’t immediately clear what consequences if any the ruling would have for German authorities’ practice in handling claims for protection from Syrians, who so far largely have been deemed to face such a threat. It could still be appealed. The court in the western city of Muenster ruled in the case of a man from Hasaka province in northeastern Syria who arrived in Germany in 2014. German authorities denied him protected status because he had previously been involved in smuggling people from Turkey to Europe, an offense for which he was given a several-year sentence in Austria. But a court obliged them to recognize him as a refugee.

The presiding judge said the man didn’t face political persecution in Syria and his previous offenses barred him from being given refugee or other protected status, the court said in a statement. It also found that he didn’t qualify for a lesser degree of protection in part because there is no longer a “serious individual threat to the life or physical integrity of civilians as a result of arbitrary violence in the context of a domestic conflict in Hasaka province, but also generally in Syria.” The court contended that fighting and attacks in the region no longer reach a level at which civilians face a high probability of being killed and wounded. A German group that supports asylum-seekers criticized the ruling. Wiebke Judith, a spokesperson for Pro Asyl, argued that it ignores the reality in Syria, German news agency dpa reported. Germany has been a major destination for Syrians fleeing the country’s 13-year civil war. Attitudes toward migrants have hardened in recent years.

Rescue operations are ongoing with more than 200 emergency services personnel at the scene. Located near the banks of the River Moselle, the hotel's roof collapsed at around 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday, shattering windows as the top floor of the building collapsed onto the lower floor. Fourteen people were inside the hotel at the time of the incident, according to local police. A young Dutch family visiting the region was among those rescued on Wednesday morning. Five people were able to flee the building unharmed late on Tuesday night, but nine others were trapped under rubble. In a news conference on Wednesday fire inspector Jörg Teusch identified the two people killed as a man and a woman, who he said died during the night as a direct result of the building collapse. Dutch media reported that a 23-year-old woman from Urk and her infant son were rescued early on Wednesday morning and taken to hospital. The woman's husband, aged 26, was rescued later the same day and his condition is not yet known. Some 250 emergency services personnel were deployed to support rescue efforts, including firefighters, police, rescue dog teams and medics. Two people are still buried under the rubble, but emergency services have said they are still in contact with them. As reported by local broadcaster SWR, the damaged building in western Germany dates back to the 1600s. It experienced significant renovations back in the 1980s, when an additional floor was added to the now two-storey hotel. The Moselle valley is a popular tourist destination, famed for its vineyards and picturesque old towns. One hotel guest quoted by SWR said he was in the toilet when the floor beneath him collapsed. Nearby residents have been told to evacuate the area given concerns that the hotel building could collapse further. Reuters Reuters Europe Germany",

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BERLIN, July 17 (Reuters) - Germany plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year, despite concerns that U.S. support for Kyiv could potentially diminish if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House. German aid to Ukraine will be cut to 4 billion euros ($4.35 billion) in 2025 from around 8 billion euros in 2024, according to a draft of the 2025 budget seen by Reuters. Sign up here. Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. \"Ukraine's financing is secured for the foreseeable future thanks to European instruments and the G7 loans,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Wednesday at a news conference. Washington pushed to \"front load\" the loans to give Ukraine a big lump sum now. Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chance of Ukraine being short of funds if Trump returns to the White House. Alarm bells rang across Europe this week after Trump picked Senator J.D. Vance , who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president. Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance's defence spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them. Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defence. DEPLETED MILITARY STOCKS The stocks of Germany's armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defence units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine. Germany's fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO's spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on. Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2025, with a total of 75.3 billion euros. Days after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a \"Zeitenwende\" – German for historic turning point - with a 100 billion euro special fund to bring the military up to speed. From this special fund, there will be 22.0 billion euros more for defence, plus 53.3 billion euros in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The defence budget is set to receive a meagre 1.3 billion euros more than in 2024, far below the 6.7 billion euros requested by Pistorius. As ever-increasing annual operating costs outpace this rise, the defence ministry is being forced to cut ammunition orders for 2025 by more than half, reduce procurement by 260 million euros and research and development by over 200 million euros. The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces' special fund to meet NATO's minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defence, as noted in the financial plan. In 2028, there is a gap of 39 billion euros in the regular budget, of which 28 billion euros are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said. Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election. \"The 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,\" said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament's budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU. \"The coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.\" ($1 = 0.9192 euros) Reporting by Maria Martinez and Holger Hansen, additional reporting by Sabine Siebold, editing by Miranda Murray and Christina Fincher Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Europe Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Maria Martinez Thomson Reuters Maria Martinez is a Reuters correspondent in Berlin covering German economics and the ministry of finance.

Germany has issued a European arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor over his alleged involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea, according to German media. German investigators believe Volodymyr Z was a member of a team that in September 2022 planted explosive devices on the pipeline route carrying natural gas from Russia to Germany, German media reported on Wednesday. German law does not allow publication of the suspect’s surname. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage, which disrupted Russian gas exports to the European Union, hitting Moscow’s energy revenues hard. Volodymyr Z was last known to have lived in Poland, according to a report by the Suddeutsche Zeitung and Die Zeit newspapers and the ARD public broadcaster, which quoted unnamed sources. The Polish prosecutor’s office confirmed on Wednesday that it had received a German arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man who is a suspect in the Nord Stream attack named “Volodymyr Z”. It said it received the warrant in June, but the suspect left for Ukraine last month. It said also that the authorities failed to prevent him from leaving because the relevant information had not percolated down to the country’s border guard. Germany’s investigation has identified another man and a woman who like Volodymyr Z are also Ukrainian diving instructors. However, no arrest warrants have been issued for them for the time being, according to the German media report.    Several explosions on September 26, 2022 damaged the two gas pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2. The explosions were registered near the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. Four leaks were discovered shortly afterwards. Russian natural gas had previously flowed to Germany through Nord Stream 1, which had a capacity of 63 billion cubic metres (82.4 billion cubic yards) per year. The similarly sized Nord Stream 2 was not yet in operation. The route was built to divert Russian gas exports to the EU away from Ukraine’s pipelines, on which they were previously heavily reliant. Russia’s gas sales to the EU were by far the country’s most lucrative until the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and ensuing political disputes all but wiped the trade out. Russia and the West accused each other of being behind the Nord Stream blasts. Each has denied involvement, and no one has taken responsibility. Authorities in several countries investigated the case, but Denmark and Sweden halted their investigations without noting any conclusion. In January 2023, Germany raided a ship that it said may have been used to transport explosives and told the United Nations that it believed trained divers could have attached devices to the pipelines at about 70 to 80 metres (230 to 260 feet) deep. In March last year, The New York Times reported that US officials had seen intelligence indicating a “pro-Ukrainian group” was responsible for carrying out the blasts without Zelenskyy’s knowledge.  Whether the finding that Ukrainians were behind the attack on the pipelines might have any ill effect on Germany’s support for Ukraine is yet to become clear. “The level of resources, of money, of military hardware that has been channelled from Germany, from Poland to Ukraine is very considerable,” said Al Jazeera’s correspondent Dominic Kane in Berlin. “The current German government says that these developments will have no effect whatsoever on their relationship with Kyiv. But clearly it’s a very serious issue.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Danish Defence Command/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab KYIV, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak denied his country's involvement in explosions which damaged the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and instead pointed the finger at Russia in comments to Reuters on Thursday. \"Such an act can only be carried out with extensive technical and financial resources ... and who possessed all this at the time of the bombing? Only Russia,\" Podolyak said as part of his written comments. Sign up here. The multi-billion dollar Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines transporting gas under the Baltic Sea were ruptured by a series of explosions in September 2022, seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday that Poland had received a European arrest warrant issued by Berlin in connection with the attack, but the suspect, a Ukrainian man named as Volodymyr Z, has already left Poland. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that top Ukrainian officials were involved in what happened. \"Ukraine has nothing to do with the Nord Stream explosions,\" Podolyak said, adding that Ukraine did not gain any strategic or tactical advantage from the blasts. Russia has already blamed the United States, Britain and Ukraine for the blasts, which largely cut Russian gas off from the lucrative European market. Those countries have denied involvement. Germany, Denmark, and Sweden all opened investigations into the incident, and the Swedes found traces of explosives on several objects recovered from the explosion site, confirming the blasts were deliberate acts.

Issued on: 24/07/2024 - 15:49 Modified: 24/07/2024 - 17:37 2 min The Blue Mosque run by the Hamburg Islamic Centre which has been banned by Germany © STRINGER / AFP Tehran reacted in fury, summoning Germany's ambassador to Iran to condemn a \"hostile action\" it branded as a \"clear example of Islamophobia\". Germany in turn held talks with Iran's ambassador but fell short of formally summoning the envoy. Germany's Interior Ministry accused the centre of presenting itself as a purely religious organisation with no political agenda, but said its probe has found the contrary to be true. In a statement, the ministry said it \"banned the Hamburg Islamic Centre and its affiliated organisations throughout Germany to date, as it is an Islamist extremist organisation pursuing anti-constitutional objectives\". Describing the group as a \"direct representative of Iran's supreme leader\", the ministry said the centre spreads Tehran's ideology \"in an aggressive and militant manner\". It is allegedly seeking to \"establish authoritarian, theocratic rule\" in place of a democracy, the ministry said, accusing the centre of backing the \"military and political dimension\" of organisations like Hezbollah. It is also believed to propagate anti-Semitism, something that Germany has been battling to stem amid a jump in cases following Israel's war in Gaza, launched in response to a deadly attack by Hamas militants on Israeli soil. Investigators raided 53 properties allegedly linked to the centre across Germany on Wednesday, impounding the centre itself while seizing a \"high number of IT devices\" along with cash and documents with links to Hezbollah and Hamas, the ministry said in a later statement. Wednesday's ban will also apply to several organisations related to the Hamburg centre, including four Shiite mosques. \"I want to make it very clear: We are not taking action against a religion,\" said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser. \"We are drawing a clear distinction between the Islamist extremists that we are cracking down on and the many Muslims who belong to our country and live according to their faith. \"This ban absolutely does not apply to the peaceful practice of the Shiite religion,\" she said. 'Outpost' of Iran Germany considers Hezbollah a \"Shiite terrorist organisation\" and in 2020 banned Hezbollah from carrying out activities on its soil. The Hamburg Islamic Centre runs the Imam Ali Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque, and calls have grown in recent years for authorities to close it down because of its alleged links to Iran. Blasting Berlin over its decision, Iran's foreign ministry said \"what happened in Germany today is a clear example of Islamophobia and a confrontation to the teachings of the Abrahamic religions\". The Iranian ministry hailed \"valuable and unforgettable services of Islamic centres, including the Hamburg Islamic Centre, in explaining the religious teachings of Islam, promoting the principle of dialogue and religious tolerance, as well as combating extremism\". Founded by Iranian immigrants in 1953, the Hamburg Islamic Centre had already been under surveillance by domestic intelligence for some time. In November, investigators had conducted sweeping raids of its premises and other related sites across seven of Germany's 16 states. \"Extensive evidence\" that was secured then had \"confirmed suspicions sufficiently to order today's ban\" of the group, the interior ministry said. The regional government of Hamburg welcomed the decision, with the state's interior minister Andy Grote saying the \"closure of this outpost of the Iranian inhumane regime is a real blow against Islamist extremism\". © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

A German court has imposed a $655 (600 euro) fine on a woman for using the slogan – “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – during a protest last year, a ruling her lawyer decried as an assault on free speech . Lawyer Alexander Gorski, who represented the 22-year-old woman in Berlin, said the decision on Tuesday was “a dark day for freedom of expression”. “My client only wanted to express her hope for a future of democratic coexistence for all people in the region,” he told AFP news agency, adding that the woman, identified only as Ava M, would appeal the decision. A court spokesperson said the woman was found guilty of using the slogan during a demonstration at Berlin’s Neukoelln district on October 11, days after the Gaza war began. The court concluded that the use of the phrase “could only be understood as a denial of Israel’s right to exist and an endorsement” of Hamas’s October 7 attack, the spokesperson said. By October 11, Israel had killed 1,537 Palestinians, according to local authorities, more than the number of Israelis killed in the October 7 attack. Antiwar activists had been organising protests calling for a ceasefire at that time.    Palestinian rights advocates have said “from the river to the sea” is an aspirational call for freedom and equality in historical Palestine. Israel’s supporters argue the slogan calls for the destruction of Israel. The phrase was outlawed by German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser in November. However, Israel controls the entire area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, where it is imposing a system of apartheid on Palestinians, according to leading rights groups. Moreover, Israeli politicians often show a map of the country that includes the occupied Palestinian territory, effectively saying that Israel extends from the river to the sea. Germany has been a staunch supporter of Israel and one of its top weapon suppliers. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,653 people, levelled large parts of the territory and brought its more than two million inhabitants to the verge of starvation. Domestically, Berlin has cracked down on Palestinian rights activism. Earlier this year, the country passed a law requiring immigrants seeking German citizenship to affirm Israel’s right to exist. In April, German police cancelled a pro-Palestine conference in Berlin. Authorities have also regularly broken up protests against the war on Gaza and assaulted and detained demonstrators. Earlier this year, Germany banned British Palestinian doctor Ghassan Abu Sittah , who worked in Gaza during the early months of the war, from entering the country.

The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report , which cited non-public documents and emails as well as discussions with people familiar with the matter. In a letter sent to the German defense ministry on Aug. 5, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds from frozen Russian assets , according to the German newspaper. Advertisement Germany and other G7 countries in June struck a preliminary deal to use the value of some $300 billion of Russia’s sovereign assets immobilized in Western financial institutions to secure a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But governments have yet to agree on the details of the scheme, and technical talks might drag on for months. Berlin, which is Europe's main supplier of military aid to Kyiv, had already signaled a change in course on Ukraine last month , when the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals adopted a preliminary deal on a draft budget for 2025. The compromise seen by POLITICO detailed plans to slash future assistance to Ukraine by half to €4 billion to fulfill other spending priorities. Speaking after the Cabinet approved the draft budget in mid-July, Lindner said Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from \"European sources\" as well as the frozen Russian assets. But it's still unclear if, and when, that money will flow. Contentions over Ukraine aid reportedly deepened the rifts in the ruling coalition in Berlin, already tattered by weeks of internal fights over a series of issues from the budget to welfare. Green leader and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said this week he plans to run for chancellor as the Greens’ candidate in the 2025 federal election, casting doubt on the survival of the governing alliance of which he is a member. “It’s quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground,” Habeck said regarding the recent disputes. “The ideas are falling apart.” Advertisement Related Tags Aid and development Air defense Budget Defense Defense budgets Elections European Defense European defense policy Finance and banking Military War in Ukraine Welfare Related Countries Germany Russia Ukraine Related People Christian Lindner Olaf Scholz Robert Habeck Related Organizations G7 German defense ministry Our readers read next DOGE loses its biggest advocate as Musk exits Washington 29 MINS ago 6 mins read Trump squeezes Zelenskyy on peace deal as US leaders skip talks in Europe 3 HRS ago 4 mins read Zelenskyy under pressure at home over peace talks and mineral deal with US 4 HRS ago 4 mins read France floats resurrecting doomed EU-US trade deal it used to oppose 5 HRS ago 2 mins read More from Giovanna Coi Why von der Leyen’s Big Tech tax plan is bluster There are major hurdles to overcome for the EU to retaliate against U.S. digital companies.

Germany summoned the Iranian ambassador in response. https://p.dw.com/p/4jgmx The closure of the language school comes after the closure of an Islamic Center in Hamburg in July. Image: dpa/picture alliance Advertisement Judicial authorities in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Tuesday closed down two branches of German Language Institute (DSIT) in the city. According to Mizan, a news outlet affiliated with the Iranian judiciary, the branches had been designated \"illegal centers affiliated with the German government\" which had \"breached Iranian law, committed various illegal actions and extensive financial violations.\" Eyewitnesses reported seeing security personnel cordoning off one branch in the Ekhtiareh district of northern Tehran , while images of a large police presence outside the language school were posted on social media. The DSIT was founded in 1995 by the German Embassy in Tehran and describes itself on its website as \"one of the leading institutions for the learning of the German language ,\" offering courses of various levels for both young people and adults. Germany summons Iranian ambassador Germany's Foreign Office condemned the closure of the institute which it said was \"in no way justifiable\" and summoned the Iranian ambassador. \"Linguistic exchange forms the foundation of mutual understanding,\" it said in a statement in which it demanded the immediate reopening of the institute. \"The institute is a popular and recognized meeting place where people put a lot of effort into learning languages under difficult circumstances. The employees of the institute carry out their work, which is intended to strengthen the connection between the people of Iran and Germany, with great engagement.\" Why has the German language school in Tehran been closed? Another media outlet, Nournews, considered close to Iran's state security apparatus, suggested that the closures were a response to the closure of the Hamburg Islamic Center (IZH) in Germany in July. At the time, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser had described the IZH as an \"important Iranian propaganda center in Europe.\" Iran had summoned the German ambassador in Tehran in protest at what it called a \"hostile action\" and a \"clear example of Islamophobia.\" Last week, the IZH lodged an appeal against the ban. German-Iranian diplomatic relations have suffered in recent years with several German nationals, some of whom hold dual German and Iranian citizenship, arrested and imprisoned in Iran on suspicion of espionage. In 2023, German-Iranian journalist and software engineer Jamshid Sharmahd was found guilty of the capital crime of \"corruption\" linked to terrorism charges and sentenced to death . mf/lo (dpa, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement",

Prosecutors named the man as Issa Al H, omitting his surname because of Germany's privacy laws. The 26-year-old had given himself up and admitted to the stabbings, police said. Three people were killed and another eight injured during Friday's attack in the city of Solingen, during a festival to celebrate its 650-year history. On Saturday, IS claimed that it was behind the attack. Solingen residents feel 'great solidarity' after knife attack Chancellor Olaf Scholz had described it as an \"horrific act\". Those killed were two men aged 56 and 67, and a 56-year-old woman, officials said. Four of those wounded are still in a serious condition. All of the victims were stabbed in the neck, police said. \"The man we’ve really been looking for the whole day has just been taken into custody,\" Herbert Reul, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, told ARD public TV late on Saturday. Germany's Bild and Spiegel news websites reported that the suspect surrendered himself in dirty blood-stained clothes. Issa Al H is under investigation for murder, attempted murder and \"strong suspicions of belonging to a terrorist group abroad\", the prosecutor's office said in a statement. He is a Syrian national, police and prosecutors confirmed, and German media reported that he arrived in the country in December 2022, after leaving war-torn Syria. Bild reported that special task force (SEK) officers stormed a refugee centre that the suspect was associated with, detaining another person there. Police also arrested a 15-year-old boy who is alleged to have known about the attack in advance. The refugee centre is located about 300m (984ft) from Fronhof - Solingen's central market square where the attack happened - according to Bild. EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Police raided a refugee centre in Solingen which the attack suspect was associated with Solingen - a city famous for its steel industry - has about 160,000 inhabitants. It lies about 25km (15 miles) east of Düsseldorf. The city's authorities asked people to leave the Fronhof area after the attack at about 22:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Friday. The planned three-day celebrations of the city anniversary - for which about 75,000 people had been expected - were cancelled. Solingen Mayor Tim Kurzbach later said that \"all of us in Solingen are in shock, horror and great sadness. \"It breaks my heart that an attack has happened in our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we've lost. \"I pray for all those still fighting for their lives. Also my greatest sympathy for all those who had to experience this, these images must have been horrific.\" People have been bringing flowers and candles to the site of the stabbing that shocked the entire country. Players from Germany's top Bundesliga football league wore black armbands during Saturday's matches. The attack may fuel an already fraught debate about immigration and asylum in Germany. It comes ahead of key regional elections in the country’s east next week, where the far right is eyeing gains. Germany",

German-born Dotcom is facing criminal charges relating to the now obsolete file-sharing website Megaupload . The 50-year-old has been fighting extradition to the US since 2012, after an FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion. Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith signed an extradition order for Dotcom, a spokesperson for the Minister of Justice said Thursday. \"I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial,\" Goldsmith said in a statement. \"As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage.\" Dotcom makes pledge to stay in New Zealand Dotcom took to X, however, to deny the claims of his extradiction. \"I love New Zealand. I'm not leaving,\" he told his followers. US authorities say Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million (€454.2 million) by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, which generated more than $175 million in revenue for the brand. Megaupload's chief marketing officer Finn Batato and chief technical officer and co-founder Mathias Ortmann, both from Germany, along with a third executive, Dutch national Bram van der Kolk, were arrested with Dotcom back in 2012 . Born Kim Schmitz in the northern German city of Kiel, Dotcom founded Megaupload in 2005. The platform provided online file storage and viewing services and made millions from advertising and premium subscriptions. At its peak, Megaupload was the 13th most popular website on the internet and accounted for 4% of all online traffic. But the FBI seized the domain in 2012 and indicted Megaupload's owners for allegedly operating as an organization dedicated to copyright infringement. Dotcom, who has resided in New Zealand since 2010, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. jsi/dj (Reuters, EFE) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement",

A suspected Islamic extremist from Syria turned himself in to police a day later. Prosecutors say he was motivated by the ideology of the Islamic State group. In response to the Solingen attack, Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged Monday to toughen knife laws and step up deportations of rejected asylum-seekers.",

The piece dates to the mid to late 1760s and consists of seven miniature movements for a string trio lasting about 12 minutes, the Leipzig municipal libraries said in a statement on Thursday. Born in 1756, Mozart was a child prodigy and began composing at a very early age under his father’s guidance. Researchers discovered the work at the city’s music library while compiling the latest edition of the Köchel catalogue, the definitive archive of Mozart’s musical works. The newly discovered manuscript was not written by Mozart himself but is believed to be a copy made in about 1780, the researchers said. The piece was performed by a string trio at the unveiling of the new Köchel catalogue in the Austrian city of Salzburg on Thursday. It will receive its German premiere at the Leipzig Opera on Saturday. The piece is referred to as Ganz kleine Nachtmusik in the catalogue, according to the Leipzig libraries. The manuscript consists of dark brown ink on medium-white handmade paper and the parts are individually bound, they said. The Köchel catalogue describes the piece as “preserved in a single source, in which the attribution of the author suggests that the work was written before Mozart’s first trip to Italy”, according to the municipal libraries.

The 27-year-old Syrian is a suspected supporter of radical Islamic ideology, according to the Munich public prosecutor’s office. It said that the suspect procured two machetes, each about 40 centimeters (15.75 inches) long, earlier this month, and allegedly planned to attack the soldiers with them. The suspect was brought before a judge on Friday following his arrest a day earlier, the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. His name was not released in line with German privacy rules. The arrest comes after an Aug. 23 attack in Solingen that left three people dead and eight wounded. A 26-year-old Syrian suspect was arrested. He was an asylum-seeker who was supposed to be deported to Bulgaria last year but reportedly disappeared for a time and avoided deportation. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the violence, without providing evidence. The violence left Germany shaken and pushed immigration back to the top of the country’s political agenda. In response, the interior ministry extended temporary border controls to all of its nine frontiers this week. The closures are set to last six months and are threatening to test European unity.

        "text": "Germany to welcome Kenyans in labour deal Image source, AFP Image caption, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) and Kenya's President William Ruto signed the deal in Berlin Wycliffe Muia BBC News, Nairobi Published 13 September 2024 Updated 14 September 2024 Berlin has agreed to allow skilled and semi-skilled Kenyan workers into Germany in a controlled and targeted labour migration deal. Kenya is struggling with increasing difficulties in providing work and sufficient income for its young professionals, while Germany is facing a shortage of skilled labour. The German government has said the deal does not specify the number of workers who will be allowed in. Migration agreements are a central pillar in the German government's efforts to curb immigration. The agreement will also simplify the repatriation of Kenyans who are in Germany without legal permission. Five Kenyan bus drivers have already been welcomed to Flensburg , external , in the north of Germany, in a pilot project. Immigration is a huge issue in Germany at the moment, following the rise in popularity of the far-right anti-immigration party , Alternative for Germany (AfD). Successive governments in Berlin have allowed relatively large numbers of asylum seekers to settle in the country in recent years. Germany took in more than one million people, mostly fleeing war in countries such as Syria, during the 2015-2016 migrant crisis, and has received 1.2 million Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Germany to tighten border controls after stabbing Kenya doctor strike: The public caught between the medics and the government The labour deal was signed in Berlin by Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Kenya's President William Ruto. Germany agreed to ease some of its immigration laws to enable Kenyans to find employment in Europe's biggest economy. Authorities in Berlin will also consider extending temporary residence permits for Kenyan workers who have secured an approved job. Kenyans will also be issued with long-term visas to study or do vocational training in Germany. \"On the expiry of the long-stay visa, Kenyans may receive a temporary residence permit for study purposes in Germany for up to two years,\" the agreement states. The temporary residence permit may be extended if the purpose of residence has not yet been achieved but is achievable within a \"reasonable\" period, it adds. According to the deal, IT specialists from Kenya will be allowed to enter and work in Germany, even if they do not have formal qualifications. Both governments will support the immigration of skilled workers who have finished vocational training or earned a university degree, as long as their qualifications are recognised by the relevant authorities of the other party. Image source, AFP Image caption, The European country needs more nurses but critics say it should not deprive Kenya of much-needed medical professionals The deal also includes provisions for the readmission and return of citizens between the two nations. It spells out guidelines to prevent and fight against labour exploitation, forced labour and human trafficking. While welcoming five Kenyan drivers in Flensburg on Thursday, Schleswig-Holstein's Transport Minister Claus Ruhe Madsen said Germany was in need of  hard-working hands and clever minds. \"We simply have to position ourselves in Germany in such a way that it is attractive to come here,\" Mr Madsen added. The drivers are the first batch of Kenyan workers, who will be trained by the Aktiv bus company in a pilot project, hoping to get a job in Germany. Doctors, nurses and teachers are among those expected to take part in the programme. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) said the deal was expected to significantly increase access to decent foreign jobs for Kenyan workers in Germany and address labour shortages in Germany. \"It includes mechanisms to protect the rights and welfare of Kenyan migrant workers in Germany, ensuring safe, orderly, and productive migration,\" ILO added in a statement , external . But there are concerns about a brain-drain in Kenya with professionals like doctors and nurses going abroad for jobs, leaving local hospitals with a huge shortage of medical workers. \"It is sad that we are going to service other countries at the expense of our own country,\" Ekuru Aukot, a Kenyan lawyer and politician, told the BBC's Newsday programme . But Roseline Njogu, a senior foreign affairs official, said Kenya was simply responding to the global labour market demands. \"We have a youth bulge in Kenya and  every year we have a million people joining the local labour market. It takes time and resources to create job opportunities at home,\" she added. Correction 14 September 2024:  An earlier version of this article put a figure on how many Kenyan workers would be allowed into Germany under the deal.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) Read More By FANNY BRODERSEN Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit POTSDAM, Germany (AP) — The Social Democrats of Chancellor Olaf Scholz won an election in the eastern German state of Brandenburg on Sunday, gaining a narrow edge over a growing far-right party, according to the vote count. The vote took place three weeks after the far right made gains in two other states in eastern Germany. According to final results published Sunday evening by the state electoral administration, the Social Democrats won 30.9% of the votes in the election to the parliament of Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin. The far-right Alternative for Germany was a close second with 29.2%. A new leftist movement, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance , or BSW, came in third with 13.5% while the center-right Christian Democrats took 12.1% The first-place showing for the Social Democrats brought a reprieve to the beleaguered Scholz, whose three-party governing coalition has fared poorly in elections so far this year. The Social Democrats have governed Brandenburg continuously since German reunification in 1990, and a loss there would have been a major setback for Scholz, who has his constituency in the state capital, Potsdam. RELATED COVERAGE NFL draft suits give prospects another way to cash in on their fame, flash their style on red carpet Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo announces he will leave club, return to Germany after 2025 season Scholz has said he would like to be the party’s candidate for chancellor in next fall’s federal election, and Sunday’s vote was also being watched for what it might signal about his political future. “It’s great that we won,” Scholz said from New York, where he was attending a meeting at the United Nations, according to the German dpa news agency. But the success of the Social Democrats in Brandenburg — after defeats elsewhere — was largely credited not to Scholz, but to the efforts of the popular state governor, Dietmar Woidke. He distanced himself from Scholz during the campaign and took the gamble of promising to resign in case of a win by the far right. He was able to celebrate his political survival on Sunday night. “It is an important victory for me, it’s an important victory for my party, and it’s an important victory for the state of Brandenburg,” Woidke said after polls closed. But he also said he felt the strong showing of the far-right party means there is work to do. “They (the AFD) have achieved about 30 percent, a lot of voters have voted for the AFD, and that’s too much. So we have to think about these results and we have to make our policies better,” Woidtke told The Associated Press. The far-right party has gained support amid a growing backlash against large-scale migration to Germany over the past decade and recent extremist attacks. Germany’s economy, once a powerhouse, has been weakening, adding to a general feeling of malaise. Sunday’s vote followed a heated election campaign centered on the issues of migration, internal security and peace. Both the far right and the new leftist movement want to end weapons deliveries to Kyiv as Ukraine tries to defend itself against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The Alternative for Germany won the most votes in the state of Thuringia and also did well in Saxony in elections held on Sept. 1. The new party on the left, the BSW, also made a strong impact, while the parties in Scholz’s unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results — as they did again on Sunday in Brandenburg. The vote in Thuringia marked the first electoral victory for a far-right party in Germany since World War II. It triggered concerns in Germany and abroad about the growing support for the extreme right in Germany, a NATO member and the largest European Union country. Towards the end of voting on Sunday afternoon, a group of anti-AfD protesters gathered near a restaurant where the far-right party’s supporters gathered to learn of the election results. Their chanting and the sound of whistles sought to disrupt the party. One carried a placard saying “AfD is so 1933,” referencing the year Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power. ___ Associated Press writer David Keyton contributed from Potsdam.",

Emergency services were alerted to two fires in residential buildings in quick succession shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, police said. The injured people included eight children who were seriously hurt, and two of them were in a life-threatening condition after inhaling smoke. Shortly after the fires broke out, a van drove into two shops in the city, causing damage to property but no injuries. The suspect then allegedly threatened people with weapons, but several men managed to push him back with shovels and poles and hold him until police arrived. Police said the suspect was a 41-year-old Essen resident with Syrian citizenship. They said the man’s motive appeared to be that his wife had left him, and he targeted houses and shops where people who supported her lived. The fire service said that, when it arrived at the scene of the first blaze, smoke was billowing from the entrance of the building and people were calling for help from windows. Neighbors had put up ladders to help people escape, but they weren’t long enough to reach the upper floors.

Dornau inked a deal with a local Center for the Isolation of Offenders to employ Belarusians convicted of political infractions at his Belarus-based agricultural company, OOO Zybulka-Bel, according to independent local outlet Reform.news. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ramped up political repression and instituted a mass crackdown on dissent, locking up opponents, in the aftermath of a 2020 presidential election widely dismissed as fraudulent. Advertisement One of the laborers at Dornau’s farm told the outlet he sorted onions for about €5 per day after being detained in February 2024 for liking a post on social media. He described difficult working conditions, with breakfast at 7 a.m. and no food or water until the end of the working day at 8 p.m. “We were brought to a shelter,” he said. “It was a horrible basement, people had all kinds of clothes on, so our hands and feet were freezing.” The onions, he noted, “were tasty.” The work was overseen by a foreman who would decide whether the detainee would be paid, he said. The labor was not forced, according to the prisoner, and the earned money was supposed to go toward the maintenance of the detention center. Dornau, according to the report, made at least one visit to his onion plantation to see his employees in person. Advertisement “I’ve even seen him. A tall, bald man,” the prisoner said, with a description that matches Dornau’s physical traits. “He came once in his car with German registration. He came into the shelter where we were picking onions together with hired workers.” Dornau did not respond to multiple requests for comment by POLITICO on Tuesday. “The presumption of innocence applies until full legal clarification,” Andreas Harlaß, a spokesperson for the AfD in Saxony, told POLITICO. He has represented the far-right populist AfD party in the Saxony parliament in eastern Germany since 2019 and has come under scrutiny for his business dealings in Belarus, a Russia-friendly dictatorship ruled with an iron fist by Lukashenko. Dornau was ordered to pay a fine of €20,862 by the Saxony parliament last month for failing to reveal his involvement in Zybulka-Bel. The company was registered in Belarus in October 2020, even as pro-democracy protests roiled the country. As of Tuesday, there are more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna. Belarus has been targeted by waves of sanctions by the European Union over the years, most recently in August for ongoing internal repression and human rights violations.

The flight came a week after three people were fatally stabbed at a street festival in the western town of Solingen. The killings shocked Germany and sparked an intense debate over asylum rules when it emerged the main suspect was a 26-year-old Syrian refugee facing deportation. An Afghan man was detained after another deadly attack in May. The government in Berlin has already announced a series of measures ahead of elections on Sunday in eastern Germany, where the far-right Alternative for Germany is riding high in the polls. Asylum seekers facing deportation are to lose benefits and carrying knives will be banned at most public events and on public transport, ministers say. Sunday's votes in Thuringia and Saxony could end in humiliation for the three parties running the federal government as they are all running below 10% in the polls. In Thuringia, the AfD are being tipped to come first, ahead of the conservative CDU, while in Saxony, opinion polls put the two parties neck and neck. The anti-immigration party has little chance of coming to power in either state as no other group is prepared to help the AfD form a majority. Sean Gallup/Getty Images The far-right Alternative for Germany is hoping to come first in Saxony and Thuringia on Sunday Friday's chartered flight from Leipzig shortly before 07:00 (05:00 GMT) was carrying 28 Afghan men on board a Boeing 787 to Kabul, German reports said. \"These were Afghan nationals, all of whom were convicted offenders who had no right to remain in Germany and against whom deportation orders had been issued,\" said government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit. Germany halted deportations in 2021 as the Taliban swept back to power in Afghanistan and the security situation deteriorated. Although Germany has no diplomatic relations with the Taliban government, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the deportation of Afghans and Syrians would be allowed after the knife attack in Mannheim last May in which a police officer was killed. A 25-year-old Afghan man was arrested. Last Friday's attack in Solingen, in which three people died and eight others were wounded , has caused outrage in Germany. Issa Al H, 26, is being investigated for murder and links to militant group Islamic State (IS). The Syrian should have been deported to Bulgaria last year but German reports suggest that the attempt failed because officials had failed to find him. During a visit to Solingen this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the government would do all it could to ensure \"those who cannot and must not stay here in Germany are repatriated and deported\". Scholz vows to speed up deportations after Solingen stabbings Man surrenders and confesses to Germany stabbing attack Ministers from the three ruling parties - the Social Democrats, Greens and Liberal FDP - announced what they said were far-reaching measures in response to the attack. Knives are to be banned at most public events including markets and sport as well as on public transport, and there will be a blanket ban on flick knives. Foreigners ordered to leave the country will have to be deported more quickly and efficiently, they say. Anyone facing a jail term for knife crime would face fast deportation. A task force for the prevention of Islamism is being proposed and biometric facial recognition will be used to help identify suspects. IS said it was behind the Solingen attack and a day afterwards released a video purportedly showing the suspect in a mask. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said asylum seekers who had already registered in another European Union country would lose their rights to welfare benefits. Ms Faeser insisted that nobody would be left hungry or sleeping on the streets, as the other EU country would be responsible for paying their benefits. The suspect in custody in the western city of Düsseldorf had sought asylum in Germany but he was turned down because he had first entered the EU in Bulgaria. Under the EU's Dublin Regulation, an application for asylum has to be made in the country of arrival. The leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz, who met the chancellor this week, had called for a halt on allowing refugees from Afghanistan and Syria to enter Germany, but that was rejected by Mr Scholz.

While still in its early stages, scientists believe that super-fast quantum computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields, from smarter encryption software to artificial intelligence. Scholz hailed the data centre as \"good news for Germany\", adding that Europe's biggest economy needs such \"key technologies\". Scientists believe that super-fast quantum computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields, from smarter encryption software to artificial intelligence © SILAS STEIN / AFP \"It is precisely these future fields where we have to be at the forefront, where we must not be dependent on others,\" he said. Quantum research is seen as a critical field and both the United States and China have been investing heavily in the area, while Washington has also placed restrictions on the export of the sensitive technology. Olivier Ezratty, an independent expert in quantum technologies, told AFP that private and public investment in the field have totalled around $20 billion worldwide over the past five years. The centre in Germany consists of two quantum computers linked to quantum processors. One of the computers at the site was inaugurated in 2021 by Scholz's predecessor, Angela Merkel, and was the first in Germany. Mind-boggling speed Quantum computers can process complex information at a mind-boggling speed and should eventually vastly outperform even the most powerful of today's conventional computers. Regular computers function in binary fashion: they carry out tasks using tiny fragments of data known as bits that are only ever either expressed as 1 or 0. But fragments of data on a quantum computer, known as qubits, can be both 1 and 0 at the same time -- allowing them to crunch an enormous number of potential outcomes simultaneously. The quantum computers at the German site are vast metal stacks and other components connected via a mass of wiring, and bear no resemblance to regular computers. IBM's quantum data centre in Germany is its first in Europe © SILAS STEIN / AFP IBM already has 250 customers worldwide who are testing its quantum computers to develop applications in various areas. The US firm has been seeking to develop the technology for 20 years in competition with other tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as research labs and start-ups. Companies that will have access to IBM's quantum systems via the new data centre include German auto titan Volkswagen and technology group Bosch. Nikolai Ardey, executive director from Volkswagen's innovation unit, said quantum computing could \"solve problems in material science, traffic optimisation, or deep learning\". The data centre \"represents an indispensable piece of the bridge between quantum computers and industrial applications at scale,\" he added. IBM says it is confident that it will be able to provide clients with a quantum computer able to run cutting-edge applications by 2029. But the technology still has some way to go. A main challenge is to reduce the rate of errors that systems produce, which experts say is still too high. By the end of the year the German data centre should host IBM's latest quantum system, called Heron, which the firm says will run with reduced error rates and a 25-fold increase in speed from its predecessor. \"In certain aspects... the Heron system is the most advanced today,\" said independent expert Ezratty. In addition IBM has built up a large ecosystem of companies and institutions which \"are already testing their tools on an experimental scale\", he said. But he cautioned that the error rate was still too high \"to perform useful calculations on a large scale\". © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

It said the group plotted to seize power in Saxony and potentially other eastern German states “to establish governmental and societal structures inspired by National Socialism.” “Even ethnic cleansing was part of their inhuman plans,” Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said in a statement. He said that the arrests were a reminder that the German constitutional state and the free and democratic order “are under threat from many sides.” “We must do everything we can to defend our liberal democracy against its enemies,” he said.

More than 450 police officers and special forces searched 20 premises in connection with the arrests. The prosecutor’s office said that since its founding in 2020, the militant group made continuous preparations for the perceived inevitable and violent change of government. It said its members, including the arrested suspects, repeatedly completed paramilitary training in combat gear, practiced specifically urban warfare, firearms handling and other skills. The group also procured military hardware, such as camouflage fatigues, combat helmets, gas masks and bullet-proof vests, the statement said. Seven other suspects were also investigated in the raids but not detained. Germany has repeatedly busted far-right groups wanting to overthrow the government. In 2022, a group of so-called Reichsbuerger planned to storm into the parliament building in Berlin and arrest lawmakers, according to prosecutors. It allegedly intended to negotiate a post-coup order primarily with Russia, as one of the allied victors of World War II.

The man, named as Martin Manfred N in court papers, is now 80. He shot Czeslaw Kukuczka in the back at Friedrichstrasse station in 1974, after he had entered the Polish embassy claiming to be carrying a bomb and demanding to be allowed to leave to democratic West Germany. Details of the killing remained unknown for decades after the Stasi secret police shredded files relating to the case before communist East Germany reunified with the West in 1990. Berlin prosecutors filed charges against him in 2023 after persistent investigations by historians and Polish authorities. On 29 March 1974, 38-year-old Kukuczka, a firefighter, entered the Polish embassy on East Berlin's Unter den Linden boulevard with a briefcase. The father of three said - falsely - that he was carrying a bomb. He demanded to be allowed to leave for West Berlin. Stasi officers gave him an exit visa and some West German money and escorted him to Friedrichstrasse station, which was still served by trains from the western side of the city. Kukuczka passed several border checks inside the station. However, before he could make it to the western part of the station, a man approached him from behind and shot him in the back. A group of schoolchildren from Hesse in West Germany were among witnesses to the killing. One gave evidence at the trial that she had seen a man shoot Kukuczka before \"people in uniform\" sealed off the passage. Details of the case were uncovered by historians, who tracked down related files in the Stasi archives. Documents linking Naumann to the killing, which had been shredded, were reconstituted using a purpose-built machine. Kukuczka's family was never officially told of his fate. His ashes were sent to his wife some weeks after he had been murdered. The case was brought to trial after Poland issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann in 2021. The trial has been seen as holding special historical significance in Germany, similarly to trials of surviving Holocaust perpetrators. Martin Manfred N always insisted on his innocence. His lawyer has said there was no proof he carried out the killing. East Germany was created from the parts of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. It was a communist dictatorship, while West Germany - created from the American, British and French occupation zones - was a capitalist, democratic state.

        "text": "Germany suspects sabotage behind severed undersea cables 19 November 2024 Share Save Henri Astier & Paul Kirby BBC News Share Save Getty Images The undersea cable between Helsinki and Rostock was laid in 2015 German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has said damage to two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea looks like an act of sabotage and a \"hybrid action\", without knowing who is to blame. A 1,170km (730-mile) telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany was severed in the early hours of Monday, while a 218km internet link between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island stopped working on Sunday. The incidents came at a time of heightened tension with Russia and Pistorius said \"nobody believes that these cables were cut accidentally\". The Swedish and Lithuanian defence ministers said they were \"deeply concerned\" that the cable connecting their two countries had been cut. \"Situations like these must be assessed with the growing threat posed by Russia in our neighbourhood as a backdrop,\" ministers Pal Jonson and Laurynas Kasciunas said in a statement , with a call for sanctions to be used in response to acts of sabotage. Germany and Finland also expressed grave concern on Monday in response to the severing of the C-Lion1 communications cable, warning that Europe's security was threatened by Russia's war, \"but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors\". A series of incidents involving Baltic pipelines have heightened fears of sabotage since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finnish telecoms and cyber security firm Cinia said its cable may have been severed \"by an outside force\". \"These kinds of breaks don't happen in these waters without an outside impact,\" a spokesperson told local media. Cinia's chief executive said the damage had taken place close to Sweden's Oland Island and could take five to 15 days to repair. On Tuesday, Finland said it had opened a police probe, while the Swedish Prosecution Authority said it had opened an investigation into \"sabotage\" . \"The preliminary investigation is ongoing and at an early stage. There is no further information to share about the investigation at this time,\" prosecutor Henrik Soderman said in a statement. The two cables intersect in the Baltic although the damage is thought to have taken place elsewhere. Arelion, the company that operates the line to Lithuania, has not said where its cable was cut but expects the repair to take a couple of weeks. Swedish civil defence minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said it was \"absolutely central\" to find out why two cables were not working. About a fifth of Lithuania's internet capacity has been reduced, although consumers are understood not to be affected. Arelion spokesman Martin Sjogren told the BBC that cables in the Baltic did get damaged every now and then. \"Fishing vessels accidentally damage cables with anchors,\" he said. \"The timing is odd of course but we haven’t been able to examine it so we don’t know what caused it.\" Samuli Bergstrom, a Finnish government cybersecurity expert, said the failure of the cable from Finland to Germany had not affected internet traffic as other cable routes were available. LISTEN: How vulnerable are the undersea cables connecting us? The biggest act of sabotage since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine took place in the Baltic in the same year. German prosecutors are still investigating the explosion of Nord Stream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany. There have been conspiracy theories around that attack, with unconfirmed rumours that either the Ukrainian, Russian or US government was behind it. In October 2023 a natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was severely damaged . Finnish officials later said the incident had been caused by a Chinese container ship dragging its anchor.

        "text": "German coalition collapses after Scholz fires key minister 7 November 2024 Share Save Ido Vock & Damien McGuinness BBC News in London & Berlin Share Save Shutterstock Finance Minister Christian Lindner (L) and Chancellor Olaf Scholz had reportedly been at loggerheads in recent weeks Germany's governing coalition has collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired a key minister and said he would call a vote of confidence in his government early next year. The chancellor said he had no trust in Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who heads the pro-business Free Democrats and has been part of the coalition along with Scholz's Social Democrats and the Greens. The crisis inside the coalition plunged Europe's largest economy into political chaos, hours after Donald Trump's US election victory triggered deep uncertainty about the future of the continent's economy and security. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called for common sense to prevail. \"This is no time for tactics and squabbling, but for reason and responsibility,\" he said. The so-called \"traffic-light\" coalition has governed Germany since 2021 and its collapse means Scholz's government no longer has a majority in parliament. The confidence vote could lead to early elections by March, although the opposition says a confidence vote should come next week, not next year. Steinmeier said he was prepared to dissolve parliament and call early elections if the chancellor lost a vote. Internal tensions had been bubbling for weeks before exploding into the open on Wednesday night. It was triggered by a row over the 2025 budget, with Germany now facing its second year without economic growth. \"This is not a good day for Germany and not a good day for Europe,\" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Greens. Olaf Scholz said his former finance minister had \"betrayed my confidence\" and had put the interests of his party base over those of the country. He added that Germany needed to show it could be relied upon by other countries, particularly following Trump's election success in the US. Lindner, who leads the Free Democrats or FDP, accused Scholz of \"leading Germany into a phase of uncertainty\". He had refused Scholz's demand to loosen the spending limit known as a \"debt brake\" that requires German governments to balance the budget. While two of his party colleagues also resigned from their cabinet posts, a third, Volker Wissing, said he had made a personal decision to stay on as transport minister and resign from his party. The head of the conservative Christian Democrats, who are well ahead in opinion polls, said there was no time to wait. \"We simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months,\" said Friedrich Merz. Reuters Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock from the Greens said they would not leave the coalition The so-called traffic-light coalition was formed after Scholz's Social Democrats narrowly defeated the conservatives in federal elections in September 2021. It was named after the individual red, yellow and green colours of three parties - Scholz's centre-left, the economically liberal FDP and environmentalist Greens - who all planned to spend big on their own individual core interest groups. However, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sent energy prices surging, and left Germany facing a increase in defence spending - and the cost of taking in 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees. Scholz and his Green partners want to tackle this by loosening the debt brake to allow more spending. Lindner wanted to pay for tax cuts by slashing welfare and social budgets and pushing back environmental targets. Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the party would not quit the government and that its ministers would remain in office. Scholz announced that a vote of confidence would be held in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, on 15 January. If MPs vote down the government, the country will head for fresh elections within weeks, instead of the scheduled date in September. However, the opposition could force Scholz out earlier if they can find a majority for an alternative chancellor. For now, Scholz will head a minority government comprised of his Social Democrats and the Greens - the second-largest party in the coalition. Without a parliamentary majority, Scholz's coalition will need to cobble together support for individual votes from other parties in order to pass laws and measures. Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz for support in passing budgetary measures to help Germany's ailing economy and boost military spending. Scholz has named Jörg Kukies as Christian Lindner's replacement as finance minister. Does Germany’s economy need more than a cup of coffee?

(Koosha Mahshid Falahi/Mizan News Agency via AP, File Read More By GEIR MOULSON Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — Germany ordered the closure of all three Iranian Consulates in the country on Thursday in response to the execution of Iranian German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd , who lived in the United States and was kidnapped in Dubai in 2020 by Iranian security forces. Sharmahd, 69, was put to death in Iran on Monday on terrorism charges, the Iranian judiciary said. That followed a 2023 trial that Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed as a sham. The decision to close the Iranian Consulates in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, announced by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, leaves the Islamic Republic with only its embassy in Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry had already summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires on Tuesday to protest against Sharmahd’s execution. German Ambassador Markus Potzel also protested to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, before being recalled to Berlin for consultations. Sharmahd was one of several Iranian dissidents abroad in recent years either tricked or kidnapped back to Iran as Tehran began lashing out after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers including Germany. RELATED COVERAGE Dubai’s Mall of the Emirates, home to a ski slope, to get $1.3 billion renovation Telegram’s CEO Durov in Dubai as France continues to investigate criminal activity on messaging app India wins Champions Trophy to extend white-ball dominance in men’s cricket Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of “disclosing classified information” on missile sites of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Iran pushed back against Germany’s protests. Araghchi wrote Tuesday on social network X that “a German passport does not provide impunity to anyone, let alone a terrorist criminal.” He accused Baerbock of “gaslighting” and wrote that “your government is accomplice in the ongoing Israeli genocide.” Germany is a staunch ally of Israel and has sharply criticized Iranian attacks on Israel as tensions spiral over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The closure of consulates, a diplomatic tool Germany seldom uses, signals a major downgrade to diplomatic relations Baerbock said were “already at more than a low point.” Last year, Berlin told Russia to close four of the five consulates it then had in Germany after Moscow set a limit for the number of staff at the German Embassy and related bodies in Russia. Iran’s government “knows above all the language of blackmail, threat and violence,” Baerbock said Thursday. “The latest comments by the Iranian foreign minister, in which he puts the cold-blooded murder of Jamshid Sharmahd in the context of German support for Israel, also speak for themselves.” “We repeatedly made unmistakably clear to Tehran that the execution of a German citizen would have serious consequences,” said Baerbock, adding that the cases of Germans held in Iran were a “central part” of a meeting she held with Araghchi in New York a month ago. She said Berlin will continue with “tireless work” to get an unspecified number of other Germans released. On Tuesday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that “the execution of a European citizen is seriously harming relations between Iran and the European Union.” “In view of this appalling development, the European Union will now consider targeted and significant measures,” he said in a statement, without elaborating. Baerbock noted that the EU imposed a new set of sanctions in mid-October and that she is pushing for Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to be put on a list of terror organizations. Sharmahd had been in Dubai in 2020, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company. He hoped to get a connecting flight despite the coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel. Sharmahd’s family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It’s unclear how the abduction happened, but tracking data showed that Sharmahd’s cellphone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a “complex operation.” The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. Germany expelled two Iranian diplomats last year over Sharmahd’s death sentence.",

(AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) Read More By GEIR MOULSON Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — A senior figure in the party whose departure from Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition three weeks ago put Germany on the road to an early election resigned Friday in a furor over an internal document discussing how the party could leave the government, a presentation whose title referred to “D-Day.” Bijan Djir-Sarai of the pro-business Free Democrats said he was quitting as general secretary, the official responsible for day-to-day political strategy and election planning. He said he was “taking the political responsibility in order to head off damage to my credibility and that of the Free Democrats.” The affair threatens to complicate further the Free Democrats’ campaign for an election in which polls already suggest they risk falling short of the 5% support needed to keep any seats in parliament. Scholz fired Christian Lindner , the Free Democrats’ leader, as finance minister on Nov. 6 as a long-running dispute in his three-party coalition over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy came to a head. The Free Democrats quit the government, leaving Scholz without a parliamentary majority . Scholz plans to call a confidence vote on Dec. 16. He is expected to lose, paving the way for an election on Feb. 23. Scholz and Lindner have traded blame for the collapse of the coalition, a combination of the chancellor’s center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the Free Democrats that had long been notorious for infighting. After the coalition collapsed, German media reported on an internal strategy document which they said set out plans by the Free Democrats to end the government. On Nov. 18, Djir-Sarai denied that the term “D-Day” — a reference to the Allied landings in France in 1944 that helped liberate Europe from Nazi Germany’s rule — had been used. But on Thursday, the Free Democrats released what they said was a working document drawn up by a lower-level official on questions of how the party could communicate a possible departure from the government. It is headed “D-Day process scenario and measures” and contains a reference to the “beginning of the open battle” as one stage in the communication effort. That language drew criticism even from within the party. Djir-Sarai said in his brief resignation statement that he had not known of the internal document at the time of his denial and had unwittingly given false information. He apologized. The party said the paper was first drawn up on Oct. 24 and was last updated on Nov. 5, the version it released. The lower-ranking official who the party said originally created the document, Carsten Reymann, also resigned. The general secretary of Scholz’s Social Democrats, Matthias Miersch, told German news agency dpa that Djir-Sarai’s resignation was a “sacrifice” meant to “divert responsibility” from Lindner. He said that “the decisive question remains: what role did Christian Lindner himself play in these plans?” Lindner said he hadn’t been aware of the “draft” document and wouldn’t have approved it, but it had been necessary to think through a possible departure from the coalition in light of its internal disputes and Germany’s “gridlock.” He said it was clear the Free Democrats would have had to leave without an “economic turnaround.” Anyone who makes a scandal out of that is only pursuing “power and party interests,” he said in a statement.",

An official from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees told Der Spiegel news magazine on Monday that the move was taken in light of the unclear and unpredictable political situation in Syria, which would place asylum decisions “on shaky ground”. No further decisions will be made on undecided asylum cases until further notice, which affects 47,770 applications by Syrian nationals. About 1.3 million people with Syrian roots live in Germany, the vast majority of whom arrived in 2015 and 2016 when then-Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed refugees fleeing Syria’s devastating war. However, in more recent years, Germany’s political climate has turned sharply against immigration. After a deadly knife attack in Solingen in August , committed by a Syrian national whose asylum case had been rejected, top government figures, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called for a deportation ban to Syria to be lifted in the case of criminals. Advertisement On Monday, senior members of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), argued for Germany to begin returning Syrians to their homeland en masse. The party is leading in polls before federal elections in February with campaign promises that include cracking down on irregular migration and increasing deportations. “I believe that there will be a reassessment of the situation in Syria and, therefore, also a reassessment of the question of who is allowed to seek protection in our country and who is not,” Jurgen Hardt, a CDU member of parliament, told the broadcaster ZDF. His party colleague Jens Spahn suggested Germany charter planes and offer 1,000 euros ($1,058) to each Syrian who returns home. Austria’s caretaker government on Monday also announced asylum proceedings for Syrians would be paused. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece, which is also home to tens of thousands of Syrians who fled the war, said in a statement: “A return to democratic normalcy must put an end to migrant flows from the long-suffering country and open the way to the safe return of Syrian refugees to their homes.” (Al Jazeera) Tareq Alaows, spokesman for the refugee advocacy group Pro Asyl, told Al Jazeera that the decision to stop processing asylum applications will leave people in limbo for months, jeopardise their integration into German society, and fuel a sense of fear and uncertainty. He stressed that the political situation is neither safe nor stable in Syria and action from the international community will be needed to create a path to democracy. Advertisement Spahn is engaging in a “cheap election campaign attempt to win votes on the right-wing fringe of society”, he said. Andrea Lindholz, a CDU speaker on home affairs, told the Rheinische Post newspaper that a lasting peace in Syria would mean many Syrians would lose their “need for protection and thus the basis of their right of residence in Germany”. Some figures within the Greens and Social Democratic Party (SPD), both of which have been in government since 2021, pushed back against making dramatic changes to the country’s asylum policy or making refugees the focus of the election campaign. “I warn against a populist debate with the tenor: ‘Now everyone has to go back immediately,’” the SPD’s Michael Roth told Der Spiegel. A spokesperson for Germany’s Ministry of the Interior told the Funke media group on Monday that it was not yet clear whether there would be movements of refugees into or out of Syria. The ministry will not yet assess whether the country is safe for refugees to return to or is a safe destination for deportations, the spokesperson said. Currently, Germany’s Federal Foreign Office does not consider Syria a safe country of return due to the war and a high risk of torture. On Sunday, Scholz and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock welcomed the end of al-Assad’s rule. “The people of Syria deserve a better future. They have been through horrible things. A whole generation has grown up in war, hardship and humanitarian deprivation, threatened by constant displacement,” Baerbock wrote on X. ‘We can live with dignity’ Over the weekend, thousands of Syrians took to the streets of cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Essen to celebrate the overthrow of al-Assad. In the Berlin districts of Neukolln and Kreuzberg, cars draped with the flag of the Syrian opposition circled neighbourhoods, honking their horns, while large crowds gathered to chant and sing late into the night. Advertisement Mohammad al Masri, one of the participants, had already tried to find flights from Berlin to Damascus. “My feelings are totally mixed up. I don’t even know if this is a dream or if it’s true,” said the 32-year-old, who has been living in Germany for almost a decade. Al Masri is from Daraa, known as the cradle of the Syrian revolution, and took part in some of the earliest protests against al-Assad’s rule in 2011. “Many people died just because they came out and called for freedom. Now, I can see it. … We are finally realising our dream,” he told Al Jazeera. “I can return home, finally meet my parents, meet my friends, sleep in my room again, experience the air, the atmosphere of my homeland.” After a decade in Turkiye, Roaa, 30, who is originally from the coastal city of Latakia, moved to Berlin, where she works as a software engineer. “Up until now, we were always worried about our future because we had no country that we can go back to. But now, we have hope, which is just amazing.” Her family is already planning to return. “We have hope because we, the Syrian people, love each other and love our country, but it’s going to be a lot of work to get Syria to a place where we can live with dignity, but that’s a very big first step already.” Rana, 34, who took part in protests against al-Assad in Damascus as a student in 2011, hopes to visit her hometown of Qamishli as soon as possible. In Berlin, she works with women’s shelters to help women and children who are at risk of violence. Advertisement “I will be happy to go back and do this to my country and to the women of Syria,” she told Al Jazeera. Like many other Syrians, she hopes al-Assad will eventually be held accountable for the many atrocities committed under his rule. “We want justice. We want him in the ICC [International Criminal Court] because he’s a war criminal, and we will get him, God willing.” Alaows said that once the initial euphoria subsides, Syrians in Germany will face questions about whether a long-term return to their homeland is possible. “I think it’s very good to talk about the issue of return in Syria because before that, we have to talk about reconstruction. We have to talk about building democracy in Syria and then we have to talk about justice in Syria before people return,” he said. “The situation is not necessarily safe for many people. … We have to wait and see which direction the country is going in.” Source : Al Jazeera",

Transgender, intersex and nonbinary people have welcomed the recognition, but conservatives are opposed. https://p.dw.com/p/4mFNB Nyke Slawik, one of only two openly transgender lawmakers in Germany, has hailed the law as a historic reform of international significance Image: Thomas Trutschel/photothek.de/picture alliance Advertisement Starting Friday, people aged 18 and older will be able to change official records to alter their names and genders or have the gender marker removed altogether, under Germany's new Self-Determination Act. There is a mandatory three-month wait between applying and making a personal declaration, but the requirement for two psychiatric assessments and a court hearing have been scrapped. Minors — over the age of 14 — can do so with parental approval, or seek legal recourse. Parents can act on behalf of younger children, but the child needs to be present at the register office and give their assent. This is a purely bureaucratic procedure with no medical implications. Nyke Slawik, a German parliamentarian and transgender woman who helped negotiate the bill for the Green Party, hailed the law as a historic reform of international significance. \"It's a sign of hope in times where right-wing populist voices are getting louder again and where there is unfortunately a rollback in many countries in terms of the rights of queer people,\" she told DW. More accessible, less costly, far less intrusive Kalle Hümpfner, policy officer for the German Trans* Association (BVT), welcomed the fact that gender self-recognition will now be much more accessible and less costly. Hümpfner stressed that the new law will also make the process far less intrusive. \"In the assessments, people were forced to divulge a lot of very personal information — information that was shared with the court. There have been many awful reports of people having to talk about their sexual preferences, about their masturbation practices, or their underwear choices,\" Hümpfner said. Some 1,200 people in Berlin, with its thriving LGBTQI+ community , have submitted applications to date, according to the German press agency dpa. The Catholic news agency KNA has reported a similar level of interest in other major cities.

He said the move brought Germany back into line with international human rights law and European developments of the last 10 years. It is now the 12th country in Europe to introduce legal self-determination legislation. \"Let's face it, it's an issue affecting a small number of people in a very personal way and respecting their choices doesn't harm anyone else, but it does uphold the core values of dignity and freedom that we all share,\" he said. Köhler warned that many other countries in Europe are introducing bans on legal and medical transition, including in Georgia and Russia. Making lives of a marginalized minority easier The changes make the practical daily lives of transgender, inter-sex, and nonbinary people much easier, as there is no longer a potential mismatch between appearance and official paperwork, which can make traveling abroad prohibitive or even just paying by credit card a serious headache. Once someone has applied to change their gender and first name, no further applications can be made for a minimum of 12 months. Right-wing populists have suggested the new law would lead to people changing their gender marker every year. Altering a birth certificate generates a huge volume of follow-through bureaucracy in changing official documents, from driving licenses to school exam certificates. \"It's an enormous amount of work to make your documents match and no one does that just for fun,\" said Hümpfner of the German Trans* Association. German Bundeswehr's first transgender commander To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Inclusivity and gender politics have become sensitive topics in Germany. Germany's center-left government of Social Democrats (SPD) , Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) took over in late 2021 with a pledge to progress and modernize the government, and included the change to the law in their coalition treaty. It was opposed by the largest opposition bloc, the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) and also by the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) . The new Self-Determination law was passed in April 2024 after a hotly contested debate in which a number of restrictions were added. 'Orchestrated attack against democracy, equality, diversity' Hümpfner expressed regret that anxiety and fear of abuse had framed the debate — with transgender people repeatedly cast in the role of potential perpetrators. \"Time and time again during the entire legislative process, it was forgotten that this is about the basic rights of a marginalized and still very disadvantaged group,\" said Hümpfner. Changes to the draft law included appearing to give business owners the right to decide whether or not to refuse individuals access to their premises on the basis of their gender. \"There was a lot of discussion about women's saunas. Our experience is that many transwomen rarely or never go into saunas because being in these places and being stared at a lot because of their physicality is regarded as unpleasant,\" said Hümpfner. Another concern raised during discussions surrounding the passage of the bill was about the possibility of transwomen using women's shelters. The Association of Women's Shelters (FHK) told the German newspaper Tagesspiegel this was baseless. \"We do not know of a single case from our membership of transgender women misusing a safe house or becoming violent there — and that although transwomen have been regularly using safe houses for many years and finding protection in them without great ado,\" said the FHK. How Berlin became 'home' to trans people To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Köhler also argued that the way the debate had been steered had poisoned public discourse and polarized the population, adding that people in the trans community were experiencing a rise in antagonism and harassment as a result. \"We're seeing an orchestrated attack against democracy, against equality, against the diversity in our society. And it's deliberate and it's orchestrated and it's heavily financed,\" said Köhler. He said trans people were easy targets because they made up such a small minority and so few people had personal contact with them. Women's fears being instrumentalized Beate von Miquel, the chair of the National Council of German Women's Organizations (DF) and a gender researcher, told DW that the issue was being politically instrumentalized and had become part of a culture war by far-right groups not known for their advocacy of women's rights. \"It is really bitter for the women's movement that this has become a very divisive issue. We should not allow ourselves to be divided,\" she said. Von Miquel, whose umbrella organization represents 60 women's associations and groups, warned that the trans community and women's organizations should not be played off against one another. \"There is concern that the category woman or women will disappear and that it won't be about women anymore,\" said Miquel. \"We will stay the German Women's Council. But there must be more freedom and diversity and individuality, there is more than one way of living gender and being a woman.\" Edited by: Rina Goldenberg While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The commentary piece in German was launched online on Saturday before being published on Sunday in the flagship paper of the Axel Springer media group, which also owns the US politics news site Politico. Musk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD’s extremist bent, and the essay expands on his post on his social media platform, X, on which he last week claimed that “only the AfD can save Germany”. Maga v Musk: Trump camp divided in bitter fight over immigration policy Read more Translated, Musk’s piece said: “The portrayal of the AfD as rightwing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021. Shortly after the piece was published online, the editor of the opinion section, Eva Marie Kogel, used the US tech mogul’s own platform to post on X that she had submitted her resignation. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion department at Welt and Wams. Today a text by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. Yesterday I submitted my resignation after printing,” she posted. View image in fullscreen Alice Weidel of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party speaks at the Bundestag on 16 December 2024 in Berlin. Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images She included a link to the Musk commentary article. The AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance and, like incoming president Donald Trump in relation to the US, is calling for mass deportations from Germany. Earlier in December, Musk not only posted in favor of AfD but the party’s hard line on immigration appeared to resonate with the incoming US vice-president, JD Vance, MSNBC reported . Senior Welt Group figures weighed in on Saturday. “Democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of expression. This includes dealing with polarising positions and classifying them journalistically,” the newspaper’s editor-in-chief designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, and Ulf Poschardt, who takes over as publisher on 1 January, told Reuters. They said discussion about Musk’s piece, which had about 340 comments several hours after it was published, was “very revealing”. Underneath Musk’s commentary, the newspaper published a response by Burgard. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally false,” he wrote, referencing the AfD’s desire to leave the European Union and seek rapprochement with Russia as well as appease China. Musk and Weidel both later posted a link to the article on X . The AfD backing from Musk, who also defended his right to weigh in on German politics due to his “significant investments”, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed late this fall. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority, but Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level.

Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy . Steinmeier said he made the decision because it was clear after consultation with party leaders that there was no agreement among Germany’s political parties on a majority for a new government in the current parliament. “It is precisely in difficult times like these that stability requires a government capable of taking action and a reliable majority in parliament,” he said as he made the announcement in Berlin. “Therefore I am convinced that for the good of our country new elections are the right way.” Since the post-World War II constitution doesn’t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Leaders of several major parties agreed earlier on the election date of Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. RELATED COVERAGE A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Russia claims its deadly attack on Ukraine’s Sumy targeted military forces as condemnation grows Steinmeier warned about outside interference in the poll, saying it is “a danger to democracy, whether it is covert, as was evidently the case recently in the Romanian elections, or open and blatant, as is currently being practiced particularly intensively on platform X.” A top Romanian court annulled the first round of the country’s presidential election, days after allegations emerged that Russia ran a coordinated online campaign to promote the far-right outsider who won the first round. The campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz’s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz’s government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany’s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. It’s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany’s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.",

(AP Photo/Sebastian Gollnow, Pool, File) Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — German lawmakers on Thursday approved legislation designed to protect the country’s highest court against possible future manipulation or obstruction by authoritarian or extremist politicians. Officials have cited experiences in Poland, Hungary and elsewhere as illustrating the need to bolster the Federal Constitutional Court. The measure was drawn up by the three parties in the governing coalition that collapsed last month and the mainstream conservative opposition. In what is expected to be one of its last sessions before it is dissolved ahead of an early election in February, parliament’s lower house, or Bundestag, backed the plan by 600 votes to 69. The legislation is set to anchor the court’s ground rules in the constitution. That means a two-thirds parliamentary majority would be required to change them in the future, rather than a simple majority. “We see when we look abroad that, when autocrats come to power, they almost always first turn against the effectiveness and independence of justice,” Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told lawmakers. She named no countries, but backers have pointed to Poland in particular as a cautionary tale. That country’s former nationalist conservative government moved to establish control over the Constitutional Tribunal . RELATED COVERAGE Pope Francis was a source of controversy and spiritual guidance in his Argentine homeland Polish conservatives use a patriotic celebration to rally behind their presidential candidate Poland’s divisions on display as presidential candidates bicker in a live TV debate Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court, based in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe, is frequently called on to act as the ultimate arbiter over policy. It has two panels of eight judges each, who serve a single 12-year term. Those requirements are to be anchored in the constitution, as are the upper age limit of 68 for justices and other rules. The far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has been polling at up to 20% in recent surveys, argues that mainstream parties are simply trying to cement their own influence over the court. Half of its justices are elected by the Bundestag and the other half by parliament’s upper house, which represents Germany’s 16 state governments. Candidates are proposed by political parties and need a two-thirds majority to be elected, which is meant to ensure balance and effectively rules out highly polarizing figures. The reform also includes a workaround in the case of “obstructive minorities” blocking the election of justices. That would enable the Bundestag to elect judges if the upper house fails to, or vice versa.",

        "text": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz loses  confidence vote 16 December 2024 Share Save Damien McGuinness BBC News Reporting from Berlin Share Save Reuters Olaf Scholz has been Germany's chancellor since 2021 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February. Scholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes. It comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration. Ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign. Losing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted. Thanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled. There were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained. Since Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November , he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government. Given Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate. Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government. Opening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts. 'Kamikaze' move Scholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections. The process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era. This vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schröder deployed on two occasions. However, there is a deeper problem within German politics. On the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects. That was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt. Lindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying. Germany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical. In 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%. In 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%. Germany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart Germany plans February election after coalition collapse The AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors. The bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition. That was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals. Rather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties. Another new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand leader, who joined the East German Communist party shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited. They refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens. That leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet. Whatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over. Europe Germany Olaf Scholz",

The man was reportedly tackled by cops as he got off the train. Police did not provide any information on the suspect's identity other than saying he was between 20 to 30 years old. The station was closed for several hours, police said ( Image: AP) The regional interior minister branded the attack a \"horrible act against all humanity\". \"It is terrible,\" Suetterlin-Waack told German public broadcaster NDR. \"We are shocked and horrified that something like this has happened. \"For me it is clear that the horrible act is against all humanity\", she added, saying her \"thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims.\" Police are still investigating the motive behind the attack. The region's interior minister branded the attack \"horrible\" and \"against all humanity\" ( Image: Jonas Walzberg/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images) Train operator Deutsche Bahn expressed its condolences on Wednesday evening, saying that \"our deepest sympathy goes to the relatives of the victims. We wish those injured a speedy and complete recovery\". A similar incident in May last year left six injured after a knifeman lashed out on a passenger train near the western German city of Aachen. The suspect was detained by police while several were treated in hospital for their injuries. Herbert Reul, the NRW state interior minister, reportedly said six people were wounded, including the suspected attacker. The suspect struck passengers \"indiscriminately and arbitrarily,\" Reul said. \"Based on everything that [they] know so far,\" investigators believed the perpetrator's intent was to harm as many people as possible, Reul added. The attack occurred on a Friday morning on a regional passenger train. Medical staff rushed four passengers to the hospital, none of whom faced life-threatening injuries. Those injured in the attack had sustained wounds to their hands and cut wounds to their faces. Police said the 31-year-old suspect had been overpowered by a 60-year-old police officer who happened to be on the train, reports The Independent , along with two other passengers. The officer, who was not named, said: “I was on my way to work, that’s all I can say.” Reul told reporters the suspect was a 31-year-old man who was born in Iraq - though his citizenship remained unclear. In December, a girl was murdered with another left fighting for her life after being attacked by a man on their way to school in Illerkirchberg, a 4,700-inhabitant village in southern Germany. Emergency services raced to the town near Munich to find the pupils, aged 13 and 14, and took them to hospital , but the eldest of the pair couldn't be saved and was pronounced dead after admission. Cops earlier said both girls had \"serious injuries\" but refused to go into further detail. German daily newspaper Bild said the attack happened around 7.30am as the youngsters made their way to school. Horrified locals immediately contacted emergency services and the two girls were rushed to hospital by ambulance. The suspect is understood to have fled into a nearby building, which initial reports suggested may have been a refugee housing. Cops stormed the residence and arrested everyone inside. The prime suspect and two other individuals were taken to the police station and the innocent parties released, cops said.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Scholz accepts Christine Lambrecht's dismissal request Unclear who might succeed her; key decisions pending U.S. defense secretary to visit Berlin on Thursday BERLIN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht resigned from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government on Monday, the culmination of growing doubt about her ability to revive Germany's armed forces against the backdrop of the Ukraine war. Her decision dealt a blow to Scholz at a time when Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany's defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. Sign up here. The pressure to find a successor is mounting also because U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is expected in Berlin on Thursday and will attend a conference on Friday at the U.S. military base in Ramstein, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to discuss further support for Ukraine, including whether to send German-built battle tanks. Lambrecht asked Scholz to dismiss her, as formally required, and he has approved, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic (SPD)-led coalition government said. During a visit to arms manufacturer Hensoldt, Scholz thanked Lambrecht for her service and said he would act fast to replace her. \"I have a clear idea and it will be known very quickly for everyone how this should proceed,\" he told reporters. Citing government sources, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said a successor would be announced on Tuesday. Among the candidates mooted by German media are Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces Eva Hoegl, junior defence minister Siemtje Moeller, SPD party chief Lars Klingbeil and Labour Minister Hubertus Heil. Scholz has promised to staff his cabinet with equal numbers of men and women. If a man should succeed Lambrecht, this could result in further reshuffling. PERFORMANCE CRITICISED Lambrecht was blamed by critics for failing to get the German armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr, back in shape quickly, despite a 100-billion-euro ($108.11 billion) special fund being agreed for that purpose after Russia invaded Ukraine. Economy Minister Robert Habeck praised Lambrecht for her ambition to reform the Bundeswehr and said her decision would not have been taken lightly. \"It shows the kind of pressure she is under, but also how she is trying to keep the office from being damaged,\" Habeck said at an energy conference in Berlin. Lambrecht was most recently criticised by media and opposition figures for posting a New Year's message on social media in which she thanked servicemen and women, but struggled to be heard against background noise from firecrackers and seemingly mixed up the war in Ukraine with pleasant personal encounters. \"What kind of a year was 2022? It confronted us with many incredible challenges. There is a war raging in the middle of Europe. Associated with this were for me many special impressions, many encounters with interesting, great people,\" Lambrecht said in the video. Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of Germany's parliamentary defence committee and a member of Scholz's junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), called for her successor to be installed quickly. \"I now expect the Social Democrats to name a successor as soon as possible who is assertive towards the ministry, does not abuse the defence ministry for other political ambitions and, above all, brings with them an understanding and heart for the soldiers,\" she said in remarks carried by the Funke media group.

The man had been plotting to use cyanide and ricin to commit a \"serious act of violence\", North Rhine-Westphalia police said in a statement. They raided the man's Castrop-Rauxel residence, in the Ruhr region, but prosecutors said no poison was found. The suspect's brother was also arrested and the pair remain in custody. While they did not find poison, police did seize electronic devices from the residence. A Düsseldorf senior public prosecutor said the tip-off about the man came from a friendly foreign intelligence service. \"After an evaluation of the information, we came to the conclusion to issue a search warrant and carry it out as soon as possible,\" Holger Heming told reporters. Germany's Deutsche-Presse Agence (dpa) reported numerous emergency workers in protective suits attending the scene. The investigation is continuing and it was initially unclear how far the attack plans had progressed. Mr Heming said he would not speculate on the possible target of the suspected attack and that police would decide whether to issue an official arrest warrant at a later date. The charge of a \"serious act of violence endangering the state\" is punishable by a prison sentence of between six months and 10 years.

The joint announcement followed a phone call between Biden and Scholz and amounts to a step change in western military support for Ukraine , which has asked for up to 700 armoured vehicles to help force the Russians out. “The United States intends to supply Ukraine with Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and Germany intends to provide Ukraine with Marder infantry fighting vehicles,” the White House said in a statement on Thursday. Ukraine has repeatedly said it needs 600 to 700 infantry fighting vehicles plus 300 tanks from from the west in order to give its military a chance of breaking through the increasingly fortified Russian positions along the frontline. Until now, however, the US and Germany have been wary of supplying Ukraine with Nato-standard armour, because they feared it would be interpreted by Russia as escalatory. But the decision to supply western armoured vehicles is significant, even if both countries stopped short of sending tanks. Germany will also supply Ukraine with a Patriot air defence system, in addition to one promised by the US last month, the White House added. Both countries will train the Ukrainian military on the Marders and Bradleys, although it it was not immediately clear how many of each would be supplied. Scholz’s deputy spoke up in support. “This is a good decision,” said Robert Habeck, the German vice-chancellor and economy minister, whose department has to green-light weapons exports. “Since the start of the war we have continuously expanded our support in coordination with our partners. It is only logical that we also take this step. “Ukraine has the right to defend itself against the Russian attack, and we have the duty to help her.” View image in fullscreen Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk. Ukraine has long had its eye on western tanks to complement its reduced fleet of Soviet-designed T-64 and T-72s. Photograph: Reuters France said on Wednesday it was upping its military aid to Kyiv by supplying an unspecified number of AMX-10 RC light armoured vehicles capable, experts said, of scouting roles and supporting main battle tanks. Hours later Biden hinted the US was considering following with the Bradleys. Earlier on Thursday, senior German ministers indicated their country’s position was also evolving rapidly. Habeck, on a visit to the Norwegian capital, Oslo, said Germany’s position had never been “static” and that it would be influenced by France and the US’s willingness “to deliver lighter tanks”. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, made similar comments. “I have pointed out time and time again we work with our partners to see what kind of military support is required by Ukraine,” she said after a meeting with her British counterpart, James Cleverly, in London. Cleverly himself said tanks “might well be” part of the next phase of weapons transfers. On Wednesday night, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Paris’s decision sent “a clear signal to all our other partners: there is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with western-type tanks”. 0:36 'No rational reason': Zelenskiy criticises allies' failure to send 'western-style tanks' – video Ukraine has long had its eye on western tanks and armour to complement its reduced fleet of Soviet-designed T-64 and T-72 tanks and BMP infantry vehicles, after more than 10 months of fighting. Kyiv has received about 200 post-Soviet tanks from eastern European countries since the start of the war, but the available supply in Europe is now limited. To replenish its stocks and build up a fresh attacking force, Ukraine has sought to obtain Leopard 2 tanks, or US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, but its lobbying was unsuccessful last year. “Tanks are potentially decisive because there is no substitute if you want to attack enemy formations in defensive positions,” said Ben Barry, a former British army tank commander and land warfare analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. Russia has largely sought to dig in since abandoning its exposed position in Kherson on the west side of the Dnipro River in November, as it tries to consolidate its occupation of a swathe of territory roughly the size of Portugal in the east and south of Ukraine. A breakthrough, if it comes at all, is likely to require the combined use of tanks, heavy armour and infantry, replicating a standard offensive tactic that dates back to the second world war. “The effectiveness of infantry is doubled, even with just three or four tanks helping,” Barry added. France’s six-wheeled AMX-10 RC were first deployed in the 1980s and have been used in multiple operations, from Afghanistan to Mali. They are in the process of being phased out by Paris, however, making them an ideal gift for Ukraine. An aide to France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was “the first time that western-designed tanks are supplied to the Ukrainian armed forces” but experts said the AMX-10 RC was too lightly armoured to be considered a proper tank.

One company usually comprises 14 tanks. \"Today the Chancellor made a decision that no one took lightly.

Other allies, in Scandinavia for example, intend to go along with Germany in supplying their Leopard tanks to Kyiv, the magazine reported. In the longer term, more tanks could be restored to be fit for use, according to the magazine. U.S. officials told Reuters that Washington may soon drop its opposition to sending Abrams tanks to Ukraine, in a move intended to encourage Germany to follow. The Pentagon declined to comment on any coming announcements on the Abrams. It also declined to comment on whether Germany might green light deliveries of the Leopards. Defence \"Secretary (Lloyd) Austin did have very productive conversations with his German counterpart when he was in Germany\" for meetings last week, Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told a news conference.

Sharmahd, a German-Iranian national, was sentenced to death on charges of \"corruption on earth\", the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported on Tuesday. The verdict can be appealed. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that the consulate was working to provide further support to the dual national and was in touch with the man's relatives. \"We will continue to provide consular support to the extent that this is possible. I have already explained how difficult this is in Iran,\" the spokesperson said. \"This is a first instance verdict and we will follow the progress of the situation,\" he added. Iran accuses Sharmahd, who also has U.S. residency, of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. Tensions between Iran and the West have intensified in recent months, pushing already-stalled efforts to revive talks on Tehran's nuclear programme further into the background. Germany has been a vocal backer of European Union sanctions against Iran over its crackdown on protesters in the country.

Ukrainian officials have been calling on Western allies to supply them with the modern German-made tanks for months - but Berlin has so far held back from sending them, or allowing other NATO countries to do so. Sign up here. Asked what would happen if Poland went ahead and sent its Leopard 2 tanks without German approval, Annalena Baerbock said on France's LCI TV: \"For the moment the question has not been asked, but if we were asked we would not stand in the way.\" Her remarks appeared to go further than German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's comments at a summit in Paris earlier on Sunday that all decisions on weapons deliveries would be made in coordination with allies including the United States. Germany has been under heavy pressure to let Leopards go to Ukraine. But Scholz's Social Democrat party is traditionally sceptical of military involvements and wary of sudden moves that could cause Moscow to further escalate. German defense minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that he expected a decision soon on the tanks, though he kept up a note of caution. Pistorius told ARD TV that Germany would not make a hasty decision because the government had many factors to consider, including consequences at home for the security of the German population. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated his long-standing plea for the tanks at his Sunday meeting with former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who was visiting Kyiv.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab \"We need more weapons: tanks, aircraft, long-range missiles,\" Zelenskiy said, according to a statement on his website. Ukraine says the heavily armoured Western battle tanks would give the Ukrainian ground troops more mobility and protection ahead of a new Russian offensive which Kyiv expects in the near future. It would also help Ukraine retake some of the territory that has fallen to Russia. After the Paris summit, Scholz told a news conference that all weapons deliveries to Ukraine so far had taken place in close coordination with Western partners. \"We will do that in the future,\" he said. Speaking at the same news conference, French President Emmanuel Macron said he did not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks to Ukraine. Macron said that sending tanks must not escalate the situation, must take into account the time to train Ukrainians to be effective, and must not endanger France's own security. \"Regarding the Leclercs, I asked the Army minister to work on it, but nothing has been ruled out,\" Macron said, adding that the move would have to be coordinated with allies such as Germany in the coming days and weeks. German sources have told Reuters they would allow German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine to help its defence against Russia if the United States agrees to send its own tanks. But U.S. officials have said President Joe Biden's administration is not poised to send its own tanks, including the M1 Abrams. The Kremlin's spokesman said on Friday that Western countries supplying additional tanks to Ukraine would not change the course of the conflict and that they would add to the problems of the Ukrainian people.

They say the gunman acted alone in Thursday's attack, and later took his own life. His motives are unknown. The suspect, named only as Philipp F, is said to have had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member. Video has emerged appearing to show him firing through a window of the hall. At a briefing on Friday, the police said four men and two women were shot dead. All the dead were German nationals. Eight people were injured, four seriously. A Ugandan and a Ukrainian were among those hurt. A woman who was seven months pregnant was shot - killing her unborn baby. The mother survived. The first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) on Thursday, to report that shots had been fired in the building on Deelböge street, Gross Borstel district, the police said. Officers were on site four minutes later, and they were almost immediately joined by special forces. The officers had to break windows to enter the building where about 50 people had gathered. The suspect - described as 35-year-old \"sports shooter\" who had a gun licence - had fled to the first floor. His \"lifeless body\" was found shortly afterwards. He had managed to shoot nine magazines of ammunition, and 20 more were found in his backpack. German Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers had saved many lives. He also described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history. Police confirmed that they had previously received an anonymous tip-off that raised concerns about the perpetrator's mental health. Officers had visited him after the tip-off - but did not have enough grounds to take away his gun at the time. Gregor Miesbach, who filmed the gunman shooting through a first-floor window, told the Bild newspaper: \"I didn't realise what was happening. I was filming with my phone, and only realised through the zoom that someone was shooting at Jehovah's Witnesses. \"I heard loud gunshots... I saw a man with a firearm shooting through a window and filmed it,\" he said. Lara Bauch, a 23-year-old student who lives nearby, told the DPA news agency that \"there were about four bursts of gunfire - several shots were fired in each burst - with gaps lasting roughly 20 seconds to a minute\". She said that from her window she could see a person frantically running from the ground floor to the first floor. \"The man was wearing dark clothing and moving fast,\" she added. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, on Thursday evening telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\". Local residents were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances. Reuters Forensic experts worked at the scene through the night Reuters A bomb disposal unit was also deployed The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described it as a \"brutal act of violence\", saying his thoughts were with the victims and their relatives. In a statement, the Jehovah's Witness community in Germany said it was \"deeply saddened by the horrific attack on its members at the Kingdom Hall in Hamburg after a religious service\". Forensic experts in white suits worked through the night inside the brightly lit interior of the meeting house. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members of the organisation. Jehovah's Witnesses are probably best known for their door-to-door evangelism; witnessing from house to house and offering Bible literature. Although Christian-based, the group believes that the traditional Christian Churches have deviated from the true teachings of the Bible, and do not work in full harmony with God. Germany has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. In 2021, there were around one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters. After mass arrests were made last December in relation to a suspected plot to overthrow the government, the German authorities are planning to tighten the country's gun laws even further.

No arrests were announced, and German dpa news agency said police were seeking one suspect. The motive of the attack was not immediately clear. The incident occurred in the old city of Duisburg and police asked residents to stay at home and avoid the area. They said a large number of officers were at the scene of the attack, right across from the city hall. Three people were in life-threatening condition, and one person was less severely injured, Duisburg police tweeted. “According to current information, one person has injured other people with an object” at a gym, they tweeted earlier. Police said that a “stabbing or cutting weapon” was used in the attack, but did not give any further details. The attacker appeared to still be on the loose, dpa reported. “There has been no arrest,” police told dpa, adding that a hunt was under way for the attacker. Investigators also said it was too early to talk about a possible motive behind the attack. Several victims were taken to a hospital, while investigators searched the gym, dpa reported. Several witnesses to the attack, some still with their sports bags, were taken to a nearby restaurant so police could question them. Helicopters were hovering above the gym and psychologists were brought in to help shocked witnesses. Police said they received the first emergency calls at about 5.40pm local time. Duisburg has about 500,000 residents and is located at the junction of the Rhine and Ruhr rivers. It used to be famous for its coal mining and steel production, but has in recent decades been plagued by high unemployment and poverty.

My thoughts are with the injured,” Ms Bas tweeted. “I hope that the emergency services will soon be able to clear up the threatening situation.” Last month, a gunman stormed a service at his former Jehovah’s Witness hall in the northern Germany city of Hamburg, killing six people before taking his own life after police arrived.

        "text": "Germany falls into recession as inflation hits economy 25 May 2023 Share Save Lucy Hooker Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Persistent inflation has helped push Germany into recession in the first three months of the year, an upgrade to growth data shows. Europe's largest economy was also badly affected when Russian gas supplies dried up after the invasion of Ukraine, analysts said. The economy contracted by 0.3% between January and March, the statistics office said. That followed a 0.5% contraction in the last three months of last year. A country is deemed to be in recession when its economy shrinks for two consecutive three-month periods, or quarters. \"Under the weight of immense inflation, the German consumer has fallen to his knees, dragging the entire economy down with him,\" said Andreas Scheuerle, an analyst at DekaBank. Germany's inflation rate stood at 7.2% in April, above the euro area's average but below the UK's 8.7%. Higher prices have weighed on household spending on things such as food, clothing and furniture. Industrial orders are also weaker, reflecting the impact of higher energy prices on businesses. \"The persistence of high price increases continued to be a burden on the German economy at the start of the year,\" the federal statistics agency Destatis said in a statement . Which European nations are winning the heat pump race? Germans split as last nuclear plants are shut down Why is UK inflation higher than US and Germany? Originally, the agency had estimated zero growth for the first quarter of this year, suggesting Germany would side-step a recession. However, the revised figures showed household spending was 1.2% lower than in the previous quarter. Government spending was 4.9% lower, and car sales also fell after government grants for electric and hybrid cars were scaled back. The recession was less severe than some had predicted, given Germany's heavy reliance on Russian energy. A mild winter and the reopening of China's economy, helped ease the impact of higher energy prices. Private sector investment and exports rose, but that was not enough to get Germany out of the \"danger zone\" for recession, analysts said. \"The early indicators suggest that things will continue to be similarly weak in the second quarter [of 2023],\" said LBBW bank analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch. However, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects the economy to grow modestly in the April to June quarter, with a rebound in industry offsetting stagnating consumer spending. The IMF has predicted that Germany will be the weakest of the world's advanced economies, shrinking 0.1% this year, after it upgraded its forecast for the UK from minus 0.3% to growth of 0.4% .

Jens Schlueter/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Christopher F. Schuetze Reporting from Dresden, Germany May 31, 2023 Updated 6:36 p.m. ET A German court on Wednesday convicted a 28-year-old woman and three accomplices of organizing and carrying out brutal attacks against people they perceived to be neo-Nazis, in what experts have described as an uncommon case of left-wing extremist violence in the country. The woman, who in accordance with Germany’s strict privacy laws was identified only as Lina E., was sentenced to five years and three months in prison by a court in Dresden, in eastern Germany for membership in a criminal association, several counts of assault, causing damage to property, as well as other lesser charges. Three other members of the group — Lennart A., 28; Jannis R., 37; and Philipp M., 28 — received prison sentences ranging from two years and five months to three years and two months for charges including membership or support of a criminal gang, assault and abetting assault. Nancy Faeser, the country’s interior minister, said in a statement after the verdict that “in a democratic constitutional state, there must be no room for vigilante justice.” She added, “No objective justifies political violence.” The judge, Hans Schlüter-Staats, announced that Lina E. would be released from jail until possible appeals were played out and she had to start her prison sentence. Supporters in the courtroom, who had protested so loudly when the initial sentence was announced that the judge called a 15-minute recess, rejoiced that she would be free for a time. The three co-defendants were not in custody during the trial. Hours after the verdict was announced, there were clashes, some violent, between left-wing protesters and the police in Berlin ; Leipzig , where Lina E. lived; and other cities. Far-left activists also had announced that demonstrations would be held in Leipzig on Saturday. The case has been widely watched in Germany, where the authorities have long been accused of failing to prosecute or slow-walking the prosecution of figures tied to right-wing attacks, and especially in the east of the country, where the dominance of far-right groups has long overshadowed a smaller and apparently also violence-prone far-left scene. The trial also forced progressives to consider how far the fight against right-wing extremism should go, experts say. At the heart of the case were six attacks that prosecutors said the loose, nameless group had planned and carried out from 2018 to 2020. Among those beaten by the masked attackers was a right-wing extremist and martial-arts fighter who himself is in jail awaiting trial for his role leading a violent right-wing group; men returning from a far-right rally in Dresden; and a man wearing a hat from a right-wing clothing company, who later denied being a neo-Nazi. Some of the victims ended up in the hospital with broken bones. One testified that he was traumatized for life. There were 13 known victims in all, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said that Lina E. had led the group with her partner, who is still wanted by the authorities.

Ronald Wittek/EPA, via Shutterstock Investigators homed in on Lina E., who was then a student, after a second attack on the extremist martial-arts fighter in 2019. After the attack, the police stopped a speeding VW Golf with stolen plates; inside, they found the original plates, which showed that it was registered to Lina E.’s mother. From there, the police connected Lina E. to other attacks through witness testimony, video, DNA evidence and a photo of a crime scene found in a camera at her home. She was arrested in November 2020 at her home in Leipzig, in Saxony State in northeastern Germany, and charged with causing bodily harm and organizing a criminal gang. The case had captured the public’s imagination ever since she stepped off a police helicopter surrounded by heavily armed officers for her arraignment in Karlsruhe, the seat of Germany’s national prosecutors. She was vilified as a violent criminal by some and celebrated as a vigilante by others. “Free Lina E.” graffiti popped up in the one neighborhood of Leipzig. Some stores put out collection boxes to help her with defense costs. Hajo Funke, an expert on the far right, said the violence the left-wing group was accused of was unusual in eastern Germany, where the far right tended to be the source of brutality in public spaces. “Especially in Saxony, but also in other states in the east, the far right has a tactical dominance against left-wing actors and even democratic-minded citizens in daily situations,” Mr. Funke said. “If you are active doing something they don’t like, you are actually in danger.” In 2022, the German police attributed 23,493 registered crimes to the far right in the country. In the same year, 6,976 crimes were attributed to the far left, the lowest number in a decade. Because of its Nazi past, Germany has strict laws to fight fascism, banning Nazi symbols and speech. Shortly after the country’s reunification three decades ago, neo-Nazis unleashed a wave of violence on migrants, targeting asylum centers, especially in the east. Although the violence has subsided, the political fortunes of the right have grown. Last year, a far-right group was accused of plotting to overthrow the government . A parliamentary committee report published in 2013 found that Germany’s police and security services had deeply rooted prejudices that had allowed a neo-Nazi cell to carry out violent attacks — killings, robberies and bombings — against immigrants for more than a decade without being detected.

Filip Singer/EPA, via Shutterstock The trial of Lina E. and her group unfolded over nearly 100 days under high security.The prosecutors’ star witness was a kindergarten teacher and former associate of the group, Johannes D., 30, who testified about the group’s training and organization, and admitted being present for at least one attack as a stakeout. (A court gave him a suspended sentence for his part in the crime.) On the final day of the trial this month, Lina. E. did not insist on her innocence or explain her motives, but thanked her family and those who had written to her and visited her in jail. Even amid calls for protests, Alexander Deycke, who studies the far left at the University of Göttingen, said that within the left-wing community, the verdict might lead to soul-searching. “It’s a fundamental contradiction when you want a violence-free, domination-free society on the one hand, but you are unwilling to exclude violence on the way to getting there,” he said. Dirk Münster, a police officer who runs the state’s special unit on far-left crimes and oversaw the investigation of Lina E.’s group, said that a clear guilty verdict was important. “It has a signaling effect,” he said before the verdict. “We have to recognize that we have a real problem and not one that can be discussed away.” Many Germans, he said, refused to see left-wing violence as a problem because they generally sympathized with the fight against fascism. “We are not fighting against left-wing beliefs,” he said. “We are working against actual criminal violence.” Christopher F.

Friedrich Merz’s remarks triggered cries of protest from his own party and raised concerns about the firewall between German conservatives and the far right. In an interview with the state broadcaster ZDF on Sunday, Merz categorically ruled out joining a coalition with the AfD at a national level but said such a taboo should not apply to local politics. “Of course we are obliged to accept democratic votes,” Merz said. “And if the head of a district authority or a mayor is voted in who belongs to the AfD, then of course you find ways to continue to work in that town.” German politicians from across the spectrum – including within Merz’s own camp – reacted with outrage, leading the CDU leader to backpedal. “To clarify it once again, and I never said it differently: the CDU resolution is valid. There will be no CDU cooperation on the local level with the AfD,” Merz tweeted on Monday. Fears however lingered that Merz could in future be open to breaching a fundamental taboo in Germany’s politics since the second world war. The AfD won its first German district council in the eastern state of Thuringia last month, and secured its first mayoral post, in Saxony-Anhalt, at the start of July. Recent polls show the rightwing populist outfit at 20-22% of the vote, behind the CDU on 26-28% – both ahead of the three centre-left, green and liberal parties that form Germany’s government. The CDU mayor of Berlin, Kai Wegner, strongly distanced himself from the party leader’s comments on Sunday evening. “What cooperation is there to be had?” Wegner said in a tweet. “The CDU cannot, does not want and won’t work with a party whose business model is hatred, division and exclusion.” The MP Norbert Röttgen, who ran against Merz for the party leadership, warned on Sunday that the AfD “knowingly admits and invites extremist forces into the party” and called it unacceptable for the CDU to work with it “on any level”. How Spain’s conservatives joined forces with far-right Vox Read more Across Europe , several conservative parties have in recent years retreated from a prohibitive stance on working with the far right. In Sweden, the nationalist Sweden Democrats function as a support party for the centre-right government, while Spain’s conservative Partido Popular has formed regional coalition governments with the far-right Vox, and could attempt to form a power-sharing pact after Sunday’s national vote. In Germany, the firewall between the CDU and AfD was fiercely protected under the leadership of Angela Merkel. In 2020, her designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, stepped down as party leader when she appeared to lack authority to stop Christian Democrat delegates in Thuringia from voting with the AfD to oust the state’s leftwing premier . Sharing news of Merz’s earlier comments in a tweet, the co-leader of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla, appeared to hail them as the start of the end of the firewall stance that stopped the centre-right from cooperating or deliberately voting with the far right. “Together we will tear down this wall in the states and at federal level,” Chrupalla said. Merz’s interview followed a series of comments that seemed to relax the CDU’s strict condemnation of the AfD, which was founded on an anti-euro ticket in 2013 but has progressively tacked harder right since. After the AfD’s district council triumph last month, Merz designated the governing Green party and not the far right as the CDU’s “main enemy”, and on Friday he described his own party as the “Alternative für Deutschland of substance”.

German gross domestic product stagnated in the second quarter after declining in both of the two previous quarters as the country struggled with high energy prices, rising borrowing costs and weakness in China, which has been a key trading partner. The International Monetary Fund forecast last month that Germany would be the globe’s only major economy to shrink this year, even with feeble economic growth around the world amid rising interest rates and the threat of growing inflation. A monthly report Monday from the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, indicated that the picture isn’t about to improve. “In the third quarter of 2023, German economic output will probably remain largely unchanged again,” it wrote. The bank said that, while private spending should continue to recover thanks to stable employment, significant pay increases and declining inflation, industrial production is likely to remain weak for the time being because of declining foreign demand, and high financing costs are expected to continue weighing on investment.",

The officer, who has been identified only as 1st Lt. Franco A. in line with German privacy rules, was convicted by the Frankfurt state court in July 2022 of preparing a serious crime meant to endanger the state, fraud and violations of weapons laws. The court, which found that he had right-wing extremist views, sentenced him to 5 1/2 years in prison. The Federal Court of Justice said in a statement that judges rejected his appeal in an Aug. 8 decision, finding that it was “clearly unfounded” and no legal errors had been made to his detriment. The German officer drew the attention of authorities after he was arrested in February 2017 while going to retrieve a pistol he had stashed in a Vienna airport bathroom. He was freed, but Austrian authorities informed Germany. The investigation was triggered when his fingerprint matched one he had given to register as an asylum-seeker. Franco A. was accused of plotting to kill prominent politicians and blame the attack on refugees. Prosecutors alleged that his targets included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas and the Jewish head of an anti-racism organization.

The legislation passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his ministers still requires approval from the lower house of parliament, where the socially liberal three-party coalition has a comfortable majority. It could take effect in January, depending on how quickly that happens. The government plans to make people eligible for citizenship after five years in Germany, or three in case of “special integration accomplishments,” rather than eight or six years at present. German-born children would automatically become citizens if one parent has been a legal resident for five years, down from eight years now. Restrictions on holding dual citizenship will also be dropped. In principle, most people from countries other than European Union members and Switzerland now have to give up their previous nationality when they gain German citizenship, though there are some exemptions.

She said the reform follows years of debates that “unfortunately were often marked by exclusion, resentment and cheap propaganda,” and that applicants for citizenship “will no longer be forced to give up part of their identity.” Faeser also linked the plan to Germany’s quest to attract more skilled workers to the country, which has Europe’s biggest economy, and address labor shortages in a growing number of professions. “We are in the middle of a worldwide competition for the best people,” she said, adding that Germany could only attract them “if they can fully become part of our society in the foreseeable future, with all democratic rights” enjoyed by German nationals. Applicants will in most cases be required to prove that they can support themselves and their family without receiving state benefits. The new legislation will specify that “antisemitic, racist or other inhumanly motivated actions” rule out naturalization. The government says that 14% of the population, more than 12 million of the country’s 84.4 million inhabitants , doesn’t have German citizenship and that about 5.3 million of those have lived in Germany for at least a decade. It says that the naturalization rate in Germany is well below the EU average. Last year, about 168,500 people were granted German citizenship. That was the highest figure since 2002 , boosted by a large increase in the number of Syrian citizens who arrived in the past decade being naturalized, but still only a fraction of long-term residents. “There can be no better incentive for successful integration” than the prospect of quicker naturalization, Faeser argued. The center-right opposition Union bloc contends that it would have the opposite effect. Senior conservative lawmaker Andrea Lindholz said that the government “is sending completely the wrong signals” at a time when local authorities are struggling to cope with large numbers of new migrants, and that its priority should be the reduction of “irregular immigration.” The Union objects to reducing the time people have to wait and to removing restrictions on dual citizenship. “Integration takes time, and is more than work and language,” Lindholz said.",

This was despite all other parties urging their supporters to vote for the other candidate. https://p.dw.com/p/4T1vM Sonneberg is one of the smallest districts in Germany, but the vote has attracted national interest Image: Martin Schutt/dpa/picture alliance Advertisement For the first time in Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has won a district council election, administrators announced on Sunday (25.6.2023). Voters in the eastern German town of Sonneberg — located in former East Germany GDR — elected AfD candidate Robert Sesselmann at the expense of incumbent district administrator Jürgen Köpper of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) . In the runoff election in the Thuringian district of Sonneberg, Sesselmann won 52.8% of the vote, earning him the necessary absolute majority, according to election officials. The area of some 57,000 people is one of the smallest districts in Germany. Still, the AfD victory is a major breakthrough for the far-right party, whose Thuringia branch has been classified as far-right extremist by Germany's domestic intelligence service. All mainstream parties regularly vow to not enter coalition governments with the AfD. The AfD's leader in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, welcomed the win and said it demonstrates the party's recent momentum. \"And then we'll prepare for the state elections in the east, where we can really create a political earthquake,\" he said, referring to state parliament elections in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia, and Brandenburg. Robert Sesselmann (center) was joined by the party's leader in Thuringia, Björn Höcke (left), and national AfD chairman Tino Chrupalla (right) Image: Jacob Schröter/IMAGO How did AfD's opponents react? Thuringia's Interior Minister Georg Maier, who belongs to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) , described the outcome as \"an alarm signal for all democratic forces.\" He called for party-political interests to be set aside and a joint effort to defend democracy. The President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said although not every AfD voter holds extreme right-wing views, the party itself does. \"This is a watershed that this country's democratic political forces cannot simply accept,\" he told the RND media network. The International Auschwitz Committee also expressed horror. \"Today is a sad day for the Sonneberg district, for Germany, and for democracy,\" Executive Vice President Christoph Heubner said. \"A majority of voters have obviously said goodbye to democracy and deliberately opted for an extreme right-wing party of destruction dominated by a Nazi [ Björn Höcke. eds ].\" What was at stake? Earlier this month, the first round of elections in the runoff vote saw Sesselmann fall short of outright victory by only a few percentage points. Such a strong showing for an AfD candidate raised the alarm nationally, with all other main political parties — the SPD, the Greens, the neoliberal FDP, and the socialist Left Party — backing the incumbent. Though the highest political office in that small arena, the position itself is of only moderate consequence and carries rather limited power. Even with the AfD's Sesselmann win, many of his duties will entail simply implementing laws from either the state or the federal parliament at the local level. However, critics fear the idea of the AfD wielding political power in any measure and say the party is xenophobic and anti-democratic. Germany's domestic intelligence service classifies the party in Thuringia and its controversial hardline leader, Björn Höcke, as far-right extremists. The German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) had also urged voters to turn out to support conservative Köpper. The CDU claimed the election campaign had been abrasive and nasty, with false claims circulating on social media. AfD making inroads The AfD win on Sunday is widely seen as a milestone for the far-right party, which is currently polling between 18% and 20% nationwide. It has gained a wave of support as the center-left federal coalition government of SPD with the environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) is showing signs of infighting. Even with their rise, however, Chancellor Olaf Scholz , who is from the SPD, faces a bigger challenge from the right-leaning CDU. The conservative party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel is polling at just under 30%. The AfD first entered the national parliament in 2017 after campaigning strongly against migration. More recently, the party has been criticizing German support for Ukraine as Kyiv fights off the invasion from Russia. zc, jsi, rc/kb (dpa, AFP, AP) While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The officer, who has been identified only as 1st Lt. Franco A. in line with German privacy rules, was convicted by the Frankfurt state court in July 2022 of preparing a serious crime meant to endanger the state, fraud and violations of weapons laws. The court, which found that he had right-wing extremist views, sentenced him to 5 1/2 years in prison. The Federal Court of Justice said in a statement that judges rejected his appeal in an Aug. 8 decision, finding that it was “clearly unfounded” and no legal errors had been made to his detriment. The German officer drew the attention of authorities after he was arrested in February 2017 while going to retrieve a pistol he had stashed in a Vienna airport bathroom. He was freed, but Austrian authorities informed Germany. The investigation was triggered when his fingerprint matched one he had given to register as an asylum-seeker. Franco A. was accused of plotting to kill prominent politicians and blame the attack on refugees. Prosecutors alleged that his targets included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas and the Jewish head of an anti-racism organization.

The Frankfurt court found that the defendant had decided to carry out the attacks, but was unable to establish whether he planned to do so while posing as a Syrian refugee. The soldier denied having planned attacks at his trial, but said that he had hoarded weapons and ammunition in case public order collapsed in Germany. He asserted that by posing as an asylum-seeker, he wanted to uncover faults in asylum proceedings.",

The accident happened early on Tuesday morning about 22 kilometres (13 miles) southwest of the island of Helgoland, the German Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said. Advertisement Several ships are currently searching for survivors in the area, it added. “One person was rescued from the water and is receiving medical care. Several other people are currently missing,” the agency said. The ship believed to have sunk was named as the Verity, sailing under a British flag and on its way from Bremen to the UK town of Immingham. The other ship was the Polesie, under a Bahamas flag and travelling from Hamburg to La Coruna in Spain. The Verity was the smaller vessel with a length of 91 metres (almost 300 feet), compared to the Polesie’s 190 metres. The Polesie was still afloat with 22 people on board, the agency said. Advertisement The Bild daily reported that a total of six people were missing. “The emergency services are doing everything they can to rescue the missing people,” German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said in a statement. “My thoughts are with the crew members, their relatives and the rescue teams who have been in action since early this morning.” Advertisement Cruise ship Two rescue cruisers, an emergency tug, a pilot boat, a police patrol boat and a helicopter are helping with the search, according to the CCME. A P&O cruise ship that was in the area, the IONA, has also been involved, the agency added. “On board the IONA, people can also receive medical care; there are doctors on board,” it said. Advertisement Other medical staff were also transported to the site by helicopter. The search was taking place in difficult weather conditions, with winds of six on the Beaufort scale and waves reaching as high as three metres, the agency said. The Polesie is owned by the Polish shipping company Polsteam. The accident comes weeks after a ship with hundreds of electric cars on board caught fire in the North Sea off the coast of the Netherlands. Advertisement The Fremantle Highway was sailing between Bremerhaven in Germany and Port Said in Egypt when the blaze broke out in July. The accident happened close to Ameland, one of an archipelago of ecologically sensitive islands situated in the Waddensee area. All 23 crew members were evacuated from the ship, but one person died and several were injured. Advertisement Efforts to tow the ship to shore were complicated by poor weather conditions but it was eventually brought to the northern port of Eemshaven.

A police patrol noticed the overloaded vehicle on the A94 highway east of Munich at about 3:15 a.m. and tried to stop it, police said. The driver didn’t react and accelerated to 180 kph (112 mph). Shortly afterward, he lost control of the vehicle when he took a turning off the highway and the van overturned, hurling several of the 23 people on board out of the vehicle. Seven people were killed, including a 6-year-old child, police said in a statement. The other 16 were injured, some of them seriously, and were taken to hospitals. The people on board were Syrian and Turkish citizens. The driver and suspected smuggler, a 24-year-old stateless man resident in Austria, was among the injured. Police said he was formally detained at a hospital and is under investigation on suspicion of homicide among other offenses. The van was designed to carry nine people, and it wouldn’t have been possible for many of the people on board to use seat belts, German news agency dpa reported.

The Austrian-registered van was traveling toward Munich at the time of the incident. The A94 is known as a smuggling route and the site of the accident is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the border with Austria, through which many migrants transit en route to Germany. “The inhuman behavior of the smuggler, who was injured in the accident and wanted to evade being stopped by the federal police just to save his own skin, makes one speechless,” Bavaria’s top security official, state Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, told dpa. Herrmann’s conservative party belongs to Germany’s main opposition bloc, which has pressed the federal government to tighten border controls. He said Friday’s incident shows “how important it is to further strengthen immediate border controls in order to stop smugglers already at the border.”",

Two masked people escaped without being caught, according to German media reports , after throwing firebombs at the building — and missing their target. “Fortunately, persons and buildings remained unharmed,” the synagogue announced Wednesday , adding that a criminal investigation has started. Advertisement Scholz — who is currently in Egypt, after visiting Israel on Tuesday — condemned the attacks against Jewish institutions, calling them “inhuman, abhorrent and not to be tolerated. Antisemitism has no place in Germany,” he said . “My thanks go to the security forces, especially in this situation,” Scholz added. However, German news outlet Tagesspiegel reported that the security officers protecting the building were present at the time of the attack, but failed both to prevent it happening and arrest the perpetrators. The Molotov cocktail attack comes as European governments fear an increase in antisemitic acts as the fighting between Israel and Hamas escalates in the Middle East. Following the Hamas attack on Israel, Berlin ramped up police protection for Jewish institutions.

Daniel Halemba was later released when a judge ruled he was not a flight risk. He was elected to the Bavarian parliament earlier this month. He was detained hours before he was due to gain immunity as an Alternative for Germany (AfD) MP when the parliament was sworn in on Monday afternoon. The 22-year-old politician is one of 32 AfD members elected in the party's best-ever election result in Bavaria, where it is now the largest opposition party in the state. Police issued an arrest warrant for him on Friday and he was tracked down near Stuttgart, in the state of Baden-Württemberg, on Monday morning. One of the new legislature's first acts on Monday was to lift Mr Halemba's immunity. He has said he intends to participate in parliamentary proceedings. Police in Würzburg last month raided the premises of the Teutonia Prag student fraternity after neighbours complained of hearing shouts of \"Sieg Heil\" from inside. The phrase was a key Nazi slogan and is banned in Germany. Officers said they had confiscated banned material and that the raid \"confirmed the allegations [made by neighbours]\". Mr Halemba is under investigation on suspicion of sedition and possessing banned symbols. Nazi iconography is also outlawed in Germany. Prosecutors told the BBC he was accused of collusion or suppression of evidence, as he was trying to influence other members of the fraternity to change their statements. \"They want to arrest me... using a totally lawless arrest warrant,\" Mr Halemba said in a video posted to social media before his arrest. His lawyer, Dubravko Mandic, said the allegations against his client had \"no truth\". Katrin Ebner-Steiner, the leader of the AfD in the Bavarian parliament, denounced what she termed a \"politically motivated\" prosecution. The AfD has enjoyed record election results in recent months. The anti-immigration party came third in this month's Bavarian election and second in the state of Hesse.

A 35-year-old male suspect has now left his car with his 4-year-old daughter, Hamburg police said on X, formerly Twitter. He did not resist arrest and the girl is seemingly not injured, officers said.

Tim Lochner was elected after winning the second round of voting in Pirna, a town in the eastern state of Saxony where the AfD has been notably strong . Initial results showed that Lochner had won 38.5% of the vote, the city stated on its website. Three-way fight The far-right candidate beat out Kathrin Dollinger-Knuth (CDU), who came second with 31.4% of the vote, and Ralf Thiele, from the small Free Voters party, who got 30.1%. Lochner, 53, is an independent but decided to stand under the far-right AfD banner for the vote. In the first round Lochner secured a third of the vote, but was able to increase his share in the second round. The local Greens and Social Democrats dropped out after the first round and threw their support behind the CDU's Dollinger-Knuth. Tim Lochner has become the first AfD mayor of a German city Image: Sebastian Kahnert/dpa/picture alliance Situated 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Dresden on the edge of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, Pirna has around 40,000 inhabitants. The town is known above all for its almost perfectly preserved old town. Extremist organization Sunday's result comes just days after the eastern state of Saxony's domestic intelligence agency deemed the AfD as a right-wing extremist party . Pirna marks the first time the AfD has won a mayorship in a town. In August, Hannes Loth was elected as the first mayor of a municipality — Raguhn-Jeßnitz in the state of Saxony-Anhalt — but this was a region with just 9,000 inhabitants. In June, the party won its first district council election, with candidate Robert Sesselmann in the Sonneberg district in Thuringia . The far-right party has been on the rise in Germany with surveys showing around one in five voters saying they would vote AfD, making it the second most popular party after the CDU. In the eastern German states, the share of voters willing to vote AfD stands at over 30% — ahead of all other parties — with three of those states scheduled to hold elections next year: Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg. Earlier this month, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's main opposition Christian Democrats (CDU), rowed back from comments suggesting his party was open to working with the AfD at the municipal level. jsi/ab (AFP, dpa, epd) While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

He´s in a plane heading to his country,” an official with the archdiocese told AFP on condition of anonymity. A government official confirmed the information. No other details were provided. A Malian army soldier patrols in Gao. — AFP/File Lohre had been due to celebrate Mass in the Malian capital when he went missing. His car was left parked outside his home and calls to his phone went to voicemail. He was widely thought to have been kidnapped, although no one ever claimed responsibility. Lohre had lived in Mali for around 30 years and taught inter-religious dialogue at the Islamo-Christian Institute, which receives students from around the world. Mali has been wracked by violence for years and kidnappings of foreigners and Malians have regularly taken place for criminal or ideological reasons, though they are more common outside the capital.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Poland's relationship with Germany has taken a further battering thanks to Russia's invasion of Ukraine | Omar Marques/Getty Images September 1, 2022 4:12 pm CET By Jan Cienski At a time when the attention of the European Union is focused on preventing Russia from conquering Ukraine, Poland is reigniting a conflict from the past — with the country’s de facto ruler on Thursday calling for Germany to pay 6.2 trillion złoty (€1.3 trillion) in reparations for its 1939-1945 occupation. “This is our goal,” Jarosław Kaczyński, the head of Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, said on the 83rd anniversary of Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland. “I know that we are embarking on a path that will take a long time and will not be easy. We do not promise quick successes,” Kaczyński said in a press conference to publicize a report prepared by Law and Justice. Advertisement Advertisement Poland was ravaged by Germany’s invasion and occupation, with about 6 million deaths — a fifth of the population (including almost all of its Jewish people). Warsaw was left a smoking ruin. Thursday’s news conference was held in Warsaw’s royal castle, a building destroyed during the war and only rebuilt in the 1970s. “The Germans invaded Poland and did great damage to us. The occupation was extremely criminal, incredibly cruel and caused effects that in many cases continue to this day,” Kaczyński said. But Poland’s post-war communist government — a satellite of the USSR — agreed to drop demands for reparations against East Germany in 1953, making it legally complicated for Warsaw to file any claims. Poland also gained large territories from Germany after the war, while losing about a third of pre-war Poland’s lands to the Soviet Union. “The position of the Federal Government is unchanged, the reparations issue is closed,” said Germany’s foreign ministry. “Poland renounced further reparations a long time ago, in 1953, and has confirmed this renunciation several times. This is an essential basis for today’s European order. Germany stands politically and morally by its responsibility for the Second World War.” The ruins of Warsaw after its occupation by German forces in 1940s | Central Press/Getty Images “There is no chance for reparations,” Radosław Sikorski, a member of the European Parliament from the opposition Civic Platform party and a former Polish foreign minister, said in a radio interview, warning that the only impact will be to worsen relations between Warsaw and Berlin. “It’s pure propaganda, a fairy tale for the naïve.” Donald Tusk, the leader of Civic Platform and a former Polish prime minister and president of the European Council, accused Kaczyński of playing politics with his demand. Advertisement Advertisement “This is not about any reparations from Germany, this is about a political campaign,” he said . “Jarosław Kaczyński is not hiding it, that they want to rebuild support for the ruling party with this anti-German campaign.” PiS hopes to win an unprecedented third term in power in next year’s parliamentary election. Although the party is still leading in opinion polls , it has been losing ground to the opposition as the country deals with high inflation, slowing economic growth and soaring energy prices. Kaczyński has long seen Germany as Poland’s historic enemy, despite both countries being in NATO and in the EU, and Germany being by far Poland’s largest trading partner. He’s suspicious that Berlin is using the EU as a cover to “build the Fourth Reich.” Poland’s relationship with Germany has taken a further battering thanks to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Warsaw has been one of the most enthusiastic backers of Kyiv, sending money and weapons to Ukraine, while leading the charge to cut off imports of Russian energy and to block Russian tourists from visiting the Continent. Berlin’s caution in moving rapidly in the same direction has aroused Polish anger. Kaczyński’s demand is still not official government policy, and Warsaw hasn’t issued any formal request to Berlin. “We are obliged today to calculate these losses as accurately as possible and present a proper account to those who owe it,” said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Advertisement Advertisement Berlin feels that the 1990 deal allowing West and East Germany to unify ended all outstanding issues related to the war, and rejects demands for reparations. Germany has paid compensation to individual victims of the Holocaust and to people forced to work as slave laborers, but not to other countries; Greece has an outstanding claim estimated at €289 billion, but the German parliament found it does not have legal merit.

The incident happened in January near the town of Kusel. https://p.dw.com/p/4B66n A 38-year-old man was charged in the shooting deaths of two police officers on a remote rural road near the town of Kusel, Germany in January Image: Sebastian Gollnow/dpa Advertisement The 38-year-old suspected shooter responsible for the death of a young policewoman and policeman on a rural road near the town of Kusel in the Palatinate region of Germany was charged Tuesday. The public prosecutor's office in Kaiserslautern charged the man with the German equivalent of first-degree murder, along with lesser charges. His 33-year-old accomplice was not charged with murder but rather obstruction of justice for helping his acquaintance to flee. Prosecutors said the investigation had shown that the elder primary suspect was the only one to open fire on the officers. A psychological evaluation of the two found they were fit to stand trial and not lacking in mental capabilities. What happened in the fatal shooting death of two police in Kusel in January? More details of the crime emerged thanks to the prosecutor's office as a trial date was set for late June. The prosecutor's office said the suspect and his friend had spent the night wildlife poaching prior to the murder of the two police officers. When the two police stopped the car with the pair allegedly responsible for their deaths on a remote rural road, the 38-year-old man first fired at the 24-year-old policewoman with a shotgun at close range. The man then allegedly shot the policeman with a shotgun, then a hunting rifle. The policeman fired back but missed. He managed to make a distress call declaring, \"They're shooting.\" Having killed the male officer, investigators allege the primary suspect finally fired a close range, fatal shot to the head of the severely wounded female officer. The two men were apprehended the following day in Saarland following a major police search and public appeal for leads. What do we know about the man who was charged? The 38-year-old suspect had previously come to the attention of the authorities for wildlife poaching-related offenses. Since April 2020, he had been prohibited from owning or borrowing firearms. He also did not have the requisite hunting permits. The murder weapon in the double police killing legally belonged to the wife of the 38-year-old man. He is accused of both poaching and killing two police officers. Prosecutors believe his motive was to protect and cover up his black market poaching operations. ar/msh (AFP, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement",

Ritsu Doan, one of the substitutes, hammered in a shot from the edge of the box in the 48th minute that Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon – whose poor clearance had created the danger – could not keep out. Three minutes later, Ao Tanaka scored from close range after the other halftime sub Kaoru Mitoma cut the ball back from the byline. The VAR system took several minutes to confirm the ball had not gone out before Mitoma's touch, sparking wild celebrations by Japan and their fans when the verdict came in. Spain had looked in total control in the first half but were suddenly clinging to their chance of staying in the World Cup as Costa Rica and Germany battled out their own drama in the other Group E match. Alvaro Morata had put the Spaniards ahead when he scored his third goal in three games in Qatar, rising high above Japan's defence to power a header past goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda in the 11th minute after a cross by Cesar Azpilicueta. The breathtaking 2-1 win for Japan - who also beat Germany 2-1 after going behind in their opening match of the tournament - meant they topped Group E, followed by Spain in second who finished ahead of third-placed Germany only on goal difference.

The \"AquaDom\" - home to 1,500 fish - is 15.85m high (52 ft) and was described as the largest free-standing cylindrical aquarium in the world. Two people were injured by falling glass after the blast. Police said there had been \"incredible\" damage. Video showed an empty tank with water pouring into the hotel lobby. Guests have been moved out of the hotel following the incident at 05:50 (04:50 GMT). A spokesman for Berlin's fire brigade told the BBC the vast majority of the fish had died, while the cold weather had made rescue attempts more difficult. The tank had contained more than 100 different species. However, fire brigade official James Klein later told local media that \"several dozen\" fish had been found alive in places where residual water had collected. He said they were being rehoused in other aquariums. Also, the Associated Press quoted officials as saying they were working to rescue another 400-500 fish in smaller tanks under the hotel lobby which had been deprived of oxygen because of the disaster. Outside the Radisson Blu, a pile of debris lay in front of what were the front doors, which now hang into the street - twisted at an angle by the force of the exploding tank. Reuters /Michele Tantussi More than 100 fire fighters were in attendance at the incident in Berlin on Friday morning Paul Maletzki was staying on the fourth floor with his girlfriend. He described being woken up by a loud bang and shaking. When he looked down into the lobby, he saw water flowing across it. They and other guests were later escorted out of the hotel by armed police. The Mayor of Berlin Franziska Giffey went to the hotel to see the damage and described the tank burst as being like a tsunami. She expressed relief it had happened so early in the morning - saying an hour or so later, and the lobby and street outside would have been busy with visitors, many of them children. Sandra Weeser, a member of the German federal parliament who had been staying at the hotel, told local television that she had been woken up by \"a kind of shock wave\" and described the scene outside the hotel as a \"picture of devastation\". She said fish which may have been saved had frozen to death and recalled seeing a \"large parrotfish lying on the ground, frozen\". The aquarium was modernised two years ago, and there is a clear-walled lift built inside for use by visitors. Some of the rooms in the hotel are advertised as having views of it. Berlin's fire brigade said more than 100 firefighters were sent to the scene and it was not clear what caused the break. It said it used rescue dogs to check the area inside the hotel for anyone potentially injured, with nobody found. Police said \"massive amounts\" of water were flowing into nearby streets and people in the area should drive cautiously. Fabrizio Bensch / Reuters The AquaDom in Berlin contained about 1,500 fish and over a million litres of water A police source told local media there is no evidence the break was the result of a targeted attack. But there has been speculation that freezing temperature - which dropped as low as -6C overnight - may have caused a crack in the tank. Berlin's public transport authority said Karl-Liebknecht street outside the hotel had been closed off due to \"an extreme amount of water on the road\". Trams service in the area was also stopped. AquaDom was opened in December 2003 and was given the Guinness World Record for being the world's largest cylindrical aquarium . According to reports at the time of its construction, it cost about €12.8m (£11.2m) to build. Clarification: An earlier version said the aquarium was operated by SeaLife. Although the aquarium is in the same building complex as Berlin SeaLife, they are not responsible for the AquaDom EPA Germany Marine life Berlin",

        "text": "Politics Germany German presidential election: A foregone conclusion Ben Knight 02/12/2022 February 12, 2022 The Social Democrat Frank-Walter Steinmeier has been reelected as German president delivering a widely-praised speech in the Bundestag. In an increasingly polarized Germany, his job could become more difficult. https://p.dw.com/p/46kXp The German president is not as powerful as his counterparts in the United States, France and Russia Image: Mohssen Assanimoghaddam/dpa/picture alliance Advertisement Frank-Walter Steinmeier was overwhelmingly re-elected as German president on Sunday, taking 1,045 of the 1,425 votes cast by the Federal Convention, a body that convenes every five years for this one purpose in the German parliament. The result had been a foregone conclusion ever since December, when Olaf Scholz entered the chancellery and his coalition partners, the Greens and the Free Democrats, made clear that they would not oppose his candidacy. If his election was a formality, however, the acceptance speech was more forthright than many expected. It included a direct appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, at whose door he put the responsibility for the current escalation at the Ukrainian border. \"Undo the noose around Ukraine's neck!\" he said. \"And seek a path together with us that preserves peace in Europe!\" From there, the speech became a rallying cry for democracy. \"My responsibility is to all the people who live in our country,\" he told the chamber. \"Non-partisan, yes - But I am not neutral when the issue is democracy. Anyone who fights for democracy has me at their side. Those who attack it will have me as an opponent!\" A bold move When Steinmeier announced last May that he wanted to run for his office again, many saw it as an unusual gamble in the cautious world of German politics. For one thing, an incumbent president rarely declares his interest in a second term so readily. Secondly, the then 65-year-old could have had no idea last year whether he could rely on a majority in the Federal Convention in this year's election. At the time, his center-left Social Democrats (SPD) were lagging behind the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) in the polls ahead of the September 2021 election. Had the conservative party won, it would probably have installed a presidential candidate of its own. As it was, the campaign of CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet became derailed, and the SPD's Olaf Scholz became head of government against the odds. Scholz's chosen coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats, were soon on board with a second Steinmeier term. The CDU, still nursing the wounds of the defeat, decided not to run its own candidate. Drag queen Olivia Jones was one of the celebrIties who attracted media attention in the Federal Assembly in 2017 Image: Annegret Hilse/SvenSimon/picture alliance Stability is a plus A total of 1,472 people formed the Federal Convention this year, comprised of all 736 members of the Bundestag plus another 736 people chosen by representatives of the 16 German states. As in most years, the latter group included celebrities and other prominent figures, including several athletes and actors, an astronaut, and a number of epidemiologists and health workers, named as a gesture of appreciation for their work during the pandemic. The oldest member of the assembly was 92-year-old Holocaust survivor Karla Spagerer, who survived a COVID-19 infection. The convention's choice of Steinmeier is not a bad outcome, according to Uwe Jun, politics professor at the University of Trier. \"The general opinion on Steinmeier is that he has performed his role satisfactorily in his first term,\" Jun told DW. \"He's someone who is very down-to-earth, who can talk to different social groups. And he always hit the right tone in difficult questions, in crisis questions, in the coronavirus pandemic.\" There have indeed been easier times to be German president, an office whose social role as a unifying figurehead for the nation usually takes precedence over its constitutional role. \"The president has to represent Germany both domestically and to the world, and he has to perform an integrating role,\" Jun said. \"The latter has become more difficult because society is becoming more and more heterogenous and more polarized. Parts of society don't want to be seen to be represented by him.\" \"He plays an important function to society,\" agreed Ursula Münch, director of the Bavaria-based institute the Academy for Political Education. \"And I would say that it has become more difficult for the president, because those who have lost faith in the political system will not trust the president as much.\" German president calls for solidarity during pandemic To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A powerful office — but only in a crisis The German president is not as powerful as his counterparts elsewhere, a legacy of the office's place in German history. The president of the Weimar Repubic wielded substantial power, and in 1933 the elderly \"Reichspräsident\" Paul von Hindenburg was persuaded to use it to pave the way for Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler to take over the country. Nowadays the constitutional purpose of the president only rarely becomes obvious. He (and up till now it has always been a he) represents Germany as head of state, but makes no executive or policy decisions. He does, however, have constitutional powers to step in as arbiter when there is a political impasse: It is the president who decides, for example, whether the Bundestag must be dissolved if the chancellor loses a vote of no-confidence. He also has the power to veto laws if he believes they violate the German constitution. \"The founding mothers and fathers of the Basic Law consciously decided not to give the president major powers. It's an important position, but it's not a powerful position — unless the other institutions are in crisis,\" Münch said. And such crises do happen, and indeed can happen more frequently now that there are more parties in the Bundestag, making majority-building more difficult. Steinmeier himself had to step in 2017 when Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to form a coalition with the Greens and the Free Democrats after her election victory. As that crisis unfolded, it fell to the president to decide against triggering new elections, therefore forcing Merkel to form another grand coalition with the Social Democrats. Marginal candidates have a role In theory, any German who is at least 40 years old is eligible for election. Candidates may be proposed by any member of the Federal Convention. If none of the candidates receives an absolute majority in the first and second ballots, a third ballot is held. In this case, a relative majority is sufficient. New candidates can also be nominated for the second and third ballots. Another element of the president's social role arises from his independence from government, something that allows him to raise awareness for issues that may not be on the agenda for the parliament or the government. That is also true of the election itself, which always includes extra candidates who stand no chance of winning, but who can use the opportunity to make a point. This year's election included three other candidates: Gerhard Trabert, a doctor nominated by the socialist Left party; Max Otte, a CDU member nominated by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD); and Stefanie Gebauer, a 41-year-old physicist with the regional center-right Free Voters party. \"It's always been a part of the presidential election that there were alternative candidates — that is important,\" said Münch, who thinks that the Left party's candidate, Trabert, was a \"skillful, clever choice.\" \"Of course, he won't become president, and he doesn't want to — he wants to carry on working as a doctor helping the disadvantaged,\" she said. \"And he can use the election to draw attention to the fact that there are issues and social groups who we and the media are too often only marginally aware of.\" The AfD, meanwhile, appeared to have a different goal in choosing Otte: provoking its political rivals. Otte is a member of the CDU's nationalist-leaning wing, the WerteUnion (Values Union), and the AfD was apparently hoping to use his candidacy to suggest that some CDU voters might be more at home with the far-right party. But these sideshows, important as they might be as illustrations of the political landscape, will not concern Steinmeier as he begins his second term as Germany's head of state.

Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said the network was part of the \"Reichsbürger scene.\" https://p.dw.com/p/4KaDg Image: Fricke/NEWS5/AFP Advertisement In a nationwide raid, 25 suspected members and supporters of a terrorist organization in Germany were arrested early Wednesday. Officials said the network, part of a wider right-wing movement, was already well established with a concrete plan to overthrow the German state by force and install a new government. What we know so far The raids were announced by Germany's federal prosecution agency and German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann. The minister said the investigations were directed against a suspected terrorist network with known ties to the Reichsbürger movement. He said that the raids had taken place on individuals suspected of planning an armed attack on state institutions. \"The suspicion exists that an armed attack on constitutional organs was planned,\" Buschmann wrote. The search operation is reported to have covered 130 properties belonging to 52 suspects in 11 German states. According to prosecution officials, the arrested suspects \"belong to a terrorist organization\" that was believed to have been founded at the end of November 2021. The group \"set itself the goal of overcoming the existing state order in Germany and replacing it with its own form of state, which has already been worked out in outline,\" prosecutors added. Of the 25 men and women arrested, 24 were from Germany and one suspected supporter is from Russia. One arrest took place in Austria and one in Italy. There are 27 other suspects, the federal prosecutor's office said. What's behind Germany's far-right raids? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Later on Wednesday it was confirmed by the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe, southern Germany, that 19 of the 25 suspects were already in pre-trial detention. The United States has offered support to the German government in the wake of the arrests. \"We remain in close contact with our partners in government and stand ready to help if we are asked to do so,\" said White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday. Two ringleaders identified Prosecutors identified the suspected ringleaders only as Heinrich XIII P. R. and Ruediger v. P., in line with German privacy rules. The news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the former was a well-known 71-year-old member of a minor German noble family, while the latter was a 69-year-old former paratrooper. According to prosecutors, P. R., who the group planned to install as the new leader of Germany, had made contact with Russian officials seeking to establish a new order in Germany once the Berlin government was overthrown. A Russian woman, Vitalia B., had allegedly given him help with this. The Russian Embassy in Berlin denied having links to far-right terror groups. A currently-serving soldier in the Bundeswehr's Special Forces Command (KSK) as well as several Bundeswehr reservists are also among suspects in the case, a spokesperson for Germany's Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD) told the DPA news agency. A search was reported to have been carried out at the soldier's home and his barracks office in the state of Baden-Württemberg. The trigger for the raids was an investigation into another Reichsbürger group that had planned to kidnap German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the case revealed the threat posed by the Reichsbürger movement. \"The investigations provide a glimpse into the abyss of a terrorist threat from the Reichsbürger scene,\" Faeser said in a statement. \"We know how to defend ourselves with all our might against the enemies of democracy,\" she added. The president of the German parliament's lower house, Bärbel Bas, said the operation shows \"that our democratic constitutional state is attentive and capable of action.\" Belief in violence to overthrow 'deep state' The group had targeted members of the Bundeswehr and police in a bid to achieve their goals. It had formed a \"military arm\" and a council presided over by Heinrich XIII P. R. Speaking at a press conference, Germany's chief federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, said that the organization had formed around P. R. at the end of November 2021. Frank said the group had established a council that was intended to act as the government of the new state with some individuals already designated for ministerial roles. Among them was a former member of the Bundestag who was to take over the justice portfolio, Frank said. To implement their plans, the group's members were prepared to use military means and violence against state representatives and were willing to kill to achieve their goals. According to investigators, the members of the group \"followed a conglomerate of conspiracy myths consisting of narratives of the so-called 'Reichsbürger' as well as QAnon ideology.\" The prosecutors added that the group's adherents believe Germany is ruled by a so-called \"deep state,\" similar to baseless claims about the United States that were made by former President Donald Trump. The Reichsbürger movement is made up of a number of small organizations and individuals, mainly in the states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria. They do not accept the legality of the Federal Republic of Germany or any of its government authorities. The movement argues that the German constitution prior to World War II was never properly nullified and that the formation of the former West Germany in 1949, and now reunified Germany, was therefore never valid. jsi, rc/msh (AFP, Reuters, dpa) While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Die Liberalen sind gar unter fünf Prozent gelandet. Nun steht die neue Regierung fest. Bei der Bürgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg haben die Wähler über ihr neues Landesparlament bestimmt. Hamburgs Bürgermeister Peter Tschentscher (SPD) wird aller Voraussicht nach im Amt bleiben. Die CDU kassierte ihr schlechtestes Landes-Ergebnis seit 70 Jahren. Die FDP scheiterte an der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde. Wegen des Coronavirus waren die Koalitionsverhandlungen ausgesetzt. Nun steht die neue Koalition fest. Update vom 6. Juni 2020: Hamburgs SPD und Grüne haben die Neuauflage ihres Regierungsbündnisses in der Hansestadt besiegelt. Die Parteitagsdelegierten beider Seiten stimmten am Samstag mit großer Mehrheit dem Koalitionsvertrag und der vereinbarten Zusammensetzung des neuen Senats zu. Damit ist die Wiederwahl von Bürgermeister Peter Tschentscher (SPD) durch die Bürgerschaft am nächsten Mittwoch praktisch sicher. Beide Fraktionen zusammen verfügen über eine Zweidrittelmehrheit. Hamburg-Wahl: Koalitionsvertrag steht - Rot-Grün regiert weiter Auf einem kleinen Parteitag der Grünen billigten 30 der 35 Delegierten ( 86 Prozent ) die Vereinbarungen mit der SPD. Es gab drei Gegenstimmen und eine Enthaltung, ein Delegierter nahm an der Abstimmung nicht teil. Bei der SPD war das Ergebnis noch eindeutiger. 288 der 312 Delegierten, also 92,3 Prozent , befürworteten in einem Online-Verfahren den Koalitionsvertrag, wie ein Parteisprecher mitteilte. Es gab nur 18 Gegenstimmen und sechs Enthaltungen. Dem Personalvorschlag für die Senatsposten stimmten allerdings nur 76,3 Prozent zu . Die Vergabe von nur zwei Spitzenämtern an Frauen, aber fünf an Männer war auf Kritik gestoßen. Vier der elf Senatsposten werden von den Grünen besetzt - einer mehr als bisher. Tschentscher bedankte sich für die Unterstützung der Delegierten und erklärte : „Hamburg steht in der Corona-Krise weiterhin vor großen Herausforderungen , die wir mit Zuversicht angehen und erfolgreich bewältigen wollen.“ Mit den formulierten politischen Linien und Projekten trage der Koalitionsvertrag eine klare sozialdemokratische Handschrift. Bei den Koalitionsverhandlungen hatten die Grünen in zahlreichen Punkten eigene Vorstellungen einbringen können. „Das ist ein Koalitionsvertrag mit einer deutlichen grünen Handschrift“, sagte Wissenschaftssenatorin Katharina Fegebank. Alle neuen Vorhaben stehen jedoch unter einem Finanzierungsvorbehalt. Seit langem geplante und für die Wirtschaft wichtige Infrastrukturprojekte wie der Bau der Hafenautobahn A26-Ost oder der Köhlbrandtunnel sollen auf jeden Fall gebaut werden. Besonders am Bau der Autobahn durch den Süden Hamburgs gab es bei den Grünen viel Kritik. Der parlamentarische Geschäftsführer Farid Müller bezeichnete das Projekt als „bittere Pille“, für die man aber Kompensationen ausgehandelt habe. Hamburg-Wahl: Koalitionsverhandlungen ausgesetzt wegen Corona Update vom 14. März 2020: SPD und Grüne verschieben den Start der Koalitionsverhandlungen . Am Montag sollten die Gespräche aufgenommen werden, doch um die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus einzudämmen, will man laut Deutscher Presse-Agentur zwei Wochen abwarten. Das teilten beide Parteien am Samstag mit. Update vom 10. März 2020: Nach der Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg werden SPD und Grüne über die erneute Bildung einer rot-grünen Koalition verhandeln . Der SPD-Landesvorstand beschloss am Dienstagabend in der Hansestadt einstimmig, entsprechende Gespräche mit den Grünen aufzunehmen. Vorausgegangen waren auch Sondierungen mit der CDU. SPD und Grünen regieren in Hamburg bereits seit 2015. Die Grünen hatten die Aufnahme von Koalitionsverhandlungen bereits zuvor gebilligt. Die SPD setze auf eine Fortsetzung der \"vertrauensvollen Zusammenarbeit\" mit den Grünen, erklärte die Landeschefin der Sozialdemokraten, Melanie Leonhard. \"Auf Basis der konstruktiven Sondierungsgespräche gehen wir sehr zuversichtlich in die Verhandlungen.\" Meine News Ukraine-News im Ticker Ende des Ukraine-Krieges: Trump mit Vorwürfen gegen Selenskyj – Russisches Ultimatum für Waffenruhe Vor 2 Std.

Februar, 21.55 Uhr: Hamburgs CDU-Landesvorsitzender Roland Heintze und Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg haben Verantwortung für die Schlappe bei der Bürgerschaftswahl übernommen - unmittelbare personelle Konsequenzen aber ausgeschlossen. Heintze sprach am Donnerstagabend bei einem Parteitag angesichts der 11,2 Prozent von einem „bitteren“ Wahlergebnis, Weinberg von einem „sauschlechten“. Veränderungen auch personeller Art seien nötig, sagte Heintze, warnte aber vor „Schnellschüssen“. Nach dem Wahldesaster waren personelle Konsequenzen im Landesvorstand und an der Fraktionsspitze gefordert worden, unter anderem von Alt-Bürgermeister Christoph Ahlhaus . Zunächst müsse die CDU es schaffen, an Profil zu gewinnen und eine kampagnenfähige Organisation zu bilden - „und dann müssen wir uns entscheiden, welchen Köpfen wir das zutrauen“, sagte Heintze, der es ebenso wie Weinberg nicht geschafft hatte, über die Landesliste in die Bürgerschaft einzuziehen. Der Landesvorstand der CDU soll von einem Parteitag im Juni neu bestimmt werden. Im Zweikampf der Bürgermeisterkandidaten von SPD und Grünen sei die CDU „unter die Räder gekommen, wir kamen nicht mehr vor“, sagte Heintze. Bürgermeister Peter Tschentscher (SPD) habe es in kurzer Zeit geschafft, sich einen Amtsbonus anzueignen, der ihn in vielen Bereichen wählbar gemacht habe, „auch für unsere Wähler“. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: SPD und Grüne treffen sich zu ersten Sondierungen Update vom 26. Februar, 17.11 Uhr: Nach der Bürgerschaftwahl treffen sich Hamburger SPD und Grüne am Freitag zu einem ersten Sondierungsgespräch. Die Chancen für eine rot-grüne Koalition stehen gut. Die SPD hatte aber am Wahlabend deutlich gemacht auch mit der CDU sondieren zu wollen. Aber bereits im Wahlkampf hatten SPD und Grüne eine Neuauflage von Rot-Grün als Wunschoption bezeichnet. Ein neuerliches Bündnis aus SPD und Grünen gilt in der Hansestadt als wahrscheinlichste Option. Die CDU erklärte sich zwar zu Sondierungen mit der SPD bereit, gab sich angesichts ihres eigenen Abschneidens aber hinsichtlich einer Regierungsbeteiligung zurückhaltend. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Arge Vorwürfe gegen Lindner - Heftige Wahlpannen, Stimmzettel landeten im Altpapier Update vom 24. Februar, 16.15 Uhr: Bei der Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl sind bei der Auszählung der Stimmen gleich mehrere Pannen passiert. In einem Wahlbezirk in Eimsbüttel sind angekreuzte Wahlkreisstimmzettel versehentlich im Altpapier gelandet - und später von der Müllabfuhr abgeholt worden, wie Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf am Dienstag sagte. Die meisten Stimmzettel konnten wiedergefunden und am Montag doch noch ausgezählt werden, 18 Zettel mit je fünf Stimmen aber blieben verschollen. „Diese 90 Stimmen sind aber nicht mandatsrelevant“, betonte Rudolf. Trotzdem sei das „ein sehr ärgerlicher Vorfall“ gewesen. Eine weitere „unschöne Besonderheit“, wie Rudolf es nannte, gab es auch im Wahlkreis Süderelbe: Dort waren insgesamt 16 fehlerhaft gedruckte Wahlkreisstimmzettel im Umlauf . Bereits bei den Bezirksversammlungswahlen im vergangenen Jahr war es in Wandsbek zu einem ähnlichen Vorfall gekommen. Auch dieser Panne ist Rudolf zufolge „keine Ergebnisrelevanz“ beizumessen. In zwei Wahllokalen wurden bei der ersten Auszählung der Landeslisten Wählerstimmen vertauscht. In Langenhorn wurden zunächst die Grünen-Stimmen irrtümlich der FDP zugeordnet - und umgekehrt. Der Fehler wurde später festgestellt und berichtigt. Auch in Winterhude waren vorübergehend Stimmen vertauscht gewesen. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Urlaubsfoto mit Freundin kurz vorm FDP-Desaster - arge Vorwürfe gegen Lindner 13.21 Uhr: Nach dem desaströsen Scheitern der FDP bei der Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl sorgt ein Foto von Parteichef Christian Lindner offenbar für Unmut bei seinen Parteikollegen. Auf dem Bild zu sehen sind Lindner und seine Freundin, Journalistin Franca Lehfeldt , bei einem Kurztrip nach Amsterdam . Verbreitet hat der FDP-Chef das Foto über sein Instagram-Profil . Christian Lindner machte kurz vor der Hamburg-Wahl noch Urlaub mit seiner Freundin Franca Lehfeldt. © Screenshot: Instagram Hamburg: FDP-Chef Lindner muss sich nach desaströsem Wahl-Ergebnis Vorwürfen stellen Warum sich manche FDP-ler über den auf den ersten Blick harmlosen Schnappschuss ärgern? Lindner knipste das Selfie ausgerechnet am letzten Sonntag vor der Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl . Dass sich Lindner einen Liebes-Urlaub gönnte, während der Wahlkampf in Hamburg auf Hochtouren lief, fällt dem FDP-Chef nach dem fatalen Wahl-Ergebnis nun auf die Füße. Denn mit nur 4,9 Prozent verpasste die FDP knapp eine Woche später den Einzug in die Bürgerschaft . Im Gegensatz dazu hatten die Freien Liberalen vor fünf Jahren in der Hansestadt immerhin noch 7,4 Prozent geholt. Parteikollegen Lindners monieren nun laut Bild.de , dass der FDP-Chef an einem entscheidenden Tag im Wahlkampf gefehlt habe . Auf Instagram sorgt das Foto nach der Wahl für Spott und Häme. „So sieht erfolgreicher Wahlkampf aus“, schreibt ein Nutzer in den Kommentaren - und meint das offensichtlich ironisch. Ein anderer Kommentar: „Dafür sind die Zähne gut gebleeched. Man kann ja nicht alle Baustellen gleichzeitig im Griff haben.“ Lindner reagierte bislang nicht auf die Vorwürfe und scheint sich generell eher bedeckt zu halten. Wie Bild.de berichtet, soll er eine Anfrage von Anne Will zur Teilnahme an ihrer Talkshow abgesagt haben. Schließlich war anstelle des aktuellen FDP-Chefs Alt-Liberale Gerhart Baum bei Will. Hamburg: Umstrittener Linken-Kandidat Tom Radtke wird nicht in die Bürgerschaft einziehen Update vom 25. Februar 2020, 12.23 Uhr: Die FDP hat in Hamburg den Wiedereinzug in die Bürgerschaft verpasst - möglicherweise eine Folge der Ereignisse in Thüringen . Auch andere Landesverbände stecken in Nöten: Eine Umfrage aus Bayern bringt weitere schlechte Neuigkeiten für die Liberalen , wie Merkur.de * berichtet. 22.03 Uhr: Der von den Hamburger Linken im Nachhinein ungewollte Listenkandidat Tom Radtke wird der neuen Bürgerschaft nicht angehören. Laut vorläufigem amtlichen Endergebnis erhielt der 18-Jährige, der Ende Januar durch einen relativierenden Holocaust-Tweet bundesweit Empörung ausgelöst hatte, nicht die nötigen Stimmen. „Ich wurde nicht gewählt, werde aber weiter Politik machen“, twitterte er am Montagabend. Radtke stand auf Platz 20 der Linken-Landesliste. Inzwischen läuft nach Angaben der Linken ein Parteiausschlussverfahren gegen ihn. Der Schüler hatte sich in seiner Wahlbewerbung als Klima- und Netzaktivist vorgestellt. Später hatte er im Netz schwere Anschuldigungen gegen führende Köpfe der Fridays-for-Future-Bewegung sowie gegen Linke und Grüne erhoben. Zuletzt hatte er einen Tag vor der Bürgerschaftswahl ein Bild von sich mit einer Fahne der vom Verfassungsschutz als rechtsextrem eingestuften Identitären Bewegung gepostet - aus der Gedenkstätte für den von den Nazis ermordeten Kommunisten-Führer Ernst Thälmann. Hamburg: CDU-Spitzenkandidat verpasst Einzug in die Bürgerschaft 21.52 Uhr: CDU -Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg hat den Einzug in die Hamburgische Bürgerschaft verpasst. Wie Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf am Montagabend mitteilte, wurden alle 15 Mandate der CDU über Wahlkreismandate vergeben. Der Altonaer Bundestagsabgeordnete hatte lediglich auf der Landesliste kandidiert. Seine CDU war bei der Bürgerschaftswahl auf für die Hansestadt historisch schlechte 11,2 Prozent abgestürzt. Ebenfalls ohne Mandat blieb der Landesvorsitzende Roland Heintze, der auf Platz drei der Landesliste angetreten war. 20.37 Uhr: Der ehemalige CDU-Fraktionschef und Kandidat auf den Parteivorsitz Friedrich Merz hat das Hamburger Wahlergebnis als „Desaster“ für die CDU bzeichnet. Jetzt sei die richtige Analyse wichtig. Diese heiße, dass die Grünen wahrscheinlich der Hauptgegner der CDU bei den nächsten Bundestagswahlen seien. „Und da freu ich mich schon drauf“, sagte der 64-Jährige. 20.22 Uhr: Die SPD in Hamburg will Grünen und CDU noch in dieser Woche Termine für Sondierungsgespräche anbieten. „Wir wollen die Hamburgerinnen und Hamburger nicht länger als nötig auf eine neue Regierung warten lassen“, sagte die SPD-Landesvorsitzende und Sozialsenatorin Melanie Leonhard am Montagabend am Rande der Sitzung des Landesvorstands. Bürgermeister Peter Tschentscher (SPD) betonte: „Wir werden jetzt sehr bald zunächst auf die Grünen, aber eben in einem zweiten Schritt auch auf die CDU zugehen und ein Gespräch anbieten.“ Die „erste Option“ sei aber ein rot-grüner Koalitionsvertrag. Bürgschaftswahl: FDP scheitert an Fünf-Prozent-Hürde in Hamburg 20.16 Uhr: Nach den Hochrechnungen am Montagabend nach der Wahl ist das desaströse Ergebnis für die FDP zumindest vorläufig amtlich. Demnach haben es die Liberalen nicht (4,9 Prozent) in das Landesparlament geschafft. Zu stark scheint der Vertrauensverlust nach dem Debakel in Thüringen zu sein. FDP-Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels sicherte sich allerdings nach den am Montag vom Landeswahlamt veröffentlichten Ergebnissen über ihren Wahlkreis Blankenese ein Mandat. Hamburgweit kamen die Liberalen auf 4,9 Prozent der Stimmen. Dass sich in Thüringen der FDP-Kandidat Thomas Kemmerich von der CDU und der AfD zum Ministerpräsidenten hatte mitwählen lassen, wird als ein Hauptgrund für das schlechte Abschneiden der Christdemokraten und der Liberalen gesehen. Auf die Schnelle konnten scheinbar auch nicht die andauernden und vielfältigen Entschuldigungen von Partei-Chef Christian Lindner helfen, Wähler zu mobilisieren. Nach der Wahl in Hamburg will Lindner nun den Kurs der Mitte in seiner Partei schärfen. „Wir werden in der nächsten Zeit ganz offensiv unsere politische Position der Mitte reklamieren und auch die Auseinandersetzung mit denen suchen, die versuchen, jetzt aus dem Fehler von Erfurt eine grundlegende Veränderung unserer politischen Landschaft herbeizuführen“, sagte Lindner in Berlin nach einer Präsidiumssitzung seiner Partei. 17.41 Uhr: Grund zur anhaltenden Verwirrung über den Verbleib der FDP im Hamburger Landesparlament ist aber nicht nur die Auszähl-Panne. Das Auszählungskonzept der Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl ist zusätzlich extrem komplex. Nach der ersten, vereinfachten Auszählung der Landesstimmen folgen weitere Auszählungen. Mit der nächsten Hochrechnung darf am Montagabend gegen 18.30 Uhr gerechnet werden. Wegen der sogenannten Heilungsregel kann es bei den aktuellen Ergebnissen aber noch Verschiebungen geben. Zunächst ungültige Stimmen können bei der zweiten Auszählrunde im Zuge dieser Regel als gültig gewertet werden, wenn der eigentliche Wählerwille erkennbar ist. Dies wäre zum Beispiel der Fall, wenn ein Wähler auf der Landesliste einer einzelnen Partei sechs statt der ihm maximal zur Verfügung stehenden fünf Stimmen gegeben hat. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: FDP bangt um ihren Platz - SPD feiert derweil einen Sieg, der Fragen aufwirft 17.28 Uhr: Die FDP muss in Hamburg weiterhin um den Wiedereinzug in das Hamburger Landesparlament bangen. Nach einer Panne bei der Stimmauszählung am Sonntagabend kann es sein, dass die Liberalen , die es nur knapp geschafft zu haben schienen die fünf Prozenthürde zu nehmen, zu wenig Stimmen auf sich vereinen können. Im Wahlbezirk Langenhorn wurden die Ergebnisse von Grünen und FDP verwechselt: Die 22,4 Prozent der Ökopartei wurden versehentlich den Freidemokraten zugeschrieben, wie der zuständige Bezirkswahlleiter Tom Oelrichs am Montag sagte. 16.37 Uhr: Nach der Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg kann die SPD nach einiger Zeit wieder einen eindeutigen Wahlsieg feiern. Das gesteht auch Parteivorsitzende Saskia Esken ein. Die Sozialdemokraten seien zuletzt nicht so daran gewöhnt gewesen, feiern zu können, „jetzt haben wir wirklich einen Anlass“, so Esken. Doch dass sie und ihr Kollege Norbert Walter-Borjans sich diesen Sieg zuschreiben können, ist eher unwahrscheinlich. Die Landesvertretung in Hamburg hatte das neue Spitzen-Duo der SPD völlig aus dem Wahlkampf herausgehalten. Nicht zu einer einzigen Wahlkampfveranstaltung hatte man die SPD-Führung eingeladen. Jetzt müssen sich Esken und Walter-Borjans den Vorwurf gefallen lassen, man habe sich in Hamburg wohl für die beiden geschämt - oder glaube nicht daran mit ihnen dort gewinnen zu können. Doch die Partei, auf Bundesebene sowie in Hamburg, zeigt bisher keine große Reaktion - zumindest nach Außen. „Die SPD ist eine richtig starke Truppe“, sagte der SPD-Wahlsieger Peter Tschentscher . Er bekräftigte, dass für ihn in Hamburg nun die Fortsetzung des Regierungsbündnisses mit den Grünen die „naheliegende Option“ sei. Diese habe in der Stadt auch „große Unterstützung bei den Bürgern“. Er sei „sehr froh, dass wir mit diesem sehr, sehr starken Ergebnis in die Koalitionsbildung einsteigen können“, um den „erfolgreichen Kurs in die Zukunft fortführen zu können“. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Böses Erwachen? „Ergebnisse vertauscht“ - die FDP verliert Stimmen 11.49 Uhr: In Berlin müssen sich die Parteien am Montag mit den Ergebnissen der Wahl in Hamburg auseinandersetzen. Besonders bitter wird dieser Prozess unter anderem für die FDP, die in der Hansestadt einen schweren Verlust eingefahren hat. Aktuell muss sie sogar um den Verbleib im Landesparlament fürchten, weil durch einen Auszählungsfehler am Sonntag mehr Stimmen der FDP zugerechnet wurden, als für sie abgegeben wurden. Das wird bestätigt, als die FDP in Berlin bereits die Beratungen über die Zukunft der Partei begonnen haben. Mit dem Wahl-Eklat in Thüringen sei ein Vertrauensverlust bei den Bürgern entstanden, sagte Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels-Frowein vor dem Treffen am Montag. „Das war für uns sehr, sehr schwer in kurzer Zeit wieder aufzuholen“, sagte sie. Die FDP kam am Wahlsonntag nach der vereinfachten Auszählung in Hamburg auf genau fünf Prozent. Am Montagabend gegen 18.30 Uhr wird mit dem vorläufigen amtlichen Endergebnis gerechnet. Doch bereits zuvor ist klar: Bei der ersten Auszählung hat es einen Fehler gegeben. Die Partei verliert einige Stimmen. Mehr Klarheit verschafft die in Hamburg vorgeschriebene zweite Runde der Auszählung, die morgens begonnen hatte. Hier geht es um die Auszählung der Kreislisten, nach der dann feststeht, welche Kandidaten in die Bürgerschaft einziehen. Auch werden die Landesstimmzettel erneut gezählt. Nach Schließung der Wahllokale am Sonntag waren zunächst nur die Stimmen für die Parteien auf den Landesstimmzetteln nach einem vereinfachten Verfahren ausgezählt worden, so dass am späten Abend nur die voraussichtliche Verteilung der Bürgerschaftssitze auf die Parteien feststand. Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf will sich erst nach Auszählung aller Stimmen zu einer möglichen Verwechslung bei der Stimmerfassung im Wahlbezirk Hamburg-Langenhorn äußern. „Ich werde zu dem Ergebnis von Langenhorn vor dem vorläufigen Ergebnis nichts bekanntgeben“, sagte Rudolf am Montag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Einzelergebnisse zu Wahlbezirke gebe er tagsüber nicht bekannt, sagte Rudolf. Er verwies darauf, dass die Ergebnisse im Internet fortlaufend aktualisiert würden, auch die Ergebnisse in einzelnen Wahlbezirken. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Böses Erwachen? „Ergebnisse vertauscht“ - die FDP verliert Stimmen 11.27 Uhr: Der Verdacht scheint sich zu bestätigen. Die FDP verliert in Hamburg Stimmen nach einer Zählpanne. Dabei sind Stimmen für andere Parteien versehentlich den Liberalen zugerechnet worden. Durch eine Verwechslung im Bezirk Langenhorn wurden dort versehentlich die 22,4 Prozent der Grünen den Liberalen zugeteilt, wie der zuständige Bezirkswahlleiter Tom Oelrichs der Deutschen Presse-Agentur am Montag sagte. Die FDP lag am Sonntagabend zunächst hamburgweit nur wenige Stimmen über der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde. 08.58 Uhr: In Hamburg wird nach der Wahl weiter ausgezählt. Um acht Uhr hat am Montag die Auszählung der Kreislisten begonnen, nach der feststeht, welche Kandidaten in die Bürgerschaft einziehen. Auch werden die Landesstimmzettel erneut gezählt . Nach Schließung der Wahllokale am Sonntag waren zunächst nur die Stimmen für die Parteien auf den Landesstimmzetteln nach einem vereinfachten Verfahren ausgezählt worden, so dass am späten Abend nur die voraussichtliche Verteilung der Bürgerschaftssitze auf die Parteien feststand. Für die FDP, die nach der vereinfachten Auszählung auf genau 5,0 Prozent kam, bleibt es damit spannend. Gegen 18.30 Uhr wird mit dem vorläufigen amtlichen Endergebnis gerechnet. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Fortsetzung der rot-grünen Koalition? Parteienforscher macht Fehler bei Grünen aus 08.29 Uhr: Wie geht es in Hamburg nach der Wahl weiter? Gibt es eine Fortsetzung der rot-grünen Koalition ? Der Hamburger Parteienforscher Elmar Wiesendahl erwartet schwierige Koalitionsverhandlungen . „Es wird auf jeden Fall zu Rot-Grün kommen. Allerdings werden die Grünen ihre Muskeln spielen lassen. Und die SPD wird im Bewusstsein ihres Erfolges dagegenhalten“, sagte er dem Hamburger Abendblatt (Montag). Es werde nicht einfach: „Die Grünen werden mehr Senatsposten verlangen. Welche Ressorts sie bekommen, dürfte zum Streit führen.“ Dass die Grünen die SPD mit der Bürgermeister-Kandidatin Katharina Fegebank herausgefordert hätten, ist seiner Ansicht nach allerdings ein Fehler gewesen. Die Hürde, Tschentscher zu stürzen, sei einfach zu hoch gewesen. Die SPD habe im Wahlkampf dagegen vieles richtig gemacht. „Sie hat die Herausforderung der Grünen angenommen und sehr subtil einen Gegen-Wahlkampf geführt. Dabei ist sie thematisch bis in den Markenkern der Grünen vorgedrungen - die Klima- und Umweltpolitik - und hat erfolgreich eine Art Produktpiraterie betrieben“, sagte der 75 Jahre alte Politikwissenschaftler. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Klingbeil zieht die Lehre für SPD 08.12 Uhr: Mit Blick auf die Bundespartei sagte SPD-Generalsekretär Lars Klingbeil gegenüber Bild : „Natürlich kann man von Hamburg lernen“. In der Hansestadt habe es klare Themen gegeben, Zukunftsthemen und einen Kurs der wirtschaftlichen Vernunft. In Hamburg habe man es geschafft auf Inhalte zu sprechen zu kommen - weg von der Selbstbeschäftigung. An dieser Stelle schoss Klingbeil gleich noch eine Spitze gegen die Grünen ab. Während die Grünen vor wenigen Wochen Umfragen zufolge noch nah dran war den Bürgermeister von Hamburg zu stellen, sei diese Stimmung gekippt, je näher die Wahl gekommen sei. Klingbeil schließt daraus, dass die Wähler, wenn es um Regierungsverantwortung geht, den Grünen doch weniger Vertrauen zugestehen würden. Klingbeil meint: „Mit schönen Worten, wie man sie von Robert Habeck kennt, wird man nicht mehr weit kommen“. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: SPD-Erfolg wegen Distanz zur Bundespartei? 06.46 Uhr: Die SPD um Spitzenmann Peter Tschentscher geht in Hamburg klar als Sieger aus der Wahl hervor. Und das obwohl die Sozialdemokraten nach aktuellem Stand im Vergleich zu 2015 6,6, Prozent der Stimmen einbüßen mussten. Im Vergleich mit der bundesweiten Tendenz ist dies allerdings ein durchaus gutes Ergebnis. Nun stellt sich die Frage, wie die Hamburger SPD dies geschafft hat. Ein Teil der Antwort ist wohl, dass die SPD in Hamburg vor der Wahl auf größtmögliche Distanz zur Bundespartei gegangen ist. Die neue eher linke Bundespartei-Spitze um Saskia Esken und Norbert Walter-Borjans trat etwa nicht im Wahlkampf auf. Peter Tschentscher baute sich sein eigenes Profil auf und hatte damit offenbar Erfolg. Eine Umfrage von infratest Dimap bei Hamburger Wählern ergab entsprechend, dass man bei der SPD in der Hansestadt wesentlich genauer weiß, wofür die Partei steht, als dies bei der Bundes-SPD der Fall ist. Unter allen Wählern gaben 60 Prozent der Befragten an, dass sie genau wissen, wofür die SPD in Hamburg steht. Mit Blick auf die Bundespartei antworteten nur 23 Prozent positiv auf dieselbe Frage. Unter SPD-Wählern war der Unterschied ähnlich klar: 86 Prozent wussten demnach wofür die Hamburg-SPD steht, wobei es nur 32 Prozent bei der Bundes-SPD waren. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: AfD atmet spät auf - FDP muss offenbar weiter zittern 05.37 Uhr: Bereits am Wahl -Sonntag hat der Hamburger Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf das Ergebnis der vereinfachten Auszählung der Landeslisten-Stimmzettel bekannt gegeben. Die Wahlbeteiligung lag demnach bei 63,3 Prozent . „Bei der vereinfachten Auszählung werden nur die eindeutig gültigen Stimmzettel berücksichtigt. Dem Ergebnis liegen die Schnellmeldungen aus allen Wahlbezirken zugrunde“, heißt es erklärend zu dem aktuellen Ergebnis vom Landeswahlleiter. Am Montag werden ab acht Uhr morgens die Landeslisten- und Wahlkreislisten-Stimmzettel vollständig ausgezählt. Erst dann steht das vorläufige Ergebnis fest. Nach dem aktuellen Ergebnis schaffen sowohl die FDP , als auch die AfD den Sprung in die Hamburger Bürgerschaft. Die Erleichterung bei den Liberalen war am Sonntag groß: „Das war eine Zitterpartie, natürlich. Aber wir können einiges ab. Wir sind Optimisten. Es liegt in unserer DNA. Wir haben es geschafft“, sagte FDP-Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels-Frowein am späten Sonntagabend. Allerdings könnte es für die FDP knapp werden, da von einer möglichen Stimmen-„Verwechslung“ berichtet wurde (siehe News von 05.28 Uhr). Ein vorläufiges amtliches Endergebnis wird erst für Montagabend erwartet. Das Ergebnis nach der vereinfachten Auszählung am Sonntag: Für die gesamte Ansicht bitte oben rechts auf „Bilderzoom“ klicken. © Landeswahlleiter Hamburg/hamburg.de Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Fällt die FDP noch aus der Bürgerschaft? Update vom 24. Februar 2020, 05.28 Uhr: Fällt die FDP doch noch aus der Hamburger Bürgerschaft heraus? Eine mögliche Verwechslung von Stimmen gefährdet den knappen Wiedereinzug aktuell. Im Wahlbezirk Hamburg-Langenhorn könnte es zu einer Verwechslung bei der Stimmerfassung gekommen sein. In einem Wahllokal kamen die Liberalen nach der vereinfachten Auszählung am Sonntagabend auf 22,4 Prozent, die Grünen hingegen nur auf 5,1 Prozent. Landesweit war das Ergebnis umgekehrt ausgefallen. „Auffällig ist das auf jeden Fall“, sagte Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. „Den Hinweis, dass es eine Auffälligkeit gibt, habe ich auch schon weitergegeben.“ Sollte es eine Verwechslung der Zuordnung gegeben haben, würden auf die FDP 423 Stimmen weniger entfallen als bisher angenommen. Da die Partei insgesamt nach den vorläufigen Zahlen nur um 121 Stimmen über der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde liegt, könnte dies dazu führen, dass sie den Einzug ins Stadtparlament doch noch verpasst. „Das kann durchaus ausschlaggebend sein“, sagte Rudolf. Alle Stimmen würden am Montag aber ohnehin erneut ausgezählt, so dass ein Irrtum dann auch festgestellt würde. News vom 23. Februar: SPD geht als Gewinner aus Hamburg-Wahl 2020 0.55 Uhr: Ohne belastbares Endergebnis, aber mit einigen Erkenntnissen endet der Wahlsonntag in Hamburg . Als Gewinner kann sich - trotz spürbarer Verluste - die SPD fühlen. Die Sozialdemokraten werden weiter den Ersten Bürgermeister stellen und verfügen mit Grünen und CDU über gleich zwei gesprächsbereite potenzielle Partner, die eine tragfähige Zweiter-Koalition ermöglichen. Ein seltener Luxus, angesichts der jüngsten Landtagswahlergebnisse im Allgemeinen und der schwachen Landtagswahl-Resultate der SPD im Speziellen. Die Grünen - als wahrscheinlichster Koalitionär - dürften Peter Tschentscher und Genossen aber vermutlich Zugeständnisse abverlangen. Die Ökopartei hat kräftigst hinzugewonnen. Bitter lief der Wahltag für die CDU , die ein historisch schlechtes Abschneiden verbuchte und sich nun einer weiter verschärften innerparteilichen Debatte ausgesetzt sehen könnte. Die FDP wähnte sich am Abend mit einem blauen Auge davongekommen. Auszählungsfehler könnten die Liberalen aber doch noch aus der Bürgerschaft befördern. Auch die AfD schrammte mit 5,3 Prozent der Stimmen nur knapp an einem Debakel vorbei. Alle drei Resultate könnten Auswirkungen auf den weiteren Kurs der Parteien haben . Spannend wird in jedem Fall die erneute und finale Auszählung der Stimmen am Montag. Wir halten Sie ab dem frühen Morgen über alle wichtigen Entwicklungen in Hamburg und Berlin auf dem Laufenden. Für heute beenden wir den Wahl-Ticker aus Hamburg und wünschen eine gute Nacht. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Ergebnisse von Grünen und FDP vertauscht? 0.26 Uhr: Die Berichte über möglicherweise vertauschte Ergebnisse von FDP und Grünen in einem Hamburger Wahllokal im Wahlbezirk Hamburg-Langenhorn sind auch bei der Landeswahlleitung angekommen. Tatsächlich könnten die Liberalen nun doch noch aus der Bürgerschaft herausfallen. „Auffällig ist das auf jeden Fall“, sagte Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf . „Den Hinweis, dass es eine Auffälligkeit gibt, habe ich auch schon weitergegeben.“ Sollte es eine Verwechslung der Zuordnung gegeben haben, würden auf die FDP 423 Stimmen weniger entfallen als bisher angenommen. Da die Partei insgesamt nach den vorläufigen Zahlen nur um 121 Stimmen über der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde liegt, könnte dies dazu führen, dass sie den Einzug ins Stadtparlament doch noch verpasst. „Das kann durchaus ausschlaggebend sein“, sagte Rudolf. Alle Stimmen würden am Montag aber ohnehin erneut ausgezählt , so dass ein Irrtum dann auch festgestellt würde. Dann müssen möglicherweise auch andere in den aktuellen Stand eingepreiste Ergebnisse auf den Prüfstand. Denn mittlerweile sind Beobachtern sogar weitere Seltsamkeiten aufgefallen. So berichteten User unter einem Posting des Portals wahlrecht.de auf Twitter, im Bezirk 41008 seien möglicherweise der CDU zu viele Stimmen zugerechnet worden. Die Christdemokraten kämen hier auf 34,9 Prozent, die Grünen nur auf 7,3 Prozent. Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: FDP freut sich über Wiedereinzug - doch es könnte anders kommen 0.19 Uhr: Ungeachtet der Unwägbarkeiten (siehe 23.31 Uhr) herrscht in der FDP am Abend Erleichterung über den mutmaßlichen Wiedereinzug in die Hamburgische Bürgerschaft . „Das war eine Zitterpartie, natürlich. Aber wir können einiges ab. Wir sind Optimisten. Es liegt in unserer DNA. Wir haben es geschafft“, sagte FDP- Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels-Frowein am späten Sonntagabend. Nach einem Wahlkrimi hatten die Liberalen nach vereinfachter Auszählung der für die Parteien auf den Landeslisten abgegebenen Stimmen genau 5,0 Prozent erreicht. Entsprechend frenetisch war die Stimmung der noch anwesenden FDP-Mitglieder im Braugasthaus „Altes Mädchen“. 0.00 Uhr: Der lange Hamburger Wahlabend neigt sich dem Ende entgegen. Noch sind einige Fragen offen - erst am Montagabend wird es wohl Klarheit darüber geben, ob die FDP tatsächlich den Sprung ins Parlament geschafft hat. Klar ist unterdessen: CDU, FDP und AfD gehören zu den Verlierern der Wahl. Das könnte nach Thüringen weitere Konsequenzen haben. Eine erste Analyse lesen Sie in diesem Artikel . Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Böses Erwachen für die FDP? Bericht über „vertauschte Ergebnisse“ 23.31 Uhr: Nach den ersten von der Landeswahlleitung kommunizierten Ergebnissen hat die FDP knappst den Sprung in die Hamburger Bürgerschaft bewältigt. Doch nach Ansicht des Portals wahlrecht.de könnte es für die Liberalen noch ein böses Erwachen geben: So ist nach Erkenntnissen der Webseite im Auszählungsbezirk Tweltenbeek 27 ein „offensichtlicher Fehler“ passiert. Hier sei die FDP mit 22,4 Prozent der Stimmen auf Rang zwei gekommen, die Grünen mit 5,1 Prozent auf Rang sechs - offenbar seien die Ergebnisse der beiden Parteien vertauscht worden. Stimmt das und ist das Ergebnis auch so in die Gesamtzahlen eingeflossen, könnte die FDP gut 420 Stimmen verlieren - und damit unter die Fünfprozenthürde rutschen. Laut wahlrecht.de trennen die Liberalen aktuell 120 Stimmen vom Verschwinden aus dem Landesparlament . Bei den nun publizierten Ergebnissen handelt es sich ohnehin noch nicht um das vorläufige amtliche Ergebnis, sondern nur um eine vereinfachte Vorauszählung. Ein vorläufiges amtliches Ergebnis soll am Montagabend veröffentlicht werden. 23.20 Uhr: Jetzt ist ein erstes Ergebnis der Hamburg-Wahl da: Wie die Landeswahlleitung mitteilt, kommen die Sozialdemokraten nach vereinfachter Auszählung der für die Parteien auf den Landeslisten abgegebenen Stimmen auf 39,0 Prozent. AfD und FDP würden demnach mit 5,3 beziehungsweise 5,0 Prozent in der Bürgerschaft bleiben . Die Grünen kämen als zweitstärkste Kraft auf 24,2, die CDU auf 11,2 und die Linke auf 9,1 Prozent. Ein vorläufiges amtliches Endergebnis wird erst für Montagabend erwartet. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Warten auf das Ergebnis - eine Partei muss weiter zittern 22.45 Uhr: Die nächste Hochrechnung aus Hamburg liegt vor. Anlass zur Freude dürften die Zahlen von infratest dimap der AfD geben: Die Partei liegt nun bei 5,3 Prozent, zunehmend deutlich zeichnet sich der Wiedereinzug in die Bürgerschaft ab. Anders die Lage bei der FDP - die Liberalen verharren weiter bei 5,0 Prozent, sie müssen weiter zittern. Möglicherweise ähnlich wie in Thüringen sogar bis zu einer zweiten Auszählung der Stimmen. Hierzu gibt es allerdings noch keine offiziellen Angaben. Ein Ergebnis war vom Statistischen Amt für Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein für 22.30 Uhr angekündigt worden. Bislang gibt es von der Behörde aber noch keine definitiven Zahlen. 22.20 Uhr: Bei „Anne Will“ im Ersten wird aktuell über die Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl debattiert. Die wichtigsten Wortmeldungen von Robert Habeck, Norbert Röttgen und Co. finden Sie in unserem Ticker zur Sendung . 22.16 Uhr: Ein bitteres Erlebnis ist die Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl am Sonntag nicht nur CDU, FDP und AfD geworden - ein Wähler ist bei der Stimmabgabe vor unangehme Hürden gestellt worden . Wende bei der Hamburg-Wahl? Weidel feiert, FDP droht erneut lange Zitterpartie 21.49 Uhr: Den neuesten Hochrechnungen zufolge könnte sich für die FDP die Zitterpartie der Thüringer Landtagswahl wiederholen : ARD und infratest dimap sehen die Partei weiterhin bei 5,0 Prozent - nach Angaben von Wahl-Moderator Jörg Schönenborn sogar bei 5,00 Prozent. Die AfD nimmt hingegen weiter Kurs auf die Hamburger Bürgerschaft. Sie wird aktuell auf 5,2 Prozent taxiert. Bundestagsfraktionschefin Alice Weidel schreibt in einem Tweet gar bereits vom „heutigen Wiedereinzug“. 21.17 Uhr: Es gibt erste Pressestimmen zur Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl - für die CDU fallen die Reaktionen teils verheerend aus. 21.02 Uhr: Ein interessanter Randaspekt der Bürgerschaftswahl : Die Erstwähler in Hamburg haben am Sonntag eine klare Präferenz gezeigt. 36 Prozent ihrer Stimmen gehen auf das Konto der Grünen, wie eine Auswertung des Instituts Infratest dimap für die ARD ergab. Auf Platz zwei folgt die SPD mit 24 Prozent, die Linke erhält 13 Prozent. Für die FDP votieren demnach immerhin sieben Prozent der Erstwähler - deutlich mehr als die Partei insgesamt laut Hochrechnungen erhält. Die CDU kommt bei den Erstwählern nur auf sechs Prozent der Stimmen, die AfD verbucht lediglich zwei Prozent der Stimmanteile, wie aus der Altersgruppenumfrage weiter hervorgeht. Zur Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg waren alle Staatsbürger im Alter ab 16 Jahren zugelassen. Die Hansestadt hatte das Wahlalter bereits 2013 gesenkt, um Jugendliche stärker an der Politik zu beteiligen. Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: Weitere Hochrechnungen sehen AfD über der Fünfprozenthürde 20.55 Uhr: Auch die neueste Hochrechnung der ARD sieht die AfD nun oberhalb der Fünfprozenthürde - 5,1 Prozent werden als aktueller Stand genannt. Damit würde die Partei sogar vor der FDP liegen, die hier weiter bei 5,0 Prozent verharrt. Das ZDF führt AfD und FDP momentan gleichauf bei jeweils genau fünf Prozent. Erste handfeste Ergebnisse sind vom Stastischen Amt übrigens für 22.30 Uhr angekündigt . 20.50 Uhr: Ein Thema an diesem Wahlabend ist auch die Berichterstattung der großen Fernsehsender : Während ARD-Mann Jörg Schönenborn um 18.00 Uhr nüchtern die Zahlen der ersten Prognose verkündete, ertönte plötzlich Jubel im Studio . Auch eine n-tv-Reporterin äußerte sich nicht besonders neutral zum Ergebnis . Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Unerwartete Wende für FDP und AfD? 20.38 Uhr: Gibt es für AfD und FDP doch noch eine Wende? Darauf könnte eine Hochrechnung des Statistischen Amtes für Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein hindeuten. Das Amt hat um 20.02 Uhr nach Auszählung von 37,7 Prozent der Stimmbezirke eine Hochrechnung vorgelegt , die die AfD bei 5,6 Prozent und die FDP bei 5,1 Prozent sieht. Damit würden beide Parteien in die Bürgerschaft einziehen. Ansonsten zeigt diese Erhebung jene Tendenzen, die zuletzt auch in den Hochrechnungen von ARD (infratest dimap) und ZDF (Forschungsgruppe Wahlen) erkennbar waren: Die SPD nähert sich hier der Marke von 40 Prozent (aktuell 39,6 Prozent), die Grünen kommen auf „nur“ 23,6 Prozent . In der ersten Prognose der Fernsehsender waren die Grünen noch deutlich oberhalb von 25 Prozent gelegen. Wahl in Hamburg: Kein Sitz für CDU-Spitzenkandid Weinberg? 20.28 Uhr: CDU-Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg schließt nicht aus, nach der Bürgerschaftswahl doch in Berlin zu bleiben und weiterhin sein Bundestagsmandat wahrzunehmen - ganz freiwillig wäre eine solche Entscheidung allerdings offenbar nicht. Es sei aufgrund des komplizierten Hamburger Wahlsystems denkbar, dass die CDU am Ende nur mit Wahlkreismandaten in die Bürgerschaft einziehe, sagt Weinberg im NDR. Damit würde ihm als höchstplatziertem Listenkandidaten ein Sitz verwehrt bleiben. Man müsse über eine Veränderung im Wahlsystem nachdenken, fordert Weinberg. Dies sei auch im Sinne vieler Wähler. Sollte er doch in die Bürgerschaft einziehen, werde er die Aufgabe wahrnehmen erklärt er - Versprechen müsse man einhalten. Bürgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg: Neue Hochrechnungen - AfD und FDP hoffen und bangen weiter 20.16 Uhr: Auch das ZDF hat nun eine neue Hochrechnung vorgelegt. Die Zahlen decken sich weitgehend mit jenen der ARD. Auch hier legt die SPD zu, FDP (5,0 Prozent) und AfD (4,9) müssen beziehungsweise dürfen weiterhin um den Einzug in den Bürgerschaft bangen und hoffen. 20.00 Uhr: Es geht langsam voran: Eine weitere Hochrechnung aus Hamburg ist publiziert worden. Nach Zahlen von infratest dimap/ARD kann die SPD noch einmal deutlich zulegen , auch zulasten der Grünen. Die Sozialdemokraten kommen nun auf 38,6 Prozent, die Grünen auf 24,8. Die AfD kommt der Fünfprozenthürde wieder etwas näher - 4,9 Prozent stehen aktuell zu Buche. Vom ZDF und der Forschungsgruppe Wahlen gibt es noch keine neue Daten. Wahlen in Hamburg: Erste Hochrechnungen liegen vor - AfD droht das Ausscheiden aus dem Parlament 19.25 Uhr: Jetzt liegen die ersten Hochrechnungen aus Hamburg vor. Allzu sehr unterscheiden sich die Zahlen nicht von den Prognosen von 18.00 Uhr. Die wichtigste Erkenntnis wohl: Der AfD droht wohl tatsächlich das Ausscheiden aus der Bürgerschaft . Die Hochrechnung von infratest dimap sieht die Partei weiterhin bei 4,7 Prozent. Die FDP bleibt bei 5,0 Prozent. Die Zahlen der aktuellen Hochrechnungen im Überblick: ARD/infratest dimap: SPD 37,6 Prozent (-8,0) / Grüne 25,4 (+ 13,1) / CDU 11,4 (-4,5) / Linke 9,1 (+ 0,6) / FDP 5,0 (-2,4) / AfD 4,7 (-1,4) ZDF/Forschungsgruppe Wahlen: SPD 37,8 Prozent (-7,8) / Grüne 25,4 (+13,1) / CDU 11,3 (-4,6) / Linke 9,5 (+ 1,0) / FDP 5,0 (-2,4) / AfD 4,7 (-1,4) 19.23 Uhr: Der Hamburger AfD-Spitzenkandidat Dirk Nockemann sieht das mögliche Ausscheiden seiner Partei aus der Bürgerschaft als \"Ergebnis einer maximalen Ausgrenzungskampagne\". Die Hamburger AfD habe in Umfragen lange konstant bei sieben bis acht Prozent gelegen, sagte Nockemann am Sonntagabend im Norddeutschen Rundfunk. \"Nach Thüringen ging es dann runter\", fügte er hinzu. Mit Blick auf den offenbar rassistisch motivierten Anschlag in Hessen sagte er, man habe \"nach Hanau so getan, als hätte die AfD den Finger am Abzug gehabt\". \"Das ist schon unerträglich, was sich in den letzten drei Tagen hier in Hamburg abgespielt hat\", sagte er mit Blick auf Anfeindungen gegenüber seiner Partei. \"Diese Kampagne war geeignet, uns die wesentlichen Prozentpunkte zu nehmen.\" In einer am Sonntag veröffentlichten Umfrage halten 60 Prozent der Befragten die AfD mitverantwortlich für den offenbar rassistisch motivierten Anschlag in Hessen. Jubel über einen bundesweiten Abriss der ansteigenden AfD-Ergebnisse wäre verfrüht, kommentiert unterdessen der Münchner Merkur *. Bürgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg: Bittere Verlust für CDU, FDP und AfD - eine Folge von Thüringen? 19.13 Uhr: Linkspartei, SPD und Grüne in Thüringen sehen in dem Hamburger Wahlergebnis ebenfalls eine Folge der Vorgänge in ihrem Bundesland. \"Die schweren Verluste für CDU, FDP und AfD zeigen, wie sehr die Wählerinnen und Wähler den Tabubruch vom 5. Februar auch an der Wahlurne bestrafen\", erklärte die Thüringer Linke-Landesvorsitzende Susanne Hennig-Wellsow am Abend in Erfurt. \"Die Hamburgerinnen und Hamburger haben den Rechtspopulisten die rote Karte gezeigt und auch der FDP klar gemacht, dass es keinerlei auch indirekte Zusammenarbeit mit dieser Partei geben darf\", erklärt Thüringens SPD-Chef Wolfgang Tiefensee. \"Das Ergebnis der AfD zeigt, dass Machenschaften auf Kosten der Demokratie von den Wählerinnen und Wählern verurteilt werden\", erklärten auch die Thüringer Grünen-Vorsitzenden Ann-Sophie Bohm-Eisenbrandt und Bernhard Stengele. 19.06 Uhr: Auch die CDU wäre zu einem rot-schwarzen Bündnis in Hamburg bereit. „Wir schließen das nicht aus“, es gehe um wichtige Weichenstellungen für Hamburg, sagt Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg im ZDF: „Wir sind bereit zu Gesprächen.“ Der Ball liege allerdings im Feld der SPD. Die Runde der Spitzenkandidaten in der Wahlsendung des ZDF wagt auch erste Analysen: Thüringen sei „eine schwere Hypothek gewesen“, sagt FDP-Politikerin Anna-Elisabeth von Treuenfels-Frowein. Das Ergebnis habe auch etwas „ mit Hanau und Thüringen zu tun“, mutmaßt Linke-Frontfrau Cansu Özdemir. 19.00 Uhr: Die erste Hochrechnung lässt unterdessen weiter auf sich warten. ARD und ZDF hatten mit ersten Zahlen gegen 19.00 Uhr bis 19.15 Uhr gerechnet. Grund für die späte Veröffentlichung erster Auszählungsauswertungen sei das komplizierte Hamburger Wahlsystem. 18.57 Uhr: SPD-Spitzenkandidat Peter Tschentscher bewertet die ersten Prognosen erwartungsgemäß positiv. Sollte sich das „Ergebnis bestätigen“, könne man zufrieden sein. Zugleich sei das mögliche Ausscheiden der AfD aus der Bürgerschaft eine „großartige Botschaft, die von Hamburg ausgeht.“ Seine erste Wahl für die Zukunft sei eine rot-grüne Koalition , erklärt er. Es seien allerdings auch andere Bündnisse möglich. Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg 2020: FDP bangt und sucht Gründe - „Thüringen hat durchaus Bedeutung gehabt“ 18.51 Uhr: FDP-Chef Christian Lindner galt schon vor der Verkündung der ersten Prognosen als angeschlagen - auch aufgrund seiner Rolle bei der Thüringer Ministerpräsidentenwahl. Auf Frage von ZDF-Moderatorin Bettina Schausten weist er allerdings zurück, er habe im Fall Thüringen „zu lange laviert“. Richtig sei, dass Hamburg schon vor Thüringen ein schwieriges Pflaster für die FDP gewesen sein. Das Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen von SPD und Grünen habe die Liberalen Stimmen gekostet, mutmaßt Lindner. „Keine Legendenbildung“ fordert Lindner auf die Frage, ob die FDP für eine Unterstützung von AfD-Vorstöße eine Quittung kassiert habe. Zwar habe man in Hamburg in der Vergangenheit „harmlose Anträge der AfD“, etwa beim Thema Zigarettenkippen auf Bürgersteigen unterstützt - aber: „Das wird nicht mehr passieren“, nach „Erfurt und der Verschlagenheit der AfD“, betont der FDP-Chef. „Selbst bei harmlosen Anträgen der AfD“ werde es keine Zustimmung der FDP mehr geben. Zuvor hatte Lindner auf der Berliner Wahlparty der FDP erklärt, die Partei brauche heute Abend einmal mehr „starke Nerven“. Ein Ergebnis wie in Hamburg sei „eine Niederlage“ für die FDP. 18.43 Uhr: Auch Hamburgs FDP-Chefin Katja Suding macht die Vorgänge in Thüringen für das schwache Abschneiden ihrer Partei mitverantwortlich. „Wir kennen ja auch schon erste Zahlen, die zeigen, dass das für unsere Wähler durchaus eine Bedeutung gehabt hat. Deswegen war es ganz wichtig, dass wir uns hier in Hamburg auch ganz klar distanziert haben von den Vorgängen in Thüringen“, sagt Suding im NDR. 18.30 Uhr: Die Grüne Katharina Fegebank sieht am Mikrofon der ARD einen „ganz klaren Auftrag der Wählerinnen und Wähler, dass es so weiter gehen soll“ - die Grünen regieren bereits seit 2015 mit der SPD. Die Partei ist nach den aktuellen Zahlen die einzige in der Hamburger Bürgerschaft , die deutlich zugelegt hat. 20 zusätzliche Sitze können der Öko-Partei winken; die Linke könnte ein Mandat hinzugewinnen. Zugleich haben die Grünen in Hamburg ihr bislang zweitbestes Ergebnis bei Landtagswahlen hingelegt. 18.26 Uhr: CDU-Generalsekretär Paul Ziemiak findet in Berlin klare Worte für den sich abzeichnenden Wahlausgang: Es sei ein „ bitterer Tag für die CDU Deutschlands “ sowie „ein historisch schlechtes Wahlergebnis“ für die Hamburger CDU. Die Ereignisse in Thüringen hätten der Hamburger CDU nicht geholfen, auf ihre programmatischen Punkte hinzuweisen, konstatiert er. Weitere Reaktionen auf das Hamburger Wahlergebnis finden Sie übrigens auch in diesem Überblick bei Merkur.de *. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Kipping sieht Klatsche für „Kemmerich-Koalition“ - CDU mit historisch schlechtem Ergebnis 18.15 Uhr: Linke-Chefin Katja Kipping deutet das Ergebnis als Strafe für jene Parteien, die „im Zweifelsfall mit der AfD stimmen“ - natürlich eine Anspielung auf die Vorkommnisse in Thüringen . „Die Kemmerich-Koalition hat verloren“, sagt sie vor Genossen in Berlin. Tatsächlich kommen CDU, FDP und AfD zusammen den ersten Prognosen zufolge nur noch auf rund 21 Prozent der Stimmen. Noch bis 2008 hatten konservative bis rechte Kräfte in Hamburg regelmäßig mehr als 50 Prozent der Stimmen auf sich vereinigt. 2001 hatte die Schill-Partei fast 20 Prozent erhalten. Im Vergleich zur vergangenen Bürgerschaftswahl beträgt der kummulierte Verlust von CDU, FDP und AfD aktuell allerdings „nur“ rund acht Prozentpunkte. 18.14 Uhr: Die CDU rutscht den aktuellen Zahlen zufolge übrigens auf ihr bundesweit schlechtestes Ergebnis bei Landtagswahlen seit knapp 70 Jahren. 18.10 Uhr: Zum Vergleich die Zahlen der ersten Prognose des ZDF beziehungsweise der Forschungsgruppe Wahlen: Hier kommt die SPD auf 38,0 Prozent, die Grünen auf 25,5. Die CDU rangiert etwas schwächer als bei der ARD (11,0 Prozent). Die FDP liegt auch hier bei 5,0 Prozent, die AfD minimal besser als in den Zahlen von infratest dimap, aber ebenfalls unterhalb der Fünfprozenthürde (4,8 Prozent). 18.08 Uhr: Die Grüne-Spitzenkandidatin Katharina Fegebank zeigt sich bei der Wahlparty ihrer Partei im Club Knust in Hamburg-St. Pauli trotz des deutlichen zweiten Platzes zufrieden: „Ich bin total gerührt“, sagt sie. CDU-Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg spricht vor seinen Parteifreunden offen von einem „schlechten Ergebnis“. Bürgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg: SPD kann zwischen Grünen und CDU wählen 18.05 Uhr: Rechnerisch möglich wäre für die SPD sowohl ein erneutes Bündnis mit den Grünen , als auch ein Schwenk zu einer „Großen Koalition“ - die freilich in Hamburg den Namen angesichts des CDU-Ergebnisses nicht mehr verdient. Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz gibt am ARD-Mikrofon allerdings schon jetzt die Richtung vor: Eine Koalition, die in der Bevölkerung so großes Vertrauen genieße wie Rot-Grün , habe bei den Verhandlungen Priorität, sagt der Amtsvorgänger von Peter Tschentscher. Gleichwohl obliege die Entscheidung des Hamburg-SPD. 18.03 Uhr: Die Grünen dürften das Ergebnis mit einem lachenden und einen weinenden Auge sehen: Einerseits hat sich die Öko-Partei verglichen mit der Bürgerschaftswahl 2015 mehr als verdoppelt - andererseits ist der Griff von Katharina Fegebank nach dem Bürgermeister-Amt doch vergleichsweise deutlich gescheitert. Wahl in Hamburg: FDP und AfD müssen um Einzug in die Bürgerschaft bangen - CDU erneut abgestraft 18.02 Uhr: Damit scheint schon jetzt klar: Peter Tschentscher (SPD) kann das Amt als Erster Bürgermeister wohl verteidigen. Die CDU kassiert eine bittere Schlappe. Die FDP muss um den Einzug in die Bürgerschaft bangen - für die AfD sieht es schon jetzt vergleichsweise düster aus. 18.01 Uhr: Hier die erste Prognose nach Zahlen von infratest dimap im Auftrag der ARD: SPD: 37,5 / Grüne: 25,5 / CDU: 11,5 / Linke: 9,0 / FDP: 5,0 / AfD: 4,7 / Sonstige: 6,8 Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: Vorläufiges Endergebnis wohl erst am Montag 17.56 Uhr: In wenigen Minuten gibt es erste Prognosen aus Hamburg . Bis zum vorläufigen amtlichen Endergebnis werden die Hamburger aber lange warten müssen. Aufgrund des komplizierten Wahlsystems wird es ein solches wohl erst am Montagabend geben. Auch erste Hochrechnungen werden erst für 19.15 Uhr erwartet. Nach Schließung der Wahllokale werden zunächst nur die Stimmen für die Parteien auf den Landesstimmzetteln ausgezählt, sodass am späten Sonntagabend nur die voraussichtliche Verteilung der 121 Bürgerschaftssitze auf die Parteien feststehen wird. Wie sich diese Stimmen auf die einzelnen Kandidaten der Landeslisten verteilen, wird bei einer erneuten Auszählung der Landesstimmzettel ermittelt, die zusammen mit jener der Wahlkreisstimmzettel am Montagmorgen beginnt. 17.44 Uhr: Bei der CDU dürfte die Vorfreude auf die Verkündung der ersten Prognosen eher gering sein. In den Umfragen waren die Christdemokraten seit Ende 2019 konstant im Sinkflug - zuletzt gaben nur noch zwölf Prozent der Befragten an, die Partei von Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg wählen zu wollen. Damit könnte eine bemerkenswerte Misserfolgsgeschichte ihre Fortsetzung finden: Noch im Februar 2008 waren 42,6 Prozent der Stimmen bei der Bürgerschaftswahl auf die CDU entfallen. Seither könnte die Partei - stimmen die letzten Umfragen - fast drei Viertel ihrer Wähler verloren haben. Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: Auch AfD bangt - Wahlaufrufe auf Twitter 17.32 Uhr: Mit Spannung wird in Hamburg auch auf das Wahlergebnis der AfD geblickt. Anders als bei den zurückliegenden Landtagswahlen dürfte die rechtspopulistische Partei in der Hansestadt um den Sprung über die Fünfprozenthürde ringen müssen. Letzte Umfragen sahen die AfD bei 5-6 Prozent der Stimmen. Auf Twitter werben Politiker und Aktivisten für den Urnengang - mit dem erklärten Ziel, die AfD aus der Bürgerschaft fernzuhalten. „Nie war es leichter, die AfD aus einem Parlament zu kicken - wenn viele demokratisch und antifaschistisch wählen zu gehen“, schrieb etwa SPD-Vize Kevin Kühnert . Auch die AfD selbst ist sich offenbar des Einzugs nicht sicher: Die Partei brauche „jede Stimme“, twitterte der Bundestagsabgeordnete Stephan Brandner noch um 17 Uhr. 17.20 Uhr: Bei der Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl deutet sich eine deutlich steigende Wahlbeteiligung an. Bis 16.00 Uhr gaben 57 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten ihre Stimme ab, wie die Landeswahlleitung mitteilte. Bei der Bürgerschaftswahl 2015 hatten eine Stunde später, um 17.00 Uhr, erst 52,3 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten abgestimmt. Am Ende hatte die Beteiligung 56,5 Prozent betragen und war damit auf den niedrigsten Stand seit 1949 gefallen. Die Wahllokale schließen um 18.00 Uhr. Bürgerschaftswahl Hamburg kurz nach Thüringen: Folgt die Wählerstrafe für Lindner und die FDP? 16.41 Uhr: Die FDP muss an diesem Abend um den Wiedereinzug in die Hamburger Bürgerschaft zittern. Laut ZDF-Politbarometer kommen die Liberalen aktuell auf fünf Prozent. Eine recht knappe Vorhersage. 2105 kam die FDP in Hamburg noch auf 7,4 Prozent. Schafft es die FDP nicht in die Bürgerschaft, kann das als Strafe der Wähler für das Wahldebakel in Thüringen gewertet werden. Nicht nur hatte sich dort der FDP-Kandidat Thomas Kemmerich mit Stimmen der AfD ins Ministerpräsidentenamt wählen lassen. Auch scheint bis heute die Rolle von FDP-Chef Christian Lindner nicht ganz klar. Lindner hatte sich zwar wiederholt für das Debakel und seine erste Reaktion darauf entschuldigt. Doch in Hamburg sieht es aktuell nicht so aus, als könnten die FDP und er sich so leicht aus der Affäre ziehen. 16.10 Uhr: Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD), der frühere Erste Bürgermeister von Hamburg, hat sich unerwartet auf den Weg in die Hansestadt gemacht. Die Hamburg-Wahl 2020 fällt mit dem Abschlusstag des G20-Finanzministertreffens in Riad zusammen. Scholz hat von dort aus frühzeitig die Heimreise angetreten, wie das Handelsblatt berichtet . Zur Begründung seiner Rückreise nach Hamburg sagte er demnach lapidar: „Weil ich dort wohne.“ Vermutlich will der Vizekanzler den erwarteten Wahlsieg seines Nachfolgers Dr. Peter Tschentscher (ebenfalls SPD) zusammen mit seinen Hamburger Parteifreunden feiern. 15.05 Uhr: Was bedeutet die Wahl für CDU und FDP ? Nach aktuellem stand droht den beiden Parteien nach dem Wahldebakel in Thüringen die nächste Katastrophe. Die FDP könnte nach der letzten Prognose sogar unter die fünf Prozent-Hürde fallen. Das wäre fatal und könnte auch das Aus für Linder als FDP-Chef bedeuten. Auch die CDU liegt laut Umfragen mit 12 Prozent auf so schlechtem Kurs wie noch nie in Hamburg. Hamburg-Wahl: Wahlbeteiligung fällt sehr hoch aus 14.59 Uhr: Bei der Hamburger Bürgerschaftswahl zeichnet sich eine größere Beteiligung ab als bei der Wahl vor fünf Jahren. Bis 14.00 Uhr gaben 46,4 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten ihre Stimmen ab, wie das Landeswahlamt mitteilte. Bei der Bürgerschaftswahl 2015 hatten bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt 38,5 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten abgestimmt. 2015 war die Wahlbeteiligung insgesamt auf das historische Tief von 56,5 Prozent gefallen. Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf hatte sich zuversichtlich geäußert, dass die Beteiligung diesmal wieder auf über 60 Prozent steigt. Wie die Hamburger gewählt haben, wird in dern ersten Prognosen um 18 Uhr zu sehen sein. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Kommt ein grünes Wunder? CDU und FDP droht bitterer Tag Hamburg - Welche Auswirkungen haben die politischen Ereignisse in ganz Deutschland auf die Hamburg-Wahl 2020 ? Diese Frage dürfte zumindest einige der großen Parteien im Vorfeld bewegen, denn die aktuelle Lage ist für manche Beteiligte vor der Bürgerschaftswahl sehr kompliziert geworden. Besonders die CDU und die FDP sind unter Druck geraten. Und das, während sie in der Hansestadt sowieso schon eine schwierige Ausgangslage erwarten mussten. +++ Hier finden Sie am Wahlabend alle Ergebnisse, Gewinne und Verluste im Überblick +++ Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Wie wird sich die CDU-Krise auswirken? In der CDU ist der Machtkampf ausgebrochen. Klar ist, dass Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer den Parteivorsitz abgeben wird - mehrere mögliche Nachfolger haben bereits öffentliches Interesse an dem Posten bekundet. Die Voraussetzungen für Marcus Weinberg, Spitzenkandidat der CDU in Hamburg , sind deshalb alles andere als rosig. Wenn es um seine Partei geht, stehen kurz vor der Wahl oft die bundespolitischen Akteure im Fokus. Die Umfragewerte von zuletzt 12 bis 13 Prozent für die CDU sahen in Hamburg wenige Wochen zuvor noch um mehrere Prozentpunkte besser aus. Ausgelöst wurden die Probleme rund drei Wochen vor der Hamburg-Wahl durch den Eklat im Thüringer Landtag. Ein FDP-Ministerpräsident, der sich mit den Stimmen von CDU und AfD wählen ließ, wurde zum Skandal und selbst jetzt setzt sich die Krise in Thüringen fort und wirft ihren Schatten bis nach Hamburg . Auch die Liberalen in Hamburg könnten dadurch einen Schaden erleiden. Sie wurden Mitte Februar erstmals in den Monaten vor der Wahl von einem großen Umfrage-Institut unterhalb der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde verortet. Dass es nach der Bürgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg eine bürgerlich-konservative Koalition geben könnte, ist nach menschlichem Ermessen ausgeschlossen. Die AfD und die Linke dürften jeweils mit einem einstelligen Ergebnis in die Bürgerschaft einziehen. Die letzten Prognosen vor der Bürgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg Alles deutet darauf hin, dass in Hamburg eine rot-grüne Koalition die Mehrheit bekommt. Der SPD wird mit ihrem amtierenden Ersten Bürgermeister Dr. Peter Tschentscher ein Ergebnis deutlich über 30 Prozent vorhergesagt. Zusammen mit den Grünen , deren Umfragewerte zwischen 23 bis 29 Prozent schwankten, ist eine völlig stabile Mehrheit absehbar. Spannend wird am Wahlabend aber die Frage, ob die Grünen weiter aufholen können. In Einzelfällen wurden sie 2020 schon gleichauf oder knapp hinter der SPD verortet. Bei der Hamburg-Wahl hat Katharina Fegebank * also noch eine Chance darauf, die grüne Erste Bürgermeisterin zu werden. Das Rennen an der Spitze konzentriert sich auf diese zwei Kandidaten und das Ergebnis von SPD und Grünen. Erstes Ergebnis der Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg schon am Sonntag zu erwarten Die ersten Prognosen der Wahlforschungsinstitute werden am Wahlsonntag wie immer um 18 Uhr erscheinen. Voraussichtlich wird sich bereits zu dieser Zeit andeuten, ob Dr. Peter Tschentscher oder Katharina Fegebank sich durchsetzen kann. Anschließend werden nach und nach die bereits ausgezählten Wahllokale in die Hochrechnungen einbezogen, bis schließlich später am Abend ein vorläufiges Ergebnis der Bürgerschaftswahl in Hamburg vorliegt.

Ihren Gesetzentwurf „zum Schutz vor Konversionsbehandlungen “ ( 19/17278 ) hat der Bundestag am Freitag, 6. März 2020, nach erster Lesung zur weiteren Beratung an den federführenden Gesundheitsausschuss überwiesen. An den Gesundheitsausschuss überwies das Parlament auch einen Antrag der Fraktion Bündnis 90/Die Grünen mit dem Titel „Gefährlichen Pseudotherapien mit dem Ziel der Änderung der sexuellen Orientierung ein Ende setzen“ ( 19/7931 neu). Die Grünen hatten sich mit der Linken die Federführung beim Ausschuss für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend gewünscht, konnten sich aber in der Abstimmung nicht gegen die Mehrheit der übrigen Fraktionen durchsetzen. Freiheitsstrafe von bis zu einem Jahr vorgesehen Medizinische Interventionen, die darauf gerichtet sind, die sexuelle Orientierung oder die selbstempfundene geschlechtliche Identität einer Person gezielt zu verändern oder zu unterdrücken (sogenannte Konversionstherapien), sollen künftig verboten werden, lautet das Ziel des Regierungsentwurfs. Die Verbote gelten für alle Personen. Bei Fürsorge- und Erziehungsberechtigten soll die Strafbarkeit auf Fälle der gröblichen Verletzung der Fürsorge- oder Erziehungspflicht beschränkt werden. Verstöße sollen laut Bundesregierung mit einer Freiheitsstrafe von bis zu einem Jahr oder einem hohen Bußgeld geahndet werden. Grüne fordern Öffentlichkeitskampagne Die Grünen schreiben in ihrem Antrag, Homosexualität sei keine Krankheit, sondern Teil der menschlichen Natur und eine geschützte Ausprägung der Persönlichkeit. Dies sei auch von der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) 1990 mit der Streichung von Homosexualität von der Liste psychischer Krankheiten. Daher fordern sie die Bundesregierung unter anderem auf, gemeinsam mit dem Gemeinsamen Bundesausschuss die Richtlinien des Leistungskatalogs der gesetzlichen Krankenkasse zu überprüfen, damit solche Pseudotherapien nicht unter anderen Leistungen abgerechnet werden können. Zudem soll die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung und die Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für die Belange der Patienten eine Öffentlichkeitskampagne starten, die über die Vielfalt sexueller Orientierungen, geschlechtlicher Identitäten und die Gefährlichkeit sogenannter „Konversionstherapien“ aufklärt.

Photograph: Christian Mang/Reuters Coronavirus This article is more than 5 years old Germany takes tentative steps back to normality as lockdown eases This article is more than 5 years old Shops start reopening, but Merkel warns Germans to stay ‘disciplined and watchful’ Coronavirus – latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage Kate Connolly in Potsdam Mon 20 Apr 2020 20.42 BST First published on Mon 20 Apr 2020 20.11 BST Share As shops across parts of Germany took their first tentative steps back to normality since lockdown rules were introduced a month ago, Andreas Trost took stock at the window of a haberdashery in the Potsdam district of Babelsberg, west of Berlin. “Not exactly life as we’ve known it,” he said, reading the sign in the window which said that customers would only be allowed to enter in controlled numbers “as long as you don’t partake in small talk”, that browsing was not allowed – and please wash your hands before entering. Whilst Trost said he was looking forward to “something of the eerie mood in the empty streets” disappearing, he said he also had some trepidation about the move, which will see small shops of up to 800 sq m reopen. “I’m quite nervous about the relaxation of the rules in that I’m concerned that people will no longer take the illness seriously, and we could soon end up with another lockdown,” the customer service adviser for Berlin Water Works said. “The sense of solidarity which was obvious at the beginning is starting to disintegrate. And as long as I can’t hug my friends, I won’t feel that life is anything like normal.” Simon, one of 10,000 secondary school students in the state of Brandenburg due to take their exams on Monday, under strict hygiene and physical distancing rules, said he was glad that he was being allowed to sit exams at all after some authorities discussed rewarding exam certificates based on average marks instead. “I didn’t fancy being labelled my whole life as being one of those forced to get the ‘emergency Abitur’,” he said, ahead of a geography exam and sipping on a latte bought from a cafe selling drinks from behind a perspex window in its doorway. “Even though it’s been an uncertain few weeks, which might affect my performance, I’m glad to have the proper chance to show what I can do. Though the situation is far from normal,” he added. Kerstin Seefeldt, owner of Script Buchhandlung in Babelsberg. ‘It has been an intense and rewarding time of mutual solidarity,’ she says. Photograph: Kate Connolly Kerstin Seefeldt was stacking the shelves of her Babelsberg bookshop, Script, eagerly preparing for a reopening on Wednesday. “I’m really looking forward to seeing my customers properly again,” she said. “I’m organising the shop so that the tables of books are like a labyrinth and customers can avoid coming into contact with each other.” Only two customers will be allowed at a time in the 30 sq m space, she said. Seefeldt ran a thrice-daily bicycle delivery service for customers during the shutdown. “It has been an intense and rewarding time of mutual solidarity. But I know that the situation is far from normal, and so I will now keep up the delivery service for people considered to be in a risk category because I’m aware that things cannot go back to normal for a long time yet, even if the shop is able to open,” she said. She added she was relieved to have been helped through a financially difficult period by a government investment grant of €9000, news of which had reached her that morning. Germany: coronavirus deaths The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Germans on Monday to remain “disciplined and watchful”, and warned that if attitudes towards the pandemic relaxed too quickly, another tougher lockdown may follow. “We must not lose track of the fact that we continue to be at the start of this pandemic and are far from out of the woods,” she said. Thanking Germans for – by and large – sticking to the rules of staying at home and keeping physical distance, Merkel said a lot had so far been achieved. “The infection is under control to the extent that it is not climbing exponentially any more,” she said. But a “rash easing” of the restrictions was in danger of unleashing the “unknown”, she warned. Acknowledging the plight of many people, including artists, single parents and restaurant managers,Merkel said Germans should not be “lulled into a false sense of security”. If the infection rate began to rise – which would first be visible in the statistics in two weeks’ time – “a new shutdown would be unavoidable” and that had to be prevented for the sake of the economy, she said. View image in fullscreen Protesters against coronavirus lockdown rules in Berlin at the weekend are said to have included conspiracy theorists. The sign reads ‘Vaccination terrorism’. Photograph: Christian Mang/Reuters But there are signs that social tensions are rising in parts of the country, and the sense that this is a critical moment in tackling the virus is keenly felt. At the weekend, police struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning on Berlin’s Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz against what they saw as constraints placed on their basic rights due to the so-called Corona Verordnungen, or regulations. Amongst the protesters were anti-vaxxers, well-known conspiracy theorists, and rightwing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship. Other similar demonstrations have taken place elsewhere across Germany . By Monday afternoon German health authorities had reported a total of 146,000 confirmed infections and 4735 deaths. The reproduction rate was slightly higher than on Friday, at 0.8, but anything under one is being considered a success by decision-makers.

        "text": "PrÃ¤sident VoÃkuhle verabschiedet sich mit einem Denkzettel an die Politik aus Karlsruhe: Stichwort âultra viresâ Aufregung in Karlsruhe: Das BVerfG erklÃ¤rt das PSPP der EZB fÃ¼r kompetenzwidrig, ebenso sei eine Entscheidung des EuGH ultra vires. Damit wendet sich das BVerfG erstmalig in seiner Geschichte direkt gegen die Rechtsprechung des EuGH. Was hat das fÃ¼r Folgen? Â Worum geht es? In Karlsruhe haben die Richter vom BVerfG mit einem Urteil fÃ¼r Aufsehen gesorgt. Im Verfahren geht es um das seit lÃ¤ngerer Zeit umstrittene Programm der EZB, in dem sie StaatsanleihenkÃ¤ufe betreibt. Das BVerfG hat dieses Vorgehen nun beanstandet und es fÃ¼r kompetenzwidrig erklÃ¤rt. Mit diesem Urteil wendet sich unser hÃ¶chstes Gericht direkt gegen den EuGH. Damit hat das BVerfG sich erstmals in seiner Geschichte gegen die europÃ¤ischen Richter gestellt. Es wird daher vermutet, dass das Urteil Auswirkungen hat, die Ã¼ber die Geldpolitik hinausgehen. Die Entscheidung kÃ¶nnte das VerhÃ¤ltnis der nationalen Gerichte der Mitgliedstaaten zum EuGH nachhaltig prÃ¤gen. Â Streit um die RechtmÃ¤Ãigkeit vom EZB-Anleihenprogramm Das Verfahren geht schon Ã¼ber einige Jahre. Mehrere Personen hatten Verfassungsbeschwerden eingelegt, die sich gegen das Anleihekaufprogramm der EZB wenden. Sie monierten das sogenannte Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP), an dem die Deutsche Bundesbank beteiligt ist. Seit 2015 kauft die EZB Staatsanleihen an, damit sich Staaten finanzieren kÃ¶nnen. Durch dieses Instrument sollen Deflationen vorgebeugt werden, die Wirtschaften der einzelnen Staaten profitieren erheblich davon â schlieÃlich betrÃ¤gt das Volumen der AnkÃ¤ufe mittlerweile mehr als 2, 6 Billionen Euro. Problematisch ist aber nun folgendes: Die EZB hat als europÃ¤ische Institution nur die Kompetenzen, die ihr von den Mitgliedstaaten Ã¼bertragen wurden. GrundsÃ¤tzlich hat sie daher nur ein Mandat fÃ¼r die WÃ¤hrungspolitik. Durch ihr Handeln besteht aber ein naturgemÃ¤Ãer Zusammenhang zur Wirtschaftspolitik. DafÃ¼r hat sie aber keine eingerÃ¤umte Kompetenz, denn Wirtschaftspolitik ist Sache der Nationalstaaten. Der EZB ist in den EU-VertrÃ¤gen lediglich eingerÃ¤umt, âdie allgemeine Wirtschaftspolitikâ der EU zu unterstÃ¼tzen. Gerichtlich wird daher seit Jahren gestritten: Welches wirtschaftspolitische AusmaÃ haben die StaatsanleihenkÃ¤ufe, die als wÃ¤hrungspolitische MaÃnahmen gelten? Mit ihren Verfassungsbeschwerden streben die BeschwerdefÃ¼hrer eine KlÃ¤rung der Legitimationsfrage EZB an. Sie befÃ¼rchten, dass der Ankauf von Staatsanleihen vielmehr eine verdeckte Staatsfinanzierung sei, die zu Lasten der Steuerzahler gehen wÃ¼rde. Dazu sei die EZB nicht legitimiert. Â EuGH sieht kein Problem Dem EuGH wurde 2017 vom BVerfG mehrere Fragen zu diesem Verfahren vorgelegt. Dieses sieht in dem PSPP keine Probleme. Die europÃ¤ischen Richter fÃ¼hrten aus, dass dadurch zwar auch ein Einfluss auf die Gesamtwirtschaft bestehe. Dieser sei aber zwangslÃ¤ufig und zulÃ¤ssig, da im Vordergrund das wÃ¤hrungspolitische Vorgehen stÃ¼nde â und sei daher von den eingerÃ¤umten Kompetenzen gedeckt. Â BVerfG: Urteil des EuGH sei âultra viresâ Die Sache kam zurÃ¼ck nach Karlsruhe. Erneut mussten sich die Richter dem Programm der EZB annehmen â und schreiben nun Rechtsgeschichte. Erstmals befindet das BVerfG, dass europÃ¤ische Organe offensichtlich kompetenzwidrig gehandelt haben. Die EZB habe kompetenzwidrig gehandelt, ebenso sei das Urteil des EuGH â das keinen VerstoÃ feststellte â âultra viresâ. Ultra vires bedeutet âJenseits der Gewaltenâ und beschreibt eine klare KompetenzÃ¼berschreitung eines europÃ¤ischen Organs. Diese kÃ¶nnen nur in den MaÃstÃ¤ben tÃ¤tig werden, die ihnen von den Nationalstaaten Ã¼bertragen wurden â es gilt das Prinzip der EinzelermÃ¤chtigung. ZunÃ¤chst musste der BVerfG das billigende Urteil des EuGH als ultra vires erklÃ¤ren, damit es seine Rechtskraft verliert. Das BVerfG findet fÃ¼r das Urteil erstaunlich starke Worte. Es bezeichnete die Kontrolle der VerhÃ¤ltnismÃ¤Ãigkeit als âschlechterdings nicht mehr nachvollziehbarâ, der EuGH habe die âBedeutung und Tragweite des auch bei der Kompetenzverteilung zu beachtenden Grundsatzes der VerhÃ¤ltnismÃ¤Ãigkeit offensichtlichâ verkannt. Die BegrÃ¼ndung des EuGH sei âmethodisch nicht mehr vertretbarâ. Der EuGH sei damit seiner Kontrollaufgabe gegenÃ¼ber der EZB nicht nachgekommen, weil dieser die tatsÃ¤chlichen wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen des PSPP Ã¼berhaupt nicht einbezogen hatte. Es sei zu einem AbwÃ¤gungsausfall gekommen. Durch die ErklÃ¤rung des EuGH-Urteils als ultra vires hat es keine bindende Wirkung fÃ¼r Deutschland.Â Nachdem das BVerfG das europÃ¤ische Urteil fÃ¼r ultra vires erklÃ¤rte, fuhr es mit dem Programm der EZB fort. Die Karlsruher Richter kritisieren das PSPP schon lÃ¤nger, daher ging die Frage auch zur KlÃ¤rung an den EuGH â die nun vom BVerfG anders beantwortet wurde. Das PSPP sei als unverhÃ¤ltnismÃ¤Ãig anzusehen. Die Richter rÃ¼gten die nicht transparente BegrÃ¼ndung der VerhÃ¤ltnismÃ¤Ãigkeit, sprich: Es hÃ¤tte besser begrÃ¼ndet werden mÃ¼ssen, wie man bei Festlegung des Programms abgewogen hat. Aus Karlsruhe wurde sich eine bessere Dokumentation gewÃ¼nscht, ob die EZB tatsÃ¤chlich Ã¼ber so viel Geld verfÃ¼gen musste, um ihre wÃ¤hrungspolitischen Ziele zu erreichen. Diese seien aktuell nicht von auÃen nachvollziehbar, kÃ¶nnten daher nicht gerichtlich kontrolliert werden. Die EZB habe somit jenseits ihrer Kompetenzen gehandelt. Â WÃ¤hrungspolitische Folgen Direkt betroffen von dem Urteil des BVerfG ist die Deutsche Bundesbank, die am PSPP teilnimmt. KÃ¼nftig darf sie nur weiter mitmachen, wenn seitens der EZB nachvollziehbar dargelegt wurde, dass die âangestrebten wÃ¤hrungspolitischen Ziele nicht auÃer VerhÃ¤ltnis zu den damit verbundenen wirtschafts- und fiskalpolitischen Auswirkungen stehenâ. Die EZB hat nun drei Monate Zeit, um AusfÃ¼hrungen zum PSPP nachzureichen. Sollte ihr dies nicht gelingen, kann die Bundesbank an dem Programm nicht weiter teilhaben. Â Folge fÃ¼r die europÃ¤ische Rechtsgemeinschaft Spannend ist aber auÃerdem die Frage, welche Auswirkungen das Vorgehen des BVerfG auf die europÃ¤ische Rechtsgemeinschaft haben wird. Es wird vermutet, dass diese negativ ausfallen. Das BVerfG gilt unter den nationalen Gerichtsbarkeiten als Vorbild. Nun haben die Richter aber die Rechtsprechung aus Luxemburg angezweifelt und als ultra vires erklÃ¤rt. Dieses Vorgehen kÃ¶nnte Einfluss auf andere nationale Gerichtsbarkeiten haben. Die wÃ¤hrungspolitische Streitigkeit wird sich im Laufe der Zeit klÃ¤ren lassen, das VerhÃ¤ltnis zum EuGH kÃ¶nnte aber einen Schaden erlitten haben.

April 2020 Presse- und Informationsamt der Bundesregierung (BPA) Die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der Länder fassen folgenden Beschluss: Nachdem es Deutschland in international beachteter Weise gelungen ist, die Neuinfektionszahlen durch das SARS-Cov2-Virus zu reduzieren, haben die Länder auf der Grundlage des gemeinsamen Beschlusses mit der Bundeskanzlerin seit dem 20. April schrittweise erste Öffnungsmaßnahmen umgesetzt. Es ist noch zu früh, um anhand der gemeldeten Neuinfektionen beurteilen zu können, ob sich diese Öffnungsmaßnahmen trotz der Hygieneauflagen verstärkend auf das Infektionsgeschehen ausgewirkt haben. Diese Beurteilung und die damit verbundene Entscheidung, ob ein weiterer größerer Öffnungsschritt möglich ist, soll am 6. Mai in einer weiteren Besprechung der Bundeskanzlerin mit den Regierungschefinnen und -chefs der Länder erfolgen. Bund und Länder arbeiten während dessen weiter intensiv daran, das Infektionsgeschehen durch ein breites Maßnahmenbündel so gut wie möglich zu kontrollieren und das Gesundheitswesen zu stärken. Nur mit einer erfolgreichen Infektionskontrolle und konstant niedrigen Neuinfiziertenzahlen kann dauerhaft erreicht werden, dass die Öffnungen Bestand haben und keine Rückkehr zu deutschlandweiten Beschränkungen erforderlich wird. Zugleich werden Wirtschaftshilfen und sozialen Leistungen auf den Weg gebracht, um die negativen Folgen der Krise abzumildern. Bund und Länder wägen bei allen Entscheidungen deren Wirkung in gesundheitlicher, sozialer und wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht sorgfältig gegeneinander ab. Die ständig zunehmenden wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse über dieses neuartige Virus und viele interdisziplinäre Expertenmeinungen fließen dabei in die Entscheidungsfindung ein. Die Verantwortung für die Entscheidungen liegt bei Bund und Ländern, für die angesichts des Umstandes, dass es sich um eine Situation ohne Beispiel mit vielen noch schwer abschätzbaren Risiken handelt, ein vorsichtiges Vorgehen in regelmäßigen Schritten und ein besonders strenger Maßstab für vorübergehend notwendige Grundrechtseinschränkungen das leitende Prinzip für verantwortbares Handeln ist. Vor diesem Hintergrund vereinbaren die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der Länder: 1. Die gemeinsamen Beschlüsse sowie die begleitenden ChefBK/CdS-Beschlüsse sowie die Entscheidungen des Corona-Kabinetts bleiben gültig, soweit im Folgenden nicht abweichende Festlegungen getroffen werden. 2. Wesentliches Element der Infektionskontrolle ist die vollständige Kontaktnachverfolgung bei allen Neuinfizierten. Wenn die Kontaktnachverfolgung nicht gelingen würde, bestünde die große Gefahr, dass eine neue Infektionsdynamik entsteht. Deshalb bauen die Länder lageangepasst erhebliche Personalkapazitäten (ein Team aus 5 Personen je 20.000 Einwohner) auf. Seit dem 24. April melden alle Gesundheitsämter über die zuständigen Landesbehörden an das Robert-Koch-Institut, ob die vollständige Kontaktnachverfolgung gewährleistet, gefährdet oder bereits aktuell nicht mehr möglich ist. Dies ermöglicht den Ländern, diese Kapazitäten bei besonders betroffenen Gesundheitsdiensten sofort aufzustocken und vom Bund die dort aufgebauten Kontaktnachverfolgungsteams von RKI, Bundeswehr und aus dem Medizinstudenten-Programm „Medis4ÖGD“ anzufordern. Die möglichst vollständige Kontaktnachverfolgung ist die Grundvoraussetzung für weitere Öffnungsschritte und ein wichtiger Maßstab für die Bewertung der Frage, welche Neuinfiziertenzahlen im mehrtätigen Mittel toleriert werden können. 3. Die bisherige epidemiologische Entwicklung in Deutschland hat gezeigt, dass es durch lokale Ereignisse immer wieder zu besonderen regionalen Betroffenheiten bei der Ausbreitung des SARS-Cov2-Virus kommt. Deshalb bereiten Bund und Länder weiter schnell abrufbare Unterstützungsmaßnahmen für besonders betroffene Gebiete vor und stimmen sich dabei zwischen den Krisenstäben von Bund und Ländern weiter eng ab. Wenn die deutschlandweit erzielten Erfolge in der Verlangsamung des Infektionsgeschehens nicht gefährdet werden sollen, muss auf eine regionale Dynamik mit hohen Neuinfektionszahlen und schnellem Anstieg der Infektionsrate sofort reagiert werden. Dazu gehört auch, dass die umfassenden Beschränkungen , die vor dem 20. April gültig waren, vor Ort sofort wieder konsequent eingeführt werden müssen. Darüber hinaus können auch Beschränkungen nicht erforderlicher Mobilität in die besonders betroffenen Gebiete hinein und aus ihnen heraus im Einzelfall geboten sein. Wenn es erneut zu einer überregionalen Infektionsdynamik kommt, die eine Überforderung des Gesundheitssystems befürchten lässt, müssen die Beschränkungen auch in allen Ländern ganz oder teilweise wieder eingeführt werden. 4. Am 13. März 2020 haben die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der Länder die Kliniken in Deutschland aufgefordert, ab dem 16. März 2020 alle medizinisch nicht zwingend notwendigen planbaren Aufnahmen und Operationen zu verschieben, um sich auf die nicht vorhersehbare Zahl von COVID-19-Erkrankten frühzeitig vorzubereiten und intensivmedizinische Kapazitäten vorzuhalten sowie aus- und aufzubauen. Aktuell werden etwa 40 Prozent der Intensivbetten – bei finanziellem Ausgleich – freigehalten. Die aktuelle Entwicklung der COVID-19-Infektionszahlen und die präzise Übersicht, die durch das DIVI-IntensivRegister ermöglicht wurde, lässt es nun zu, dass ein etwas größerer Teil der Krankenhauskapazitäten wieder für planbare Operationen genutzt werden kann. Dies ist auch deswegen geboten, weil sich eine dauerhafte ausschließliche Priorisierung nur einer bestimmten Patientengruppe unter Ausschluss anderer Gruppen von Erkrankten nicht rechtfertigen lässt. Gleichzeitig sollen ausreichend COVID-19-Behandlungskapazitäten freigehalten und an die jeweilige Pandemieentwicklung angepasst werden. Für die Umsetzung hat der Bund ein kriterienbasiertes Konzept vorgelegt, unter dessen Berücksichtigung die Länder ab sofort die regionale Steuerung unter Beachtung der regionalen Besonderheiten vornehmen können. Das DIVI-IntensivRegister zur Steuerung der Intensivkapazitäten in Deutschland wird aktuell zu einem Tool weiterentwickelt, das anhand bekannter Parameter eine Prognose für den COVID-19-bedingten Bedarf an Intensivbetten bundesweit und regional für die nächsten zwei Wochen vorhersagt. Dieses Tool wird vom Bundesministerium für Gesundheit weiter gefördert und im laufenden Betrieb beständig weiter verbessert und ausgebaut. 5. Großveranstaltunge n wie z.B. Volksfeste, größere Sportveranstaltungen mit Zuschauern, größere Konzerte, Festivals, Dorf-, Stadt-, Straßen-, Wein-, Schützenfeste oder Kirmes-Veranstaltungen sind derzeit untersagt. Wegen der immer noch gegebenen Unsicherheit des Infektionsgeschehens ist davon auszugehen, dass dies auch mindestens bis zum 31. August so bleiben wird. Ab wann und unter welchen Bedingungen kleinere öffentliche oder private Veranstaltungen oder Feiern sowie Veranstaltungen ohne Festcharakter künftig stattfinden können, ist derzeit aufgrund der in diesem Bereich besonders hohen Infektionsgefahr noch nicht abzusehen und abhängig vom weiteren epidemiologischen Verlauf. 6. Die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der Länder bekräftigen ihren Dank an die Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften , die mit dem notwendigen Verzicht auf die öffentliche Durchführung von Gottesdiensten und Gebetsveranstaltungen trotz hoher Feiertage in den vergangenen Wochen einen wichtigen Beitrag geleistet haben, um die Verbreitung des Coronavirus einzudämmen. Die jetzt auch durch diese Maßnahmen erreichten Erfolge lassen daher eine schrittweise Lockerung der Maßnahmen zu. Auch aufgrund des besonderen Schutzes der Freiheit der Religionsausübung im Grundgesetz ist es im Zuge der Überprüfung der beschränkenden Maßnahmen geboten, Versammlungen zur Religionsausübung wieder zu ermöglichen, soweit bei ihrer Durchführung den besonderen Anforderungen des Infektionsschutzes Rechnung getragen wird. Vor dem Hintergrund des partnerschaftlichen Verhältnisses von Staat und Religionsgemeinschaften in Deutschland haben Länder und Bundesinnenminister mit den Kirchen und großen Religionsgemeinschaften deren umfassende Konzepte für die Durchführung von Gottesdiensten und religiösen Handlungen unter Beachtung des Infektionsschutzes vorbesprochen und hieraus eine Übersicht hinsichtlich der von den Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften vorgesehenen Maßnahmen erstellt. Versammlungen zur Religionsausübung (Gottesdienste und Gebetsveranstaltungen) sollen fortan wieder stattfinden können. Für Weltanschauungsgemeinschaften gelten die Ausführungen entsprechend. Die Einzelheiten regeln die Länder. 7. Spielplätze können mit Auflagen wieder geöffnet werden, um Familien neben Grünanlagen und Parks zusätzliche Aufenthaltsmöglichkeiten im öffentlichen Raum zu bieten. 8. Unter Auflagen zur Hygiene, zur Steuerung des Zutritts und zur Vermeidung von Warteschlangen können folgende Kultureinrichtungen wieder geöffnet werden: a. Museen, Ausstellungen und Galerien b. Gedenkstätten, sowie c. zoologische und botanische Gärten. Voraussetzung ist, insbesondere bei kleinen und historischen Gebäuden, dass diese Auflagen räumlich und personell umgesetzt werden können. Die Beauftragte für Kultur und Medien wird gebeten, kurzfristig ein Förderprogramm in Höhe von zunächst 10 Mio. € für corona-bedingte Umbaumaßnahmen in kleinen und mittleren Museen aufzulegen. 9. Der Chef des Bundeskanzleramts und die Chefinnen und Chefs der Staats- und Senatskanzleien werden beauftragt, auf der Grundlage der Empfehlungen der jeweiligen Fachministerkonferenzen Beschlussvorschläge für den 6. Mai zur schrittweisen weiteren Öffnung von Schulen , zur weiteren Öffnung von Kinderbetreuungsangeboten und zur schrittweisen Wiederaufnahme des Sportbetriebes zu erarbeiten. 10. Die zuständigen Fachministerkonferenzen werden beauftragt, bis zu der auf den 6. Mai folgenden Konferenz der Bundeskanzlerin mit den Regierungschefinnen und -chefs der Länder Vorschläge für Rahmenbedingungen schrittweiser Öffnungen von Gastronomie- und Tourismusangeboten und für die weiteren Kultureinrichtungen vorzubereiten.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said he was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers. Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma. His team says he was poisoned on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation. The Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. \"Where are the facts, where are the formulas, at least some kind of information?\" she asked. Navlany 'Novichok poisoning' test for the West What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the latest attack , external as \"outrageous\". \"The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done,\" he tweeted. What has Germany said? After the government in Berlin released results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory, Chancellor Merkel said there were now \"serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer\". \"Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms.\" Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Navalnyâs team sees Kremlin behind attack Chancellor Merkel said Germany's Nato and EU partners had been informed of the results of the investigation and they would decide on a common and appropriate response based on Russia's reaction. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya and Russia's ambassador to Germany would also be informed of the findings, the Berlin government said. The European Union has demanded a \"transparent\" investigation by the Russian government. \"Those responsible must be brought to justice,\" a statement read , external . Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also called for an inquiry in a tweet , external , while the US National Security Council (NSC) said the suspected poisoning was \"completely reprehensible\". \"We will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities,\" an NSC spokesman said , external . Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud. It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny's faced over the years tell a different story about his impact. He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the \"Navalny problem\" for good. The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation. The \"collapse\" is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious. Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come. What happened to Navalny? Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. The flight of the prominent Putin critic was diverted to Omsk, where doctors treated him for three days before he was transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Navalny's transfer to Germany came after three days in hospital in Omsk The Kremlin says Russian doctors administered atropine - which can be used to treat the effects of nerve agents - but found no evidence of poisoning. Mrs Navalnaya said she feared Russian doctors had delayed his transfer as authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear. Doctors at CharitÃ© hospital have said his condition is continuing to improve but he remains in an intensive care unit on a ventilator. What is Novichok? The name Novichok means \"newcomer\" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they can be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. In 2018, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill in the British city of Salisbury, after Russian suspects were alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on the door handle of the former Russian spy's home. What is the Salisbury poisoning's legacy? Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Her partner became critically ill but recovered. Who is Navalny? Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He has called Mr Putin's party a place of \"crooks and thieves\" that is \"sucking the blood out of Russia\". However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. Who else has been poisoned? In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko - an ex-Russian intelligence officer who became a Kremlin critic and fled to the UK - died after his tea was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210. More recently, journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and two years later went into a coma for a week. Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He too was treated by Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital, and asked the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation to arrange Mr Navalny's airlift there.",

He is in a coma after drinking what his supporters suspect was poisoned tea; they accuse the authorities of trying to conceal a crime. Doctors treating him in Omsk had insisted on Friday that he was too ill to be moved. But they later said his condition was stable enough for the flight. His wife Yulia travelled with him. On Saturday morning, Mr Navalny's medical evacuation flight - paid for by the German non-governmental organisation Cinema for Peace - landed at Tegel airport in Berlin. He is being treated at the German capital's CharitÃ© hospital, which has said it does not expect to release a statement about his condition before Monday. The founder of the Cinema for Peace Foundation, activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj, told reporters outside the hospital that Mr Navalny's condition was \"very worrying\". \"It's not only about the question if he will survive this,\" he said. \"It's a question what kind of damage there is, if he will survive this and come back to normal fully.\" Image source, EPA Image caption, Mr Navalny is in a coma on life support Mr Navalny's personal doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, was not allowed to see him while he was in hospital in Russia. But she said she was hopeful he could recover now that he was in Germany. \"I'm sure that they can treat him and do everything to eliminate this toxic agent from his body.\" Medical staff treating Mr Navalny at the hospital in Omsk said before his flight that his life was not in immediate danger. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, earlier tweeted: \"Massive thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning.\" Ms Yarmysh said it was a pity that doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. Image source, EPA Image caption, The medical evacuation flight arrived at Tegel airport in Berlin on Saturday morning Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday, and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media appeared to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea. Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he had heard the activist \"screaming in pain\". What the doctors said on Friday The head doctor at the hospital where Mr Navalny was being treated in Omsk, Alexander Murakhovsky, warned late on Friday that doctors did not recommend flying \"but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic\". \"The patient's condition is stable,\" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia's vociferous Putin critic Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight on Thursday \"As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility,\" Dr Kalinichenko said. Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a \"metabolic disorder\" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency that the chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity , external , but its concentration was impossible to establish. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. What do Mr Navalny's supporters say? At a news conference in Berlin on Friday, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but had abruptly stopped doing so. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Medical experts from Germany were allowed to see Mr Navalny \"[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,\" he said. \"The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to CharitÃ© possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves.\" In 2018, the Cinema for Peace Foundation arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembled the \"poisoning\" of her ex-husband. \"What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,\" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: \"I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere.\" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a \"speedy recovery\". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has described the incident as \"unacceptable\" , external and vowed that, if elected, he would \"stand up to autocrats like Putin\". After Mr Navalny was flown to Germany, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted , external : \"It is vital that there is a full & transparent investigation into his poisoning.\" Timeline: Navalny targeted April 2017: He was taken to hospital after an antiseptic green dye was splashed on his face in Moscow. It was the second time he was targeted with zelyonka (\"brilliant green\" in English) that year. \"It looks funny but it hurts like hell,\" he tweeted following the attack.

The vote in the Bundestag (parliament) on Thursday makes defiling foreign flags equal to the crime of defiling the German flag. The same applies for the EU anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy theme. The move followed Social Democrat (SPD) complaints about protesters' burning of the Israeli flag in Berlin in 2017. Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht, a member of the centre-left SPD, said \"burning flags publicly has nothing to do with peaceful protests\". She said it stoked up \"hatred, anger and aggression\", and hurt many people's feelings. The new law also applies to acts of defilement besides burning, such as publicly ripping a flag up. Public display of the Nazi swastika and other Nazi symbols is already banned in Germany. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has condemned the new law as \"excessive interference in free speech and artistic expression\". The act of defiling the Union Flag in the UK is not a crime, but France has made desecration of the tricolour punishable by a fine of up to €7,500 (£6,600; $8,000) or six months in jail.

The incident occurred after a daylong demonstration by tens of thousands of people opposed to the wearing of masks and other government measures intended to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Police ordered the protesters to disband halfway through their march around Berlin after participants refused to observe physical distancing rules, but a rally near the capital’s iconic Brandenburg Gate took place as planned. Footage of the incident showed hundreds of people, some waving the flag of the German Reich of 1871-1918 and other far-right banners, running toward the Reichstag building and up the stairs. Police confirmed on Twitter that several people had broken through a cordon in front of parliament and entered the staircase of the Reichstag building, but not the building itself. Force had to be used to push them back. Stones and bottles were also thrown, police said. Germany’s top security official condemned the incident. “The Reichstag building is the workplace of our parliament and therefore the symbolic centre of our liberal democracy,” the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said in a statement. “It’s unbearable that vandals and extremists should misuse it.” He called on authorities to show zero tolerance. Earlier, thousands of far-right extremists had thrown bottles and stones at police outside the Russian embassy. Police detained about 300 people throughout the day. Berlin’s regional government had tried to ban the protests, warning that extremists could use them as a platform and citing anti-mask rallies earlier this month where rules intended to stop the virus from being spread further were not respected. Protest organisers successfully appealed against the decision on Friday, though a court ordered them to ensure physical distancing. Failure to enforce that measure prompted Berlin police to dissolve the march while it was still in progress. During the march, which authorities said drew about 38,000 people, participants expressed their opposition to a wide range of issues, including vaccinations, face masks and the German government in general. Some wore T-shirts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory, while others displayed white nationalist slogans and neo-Nazi insignia, though most participants denied having far-right views. Uwe Bachmann, 57, said he had come from southwestern Germany to protest for free speech and his right not to wear a mask. “I respect those who are afraid of the virus,” he said, wearing a costume and a wig that tried to evoke stereotypical Native American attire. He suggested, without elaborating, that something else was behind the pandemic. Germany figures Another protester said he wanted Germany’s current political system abolished and a return to the constitution of 1871 on the grounds that the country’s postwar political system was illegal. Providing only his first name, Karl-Heinz, he said he had travelled with his sister from their home near the Dutch border to attend the protest and believed that the coronavirus cases being reported in Germany now were false positives. Germany has seen an upswing in new cases in recent weeks. The country’s disease control agency reported on Saturday that Germany had recorded almost 1,500 new infections over the past day. Germany has been praised for its handling of the pandemic, and the country’s death toll of some 9,300 people is less than a quarter of the amount of people who have died of Covid-19 in Britain. Opinion polls show overwhelming support for the prevention measures imposed by authorities, such as the requirement to wear masks on public transport, in stores and some public buildings such as libraries and schools. Along the route were several smaller counter-protests where participants shouted slogans against the far-right’s presence at the anti-mask rally. “I think there’s a line and if someone takes to the streets with neo-Nazis, then they’ve crossed that line,” said Verena, a counter-protester from Berlin who declined to provide her surname. In London, hundreds of people crowded into Trafalgar Square for a Unite for Freedom protest against government lockdown restrictions and the wearing of face masks. The Metropolitan police warned demonstrators that anyone attending a gathering of more than 30 people may be at risk of committing a criminal offence.

State Premier Winfried Kretschmann said burqas and niqabs did not belong in a free society. A similar rule for teachers was already in place. https://p.dw.com/p/3febV Image: Reuters/S. Wermuth Advertisement The government of the western German state of Baden-Württemberg agreed on Tuesday to ban full-face coverings, often known as burqa or niqab, in schools. The new rule comes as the topic of Muslim face coverings has been hotly debated in Germany and follows a ruling by a court in Hamburg that reversed that city's own ban. Baden-Württemberg's city council's decision to ban full-face coverings, typically worn by ultra-conservative Muslim girls, matches the ban for teachers that is already in effect. State Premier and prominent Green politician Winfried Kretschmann conceded that cases of full-face veiling in schools were rare, but said that nonetheless, a legal ruling was necessary for the rare cases. Kretschmann said that full-face veiling did not belong in a free society. But he added that such a ban at the university level, where students are adults, was a more complex question. For now, the rule in Baden-Wurttemberg will only apply to primary and secondary education. Read more: German authorities, politicians divided on niqab, burqa ban Controversial debate splits the Green party Proponents of full-face bans in Germany say they are necessary to protect young girls, that forcing or encouraging them to wear them infringes on their rights. Prominent members of conservative parties, including Julia Klöckner in Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), have called for a nationwide full-face veil ban. The Greens have been split on the issue, but in the case of school kids in Baden-Württemberg, they sided with the CDU. Baden-Württemberg Green party leaders Sandra Detzer and Oliver Hildenbrand have previously referred to the burqa and the niqab \"symbols of oppression.\" Read more: Where are 'burqa bans' in Europe? But opponents say that such rulings can lead to the marginalization of Muslim communities in Germany. A school student in Hamburg recently fought and won a legal battle allowing her to wear the attire, though the court noted that a ban might be possible if the state's school laws were altered, which local politicians are now working on. Filiz Polat, migration policy spokesperson for the Greens'  federal parliamentary group, has said that the freedom to wear religious symbols or not was one of the features of a democratic society. Currently, full-face veils have been banned in neighboring countries such as The Netherlands, France, Denmark and Austria. A 2019 YouGov poll released found that 54% of respondents in Germany would support a ban on burqas. jcg/msh (epd, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement",

Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has extended and tightened the country's coronavirus lockdown as its death toll surpassed 35,000. The leader made the announcement after meeting with the country's 16 state governors to decide on the length of a possible continuation and to what extent schools will reopen. The state and federal governments agreed most non-food shops, bars, restaurants, cultural and leisure facilities and schools will remain closed, as well as new rules being brought in, Merkel said. \"We must further reduce our social contacts in order to fight\" the pandemic, the Chancellor added. The lockdown measures currently in place initially took effect on December 16, after a partial lockdown failed to calm case numbers, and were set to expire on January 10. Now, under even tighter new rules, people in areas that are considered hotspots for the virus will not be allowed to travel over 15 km from their homes without a good reason. And those arriving in the country that have come from a destination deemed to be high risk will have to provide two negative test results, with a mandatory five-day quarantine even in cases where the first test is negative. The restrictions in meetings in private will be limited to one other person from outside the household. On Tuesday, Germany’s disease control agency said 11,897 more coronavirus cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours, up from 9,847 registered on Monday. This puts the country fifth in a tally of COVID-19 infections in Western Europe, behind the UK, France, Italy, and Spain. At least 944 deaths were reported on Tuesday, taking the official coronavirus death toll to 35,518, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). However, the agency said delays in reporting over the festive period could have affected the figures. Vaccinations against COVID-19 kicked off in Germany on December 26 and, in the nation of 83 million, nearly 265,000 vaccinations had been reported by Monday, RKI said. Germany has carried out a relatively fast vaccination rollout compared to many of the other EU27 member states. But it has faced criticism that it has failed to procure enough vaccine doses to speed up the nationwide campaign amid the high infections and hospitalisations. France, for example, inoculated just 516 people in the first week since the vaccine was delivered. One reason for the delay is that France took a more cautious strategy to vaccinations, requiring a pre-vaccination visit and the express consent of the person being vaccinated, according to experts. The EU bloc itself was also facing increased pressure to justify its COVID-19 vaccine plan, with member countries complaining about a lack of doses and a slow rollout. Markus Söder, the minister-President of Bavaria - Germany's largest region - described the European Commission’s process for buying and approving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as \"inadequate\", in an interview with German tabloid Bild am Sonntag. But Merkel said she supported the bloc's policy of securing vaccines for all 27 countries, adding it didn't make sense for Germany to try and get jabs on its own. Along with the Netherlands, Germany is investigating delaying giving out second doses of its coronavirus vaccines in an effort to inoculate more people. Two jabs are required for the highest-possible immunity - the European Medicines Agency (EMA) says the second dose should be given with six weeks of the first to ensure maximum protection. But with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the only jab to have got EMA approval so far, offering short-term efficacy from the first dose, some scientists have suggested a longer gap between doses.

The concept was a topic of discussion presented by Austrian identitarian Martin Sellner at a secret meeting of right-wing extremists in Potsdam, near Berlin, in November 2023, attended by members of the AfD.

Authorities in Brandenburg state, which surrounds Berlin, said on Friday that a farmer found three of a 14-strong herd of water buffalo dead in Hoenow, just outside the capital’s city limits. Germany’s national animal health institute confirmed that foot-and-mouth disease had been detected in samples from one animal, and the rest of the herd was slaughtered. It wasn’t clear how the animals were infected. A 72-hour ban on transporting cows, pigs, sheep, goats and other animals such as camels and llamas in Brandenburg went into force Saturday. Berlin’s two zoos closed starting Saturday as a preventive measure. Their management noted in a statement that while the virus isn’t dangerous to humans, it can stick to their clothing and be transmitted. Authorities said that around 200 pigs at a farm in Ahrensfelde, near where the outbreak was detected, would be slaughtered as a precaution.

AfD leaders have faced problems with some of the group's past activities. https://p.dw.com/p/4p4kr The JA has long been a thorn in the side for the party leadership of the AfD Image: Sebastian Kahnert/dpa/picture alliance Advertisement The party leadership of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday voted to replace its \"Young Alternative\" (JA) group with a new one under greater party oversight. The decision, ahead of the early February 23 parliamentary election , comes after Germany's domestic intelligence service classified the JA as a confirmed extremist movement . What changes are planned? The JA is relatively independent. Members of the association — with the exception of the board members — do not have to be in the AfD. That would not be possible in the new organization, except for under-16s, who would not yet be able to join the AfD as members. The board's proposal was approved after a lively debate at a two-day party conference in the eastern German town of Riesa, having achieved the two-thirds majority required for the rule change. Board members have suggested the name \"Patriotic Youth\" for the organization. A now-adopted change in the statutes stipulates that the youth organization's activities \"must not contradict the order and principles of the party.\" It says the AfD and its youth organization — for members up to the age of 36 — should \"promote each other's activities to the best of their ability.\" The party leadership has long been dissatisfied with the JA, saying its difficult-to-control activities could bring the entire party into disrepute. Germany's BfV domestic intelligence services in 2023 said it had found indications that there was enough evidence that the JA had aspirations against the free democratic basic order for it to be treated as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization. German protesters block far-right AfD congress To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The AfD leadership hopes that the reform will give it more control over misconduct in the JA. Experts also see the motivation as being that the AfD Youth, if it is no longer an independent association, would be better protected from any possible ban. The BfV is monitoring the national AfD party as a suspected right-wing extremist group, with several state-level party organizations already having classified as such. How optimistic is the AfD about its electoral prospects? On Saturday, the party's 600-odd delegates approved co-leader Alice Weidel as the AfD's chancellor candidate ahead of the general election. The vote caps an eventful week for Weidel, who on Thursday was hosted by Donald Trump ally and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk for a wide-ranging livestream on his X social media platform. The AfD is in second place in opinion polls, averaging 20% percent, while one survey on Saturday gave them 22%. The conservative CDU/CSU is leading at 31% while Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats are battling for third place with their Green coalition partners on 15% and 14% respectively. In her speech, Weidel bashed the CDU/CSU, branding them a \"party of cheats\" and adding that her goal was to overtake them. Despite the high showing, the AfD has little chance of being part of Germany's next government. Because of Germany's Nazi past, cooperation with the far-right remains a major taboo there. rc/lo (AFP, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement",

The suspect, a former asylum-seeker who was supposed to be leaving Germany, was arrested. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that authorities must clear up why the suspect was still in the country. He said the attack, a month before a national election in which curbing irregular migration is a major issue , must have consequences. The attack occurred just before noon in a park in Aschaffenburg, a city of about 72,000 people. Bavaria’s top security official, Joachim Herrmann, said the assailant attacked the boy, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, with a kitchen knife. He said the 2-year-old of Moroccan origin was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who was passing by and appeared to have intervened to protect the other children. Bavarian officials said two adults and a 2-year-old Syrian girl were injured and taken to a hospital for treatment, and none of their lives were in danger. Other passers-by chased the suspect and he was arrested 12 minutes after the attack, Herrmann said. RELATED COVERAGE A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Russia claims its deadly attack on Ukraine’s Sumy targeted military forces as condemnation grows He said the suspect, a 28-year-old Afghan national, had come to authorities’ attention at least three times because of acts of violence. On each occasion, he was sent for psychiatric treatment and later released. The suspect is believed to have arrived in Germany in November 2022 and applied for asylum in early 2023, Herrmann said. On Dec. 4, he told authorities that he would leave the country voluntarily and would seek papers from the Afghan consulate. A week later, German authorities formally closed asylum proceedings and told him to leave. Police will work over the coming days to identify his motive, Herrmann said, adding that suspicions so far point to his psychiatric illness. A first search of his room at a refugee home found no evidence that he had radical Islamic views, and only turned up medicine that would fit with his psychiatric treatment, he said. The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany’s national election. Scholz issued a strongly-worded statement condemning what he called “an incomprehensible act of terror.” “I am tired of such acts of violence happening here every few weeks — by perpetrators who came to us to find protection here,” he said. “Mistaken tolerance is inappropriate here. Authorities must clear up at high pressure why the attacker was still in Germany at all.” That must lead to “immediate consequences — it is not enough to talk,” Scholz added. He didn’t elaborate. Following a knife attack by an Afghan immigrant in Mannheim in May that left a police officer dead and four more people injured, Scholz vowed that Germany would start deporting criminals from Afghanistan and Syria again. He vowed to step up deportations of rejected asylum-seekers following a knife attack in Solingen in August in which a suspected Islamic extremist from Syria is accused of killing three people. At the end of August, Germany deported Afghan nationals to their homeland for the first time since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. ___ Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report.",

Photo-Illustration: Wired Staff/Getty Save this story Save Save this story Save On Thursday, Elon Musk agreed with the leader of a far-right German political party that Adolf Hitler was a communist and that left-wing groups who support Palestinian causes have more in common with Nazis than with her own party. The deeply weird and disinformation-filled conversation between Musk and Alice Weidel, the leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), took place on X. It came after weeks of Musk’s efforts to boost the far-right party, which has deep links to neo-Nazism and has been surveilled for suspected extremism by Germany’s own intelligence services. “[Hitler] was a communist, and he considered himself as a socialist,” Weidel said in response to Musk asking about media reports linking the AfD to Nazism. “The biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite,” Weidel said. “He wasn't a conservative, he wasn't a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite.” “Right,” Musk responded. In his autobiography Mein Kampf , Hitler—who as leader of the German Reich was responsible for the invasion of the Soviet Union and the enslavement and death of millions of its citizens—repeatedly describes communism as an enemy of the German nation. He believed that Marxism was a Jewish conspiracy to control Germany and the world. Weidel also compared the Nazi Party’s views to those of modern-day left-wing political groups who support Palestine in the face of what a UN commission has called crimes against humanity conducted by Israel . While her AfD colleagues were last month seen attending a secretive meeting organized by former members of a militant neo-Nazi group known for burning the Israeli flag, she said, “The AfD is the ​​only protector of the Jewish people here in Germany.” Weidel is the AfD’s candidate for chancellor in Germany’s snap elections, which take place next month. As someone who previously worked in finance and lives in Switzerland with her wife, who is from Sri Lanka, and their children, she has been presented as a relatively moderate face for the party. This is something Musk picked up on in an op-ed he penned last month for a German newspaper. \"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka,” Musk wrote. “Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Ahead of the conversation on Thursday, the EU said that it would be monitoring the event to see if it was artificially promoted to voters in Germany, something which would be in violation of the region’s sweeping Digital Service Act rules. A European Commission spokesperson told WIRED it would not be commenting on the contents of the livestream. Weidel referenced the EU’s preoccupation with the conversation, claiming 150 officials at the EU commission were listening in, then claimed the DSA was a censorship tool, before adding: “You know what Adolf Hitler did? He switched off free speech. He controlled the media, and without that he would have never been successful.” “Yes, exactly,” Musk responded. The conversation, which was billed as an interview but was more of a love-in, hit virtually event major culture war topic, from the war in Ukraine, where Weidel suggested European government’s lack of strategy would push Russia toward nuclear war, to immigration, where Musk wildly claimed that “on the Mexican side of the border in the US is a giant pile of discarded passports and drivers’ licenses, like a huge pile.” It was unclear what Musk was talking about, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk also claimed that “basically theft is legal in California” and said that the only thing that would slow down what “the influx of criminals” were stealing is “if your back hurts from carrying out all the goods.” The centibillionaire’s interest in German politics, and the AfD in particular, appear to have been largely informed by a single X user, Naomi Seibt, a 24-year-old German influencer who rose to prominence by posting climate change and Covid-19 denial content. After she posted an image of herself in June saying she had voted for the AfD in last year’s European elections, Musk shared her post, asking: “Why is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?” He then slid into her DMs, Seibt told Reuters . \"I explained to him the AfD is not similar to the Nazi ideology or Hitler but is like the 19th century liberal nationalist movement ... because they wanted to be free from authoritarians in their own territory,\" Seibt told the outlet. Musk engaged with the 24-year-old 40 more times before sharing one of her posts on December 20 with the comment: “Only the AfD can save Germany.” A week later an op-ed with Musk’s byline appeared in the German Welt am Samstag newspaper claiming that the AfD was the “last spark of hope” for Germany. Musk repeated his endorsement during the livestream, saying, “I think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person, and hopefully people can tell just from this conversation. Nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense.” It’s unclear whether Musk’s endorsement of Weidel and the AfD will have any material impact on the outcome of the election. “In the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,” Manfred Güllner, the head of the Forsa Institute, told Politico . “I don’t see very much potential for future change, because Musk has become a negative figure.”",

Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government notified the European Union’s executive commission of the extension to Sept. 15. “With the border controls, we are pushing irregular migration down successfully. The figures prove this,” he said. Germany turned back 47,000 people back at its borders, seeing one-third fewer asylum requests year-on-year and arresting 1,900 smugglers. The country was already controlling its borders with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland before it extended the checks last September to its remaining borders, with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. The EU has a visa-free travel area known as Schengen that allows citizens of most member states to travel easily across borders for work and pleasure. Switzerland also belongs to Schengen although it is not an EU member. RELATED COVERAGE A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023.

He has said that if he becomes chancellor, he would order the Interior Ministry on his first day in office to control all of Germany’s borders permanently and “turn back all attempts at illegal entry without exception.” He argued that EU rules are “recognizably dysfunctional” and Germany must exert a right to the primacy of national law.

(Sebastian Christoph Gollnow/dpa via AP) Read More By GEIR MOULSON Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday issued rare public criticism of her successor as the country’s center-right leader, the front-runner in Germany’s election next month, for putting to parliament proposals for tough new migration rules that only passed with the help of a far-right party . Germany’s center-left governing parties have cast doubt on whether conservative leader Friedrich Merz can still be trusted not to bring the far-right Alternative for Germany , or AfD, into government after Wednesday’s events. He insists that he didn’t and won’t work with it, and that he didn’t break a political consensus, often called a “firewall,” to shun the party. But Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Merz made “an inexcusable mistake.” Merz, determined to show his center-right Union bloc’s commitment to cutting irregular migration after a deadly knife attack last week by a rejected asylum-seeker, put a nonbinding motion to parliament calling for Germany to turn back many more migrants at its borders, although it might need AfD’s backing to pass. The measure squeaked through thanks to the far-right party’s support. Polls show Merz’s Union leading ahead of the Feb. 23 election with around 30% support, while AfD is second with about 20%, and Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats and their remaining coalition partners, the Greens, are further back. RELATED COVERAGE Police in central Germany hunt for a suspect on the run after 2 people were shot dead A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Merkel, a former leader of Merz’s Christian Democratic Union, noted in a rare statement that Merz had said in November that no measures should be passed with AfD’s support before the Feb. 23 election. She said she supported that position but “I think it was wrong no longer to feel committed to this proposal and, on Jan. 29, to enable with open eyes for the first time a majority with votes from AfD in a vote in the German parliament.” Merkel added that “all democratic parties” must work together — “not as a tactical maneuver,” and while respecting European Union law — to do everything to prevent attacks such as last week’s and others in recent months in which the suspects were immigrants. Merz took over the CDU after Merkel, a former rival, stepped down as chancellor in 2021. A more conservative figure, he has taken a more restrictive stance on migration. He said last week that Germany has had a “misguided asylum and immigration policy” for a decade — since Merkel allowed large numbers of migrants into the country. Merkel has largely kept a low profile since leaving office, doesn’t usually comment on day-to-day politics and is no longer actively influential in her party. However, her intervention could be problematic for Merz. Merz appears to hope that he will gain support by making the Union look decisive in forcing a tougher approach to migration, blunting the appeal of the anti-immigration AfD, while making center-left Scholz and the Greens look weak. It’s uncertain whether that will succeed. AfD lawmakers celebrated after Wednesday’s vote while others sat stony-faced. Merz said he had sought a majority in the “democratic center” and he regretted that didn’t happen. But he also insisted that “a correct decision doesn’t become wrong because the wrong people approve it.” On Friday, the Union plans to call a vote on months-old proposed legislation that calls for an end to family reunions for migrants with a protection status that falls short of asylum. The measure also could pass with AfD votes, though it would need approval from parliament’s upper house, which is uncertain. This week’s events soured the political atmosphere and may complicate efforts to form a coalition after the election, which could leave Merz needing center-left parties to take power. Wolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the Berlin Social Science Center, said they were a “breach of the informal firewall” and a “toxic intervention by Merz and the CDU,” which may help them in this election but are likely to have negative effects in the longer term. He said this week’s goings-on in parliament are “symbolic politics that one must not underestimate” but also said he “would be cautious with the category of an epochal, historic moment.” ___ Kerstin Sopke in Berlin contributed to this report.",

At least 37 people were injured when a car was driven into a crowd of people at a trade union rally. The driver was a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, police said, identified in local media as Farhad N. He was arrested at the scene and prosecutors say he has admitted to carrying out the attack. He appeared to have a religious motivation, officials said. The mother and child were among those taken to hospital with serious injuries following the attack. \"Unfortunately, we have to confirm the deaths today of the two-year-old child and her 37-year-old mother,\" police spokesman Ludwig Waldinger told the AFP news agency on Saturday. The car ramming has brought security issues back into focus the week before federal elections are held in Germany. A series of attacks have been carried out in Munich by immigrants, with two of the alleged attackers coming from Afghanistan. The attack also occurred on the eve of the Munich Security Conference, which began on Friday. Upon arrival in the city on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance expressed his condolences to the victims in the attack. What we know about suspected car attack in Munich Car ramming comes as migration at forefront of German elections Authorities have said the suspect arrived in Germany in 2016 and, although his application for asylum was turned down, he was allowed to stay in Germany as he faced risks being deported back to Afghanistan. He had a valid residence and work permit. He had no previous criminal record, and police said there was no evidence of a link to a jihadist group. He also appears to have acted alone, German authorities say. On Friday, police said the suspect told officers during questioning that he had driven his Mini Cooper car intentionally into the crowd. Munich public prosecutor Gabriele Tilmann told reporters that the suspect had said \"Allahu Akbar\" - God is greatest in Arabic - when he was detained. She suggested he \"may have had an Islamist motivation\". Campaigning around Germany's election on 23 February has for weeks been embroiled in a fevered debate about migration. It was called due to the collapse of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government last year. A number of violent incidents linked to migrants over the past year have led to increased support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In December, six people were killed and at least 299 injured after a man drove a car into a German Christmas market . The suspect was a 50-year-old Saudi asylum seeker who had been an outspoken critic of Islam. And in January an attack that shocked the country saw a two-year-old child and a passer-by who attempted to intervene killed after a group of children were stabbed in a park in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg. The suspect in that attack is a 28-year-old Afghan asylum seeker. Europe Germany",

The attack took place on Friday evening, with the assailant approaching the 30-year-old victim from behind before stabbing him and fleeing the scene. A man was arrested nearby after police noticed blood stains on his hands and clothing. The suspect was carrying a prayer rug, a copy of the Quran, and the suspected weapon in his backpack, suggesting \"a religious motivation\", police said. After being taken to hospital with serious wounds to his neck, the victim underwent an operation and was put into an induced coma, but his life is no longer in danger. Police say they are examining possible connections to the current Middle East conflict - but said there is currently no evidence of links to any groups or individuals. They are also investigating whether the suspect is suffering from mental illness. He had no prior criminal record and was not known to the police, they added. Six people who witnessed the attack are receiving counselling from local authorities. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser described the attack as an \"abhorrent and brutal crime\" for which the suspect \"must be punished with the full force of the law\". \"We will use all means to deport violent offenders back to Syria,\" she said. Several stabbing and car-ramming attacks have taken place in Germany in recent months, in the cities of Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich. All of the alleged attackers were migrants. Immigration has become a core issue for voters ahead of federal elections taking place on Sunday. The Berlin Holocaust memorial was opened in 2005 to commemorate the six million Jews of Europe murdered by the Nazi regime, and comprises 2,711 stone slabs. Hours after the attack in the German capital, Swedish police said they had apprehended three men near the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, on suspicion of preparing to commit violent crime.

Sometimes they look chic and sometimes shabby. But can these sandals be considered art? That’s the question Germany’s Federal Court of Justice wrestled with Thursday, and it ruled they’re just comfy footwear . Birkenstock, which is headquartered in Linz am Rhein, Germany, and says its tradition of shoemaking goes back to 1774, filed a lawsuit against three competitors who sold sandals that were very similar to its own. The shoe manufacturer claimed its sandals “are copyright-protected works of applied art” that may not be imitated. Under German law, works of art enjoy stronger and longer-lasting intellectual property protections than consumer products. The company asked for an injunction to stop its competitors from making copycat sandals and order them to recall and destroy those already on the market. The defendant companies were not identified in the court statement. Before Germany’s highest court for civil trials weighed in Thursday, the case had been heard at two lower courts, which disagreed on the issue.

Arbor Day’s a good time to plant one A regional court in Cologne initially recognized the shoes as works of applied art and granted the orders, but Cologne’s higher regional court overturned the orders on appeal, German news agency dpa reported. The appeals court said it was unable to establish any artistic achievement in the wide-strapped, big-buckled sandals. The Federal Court of Justice sided with the appeals court and dismissed the case. In its ruling, it wrote that a product can’t be copyrighted if “technical requirements, rules or other constraints determine the design.” “For the copyright protection of a work of applied art — as for all other types of work — the level of design must not be too low,” the court wrote. “For copyright protection, a level of design must be achieved that reveals individuality.” KIRSTEN GRIESHABER Grieshaber is a Berlin-based reporter covering Germany and Austria for The Associated Press.

The 24-hour walkout, which started at midnight on Sunday, involves public-sector employees at the airports as well as ground and security staff. At Frankfurt Airport, 1,054 of the day’s 1,116 scheduled takeoffs and landings had been canceled, German news agency dpa reported, citing airport traffic management. All of Berlin Airport’s regular departures and arrivals were canceled, while Hamburg Airport said no departures would be possible. Cologne/Bonn Airport said there was no regular passenger service and Munich Airport advised travelers to expect a “greatly reduced flight schedule.” The ver.di service workers union’s strike also targeted the Bremen, Hannover, Duesseldorf, Dortmund, Leipzig/Halle and Stuttgart airports. At the smaller Weeze and Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden airports, only security workers were called out. The German airports’ association, ADV, estimated that more than 3,500 flights in total would be canceled and about 560,000 passengers affected.

But at Hamburg Airport, it added a short-notice walkout on Sunday to the strike on Monday, arguing that it must ensure the measure was effective. The so-called “warning strike,” a common tactic in German wage negotiations, relates to two separate pay disputes: negotiations on a new pay and conditions contract for airport security workers, and a wider dispute over pay for employees of federal and municipal governments. The latter already has led to walkouts at Cologne/Bonn, Duesseldorf, Hamburg and Munich airports. Pay talks in that dispute are due to resume on Friday, while the next round of talks for airport security workers is expected to start on March 26.",

His immediate priority is to try to form a government with the third-placed Social Democrats of Olaf Scholz. Even before the result was clear, Merz said his top priority was unity in Europe, so that \"step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US\". The other big winner in Sunday's vote was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who are celebrating a record second-place result of 20.8%. The AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, did a victory lap of her supporters, but even her party had hoped for a greater result and the mood at AfD HQ was subdued. Merz, 69, has never held a ministerial job, but he has promised if he becomes the next German chancellor to show leadership in Europe and beef up support for Ukraine. Most Germans have been shocked by President Donald Trump's conduct towards Ukraine and Europe and Friedrich Merz said the US leader had shown \"the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe\". Trump has labelled Ukraine's leader a \"dictator\" and two of his leading figures have openly backed the AfD in the run-up to the vote. Vice-President JD Vance was accused of meddling in the vote during a visit to Munich, while billionaire Elon Musk has made repeated remarks on his X platform. LIVE: Merz calls for security independence from the US Germany's election winner signals seismic shift in transatlantic relations Big challenges ahead for Merz in divided Germany Merz: Risk-taker who flirted with far right Friedrich Merz's first priority will be to try to form a coalition made up of his Christian Democrats (and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU) and Scholz's centre left, despite the Social Democrats' worst-ever showing of 16.4%. Merz's CDU party leadership will meet on Monday and so will the Social Democrat SPD's, separately, but Scholz will not take part in the talks. Merz is keen to form a government by Easter. It could be possible, because between the two parties, they have 328 seats, a majority of 12 in the 630-seat parliament. But it was not until the early hours of Monday that that became clear. After the collapse of Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition late last year, Merz had asked the electorate for a strong mandate to form a clear-cut coalition with one other party. In the event, he secured enough seats only because two of the smaller parties failed to get into parliament. A two-party coalition would enable him to solve as many of Germany's problems as he could in four years, he said, from a stagnant economy to closing its borders to irregular migrants. German voters had other ideas. They came out in big numbers, with a 83% turnout not seen since before reunification in 1990. Merz's Christian Democrats had been looking for more than the 28.6% of the vote they and their Bavarian sister party received. His most likely partner was always going to be the Social Democrats - known in Germany as a GroKo, or grand coalition. But Germany's electorate has fractured, and the two big beasts of its post-war politics can no longer be sure of success. The AfD under Alice Weidel enjoyed a 10-point increase in support on four years ago, their support boosted by anger over high prices and a series of deadly attacks in German cities. Three took place during the election campaign. Weidel also benefited from a successful TikTok campaign that drew in big numbers of young voters. As results came in during the early hours of Monday, it became clear the AfD was far ahead of the other parties in the east, with a projected 34%, according to a survey for public broadcaster ZDF. \"Germans have voted for change,\" said Weidel. She said Friedrich Merz's attempt to forge a coalition would ultimately end in failure: \"We'll have fresh elections - I don't think we'll have to wait another four years.\" But just as the election map turned light blue in the east, much of the rest of Germany turned black - the colour of the CDU. And Merz dismissed the rise of the AfD out of hand. \"The party only exists because there have been problems that haven't been solved. They're happy if these problems get worse and worse.\" \"We need to solve the problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\" Merz was equally withering towards the new Trump administration. President Trump did welcome Merz's victory. He said it was proof that Germans were, like Americans, tired of \"the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration\". If it was an overture, Merz did not take it as one. He told a round-table TV discussion on Sunday night that the interventions from Washington had been \"no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow\". Last week, Trump appeared to accuse Kyiv of starting the war which Russia unleashed on its neighbour exactly three years ago. Merz's victory was quickly welcomed by leaders across much of Europe. France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of uniting at a time of uncertainty to \"face the major challenges of the world and our continent\", while the UK's Sir Keir Starmer sought to \"enhance our joint security and deliver growth for both our countries\". Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats continue to rely on older voters for their success, while voters aged 18-24 appear to be far more interested in both the AfD and another party, the Left, which surged in the polls in recent weeks. Not long ago, the Left was heading out of the parliament, with poll numbers well below the 5% threshold. But a series of TikTok videos showing co-leader Heidi Reichinnek giving fiery speeches in parliament went viral and they ended up close to 9%, and a quarter of the younger vote, according to an ARD survey.

Hamburgs SPD und Grüne haben sich exakt 100 Tage nach der Wal im Februar 2020 auf ein gemeinsames Programm für die Hansestadt geeinigt und am Dienstag (02.06.) ihren Koalitionsvertrag für die kommenden fünf Jahre präsentiert. Koalition steht im Zeichen der Coronakrise Bürgermeister Peter Tschentscher betonte bei der Präsentation, dass die Corona-Pandemie die Stadt in die schwerste Krise aller Zeiten gebracht habe. Das habe dementsprechend auch die Koalitionsverhandlungen geprägt. Es gehe nicht nur um den Klimawandel und soziale Themen, sondern darum, die Corona-Krise gut zu überstehen. \"Dieser Koalitionsvertrag ist ein sehr guter Koalitionsvertrag\", sagte Tschentscher. Die Zweite Bürgermeisterin, Katharina Fegebank, erklärte, beide Seiten hätten unter den besonderen Umständen stark miteinander gerungen. Bei den Gesprächen hätten Grüne und SPD aber festgestellt, dass sie inhaltlich recht nah beieinander lägen. Neues Verkehrsressort in Hamburg Der künftige Senat soll um ein eigenes Verkehrsressort ergänzt werden. Es soll von dem Grünen Anjes Tjarks verantwortet werden und sich vor allem um die Mobilitätswende kümmern, wie die Grünen schon am Wochenende mitgeteilt hatten. Das Thema Gesundheit soll von einer Staatsrätin geführt werden und zur SPD-geführten Sozialbehörde gehören. Tschentscher versicherte, dass alle Senatoren für die gemeinsamen Ziele des Koalitionsvertrages arbeiten werden. Die wichtigsten Ziele im Koalitionsvertrag Insgesamt ist der Koalitionsvertrag deutlich grüner als bisher, was vor allem daran liegt, dass die Grünen mit 24 Prozent Stimmenanteil deutlich zulegen konnten. Die wichtigsten Maßnahmen, die beschlossen wurden, tragen also auch eine deutlich grünere Handschrift: - Die Radwegausbau so doppelt so schnell vorangetrieben werden. Statt bisher 30-40 Kilometer sollen 60-80 Kilometer pro Jahr entstehen - Die Innenstadt soll deutlich autoärmer werden. Geplant ist unter anderem den Jungfernstieg vom Individualverkehr zu befreien und die Mö phasenweise in eine Fußgängerzone zu verwandeln - Die A26 Ost wird als Hafenpassage gebaut. Die marode Köhlbrandbrücke soll in diesem Zug abgerissen und durch einen Tunnel ersetzt werden - Noch vor 2050 soll Hamburg klimaneutral werden - Bis 2040 sollen 35 Milliarden investiert werden um unsere Stadt in den Punkten Verkehr, Bildung, Digitalisierung, Hafen, Wohnraum, Klima, Gesundheit und Kultur zukunftsfähig zu machen - Die Neuverschuldung durch die Coronakrise soll in den kommenden Jahren schrittweise wieder abgebaut werden - Für die Wirtschaft wird es ein großes, milliardenschweres Hamburger Konjunkturpaket geben, welches das Konjunkturpaket des Bundes ergänzen soll. Der Fokus soll hier auf kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen liegen, sowie einem Arbeitsmarktprogramm - Hamburg wird mehr Flüchtlinge aufnehmen als laut Verteilungsschlüssel eigentlich vorgesehen wären - Der HVV für Schüler wird kostenlos. Für Azubis und Berufsschüler gibt es günstigere Tickets - Der HVV soll durch öffentliche Bürgeranleihen mitfinanziert werden - Der Drogenkonsum bei jungen Menschen soll straffrei werden. Stattdessen gibt es eine Suchtberatung.

Dieter Leder/picture alliance/Getty Images CNN — German authorities say a car-ramming incident in the southwestern city of Mannheim that killed two people Monday was a deliberate attack but it does not appear to have been politically or religiously motivated. Police said Monday night the two dead were an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man. Eleven others were injured. The attacker purposefully targeted and struck people at high speed, police said at a press conference, noting that authorities originally thought they were responding to a traffic accident. Public prosecutor Romeo Schüssler said there was “concrete evidence” that the suspected attacker suffers from a psychological illness. Police searched the suspect’s house Monday, the prosecutor added. Mannheim police said they had arrested the suspect after launching a large-scale manhunt in the city center shortly after midday local time (6 a.m. ET). The suspect is a 40-year-old German national from the neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate state, police said. “We are all deeply shocked by this heinous inhumane attack on peaceful people,” said Christian Specht, mayor of Mannheim in a statement posted on the city website. “Our thoughts are with the dead and injured, their families and friends.” Mikla Cela, a worker at a restaurant in the city center, told CNN that he saw a black car drive by at high speed. He said he later heard several people screaming and saw a man with a white jacket lying on the floor. Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and likely Germany’s next chancellor, said he was “shocked” by Monday’s incident, as well as several other “terrible acts” that have rocked the country in recent months. “Germany must become a safe country again. We will work towards this with the utmost determination,” Merz said. Officers inspect a damaged vehicle after the deadly incident on March 3. Boris Roessler/dpa/AP Mannheim University Hospital said that three of the injured people it has received are receiving urgent acute care, including a child. Ferry Overdevest, the owner of a flower store in central Mannheim, told CNN that around 30 people had sought shelter in his shop and that ambulances were on the streets outside. 17 February 2025, Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart: Cars stand and drive on the B10 in gridlocked rush-hour traffic. Marijan Murat/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images Related article The far right just made huge gains in a country once seen as a climate champion. It’s a pattern happening across the world Germany has been rocked by a string of deadly car ramming attacks in recent months. In December, a vehicle plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg , killing six people, including a 9-year-old boy. The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi citizen who had lived in Germany for more than a decade and worked to help Saudis leave his home country. Social media posts showed he was a fervent critic of Islam. In February, a person drove a Mini Cooper into demonstrators in Munich , killing a mother and her child and injuring more than 30 others. The suspect is a 24-year-old Afghan man. That attack came on the eve of the Munich Security Conference and just days before the country’s federal election, where concerns over immigration and security helped propel the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to second place. Monday’s incident comes as Germany celebrates “Rose Monday,” a carnival held before Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. German police were already on high alert ahead of the carnival celebrations, but the incident in Mannheim has prompted some forces to take additional measures. Police in Ulm, a city southeast of Mannheim, said they have “noticeably increased” their presence around carnival events.",

The airport operator said airlines had canceled about 80% of their flights to and from Munich and further cancelations were not ruled out. The ver.di service workers’ union called the “warning strike,” a tactic often used in German pay negotiations, on Monday as it seeks to step up pressure in ongoing talks with the federal government and municipal authorities on wages and working conditions for public-sector employees. The industrial action is set to end at midnight on Friday. Workers at ground handling services are among those taking part. Public sector workers also walked off the job in various other locations and services in Germany.

Scholz made the comment after a two-thirds majority of parliamentarians — the number required to make the change to the constitution — approved the amendments on Tuesday. Germany is \"loosening the shackles, which have so far prevented us from spending sufficient funds on our defense,\" said Scholz, speaking in Berlin alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. \"By strengthening the European pillar of NATO , we will strengthen the trans-Atlantic alliance as a whole.\" https://p.dw.com/p/4ry4D Skip next section Germany needs to take security in its own hands: CDU politician 03/19/2025 March 19, 2025 Germany needs to take security in its own hands: CDU politician Kate Hairsine | Wesley Dockery Editor Thomas Silberhorn, a Bundestag member from the center-right CDU, told DW that his party had changed its stance and voted for the landmark amendment because Germany's \"threat perception had changed.\" Russia wasn't just fighting a war against Ukraine , but it was also a threat to Germany. \"We are [the] object of Russian cyberattacks, of espionage and of sabotage every day in Germany,\" said Silberhorn, the spokesperson for the CDU and its sister CSU's parliamentary group for trans-Atlantic relations . With the United States under Donald Trump also raising questions about its solidarity to Europe and NATO, \"we have to readjust our threat perception and take our own security in our hands,\" Silberhorn said. \"That's why we decided to do whatever it takes to make Germany safe and to enable us to defend our country and our partners in Europe.\" Increasing defense funding was one of the \"preconditions\" of strengthening Germany's armed forces, said Silberhorn, who was previously state secretary in Germany's Defense Ministry.

Lauterbach's SPD voted with CDU/CSU to push the spending bill through parliament. The two parties are set to form the next governing coalition.

The package has been brought to the old parliament rather than the newly elected one, due to hold its first session on March 25, because parties that were unlikely to agree to the change have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. Chrupalla said that after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence in parliament — paving the way for new elections — the old Bundestag was denied the ability to make far-reaching decisions. The AfD lawmaker said the old Bundestag was being used to cement the future government because only the old Bundestag had the majority for it. \"What a spectacle you're subjecting the citizens and our voters to,\" said Chrupalla. \"The most valuable asset politicians have is credibility. With these embarrassing actions, dear Mr. Merz, you've already completely lost yours.\" \"The voters feel betrayed by you — and rightly so,\" said Chrupalla. https://p.dw.com/p/4rwJ2 Skip next section Free Democrat lawmaker derides 'debt coalition' 03/18/2025 March 18, 2025 Free Democrat lawmaker derides 'debt coalition' The parliamentary group leader of the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), Christian Dürr, has spoken, accusing the conservative CDU/CSU and center-left Social Democrats of \"unbridled debt-mongering.\" Dürr accused Merz of putting together \"a debt coalition that is prepared to sacrifice tomorrow's prosperity for short-term electoral gifts.\" Dürr said that, for the fiscally cautious FDP, Germany's \"debt brake\" was not a principle of dogma but a means to an end. \"It protects the generations of our children and grandchildren from political incapacity — and, in reality, it ensures that one can still take on debt in times of need.\" Before February's federal election, the FDP had expressed an interest in joining a future coalition with Merz's CDU, but failed to get above the 5% vote threshold to enter the new parliament. https://p.dw.com/p/4rwCA Skip next section Outgoing Chancellor Scholz takes back seat during debate 03/18/2025 March 18, 2025 Outgoing Chancellor Scholz takes back seat during debate Politics can be a cruel business.

The Greens have repeatedly criticized the conservatives for changing tack on the need for spending since the February 23 election. Ahead of this, Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats had dismissed the need for borrowing. \"The conditions today are no different than they were in October 2024,\" said Hasselmann. \"Everyone knew that this country urgently needed investment. \"The Greens and the SPD [center-left Social Democrats] had campaigned together for this.\" \"We asked you to accompany us on this path,\" Hasselmann said, adding that the CDU/CSU had categorically rejected this. \"You said: 'There is no need for this in our country.' After all, we don't have a revenue problem, but a spending problem.\" \"How deeply you have defamed my colleagues. Defamed them for their ideas and for their struggle to ensure that we invest in this country.\" Hasselmann cited an investment backlog in municipalities, the railways, and climate protection. \"You categorically rejected all of this — and mostly with such arrogance and populism that it made one sick.\" https://p.dw.com/p/4rw6t Skip next section Merz calls for 'major step toward a new European defense community' 03/18/2025 March 18, 2025 Merz calls for 'major step toward a new European defense community' Merz said Germany has had a 'false sense of security' Image: Michael Kappeler/dpa/picture alliance Germany's expected next Chancellor Friedrich Merz has told the Bundestag lower house of parliament that Germany has failed to recognize the precarious nature of European security in recent years — and that it must act now. Merz made the observation as he promoted a planned increase in borrowing to fund defense spending and revive growth, saying that it would herald a new era for European security. \"We have for at least a decade felt a false sense of security,\" said Merz, adding that nothing short of a total rebuilding of Germany's defense capabilities was needed. \"The decision we are taking today on defense readiness ... can be nothing less than the first major step toward a new European defense community, which also includes countries that are not members of the European Union,\" he said. https://p.dw.com/p/4rvwL Skip next section Merz faces down heckles from far right ahead of major vote 03/18/2025 March 18, 2025 Merz faces down heckles from far right ahead of major vote Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor in waiting, began his speech on this historic day to a chorus of heckles from the far-right Alternative for Germany benches. One of Merz' backbench lawmakers shouted at them to shut up. The schoolyard theatrics are a reflection of the tense mood in the Bundestag today. That's because an eye-watering infrastructure investment package, and the removal of fiscal limits on defense spending are on the agenda. And it's being pushed through in the last day of the old parliament by the man who will most probably be chancellor in the next parliament. In a word: controversial. The proposals will allow Germany, as Merz famously said, to do \"whatever it takes\" to strengthen the Bundeswehr and allow Europe to defend itself again. But his critics on the far-left and the far-right oppose the plans. The Left party is against remilitarization, as they see it. The AfD agrees on increased defense spending but believe borrowing to do so will crush Germany's reputation for fiscal prudence. https://p.dw.com/p/4rviF Show more posts Send us your feedback Your feedback",

Earlier this week, German lawmakers approved a historic amendment to the constitution that will allow unprecedented levels of government spending. Last major hurdle for debt reform Approval fromthe Bundesrat, which represents Germany's 16 federal states, was necessary for the reform to pass into law. At least two-thirds of members voted for the amendment for it to pass. The yes vote was not a sure thing , as smaller parties in state coalition governments voiced objections.

Germany ready to spend big The Bundesrat vote paves the way for massive spending from Europe's largest economy. The debt reform plan exempts defense spending from Germany's so-called \"debt brake,\" a constitutionally enshrined mechanism that limits government borrowing. Expenditures on defense, cybersecurity, intelligence and civil protection exceeding 1% of German GDP can now be financed with new debt. The plan also earmarks a special €500 billion special infrastructure investment fund. The proposal to loosen the debt brake was pitched by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Social Democrats (SPD) , who are trying to move quickly to push the reform through the outgoing parliament. There were fears the plan could have been blocked in the new parliament after far-left and far-right lawmakers, who oppose the plan in principle, won more seats in the February election. On Tuesday, the plan passed in Germany's Parliament , the Bundestag, after the Greens were promised €100 billion ($109 billion) in climate investment would be included. German lawmakers approve easing 'debt brake' To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Why does Germany want to reform debt rules? For CDU leader, and Germany's next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, getting the debt brake reform passed before taking office amounts to a big win. The CDU is in coalition talks with the SPD, and hopes to get a coalition government on its feet by the end of April. After the CDU came out on top in last month's general election, Merz went on television and warned that the administration of US President Donald Trump was largely \"indifferent\" to the fate of Europe , and that Germany must act quickly to bolster its defense capabilities. Merz was responding to major shifts in transatlantic ties under Trump, who has embraced Russian narratives on the war in Ukraine, while calling into question Washington's commitment to European security. \"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said. Bavaria's conservative premier Markus Söder told the Bundesrat on Friday that \"we must do everything we can to ensure that Germany once again becomes one of the strongest armies in Europe and can protect itself.\" Söder, who heads the Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU's Bavarian sister party, added Germany's armed forces need new weapons systems, drones and air defenses. \"The threat from the east, from Moscow, is still present, while the support from the West is no longer what we were once accustomed to,\" he said. \"I am a convinced transatlanticist, but the relationship of trust in the United States of America has, at least for me and for many others, been deeply shaken. The Germans are worried,\" Söder added.

(AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)                           BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s new parliament on Tuesday elected as its speaker a conservative former minister, who called for civilized debate in what is likely to be a confrontational term after a far-right, anti-immigration party doubled in strength in last month’s election . The post of speaker — in protocol terms Germany’s second-highest, behind the president and ahead of the chancellor — traditionally goes to the strongest group in parliament’s lower house , or Bundestag. After the Feb. 23 election , that is the center-right Union bloc of the country’s likely next leader, Friedrich Merz . Merz’s choice was Julia Klöckner, 52, who was agriculture minister from 2018 to 2021 in then-Chancellor Angela Merkel’s final government. Lawmakers elected her by 382 votes to 204, with 31 abstentions. Klöckner promised lawmakers she would carry out her duties in a “non-partisan, calm and undaunted” way. The atmosphere in the Bundestag has become considerably more heated since the far-right Alternative for Germany , or AfD, first won seats in 2017. It finished second in last month’s election, doubling its share of the vote to 20.8%, and now holds 152 of the 630 seats. “There is a very clear yardstick for me: decency,” Klöckner said. “We must conduct and endure controversial discourse ... according to clear rules,” she added. “I will take care that we deal with each other in a civilized way — and if we don’t do that, learn to.”  According to parliamentary rules, other parties are each supposed to get a deputy speaker, but their candidates must win a majority of lawmakers. In its eight years in parliament, a majority has balked at every candidate AfD has proposed. On Tuesday, the Bundestag snubbed AfD lawmaker Gerold Otten, who failed to win more than 190 votes. It’s not clear when the Bundestag will be able to elect a new chancellor. Merz is still in talks to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Scholz and his Cabinet received their dismissal certificates from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Tuesday. But as is customary, Steinmeier tasked the government to stay in office on a caretaker basis until a new chancellor is in place.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

(Thomas Niedermueller/dpa via AP, File) By KIRSTEN GRIESHABER Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) — Police were executing raids in six German states Wednesday against a group that authorities say “is part of an international network whose aim is to overthrow the government in Eritrea.” Germany’s federal prosecutor’s office is accusing 17 suspects of founding or being members of the German branch of Brigade N’Hamedu, which it defines as a terrorist organization. Eritrea has long been described as one of the world’s most repressive countries by human rights groups, and some members of its divided diaspora have clashed violently at times. The prosecutors said the investigations “suggest that the suspects assumed senior positions” within the group. The German offshoot has been active since at least 2022 was involved in violence at events connected to the Eritrean government. The prosecutor’s office said the organization coordinated violent riots at Eritrea festivals in Giessen on Aug. 20, 2022, and on Aug. 7-8, 2023, as well as the seminar of an Eritrean association in Stuttgart on Sept. 16, 2023 . Numerous police officers were injured at the events, some of them seriously, and dozens of protesters were detained. The state interior minister of Baden-Württemberg, which includes Stuttgart, said that 56 people were sentenced to prison following the riots in the city in 2023, though some of those sentences can still be appealed, German news agency dpa reported. RELATED COVERAGE Police in central Germany hunt for a suspect on the run after 2 people were shot dead A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Prosecutors also say that some members of the association considered violence against German state institutions and police officers to be legitimate. More than 200 federal and state police officers searched 19 properties — eight in Hesse, four in North Rhine-Westphalia, three in Bavaria, two in Baden-Württemberg and one each in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Rhineland-Palatinate. Another search took place in Denmark at the same time, dpa reported. No arrests have been made. The prosecutor’s statement also noted that another person who is suspected of holding a senior position within Brigade N’Hamedu in the Netherlands and Germany “has recently been sentenced by a Dutch court to a prison term of several years on account of his participation in clashes in The Hague” last February. The prosecutor’s office did not identify any of the accused by name, in line with German privacy rules. Separately, a court in Sweden jailed six people on Wednesday for violent rioting in connection with an Eritrean cultural festival in 2023, Swedish news agency TT reported. Five people were sentenced to five months in prison, while a sixth person was sentenced to six months in prison, according to TT. At the time, hundreds of anti-government protesters stormed the festival. More than 50 people were injured and nearly 140 people were detained, TT reported. As in German, Sweden is home to tens of thousands of people with Eritrean roots. The festival devoted to the cultural heritage of Eritrea is an annual event that has been held since the 1990s but has been criticized for allegedly serving as a promotional tool and source of money for the African nation’s government, according to Swedish media. Exiles have attacked several festivals held by Eritrea’s diaspora in Europe, North America and Israel in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Eritrea over the years, many setting off into the deserts of Sudan and then North Africa in attempts to reach Europe.

Support for Merz's conservative CDU/CSU bloc, which won the February 23 election, fell by five percentage points to 24% while the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained three points to land on 25%, according to the Ipsos institute's poll. Sign up here. The AfD came second in the election, the best performance by a far-right party since World War Two. Its polling strength is a setback for Merz's conservative alliance, which wanted to win back voters from the party. The Ipsos poll showed support for outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) unchanged at 15%. The centre-left SPD are in talks with the CDU/CSU to form Germany's next government, with the two sides forced to iron out their differences in policy areas such as tax and migration to keep the far right out of power. The talks are expected to conclude later on Wednesday, sources told Reuters. AfD leader Alice Weidel hailed her party's polling breakthrough in a post on X. \"The people want political change - and not a 'business as usual' coalition of CDU/CSU and SPD,\" she wrote.

Merz, 69, said their agreement sent \"a strong and clear signal\" to Germans and the EU that they would get \"a strong government capable of action\". Germany was already in recession before it was buffeted by economic turbulence, caused by US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. \"The key message to Donald Trump is Germany is back on track,\" said the chancellor-in-waiting, promising to fulfil defence commitments and revive economic competitiveness. Follow live updates as China and EU hit back at Trump tariffs Merz and his coalition partners have been under intense pressure to put an end to Germany's political limbo since his Christian Democrats won federal elections in February. He has also just seen his party overtaken in an opinion poll by the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD). Announcing the government deal, Merz promised to reform and stabilise Germany, with a focus on migration, the economy and defence. \"Europe can rely on Germany,\" he said, promising \"a strong plan to bring our country to the forefront again\". He will have to wait for the week starting 5 May for the new parliament to elect him as chancellor, but should have no problem with a 13-seat majority. The coalition parties had already signalled their urgency last month, when they pushed through significant reform of Germany's strict debt rules. Such changes mean the new government will be able to plough significant investment into the military and the country's crumbling infrastructure. Included in Wednesday's agreement were a series of measures to \"control and largely end irregular migration\", and impose border controls aimed at addressing one of the big concerns of voters in the February election. The AfD complained that the plans did not go far enough, accusing Merz of capitulating to the Social Democrats. In a recent report to parliament, Germany's armed forces commissioner highlighted dramatic shortages in the military across the board, from ammunition and soldier numbers to dilapidated barracks. Another significant part of the coalition deal is for defence spending to be increased, and for boosting the strength of the military. Although there will be no conscription, Merz said the coalition was aiming to follow a \"Swedish model\" of voluntary military service. \"We hope that with enough volunteers, we will also be able to achieve an expansion of the Bundeswehr [German armed forces],\" he said. Merz also promised \"comprehensive support\" to Ukraine. Germany leads defiance of Trump car tariffs, saying it \"will not give in\" Germany decides to leave history behind and prepare for war Merz clinches package to revamp defence and infrastructure Although his government will feature almost entirely new names - Merz himself has never been a cabinet minister - there will be continuity at the defence ministry. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, is expected to remain in post. This will be the fifth so-called grand coalition (GroKo) - involving the big parties of the centre right and centre left since World War Two - but the parties were at pains to say it would not be like any previous government. With Germany in economic recession, though, one leading politician on the populist left, Sahra Wagenknecht, said they offered no answer either to Germany's economic crisis or the trade war. She said Germany was threatened with a third and fourth year in recession, which she dubbed \"Merzession\". Merz said he was confident that the coalition deal would be approved by their respective parties and they would be able to get to work in early May. Meanwhile, an Ipsos poll on Wednesday put Merz's conservatives in second place on 24% support, a point behind Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose co-leader Alice Weidel hailed the survey as unprecedented, and promised that \"political change will come\".

Ihnen seien mehr als die 63 Prozent der Aktien des MDax-Konzerns angeboten worden, die sie als Mindestschwelle für die Umsetzung der Transaktion angegeben haben, teilte Stada am Donnerstag mit und bestätigte damit entsprechende Informationen von manager-magazin.de. Die Bieter, die sich für die Offerte in der \"Nidda Healthcare Holding AG\" zusammengeschlossen haben, präzisierten die Angabe später auf 63,85 Prozent. Damit ist eine der spektakulärsten Übernahmeschlachten in Deutschland der vergangenen Jahre beendet. Bain Capital und Cinven waren mit ihrem ersten Anlauf vor rund zwei Monaten gescheitert und hatten danach die Mindestannahmeschwelle von 67,5 Prozent gesenkt sowie den Angebotspreis um 25 Cents auf 66,25 Euro erhöht. Ein möglichst großes Aktienpaket ist für die Investoren wichtig, um ihre strategischen Vorstellungen so ungebremst wie möglich durchsetzen zu können. In den kommenden Wochen steht nun eine weitgehende Neubesetzung der Spitzengremien an. Stadas Vorstandsvorsitzender Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink hatte schon bei seinem Amtsantritt vor wenigen Wochen erklärt, nur für eine Übergangsphase zur Verfügung zu stehen. Auch Aufsichtsratschef Carl Ferdinand Oetker wird keine lange Zukunft zugetraut. An der Börse kam die Nachricht vom erfolgreichen Angebot gut an: Stada-Aktien Börsen-Chart zeigen schossen zeitweise um mehr als 14 Prozent auf über 73 Euro. Händler begründeten die Kurs-Rally vor allem mit Eindeckungen von Leerverkäufen: Spekulative Anleger, die mit geliehenen Stada-Aktien auf fallende Kurse gesetzt hatten, mussten diese Aktien nun am Markt zurückkaufen. Das trieb den Stada-Kurs steil nach oben. Viele Marktteilnehmer dürften zudem auf einen Sondergewinn durch einen Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsvertrag hoffen, der ab einer Schwelle von 75 Prozent möglich ist, sagte ein Händler. Sollte sie im ersten Schritt noch nicht erreicht worden sein, wäre es in einer Verlängerungsfrist immer noch möglich. Schließlich sei es dann auch nur noch eine Frage der Zeit, bis Bain und Cinven nach dem Kauf weiterer Anteile mit dem Ausschluss der Minderheitsaktionäre (Squeeze Out) begännen. 5,3 Milliarden schweres Stada-Angebot galt als Test 8 Übernahmen: Die größten Private-Equity-Deals Vor dem ersten und zweiten Angebot hatten jeweils scharfe Konflikte in der Unternehmensführung das Unternehmen und den Verkaufsprozess belastet. So mussten etwa vor wenigen Wochen der damalige Vorstandschef Matthias Wiedenfels sowie sein Finanzvorstand Helmut Kraft das Unternehmen mit sofortiger Wirkung verlassen. Noch am Mittwochabend hatte der Stada-Kurs unter dem Angebotspreis gelegen - ein Beleg für die Unsicherheit unter Investoren , ob der Deal zustande kommt. Das insgesamt 5,3 Milliarden Euro schwere Angebot der Finanzinvestoren galt als Test, ob in Deutschland Finanzinvestoren überhaupt der Kauf größerer börsennotierter Unternehmen möglich ist. Zahlreiche Private-Equity-Investoren haben bei ihren Anlegern Milliarden eingesammelt, für die sie nun ihrerseits Investitionsmöglichkeiten suchen. Stadas Vorstandsvorsitzender Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink sagte: \"Wir sind froh, dass die Frage der zukünftigen Eigentümerstruktur nun geklärt ist. Mit der umfangreichen Branchenexpertise der neuen Eigentümer und ihrem Zugang zu einem weltweiten Netzwerk im Gesundheitswesen wird Stadas Position als global tätiges Pharmaunternehmen nachhaltig gestärkt.\" Alle kartellrechtlichen Freigaben seien erfolgt. Der Hersteller von Nachahmermedikamenten (Generika) und rezeptfreien Markenprodukten wie Grippostad könne sich nun wieder auf das operative Geschäft konzentrieren.

PETER KNEFFEL/DPA/AFP/Getty Images Berlin CNN — Every public building in the southern German state of Bavaria is now required to display a Christian cross at the entrance to greet visitors. The law, which came into effect Friday, has re-ignited a fierce national debate about the role of religion in politics and what it means to be German. “The cross is a fundamental symbol of our Bavarian identity and way of life.  It stands for elementary values such as charity, human dignity and tolerance,” declared Bavarian State Premier Markus Soder at a cabinet meeting in April when the new requirement was announced.  He then walked out and nailed a cross to the wall of the lobby in the Bavarian State Chancellery. Parts of Germany have been grappling with a crisis of identity after the country accepted more than a million refugees in 2015, many of whom are Muslims. \"For some people it is like a gravestone,\" artist Günter Demnig says. Claudia Otto/CNN Related article Germany's Holocaust mini-memorials go missing amid far-right backlash Many arrived across the border from Austria, entering Germany via Bavaria, one of Germany’s most politically and socially conservative states. It also has one of the highest proportions of Christians – in the 2011 census , over 75% of Bavarians identified as Roman Catholic or Protestant, compared to 62% nationwide. Bavaria’s ruling party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been steadily losing voters to the far-right, anti-Muslim Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The “Kreuzpflicht” or “crucifix obligation,” ushered in before new elections in October, may be one attempt to win voters back. ‘Law could create unrest’ The AfD, which became the first far-right party in decades to enter German parliament following elections last year, criticized the new law as a superficial piece of politics. “The Christian cross is being turned into an election accessory, while the conservatives refuse to protect our basic values with real actions,” said the AfD’s co-chair, Alice Weidel, in a statement in April . At an AfD rally on May 27,  supporters hold placards reading \"No Islam in Germany.\" TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Bavaria’s Christian leaders have also expressed concern. Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, said displaying the cross should not be mandatory and that he feared the law would create “division, unrest and adversity.” “It is a symbol that opposes violence, injustice, sin and death. It is not a symbol against other people,” said Marx in an April interview with German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung . Archbishop Ludwig Schick of Bamberg in northern Bavaria welcomed the prospect of more Christian crosses appearing in the state. “Christians are happy when they see a cross,” he wrote on Twitter on May 2, adding that the symbol held a powerful meaning for followers of Christ: “In the cross is healing, in the cross is life, in the cross is hope.” But, like Marx, he has also stressed the importance of the cross as a symbol of inclusivity, not hostility. It is “a sign of unity, reconciliation, peace, brotherhood, solidarity,” he told radio station Bayerischer Rundfunk in April. ‘Islam does not belong to Germany’ Alternative for Germany leader Alice Weidel (right) chats with two party members during the party congress on December 2 in Hanover, Germany. TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP/Getty Images Related article Opinion -- Germany has a far-right enemy within Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced a public backlash for her handling of the refugee crisis. In response, she appointed Bavarian CSU leader Horst Seehofer to be the Ministry of Interior and “Heimat” – a controversial word that translates as “home” or “homeland” but also signals nostalgia for German tradition. The word is widely used by the AfD and was cited frequently in the “blood and soil” propaganda of the Nazi regime. Seehofer has promised to crack down on asylum applications and speed up deportations. In a March interview, Seehofer told Germany’s largest tabloid, BILD : “Islam does not belong to Germany,” mimicking a central slogan of the AfD and adding: “Germany was shaped by Christianity.” “The Muslims who live among us naturally do belong to Germany,” he added. “Of course, that does not mean that we should, out of a false consideration of others, give up our traditions and customs. Muslims need to live with us, not next to us or against us.” Atika Shubert reported from Berlin and Judith Vonberg wrote from London. CNN’s Nadine Schmidt also contributed to this report.",

The western state is the last in Germany to amend its local legal code, after the national constitution abolished capital punishment in 1949. Some 83% of voters were in favour of changing the 1946 provision, referendum results on Thursday showed. The vote is a symbolic one, as federal laws have always trumped state ones. Between 1946 and 1949, two people were sentenced to death in the state, but the rulings were later commuted to life sentences. Capital punishment is banned in all EU countries, so this lingering quirk was seen as an embarrassment to Germany, an outspoken opponent of the practice. How many countries still have the death penalty? The secret executions in Europe's 'last dictatorship' Pope changes teaching on death penalty The referendum, which took place on Sunday, coincided with a regional vote which saw heavy losses for Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party. On Monday, she announced she would quit as party leader and step down as German chancellor in 2021. How did the law last so long? Germany abolished the death penalty with its Basic Law of 1949, but the state of Hesse's constitution predated this. Other states introduced local bans in line with national law, but wealthy Hesse, home to financial hub Frankfurt, was the last to do so. \"Partly it was never modernised because it wasn't necessary - the Basic Law overrules state constitutions,\" local politician Juergen Banzer said, according to Reuters. A second reason was that Hesse is the only state that can change its state constitution - the oldest in modern Germany - through a people's vote. \"There was a fear that if a terrible crime was committed just as Hesse voted on whether to abolish the death penalty, then the vote could go the wrong way,\" Mr Banzer said. Voters had 15 amendments to consider on Sunday, including statements on children's rights, sex equality, European unity and environmental sustainability.

The government decision came amid a row over Mr Maassen's response to far-right unrest in Chemnitz, eastern Germany. Anti-migrant \"hunts\" were reported there on 26 August after a German man was killed in a brawl with migrants. Mr Maassen doubted that foreign-looking people had been hounded. Chancellor Angela Merkel was urged to sack him. Critics said his scepticism downplayed the seriousness of far-right violence and intimidation in Chemnitz. Mr Maassen will leave the BfV spy service and become a state secretary in the interior ministry. German media report that he will actually move to a higher pay grade. It is not yet clear who will replace him. What happened in Chemnitz? Several xenophobic assaults were reported in the eastern city after the fatal stabbing of Daniel Hillig. They were described as racist \"hunts\", and images emerged showing demonstrators chasing people and flinging bottles and fireworks. Controversially, spy chief Mr Maassen said his Federal Office for Constitutional Protection (BfV) , external - which is similar to the British MI5 - had \"no reliable information about such hunts taking place\" in Chemnitz. He also questioned whether a video posted by \"Antifa Zeckenbiss\" - meaning \"anti-fascist tick bite\" - really showed, as claimed, a \"hunt in Chemnitz\" on 26 August.

German public broadcaster ARD said in a \"fact-check\" , external that Antifa Zeckenbiss is an anonymous Twitter account, active since February, posting anti-fascist messages and \"there is nothing to indicate that it is a fake account\". There were more far-right rallies in Chemnitz after 26 August, and smaller counter-demonstrations by leftists. Mr Maassen was also criticised over his contacts with far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politicians. Germany jails Chemnitz Nazi salute man Germany's far right march en masse Are migrants driving crime in Germany? Who decided to force him out? Tuesday's decision was a compromise between Mrs Merkel and her coalition partners - Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the right-wing Bavarian CSU, and centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) leader Andrea Nahles. Mr Seehofer defended Mr Maassen's actions over Chemnitz, but Ms Nahles wanted him dismissed. AfD's Beatrix von Storch tweeted scornfully: , external \"This gives the SPD what it wanted in theory, Seehofer can remain spineless and Merkel gets some peace.\" What happened about the stabbing? Investigations over the murder of Daniel Hillig are ongoing. Earlier on Tuesday, an Iraqi man identified as Yousif A was released from custody, three weeks after he was arrested and detained over the killing. His lawyer Ulrich Dost-Roxin said the detention had been \"illegal\", and accused officials and politicians of using him for political ends. \"No witness accused my client of involvement in the crime,\" he said in a statement. , external Image source, AFP Image caption, A far-right crowd in central Chemnitz on 27 August - further rallies were held recently A Syrian man is still in custody, and police are still looking for a third suspect. What's the bigger picture? The Maassen controversy has fuelled fears that Germany's main state security body may be soft on far-right extremism. AfD is now the main opposition party, with 92 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. It backs the far-right protests, arguing that violent asylum-seekers should be expelled from Germany. AfD is furious with Mrs Merkel for having let in more than a million migrants in 2015-2016. Mr Maassen's predecessor was forced to quit over BfV shortcomings in the notorious NSU neo-Nazi case, in which a terrorist cell killed 10 people in a racially-motivated campaign in 2000-2007. The BfV and police were found to have neglected or ignored racism as a motive. Who does the BfV spy on? It has about 3,100 staff who, along with regional intelligence services, monitor groups acting against Germany's democratic order. It was created in 1950 by the Allied powers in Germany to guard against communist and pro-Nazi groups. It is part of the federal interior ministry and is overseen by the Bundestag. The BfV cannot make arrests. It says most of its intelligence is gathered from open or public sources, including press reports. It can only spy on groups - not private individuals - engaged in anti-constitutional behaviour. Separate BfV departments spy on radical left-wingers, far-right extremists and militant Islamists. The BfV also runs counter-espionage operations, watching foreign spies in Germany. But overseas intelligence-gathering is done by the BND spy service.

Seehofer confirmed early on Monday morning he would offer to step down [Sven Hoppe/DPA via AP] Published On 2 Jul 2018 2 Jul 2018 German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has offered to resign after rejecting a migration deal brokered in Brussels by Chancellor Angela Merkel , as the two leaders prepare for final talks on Monday. Early on Monday, Seehofer confirmed he would offer to step down from the posts, while party leaders are reportedly trying to convince the minister to stay put. Speaking outside the CSU headquarters after a leadership meeting, Seehofer told reporters “I said yes, that I would make both posts available, which I will do within three days”. He added he would meet Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday in hopes of reaching an agreement “in the interests of this country and the ability of our coalition and government to rule, which we want to preserve”. Merkel and Seehofer have been embroiled in a dispute for weeks over the interior minister’s plan to start turning away migrants at the German border who have already registered elsewhere in the European Union (EU). If the CSU withdraws its support for Merkel’s coalition, she would be left without a majority in the German parliament, possibly prompting fresh elections. Two-week deadline Merkel is opposed to Seehofer’s plan, which she said would cause a domino effect in Europe. But Seehofer has stood firm and gave the chancellor a two-week deadline in June to broker a European solution or he would start implementing the policy unilaterally. Advertisement On Friday, Merkel and the rest of the EU leaders hammered out a vaguely-worded deal to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and create “controlled centres” inside the bloc to process asylum requests. But on Sunday party sources told AFP news agency that Seehofer was unhappy with the accord and complained that he had endured a “conversation with no effect” with Merkel on Sunday. Reuters news agency also quoted a party source as saying that Seehofer saw no alternative to turning some migrants back at the country’s border. The CSU’s hard line on migration comes amid a growth in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria, where state elections will be held in October. In a televised interview on Sunday, Merkel said “The sum of everything we have decided has the same effect [as national measures]”. “That is my personal conclusion. Of course, the CSU will have to decide that for itself,” she added. Government scenarios If Seehofer goes ahead with his resignation, the CSU, the sister party of Merkel’s CDU, can either propose a new interior minister or decide to pull out of the coalition government altogether. This would leave Merkel and her remaining coalition partner the Social Democrats ( SPD) with a minority in the parliament – something she could bridge by courting support from opposition parties for legislation or finding an additional coalition partner. Last November, when Merkel was negotiating her fourth coalition, the long-time chancellor told German broadcaster ZDF she was “very sceptical” about leading a minority government and would rather call new elections. Advertisement Under the deal brokered in Brussels, EU leaders agreed to consider setting up “disembarkation platforms” outside the bloc, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants and refugees boarding EU-bound boats. Member countries could also create processing centres to determine whether the new arrivals are returned home as economic migrants or admitted as refugees in willing states. At the national level, Merkel proposes that migrants arriving in Germany who first registered in another EU country should be placed in special “admission centres” under restrictive conditions, according to a document she sent to the CSU and SPD. A document circulated by Merkel to coalition allies on Friday night outlined bilateral repatriation agreements with 16 countries and proposed reception centres in Germany where migrants would undergo an accelerated asylum procedure – measures that represent a significant hardening of her 2015 open-door asylum policy. But the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long sought to position himself as Merkel’s nemesis in the immigration debate polarising the continent, later said they had signed no bilateral agreements on repatriation. Migration downturn Political stability was upset by Merkel’s 2015 decision to keep borders open to migrants and refugees arriving from the Middle East via the Balkans, Hungary and Austria. Since then, more than one million people have arrived in Germany, while Merkel’s governments have repeatedly tightened immigration and asylum laws. The current political crisis over migration comes amid a significant downturn in the number of arrivals. This year, about 45,000 migrants and refugees have reached Europe’s shores by crossing the Mediterranean so far while in 2017 nearly 100,000 people had arrived by the end of June.

Credit... Thorsten Wagner/Reuters By Katrin Bennhold June 8, 2018 It was a gruesome murder: A 14-year-old girl was raped and strangled, her body buried under brushwood in a secluded area near the railway tracks near her hometown in western Germany. But the fact that the chief suspect is an Iraqi asylum seeker has turned a terrible crime into political dynamite. On Friday, the case dominated the German news media and became the latest cudgel for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opponents and, some predicted, a potential turning point in the migration debate in a country where some 10,000 asylum seekers still enter every month. There is no doubt the murder has given ammunition to those who want to get tougher, led by the far right, who are waging a widening challenge to what they contend is the government’s botched handling of asylum cases. The killing comes on top of a deepening scandal and calls for a full-blown parliamentary investigation over allegations that civil servants may have granted asylum to as many as 1,000 migrants in exchange for money — and that some of those migrants may have been criminals or even terrorism suspects. The murder suspect, identified as Ali Bashar, a 20-year-old Iraqi, arrived in Germany in October 2015, shortly after Ms. Merkel opened the borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. He was rejected in late 2016, but was allowed to stay in the country while his appeal was pending. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

It was also heard in Clausnitz in early 2016, as a mob of Germans surrounded a bus of refugees entering their town. And later that year in Bautzen, as 80 Germans chased some 20 teenage refugees through the streets. The chant has become a go-to for the German far right. But it wasn’t always an extremist rallying cry. “Leipzig is a city of protest again tonight.” In 1989, people in East Germany took to the streets to demand more freedom, after living under an oppressive communist regime for decades. Their movement was neither of the right nor the left. It was a cry for democracy. After German reunification, the chant largely disappeared. But in recent years, it has been co-opted by far-right groups who violently oppose Angela Merkel’s open border policies. Violent demonstrations against refugees have featured a chant that translates to English as “we are the people.” Credit Credit... Jens Meyer/Associated Press By Katrin Bennhold Aug. 30, 2018 CHEMNITZ, Germany — Waving German flags, with some flashing Nazi salutes, the angry mob made its way through the streets, chasing after dark-skinned bystanders as police officers, vastly outnumbered, were too afraid to intervene. A Syrian refugee and father of two, Anas al-Nahlawie, watched horrified from a friend’s fourth-floor balcony. They were hunting in packs for immigrants just like him, he said. “Like wolves.” For a few perilous hours over two days this week, the mob owned the streets of Chemnitz , where anger exploded after word spread that an Iraqi and a Syrian asylum seeker were suspected in a knife attack that killed a German man early Sunday. Chemnitz, a city of some 250,000 in eastern Germany, has a history of neo-Nazi protests. Usually they draw a few hundred from the fringes of society — and far larger counter-demonstrations, city officials say. The crowd this time was 8,000-strong. Led by several hundred identifiable neo-Nazis, it appeared to be joined by thousands of ordinary citizens. More marches are planned Saturday. The city had never seen anything like this — and, to some degree, neither had post-World War II Germany. The rampage now stands as a high-water mark in the outpouring of anti-immigrant hatred that has swelled as Germany struggles to absorb the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived in the country after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to open the borders in 2015.

Rumours circulated online that she had been murdered by a Muslim immigrant. But the truth of what happened was very different from the wild speculation. Karin Gross lives in east Berlin. On 7 March 2018 she received a phone call at work from her 14-year-old daughter Keira. \"She said to me: 'OK, Mama I'm at home, give me a ring when you are coming back.' So when I finished work I got in my car and phoned her. But she didn't answer.\" Karin called again, and again. No one picked up. She sent a WhatsApp message, but it didn't go through. She assumed that the network was down, or that her daughter had turned off her phone to have a nap. Karin drove home. When she entered her flat, she saw that the living room door was closed. \"That was unusual,\" says Karin. \"I searched the apartment for my daughter. I went to her bedroom. She wasn't in there.\" She entered the living room. \"I saw her sitting in front of the couch, gagged with a scarf full of blood.\" Keira had been stabbed more than 20 times. Image caption Karin Gross wants people to remember her daughter Ice skating star I meet Karin at her lawyer's office on a bitterly cold day in Berlin. She has a naturally cheerful disposition and, under normal circumstances, is quick to laugh. \"The daytimes aren't so bad,\" she says. The nights are a lot harder. Karin speaks about the most traumatic experience imaginable with astonishing clarity. She is determined that people understand what losing her daughter has been like. \"I want everyone to remember what happened to her,\" she tells me. Keira was a popular, charismatic girl and already an ice skating star in Berlin at 14. Karin was a single mother and Keira her only child. While the police investigation continued, a very different process was taking place online. Keira's death was swiftly exploited by activists hostile to migrants. \"It only took hours for there to be posts from far-right actors with the hashtag 'Keira' on Twitter and on Facebook,\" says Oliver Saal, a researcher at the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, an anti-extremism organisation. \"Posts appeared about the case suggesting that immigrants had committed this crime. \"The perpetrator was still unknown, and they knew it. But because Keira had been murdered with a knife, (they assumed) it had to be a non-German who had done it. \"Far-right actors claimed that no German could ever do such a thing.\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Migrants entering Germany from Austria in 2015 This speculation appeared to confirm the worst fears of many Germans who opposed Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees in the summer of 2015. Concerns about mass immigration have fuelled the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which entered the German parliament as the third biggest party in September 2017. Keira's death also followed two other widely-discussed murders in Germany: Maria Ladenburger , a student murdered in 2016 by a refugee who claimed to be from Afghanistan; and a 15-year -old girl known as Mia V, who was killed by her Afghan ex-boyfriend in the town of Kandel in 2017. There has been an increase in crime committed by migrants in Germany since 2015. Some researchers put this down to the high proportion of refugees who are young and male. Young men commit more crimes than any other demographic. Overall, however, crime in Germany is falling - down to its lowest level since 1992. While violent crime rose between 2014 and 2016, there was a 2.5% decrease between 2016 and 2017. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Karin's story 'Beast from the Caucasus' Four days after Keira's murder, the police announced they had arrested a 15-year-old boy. When the police told Karin the suspect's name, she was shocked. \"I didn't know him personally, but I had heard a lot about him,\" she says. \"Keira had photos in her room of him. She was a little bit in love with him but they were not together. She always spoke about him like he was her brother.\" Initially, neither the boy's ethnic or religious background was revealed to the public. Despite this being normal police procedure, posts criticising the authorities erupted across social media. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pegida supporters marching in Dresden The criticism leaked into more mainstream politics and media as well. An AfD state representative in Berlin tweeted asking why the perpetrator's \"origin\" had not been made public. The editor-in-chief of Bild, the most popular tabloid in Germany, called for the \"regular information\" about the perpetrator to be revealed. The suggestion that important information was being withheld from the public fed into a narrative that \"the establishment\" was covering up evidence of a migrant crime wave. Oliver Saal says one man played a key role in promoting this conspiracy theory. Lutz Bachmann is the founder of Pegida - otherwise known as the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident - a far-right, anti-Islam organisation. He's now an influential social media personality on the German far right. Following Keira's murder, Bachmann posted online that he knew the identity of the suspect. He claimed that the culprit was a \"beast from the Caucasus\", a \"Chechen Muslim\" and a \"former refugee\". Chechnya has historically been a source of Muslim immigrants to Germany. Bachmann posted a picture of a boy online. He included the boy's full name and linked to his Facebook profile. The post was shared widely. The culprit, as far as many of Bachmann's followers were concerned, had been identified. Except it wasn't him. Image copyright EPA Image caption Lutz Bachmann falsely claimed a \"Chechen Muslim\" was the killer The boy that Bachmann had discovered online had nothing to do with the crime - he just happened to have the same first name and surname initial as the real suspect. With posts accusing him of murder proliferating across the internet, the boy made his social media accounts private. The BBC's efforts to contact him were unsuccessful. We tried to contact Lutz Bachmann through Pegida. They said they had \"no interest\" in speaking to us. Bachmann's post was so wide of the mark that the police felt compelled to take the unusual step of responding online. They posted a screenshot of Bachmann's tweet, and called it \"fake news\". Image Copyright @polizeiberlin @polizeiberlin Report Image Copyright @polizeiberlin @polizeiberlin Report In Germany a victim's relatives are entitled to be represented at court proceedings. A few days after Keira's murder, Karin Gross contacted Roland Weber, a well-known criminal lawyer, to represent her. \"This case for me was like a puzzle,\" says Weber. \"We had many little pieces and then, step by step, I began to see the bigger picture.\" The boy who had been arrested was neither a refugee nor a Muslim, as Bachmann had claimed. He was a white church-going German-born teenager, who because of his youth was given the legal pseudonym \"Hannes\". \"When he was first arrested he told the police a (particular) story,\" Weber says. \"He said that the daughter of my client wanted to commit suicide and that she begged for him to do this for her.\" However, Keira's behaviour with friends and family in the days before she died did not suggest that she had been planning to kill herself. Her calendar was filled with plans she had made for the coming months. Image copyright Karin Gross Image caption Police dismissed the suspect's claims that Keira had been suicidal As the investigation proceeded, a different picture began to emerge, one which indicated there was a greater degree of premeditation in Hannes' actions than he had first admitted. Hannes had brought a backpack with him to Keira's home. It contained a change of clothes, gloves and a mask. Some of his schoolmates told police that in the days before the crime Hannes had spoken, in detail, about what he was going to do. In fact, he had even called one of them minutes after the murder to confirm that he had gone through with it. 'The hardest thing in the world' Karin attended every day of the trial. Hannes sat with his mother on the opposite side of the room. \"I think it was the hardest thing in the world that I have ever been through,\" Karin says. \"I didn't get any regrets or any apologies - not from his family. Nothing. Even when they were talking about what he has done, he didn't apologise. He talked about it like stealing a car.\" Teachers described Hannes as a friendly, popular boy, but there was a very different side to his personality. \"He wasn't sure if his friends were real friends,\" Roland Weber says. \"One day he decided that if he couldn't have real friends then maybe it would be better to be the bad guy: the Joker, the opposite character to Batman.\" You may also be interested in: The truth behind a viral murder video The battle over Britain's newest student movement The memes that might get you jailed in Russia The court heard that for some time before the killing, Hannes had dyed his hair green and even wore white face paint to look like the Joker. Evidence about his actions after the murder also suggested a chilly detachment. Knowing that he needed to destroy Keira's phone - so there would be no trace of the WhatsApp messages they had exchanged - he went to a nearby lake and threw it in. He went home and returned the knife to a block in his parents' kitchen. Then he turned on his computer and began to play League of Legends. A court-appointed psychiatrist concluded that there was no indication that Hannes had a personality disorder or a mental illness. \"In the end,\" Roland Weber says, \"all of us - not only the judge, but also my client and me - we were very sure that he just did it for fun. To see how it is when someone is dying.\" Hannes was convicted of murder and sentenced to nine years juvenile detention. The story was very different from the narrative being promoted by far-right activists online. A Berlin police spokesperson told the press that they had \"never experienced a murder case being politically exploited in such a way.\" Image copyright Karin Gross Image caption Keira was Karin's only child On a January afternoon, Karin takes me to the cemetery where Keira is buried. She comes almost every day. Trimming the leaves of an orange rose to lay on the grave, Karin describes how on one visit, a few months earlier, she made a disturbing discovery. Keira's grave had been desecrated. On the gravestone someone had written the name of the murderer and described him as \"Russian.\" The myth of the \"beast from the Caucasus\" persisted. \"It was a shock for me,\" says Karin, \"because I never thought there would be someone who would write something like that on my daughter's gravestone. \"For me it doesn't make any difference if it was Russian or Japanese or anything like that,\" she tells me. \"My daughter is still dead.\" Karin tried to get rid of the graffiti with water, but it wouldn't come off. She went home to get nail polish remover. Even with that, it took two hours to scrub the marble clean. Image copyright Karin Gross Karin still lives in the same flat where her daughter was murdered. \"People wonder how I can bear it,\" she says. \"I haven't changed anything. OK, I have a new couch. But all the blood and evidence of what happened are gone.\" \"I can't imagine moving away. It was one day that was not good. But there are so many years of memories there.\" Recently she has taken her first tentative steps onto the ice at the hall where Keira practised. She wears her daughter's skating clothes. \"They fit me, although we have a different figure - her shoes too,\" Karin says. \"Perhaps in 10 years I will also be a speed skater. I am just doing it because I want to be near her. I go there to have fun. \"I am not alone. So many friends of hers come ice skating with me. We do it together, in memory of her.\" If you need support for mental health issues, advice is available via the BBC Action Line . Do you have a story for us? Email BBC Trending .
