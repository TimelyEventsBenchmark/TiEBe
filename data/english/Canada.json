Sportsnet Staff February 18, 2017, 6:50 PM Sportsnet Staff February 18, 2017, 6:50 PM A few weeks after three finalists made their final pitches to host the 100th Memorial Cup in 2018, it has been announced that Regina, Saskatchewan has won the honour. Hamilton and Oshawa were the other two finalists. “It’s really exciting to hear that Regina and the Regina Pats have it, this is their centennial of course,” said former Pat and NHLer Ed Staniowski, who was part of the delegation that made a pitch on behalf of the city. The Pats are the oldest major junior franchise, and have been in continuous operation since 1917. The team has won the Memorial Cup four times, in 1925, 1928, 1930 and 1974. “The 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup and the celebrations around this centennial event will truly capture, preserve, and enhance the legacy of one of the most prestigious trophies in all of sport while honouring the brave men and women who served and continue to serve our country,” said CHL President David Branch in a release. “I applaud our national Site Selection Committee who were challenged with the decision of choosing between three outstanding bids.  On behalf of the CHL we look forward to working with the City of Regina and the Regina Pats to engage the entire nation in what will truly be a historic event.” Their arena, the Brandt Centre, seats 6,484 and has been used since 1977. Regina last hosted the Memorial Cup in 2001. This year’s host is Windsor.

The timing means the leadership race will be six weeks longer than it was in 2011, when Clark won. Article content Article content Article content Candidates widely considered to be contemplating a leadership bid include MLAs Mike Bernier, Todd Stone, Andrew Wilkinson, Mike de Jong and Michael Lee, as well as South Surrey-White Rock MP Dianne Watts. None have officially announced their intention to run for the leadership, but Bernier, Stone and Wilkinson said Tuesday that they’ll decide in the coming weeks.

Article content Candidates will have a Dec. 29 entry deadline, and have to pay $60,000 in various fees ($50,000 of which will be non-refundable). Each candidate will have a $600,000 spending limit, up from $450,000 in the 2011 leadership race. Article content “The way they’ve adjusted the limits is more than fair for anyone who is running,” said Bernier, who added he’s encouraged by the overall rule changes. “If you cannot run a leadership race for under $600,000, I would say there’s a problem with how you are running your campaign.” Article content In another change from 2011 candidates won’t be able to exempt personal expenses as defined under the Election Act from their spending cap. The party said that exemption caused considerable confusion in the last race, and so was eliminated. Article content Article content “It’s very simple, it’s very clean,” Stone said of the cap. “The cap in and of itself will allow for a level playing field that ensures each campaign can run a provincial and professional campaign without that campaign being over the top.” Article content Wilkinson said he thinks the rules are “quite reasonable.” Article content “It seems the party has done its best to address concerns about the duration of the race, the amount of money that can be spent by candidates and most importantly about the integrity of the voting system,” he said. Article content Perhaps the biggest change in the race will be how Liberal members have their identities authorized to vote. In 2011, the party mailed personal identification numbers (PINs) to members, but then faced harsh criticism from candidates after thousands of members, from mainly rural ridings, failed to get their PINs before voting opened. Article content “I’m glad they learned from some mistakes from last time,” said Bernier. Article content There were also concerns raised in 2011 about PINs being obtained in bulk to cast votes, though the party says that allegation was never substantiated.

Article content The Liberal party said it intends to put out a request for proposals to find an alternate form of member authentication in the coming weeks. Voting will run Feb. 2-4 online and by phone. Article content “I think there was a lot of concern expressed by a lot of members around the province, and I shared those concerns, that there were many stories from the last go-round that called into question perhaps the integrity of the PIN system,” said Stone. But he said he’s pleased to see the party considering new technological solutions. Article content The Liberals have retained the weighted vote system from the 2011 race, which gives all ridings in the province 100 points to award to a candidate. Bernier said it gives rural areas, with fewer members, the same voice on selecting a leader as big urban centres. Article content The price of a membership remains the same — $10 for four years.

Jack credits Radek with giving her the strength to speak publicly about her missing sister, Doreen Jack. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press) Social Sharing Members of the United Nations Human Rights Council are urging Canada to improve its treatment of Indigenous people, in particular women and girls. Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould represented Canada in Geneva for the UN's third Universal Periodic Review of human rights. Wilson-Raybould says she heard the council's message \"loudly and clearly,\" including the need to support the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and addressing the over-representation of Aboriginal women behind bars. \"We know this is a challenge we're facing, it needs to be addressed in a fundamental way,\" she said Friday in a telephone interview from Geneva. 'Do something': Liberals faced angry backlash over Colten Boushie case 'We are all impatient': Trudeau promises First Nations leaders fundamental change The review, first established in 2008, sees the council review the human rights records of all UN members and make recommendations for improvement. Canada has taken part in two reviews, in 2009 and in 2013, although 2018 marks the first time that a federal minister has led a delegation for the presentation. Wilson-Raybould said she welcomes the feedback — and while Canada has made important gains, a great deal more work remains. Minister touts progress, not perfection The government is still considering whether it will grant the missing and murdered women inquiry a two-year extension, which commissioners requested in March. The decision will come \"in the near future\", she said. \"We will ensure Indigenous survivors and family members will be heard by the commission and that we will complete the work of the national inquiry in a way that allows those voices to be heard, commemorates lived experiences of Indigenous women and gets at the root causes of why the situation exists in the first place,\" Wilson-Raybould said. In a speech to the council, she highlighted the government's launch of the inquiry, its work in eliminating boil-water advisories in First Nations communities and its intention to implement the 94 recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. She also raised the government's plan to work with First Nations, Inuit and Metis people on a recognition and rights framework, which she said builds on the government's reconciliation efforts. The struggle continues Wilson-Raybould said she is reviewing the Criminal Code and that the government is working on pay equity legislation. She reminded the council of Trudeau's apology to those in the LGBTQ2 community harmed by past federal legislation. The review confirmed however that Canada is still \"failing millions of Canadians by denying them an equal chance to succeed and thrive,\" said Marie-Claude Landry, chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. 'We are truly sorry': Trudeau exonerates Tsilhqot'in chiefs hanged in 1864 Ottawa vows to eliminate tuberculosis in Inuit communities by 2030 \"The recommendations in this third UPR are not a surprise to anyone,\" she said. \"For the most part, they are largely the same as those presented to Canada in 2013. This latest review is evidence that, despite best efforts at all levels of government, Canada continues to struggle to address this country's most urgent human rights issues.\" Landry credited the government for putting human rights back on the agenda and cited the prioritization of women's equality, reconciliation, homelessness and LGBTQ2 rights as examples. Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that Canada is \"not perfect\" and that there's room for improvement. \"Hearing from our peers is an opportunity to take recommendations and do what we can to improve.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error Related Stories 'Do something': Liberals faced angry backlash over Colten Boushie case 'We are all impatient': Trudeau promises First Nations leaders fundamental change 'We are truly sorry': Trudeau exonerates Tsilhqot'in chiefs hanged in 1864 Ottawa vows to eliminate tuberculosis in Inuit communities by 2030",

Bob Tymczyszyn/Postmedia Network Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error A basketball wasn’t available to use as a prop at a Wednesday news conference announcing St. Catharines being awarded an international hoops tournament. “Does anyone have a basketball?” Walter Sendzik, the city’s mayor, asked before joining the three other keynote speakers for a photo op on a temporary stage on the second floor of Meridian Centre. That won’t be a problem in June 2018. With eight teams from as far south as Argentina competing in the FIBA boys under-18 Americas championships, bouncing basketballs will abound in the multi-use downtown arena. They will be dribbling up and down a new court that could cost Canada Basketball up to $200,000, passed in bounds by future Olympians and NBA players and, for the host Canadians, swishing through the net, hopefully at a pace-setting rate for the first time in the tournament’s 28-year history. Canada’s success internationally in a sport developed by a Canadian, albeit at a YMCA in Springsfield, Mass., is definitely on the upswing. Master of ceremonies Rod Mawhood pointed out Canada followed up three third-place finishes in a row with back-to-back silver medals. “Three bronze medal finishes, then back-to-back silvers – we’re due for gold next year, on this court!” St. Catharines topped a short list of Brampton, Winnipeg and Vancouver after Federation International de Basketball, the sport’s world governing body, awarded Canada the right to host the biennial tournament for the first time. “Official FIBA hosting is a strategic priority for us, so we’ve been working on this for about a year and a half,” Canada Basketball president and chief executive officer Michele O’Keefe said. “I just went to FIBA, and I went in ahead of the game, and said ‘Listen, we’re prepared, we’re ready to do this and we need to confirm it right away so we can build our plan.’” O’Keefe, a Welland native who played basketball at Bishop's University after graduating from Welland Centennial Secondary School, said Meridian Centre tipped the scales in favour of St. Catharines when the time came to select a venue, as did Brock University. “I think we’re likely to use the dorms for residences for the athletes and the fact they are so close together.” Plans to close off St. Paul Street East between the Meridian Centre bridges for a street festival on the final day of the June 11-17 tournament also impressed the selection committee of which O’Keefe was not a part. “I think it’s such a self-contained little area.” Niagara’s “basketball history” also was a factor in landing a tournament that has been played in the U.S. on three occasions and in Argentina twice. “The Niagara Sport Commission and the City of St. Catharines did a great job of building and leveraging the history of basketball down here in Niagara,” she said in an interview. “It just seemed like a perfect fit.” A top-three finish at the under-18s would qualify Canada to compete in the 2019 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, but Canada Basketball’s goals aren’t all that so short term nor limited to the court. O’Keefe and one-time Olympian Mike Meeks, manager of men’s youth player development, both see hoops at the grassroots level in Niagara benefiting from a legacy of improved coaching, officiating and calibre of play. Meeks said the opportunity to see some of the best of up-and-coming basketball players in the world can’t help but leave a lasting impression on the next generation. “An event like this puts it in front of kids,” he said. “There will be kids sitting there watching who may be playing more soccer at one point or more baseball. They are going to come to this event and say ‘Hey, why not basketball.’” “I started really focusing on basketball at about eighth grade, and the rest is history,” said Meeks, who played for the Canadian men’s team that lost to France in the championship quarter-finals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. “Events like this, on your home soil, just shows the level which the community is willing to go to for the sport.” Home-court advantage will be a “huge” factor in Canada’s favour when action gets underway at Meridian Centre. Meeks, speaking from experience, said there can be a “night-and-day difference” between their facilities at home and some of the gyms they practise in when travelling abroad for international tournaments. Culture shock can also throw players off their games, giving visiting teams more to deal with than the X’s and O’s of executing plays on the court. “We have to know what the weather is going to be like, the food — sometimes they don’t want to eat the food that’s provided — and not having the comfort of their peers and family and friends to lean on when they meet with some adversity,” Meeks said. Pelham Panthers Basketball Association president Brian Bleich echoed Meeks’ comments about the importance of home-court advantage at international tournaments. Bleich found playing for Canada at the world junior championships in 1987 in Rome difficult especially after the team prepared for worlds by playing in Bangkok, Thailand. “We’re playing in hot, humid conditions at a different elevation, and not used to it, and you’ve got to train for that,” he said. “You’re 12 guys on a bench and that’s it, that’s your fans. And there’s going to 10, 12,000 people in the seats.” Unlike globetrotting players nowadays, Bleich’s heyday in international hoops was long before Skype. “I was 17 at the time,” he recalled. “That was back in the ‘80s, there was nothing, there was no phone. I didn’t have contact with my family for almost three months.” St. Catharines city council showed its support for the bid in a unanimous vote last December to waive $64,000 in rental fees and related costs for use of the city-owned downtown arena. Sendzik thanked previous councillors who had the foresight to build “this kind of facility in our community so we can host the Scotties, we can host the word under-18 women’s championships.” “If we didn’t have this facility, we wouldn’t have this event here today,” he said. Sendzik praised the Niagara Sport Commission and the company managing day-to-day operations at Meridian Centre for putting on a “great show” when Canada Basketball toured the site. “These are the individuals that are really doing the heavy lifting to ensure that when Basketball Canada comes in here, they just don’t see the Meridian Centre, they see all that we have to offer, all the way down St. Paul Street,” he said. “They see the volunteers and the support that we have.” The mayor also acknowledged the many club teams in the region in his remarks. bfranke@postmedia.com “",

The city’s emergency services said there was a sharp increase in calls since a heat wave began last week. Credit... Eva Hambach/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Dan Bilefsky July 5, 2018 MONTREAL — Thirty-three people have died in Quebec from one of the worst heat waves to hit eastern and central Canada in decades, the authorities said on Thursday, underscoring the vulnerability of elderly, ill and poor people during the hot summer months. Dr. David Kaiser, the senior physician at Montreal’s public health agency, said that most of those who had died from the heat in Montreal were 65 or older, had histories of health problems or mental illness and had been living without air-conditioning. He said that disadvantaged people who had chronic illnesses or were living alone were particularly vulnerable. “While we are an advanced industrialized economy, these deaths reflect that there are serious social inequalities,” he said, adding that many wealthy countries the world over had been hit by heat waves associated with climate change. Public health authorities in Quebec have made a concerted effort to improve the reporting of heat-related deaths. They have set up a special liaison program with hospitals and emergency rooms to monitor heat-related illnesses and mortality, Dr. Kaiser said, which may explain why the number of deaths seems high compared to elsewhere in the nation. On Thursday, as temperatures in Montreal rose to 93 degrees — 23 degrees above the average daily temperature for July — local residents sought refuge in park fountains or remained inside in air-conditioned homes or offices. Some elderly residents canceled appointments and stayed at home, eager to avoid the stifling heat outside. Home appliance stores have been mobbed in recent days, with residents trying to buy air-conditioners, only to discover that all the units are sold out. At a sprawling Home Depot store in central Montreal, about 20 shoppers were seen fighting this week over the last remaining air- conditioner. “It’s survival of the fittest,” said Victor Perchet, who managed to get it.

Sportsnet Staff February 18, 2017, 6:50 PM Sportsnet Staff February 18, 2017, 6:50 PM A few weeks after three finalists made their final pitches to host the 100th Memorial Cup in 2018, it has been announced that Regina, Saskatchewan has won the honour. Hamilton and Oshawa were the other two finalists. “It’s really exciting to hear that Regina and the Regina Pats have it, this is their centennial of course,” said former Pat and NHLer Ed Staniowski, who was part of the delegation that made a pitch on behalf of the city. The Pats are the oldest major junior franchise, and have been in continuous operation since 1917. The team has won the Memorial Cup four times, in 1925, 1928, 1930 and 1974. “The 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup and the celebrations around this centennial event will truly capture, preserve, and enhance the legacy of one of the most prestigious trophies in all of sport while honouring the brave men and women who served and continue to serve our country,” said CHL President David Branch in a release. “I applaud our national Site Selection Committee who were challenged with the decision of choosing between three outstanding bids.  On behalf of the CHL we look forward to working with the City of Regina and the Regina Pats to engage the entire nation in what will truly be a historic event.” Their arena, the Brandt Centre, seats 6,484 and has been used since 1977. Regina last hosted the Memorial Cup in 2001. This year’s host is Windsor.

        "text": "Politics Canada just legalized marijuana. That has big implications for US drug policy. It’s the second country in the world to legalize pot, following Uruguay. by German Lopez Updated Jun 21, 2018, 2:44 PM UTC Facebook Link Marijuana smoke lingers in front of Parliament Hill during a 4/20 rally in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty Images Canada has become the first wealthy nation in the world to fully legalize marijuana . The Senate approved Bill C-45 , also known as the Cannabis Act, on Tuesday. The measure was already approved by the House of Commons, so the Senate’s approval means it’s now set to become law. The measure legalizes marijuana possession, home growing, and sales for adults. The federal government will oversee remaining criminal sanctions (for, say, selling to minors) and the licensing of producers, while provincial governments will manage sales, distribution, and related regulations — as such, provinces will be able to impose tougher rules, such as raising the minimum age. The statute largely follows recommendations made by a federal task force on marijuana legalization. The law will go into effect on October 17, with at least some sales beginning on that date, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said . None of this may seem too shocking in the US, where already nine states have legalized marijuana for recreational use and 29 states have allowed it for medicinal purposes. What sets Canada apart, though, is it’s doing this as a country. Previously, the South American nation of Uruguay was the only one that legally allowed marijuana for recreational purposes. Canada, like the US, is part of international drug treaties that explicitly ban legalizing marijuana. Although activists have been pushing to change these treaties for years, they have failed so far — and that means Canada will be, in effect, in violation of international law in moving to legalize. (The US argues it’s still in accordance with the treaties because federal law still technically prohibits cannabis, even though some states have legalized it.) For Canada’s ruling party, this fulfills a major campaign promise. When Trudeau’s Liberal Party was elected in 2015, one of the main promises he ran on was to legalize marijuana. “We will legalize, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana,” the Liberal Party declared on its campaign website. “Canada’s current system of marijuana prohibition does not work. It does not prevent young people from using marijuana and too many Canadians end up with criminal records for possessing small amounts of the drug.” But the process languished as Trudeau and his allies waited for a federal task force’s recommendations and as the Senate debated several provisions in the bill. In moving forward, the Canadian government is now walking a fine line: It’s hoping to legalize marijuana to clamp down on the black market for cannabis and provide a safe outlet for adults, but it’s risking making pot more accessible to kids and people with drug use disorders. It is taking a bold step against outdated international drug laws, but it could upset countries like Russia, China, and even the US that have historically adopted a stricter view of the treaties. And while Canadian lawmakers may feel marijuana legalization is right for their country, there’s a risk that legal Canadian pot will spill over to the US — perhaps causing tensions with Canada’s neighbor and one of its closest allies. Whether Canada is successful in its legalization attempts will depend on how it strikes a balance between these concerns. And depending on how it pulls this off, it may provide a model to other countries interested in legalization — including the US. The risks and benefits of legalization For Canada, marijuana legalization has been a balancing act from the start. On one hand, marijuana prohibition has a lot of costs. In Canada, tens of thousands of people are arrested for marijuana offenses each year, ripping communities and families apart as people are thrown in jail or prison and gain criminal records. Enforcement of these laws also costs money, while legalizing and taxing marijuana could bring in extra revenue — although typically not that much, based on Colorado’s experience , where marijuana taxes make up less than 1 percent of the general budget. The black market for marijuana fuels violence around the world — not only can it lead to conflicts and violence within Canada, but the money from illegally produced and sold pot often goes back to drug cartels that then use that money to carry out brutal violence, including murders , beheadings , kidnappings , and torture . Legalization shifts marijuana out of the illicit, potentially violent market toward a legal one that can produce legitimate jobs. Legalization carries risks too. It could lead to more use and misuse by making pot cheaper and more available. Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert at New York University’s Marron Institute, estimates that in the long term a legal marijuana joint will cost no more to make than, say, a tea bag — since both products come from plants that are fairly easy to grow. It would also be available to anyone (of legal age) in retail outlets after legalization — meaning it would no longer require a shady or secretive meeting with a drug dealer. Those are benefits for people who use marijuana without problems, to be sure, but easier access could also pose a risk for people who can’t control their cannabis consumption. Although marijuana isn’t very dangerous compared to some drugs, it does carry some risks: dependence and overuse , accidents, nondeadly overdoses that lead to mental anguish and anxiety, and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes . Still, it’s never been definitively linked to any serious ailments — not deadly overdoses, lung disease , or schizophrenia . And it’s much less likely — around one-tenth so, based on data for fatal car crashes — to cause deadly accidents compared to alcohol, which is legal. Among the risks, drug policy experts emphasize the risk of overuse and addiction. As Jon Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University, has told me, “At some level, we know that spending more than half of your waking hours intoxicated for years and years on end is not increasing the likelihood that you’ll win a Pulitzer Prize or discover the cure for cancer.” A balancing act To this end, Canada is striking a balance unlike that of the US’s legalization experiments so far. So far in the US, the eight states that have legalized pot sales have done so with a model similar to alcohol. (Vermont has only legalized possession, not retail sales.) Basically, they’re setting up their systems to allow a for-profit pot industry to flourish, similar to the alcohol industry. Drug policy experts, however, often point to the alcohol industry as a warning , not something to be admired and followed for other drugs. For decades, big alcohol has successfully lobbied lawmakers to block tax increases and regulations on alcohol, all while marketing its product as fun and sexy in television programs, such as the Super Bowl, that are viewed by millions of Americans, including children. Meanwhile, excessive drinking is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US. If marijuana companies are able to act like the tobacco and alcohol industries have in the past, there’s a good chance they’ll convince more Americans to try or even regularly use marijuana, and some of the heaviest users may use more of the drug. And as these companies increase their profits, they’ll be able to influence lawmakers in a way that could stifle regulations or other policies that curtail cannabis misuse. All of that will likely prove bad for public health (although likely not as bad as alcohol, since alcohol is simply more dangerous ). There are policies that can curtail this, some of which Canada’s plan will allow. For example, Canada’s measure restricts marketing and advertising. In the US, this is generally more difficult because the First Amendment protects commercial free speech. (Tobacco marketing is largely prohibited due to a massive legal settlement .) But in Canada, the restrictions could stop marijuana companies from marketing their product in a way that targets, say, children or people who already heavily use cannabis. “It’s a no-brainer,” Caulkins previously told me . For public health purposes, “every serious researcher around the world thinks it’s a very good idea to restrict advertising of tobacco, alcohol, any dependence-inducing substance.” Canada’s bill also lets provinces entirely handle the distribution and sales of marijuana — up to letting provincial governments directly manage and staff all pot stores by themselves. While state-run liquor stores aren’t unheard of in the US when it comes to alcohol, it’s widely seen as risky in America with marijuana: Since cannabis is illegal at the federal level, asking state employees to run marijuana shops would effectively ask them to violate federal law. But since Canada is legalizing marijuana nationwide in one go, it can do this — and several provinces are expected to take up this option. The promise of government-run marijuana shops is that they could be better for public health. In short, government agencies that run shops are generally going to be more mindful of public health and safety, while private companies are only going to be interested in maximizing sales, even if that means making prices very low or selling to minors and people with drug use disorders. Previous research found that states that maintained a government-operated monopoly for alcohol kept prices higher, reduced youth access, and reduced overall levels of use — all benefits to public health. Again, this is about balancing the risks and benefits of legalization: Maybe legalization is the better approach on net compared to prohibition, but that doesn’t mean that for-profit, private companies have to be given free rein over the market. This isn’t important just to Canada. If Canada shows that these policies — and the many other quirks that will make it different to the US — are the right approach to legalization, it could provide a legalization model to the rest of the world that’s very different from what America has done so far. Canada’s legalization bill could violate international treaties From the 1960s through the ’80s, much of the world, including the US and Canada, signed on to three major international drug policy treaties: the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 , the Convention on Psychotropic Drugs of 1971 , and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 . Combined, the treaties require participants to limit and even prohibit the possession, use, trade, and distribution of drugs outside of medical and scientific purposes, and work together to stop international drug trafficking. There is some debate about whether these treaties stop countries from decriminalizing marijuana — when criminal penalties are repealed but civil ones remain in place — and legalizing medical marijuana. But one thing the treaties are absolutely clear on is that illicit drugs aren’t to be allowed for recreational use and certainly not for recreational sales. Yet that’s exactly what Canada has now moved to allow. Canada’s decision to legalize pot is the most high-profile rebuke of the international treaties since they were signed — since Canada is a relatively large developed country and is fairly active in the international arena. In theory, Canada could face diplomatic backlash by legalizing pot. But it’s unclear who would lead such an effort, given that the US, the de facto enforcer of the treaties over the past few decades, is currently allowing states to legalize pot without federal interference. There’s one way Canada could get around the treaty problem. In the early 2010s, Bolivia moved to allow coca leaf chewing, which was banned from the treaties. To get around this, the country effectively withdrew from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and then rejoined with a “reservation” allowing the use of coca leaves within its own borders. The move could have been blocked by one-third of the parties to the treaty — which would amount to more than 60 nations — but only 15 joined in opposition. Canada could use a similar process — of withdrawing and then rejoining with a reservation for legal pot — to meet its treaty obligations. It could also follow Uruguay, which has essentially refused to acknowledge that legalization violates the treaties. Despite warnings from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, no one has taken significant action against Uruguay for its decision. As for the US, it claims to respect the drug treaties, despite some states’ move to legalize marijuana, with a clever argument : It’s true that multiple states have legalized pot, but the federal government still considers marijuana illegal, so the nation is still technically in line, even if a few states are not. Canada could not try this route if it legalizes nationwide. If Canada pulls this off, it could provide a model for other countries to relax their drug laws — and particularly their marijuana laws — without violating international treaty obligations or, at the very least, without getting punished for disobeying the treaties. Such a move would come at a very crucial time in international drug policy: After the UN’s special session on drugs in 2016 , drug policy reformers are putting more pressure to reform the global drug control regime. Canadian legalization gives these reformers an opening by showing that if the treaties aren’t changed, they may soon be rendered meaningless as countries move ahead with their own reforms anyway — even if it puts them in violation of international drug law. And that could open up the rest of the world to legalizing pot. It’s not just, then, that Canada is changing its own drug laws. Canada’s steps — from its rebuke of international drug treaties to how it will regulate cannabis — could affect the future of marijuana policy worldwide.

Media caption, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the trade deal was \"good news for Canada's middle class\" The European Union and Canada have signed a long-delayed landmark trade deal, following weeks of uncertainty due to opposition in Belgium. The deal was signed in Brussels by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and top EU officials. The signing ceremony initially planned for Thursday had been cancelled after Belgium's Wallonia region vetoed the agreement. All 28 EU states approved the deal on Friday when consensus was reached. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, known as Ceta, required all EU member states to endorse it. The deal removes 99% of tariffs - and officials hope it will generate an increase in trade worth $12bn (â¬10.9bn; Â£9.8bn) a year. What is Ceta? Is Ceta a good model for Brexit? The deal was due to be signed at 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT), but was postponed after Mr Trudeau's plane had to turn back to Ottawa airport after experiencing \"mechanical issues\" shortly after take-off. After the agreement was finally signed several hours later, Mr Trudeau said: \"Canadians and Europeans share the understanding that in order for real and meaningful economic growth, we need to create more good, well-paying jobs for our citizens. \"Progressive trade agreements like the one signed today, will do just that.\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker referred to \"a new chapter\" in relations between the EU and Canada, which would open new opportunities \"more than half-a-billion people on both sides of the Atlantic\".

A handshake for European Council President Donald Tusk, representing the EU's 28 member states, came with a hug, and from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a kiss on both cheeks. Love was in the air between the EU and Canada after a rocky few days. Canada has a new economic opening to 500 million Europeans. The EU believes this proves it can do big trade pacts which are good for its citizens. Are there lessons for Brexit? Jean-Claude Juncker said he didn't believe so. But there are some observations to be made. Ceta was approached with goodwill on all sides. Still it took seven years. Ceta is about removing trade barriers. Brexit may discuss which ones to put up. If the UK limits the movement of people, will the EU seek to do the same? And what other barriers may come, too? And will political parties and leaders around Europe now follow the Walloons and bargain hard over Brexit, too? Seven years of negotiations were left hanging in the balance after Belgium's French-speaking region of Wallonia demanded stronger safeguards on labour, environmental and consumer standards. It also wanted more protection for Walloon farmers, who would face new competition from Canadian imports. Image source, AFP Image caption, Protests have dogged the trade talks throughout Image source, EPA Image caption, Belgium finally signed the deal on Saturday On Thursday, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said that after marathon talks they had agreed on an addendum to the deal which addressed regional concerns. Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, which currently holds the EU presidency, said the final approval of the deal was \"a milestone in the EU's trade policy\". Complications over the Ceta agreement had raised fresh concerns about future UK negotiations with the EU on a Brexit trade deal. Mr Tusk had warned that the delays and wrangling were further damaging EU credibility following Britain's vote to leave the bloc.

        "text": "Nurse charged with murdering eight in Canadian old-age homes By David Ljunggren October 26, 2016 12:07 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian nurse was charged on Tuesday with using drugs to murder eight elderly patients in long-term care facilities in an alleged killing spree that ran for seven years. Elizabeth Wettlaufer, 49, is accused of killing five women and three men in the Ontario towns of Woodstock and London between 2007 and 2014. The dead ranged in age from 75 to 96. \"The victims were administered a drug,\" Woodstock Police Chief William Renton told a televised news conference, declining to give further details. Wettlaufer appeared in court on Tuesday and was remanded in custody. The criminal case is the largest in Ontario since 2006, when five men were charged with murdering eight biker gang members. They were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Renton said officers began probing the deaths in September after receiving a tip. \"We are confident at this time that all of the victims have been identified,\" he said. The Canadian Association of Retired Persons said it was shocked by the tragic nature of the alleged crime. Mass killings are uncommon in Canada. \"For nurses and staff to be part of a violence problem, we think this is rare... it is extraordinary, and thankfully so,\" spokesman Anthony Quinn said from Toronto.

Seven of the dead lived in a Woodstock facility run by Caressant Care. The firm said Wettlaufer had left her job in 2014. Doris Grinspun, head of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, said she was devastated. \"An event like this is most, most, most unusual, the first actually in all my 20 years at the association... these things are horrifying to all of us. They are the exception, the very rare exception,\" she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. People residing in the same apartment building as Wettlaufer described her as a pleasant person who lived alone with her dog. \"We would chat and have laughs. She seemed like an everyday, normal kind of person,\" Derek Gilbert told CBC. A LinkedIn profile in the name of Elizabeth Wettlaufer said she was a nurse who worked at the Woodstock home from June 2007 to March 2014. \"Administering medications\" was listed as one of her responsibilities. In March, Italian police arrested a 55-year-old nurse on suspicion of murdering 13 elderly patients in the intensive care ward where she had worked for decades.

Beckett said there is also limited access to about 700 addresses in what he called the \"outer perimeter\" of the evacuated zone.

Article content “We will always be the party that dreams no small dreams,” Mulcair said. “We will always be the party that thinks about the little guy.” Article content Article content A bare-minimum 50 per cent plus one vote would have been necessary for Mulcair to stay on, let alone have anywhere near enough support for a confident mandate — a threshold some had pegged at closer to 70 per cent.

Article content Prior to the vote, Mulcair made one last pitch to the New Democrat faithful to allow him to stay on as leader, urging rank-and-file members to stand with him. Article content He said he has accepted the blame for the mistakes of last year’s disappointing election campaign, but insisted he is re-energized, reinspired and re-engaged after six months of meeting grassroots supporters. Article content “We made mistakes that cost us a victory in October, and for that I take responsibility,” Mulcair said. “I share your deep disappointment in the election results. That’s why we’ve held unvarnished debrief sessions across the country — to understand what went wrong, what mistakes were made, and how we can apply those lessons going forward.” Article content It was a largely familiar speech, one that included echoes of many of Mulcair’s public comments in the months since the election, and steered largely clear of some of the sore spots that have endangered his status as leader. Article content In particular, Mulcair made no mention of the so-called “Leap Manifesto,” a proposed policy pivot from the left-most factions of the party who want to see the NDP embrace some more drastic measures to combat climate change and aboriginal issues, among others. Article content Article content Prior to Mulcair’s speech, delegates voted to adopt a motion to debate the manifesto’s ideas and proposals, which include: • Moving away from fossil fuels so that Canada gets 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable resources within 20 years and is entirely weaned off fossil fuels by 2050; • No new infrastructure projects aimed at increasing extraction of non-renewable resources, including pipelines; • An end to all trade deals “that interfere with our attempts to rebuild local economies, regulate corporations and stop damaging extractive projects”; • Expand low-carbon sectors of the economy, such as caregiving, teaching, social work, the arts and public-interest media; • Ending fossil fuel subsidies, imposing financial transaction taxes, increasing resource royalties, hiking taxes on corporations and the wealthy, introducing a progressive carbon tax, and cutting military spending. Article content Billing himself as a hard-nosed political fighter, Mulcair said only New Democrats will continue to battle against income inequality, because the Liberals and the Conservatives are too loyal to their corporate backers and the status quo. Article content Article content Last year alone, Canada’s big banks made a record $35 billion in profits, and handed out $12 billion in bonuses to their executives, all while cutting thousands of Canadian jobs, he said. Article content “We don’t accept that,” Mulcair said. “Liberals and Conservatives will tell you that this is just the way things are. They will say this is the inevitable outcome of market forces, that nothing can be done.” “Well, allow me to be blunt: This is complete and utter BS.” Article content The rift within the NDP over Mulcair’s leadership was evident during his speech, as some supporters jumped to their feet to applaud and express their support, while others on the convention floor stayed stone-faced and seated. Article content By the end, however, he at least earned a standing ovation for his efforts. Article content “If you keep standing with me, then together, we will never stop fighting,” Mulcair said as his speech built to a crescendo, the applause building around him. Article content “So — stand with me…. Stand if you want to fight to grow our party and strengthen our movement…. Stand if you want to unite progressives in Quebec with those in the rest of the country…. Stand if you want to fight to build a country that generations of New Democrats, young and old, have dreamed of and organized for.” Article content “A Canada that is loving, hopeful and optimistic. Where everyone belongs, everyone matters, and no one is left behind.” Article content When it was over, Mulcair was swarmed by supporters, and appeared close to tears as he moved into the crowd. Article content Over the 24 hours leading up to the speech, the efforts intensified among those who wanted to see Mulcair ousted for failing to effectively communicate the NDP’s vision to voters. The embattled leader also faced muted but undeniable criticism from within his own caucus. Article content Mulcair said the federal Liberal budget proves that when it comes to child care and health care, the principle of universality — the cherished legacy of party founder Tommy Douglas — is in peril. Article content “Tommy’s vision is under threat like never before,” he said. Creeping privatization and a Liberal budget that doubles down on Stephen Harper’s health care cuts threaten the quality of health services in Canada. Let there be no doubt: Together, we will fight like hell to protect universal health care, because there is nothing more universal to New Democrats.“ Article content Article content And he renewed a push for electoral reform, saying that the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau has already started to back away from its promise to end the current first-past-the-post system, which he says effectively discounted some nine million votes in October. Article content “Of course, Conservatives believe the unfair status quo is just fine. Liberals, on the other hand, promised change, but they are already starting to backtrack on that as well,” he said. Article content “My friends, the next few months will be critical in the fight for proportional representation. We have to stay strong and united to lead this fight together.” Article content An internal political post-mortem of the election results blamed the disaster on a decision to offer cautious change instead of the sharp change promised by the Liberals and a failure to prepare for campaign challenges.

The six remaining victims are in stable condition, with injuries ranging from minor to serious. Read live updates on the Calgary shooting from CBC reporters in the field Det. Steve Adair said city police received multiple 911 calls from the 1900 block of 36th Street S.W. at about 5:05 a.m. MT Thursday. Responding officers located five people in and around the house with possible gunshot wounds and Adair said two other people later showed up at local hospitals for treatment. Those injured in the shootings are both male and female, ranging in age from early 20s to early 30s. First homicide of 2015 CBC has confirmed the victim was 27-year-old Abdullahi Ahmed. Calgary Imam Abdi Hersy spoke to Ahmed's family, who was with him at the Foothills Medical Centre when he died. “They were there until the last moment and when he was pronounced dead and life support was taken off, that is when they left the hospital,” Hersy said. According to Hersy, Ahmed was originally from Toronto and had been in Calgary for six years. His mother was on her way from Toronto to Calgary on Thursday night. Hersy urges anyone in the Somali community with information to come forward and speak to police. “If we remain silent, then nothing will be done,\" he said. \"Everybody has to be working side-by-side, hand-in-hand together with the authority, with the police and everybody to bring the criminals to pay their criminal act and to face justice.” Search for suspects Adair says police don't yet have a description or know the number of assailants. About 50 people were at or near the residence, and a s many as 15 witnesses were taken to headquarters in a city transit bus to be interviewed. Police say witnesses have identified themselves and others at the party as members of African communities. Adair said police \"are not getting a great deal of co-operation\" from witnesses. At least two blocks were cordoned off, with numerous police cruisers in the area. Killarney is a quiet community just off 17th Avenue, which is a major Calgary thoroughfare. Duty Insp. Quinn Jacques says police have more questions than answers at the moment.

Privacy Notice Business Target Canada workers feel left in the dark as stores close Share on Facebook Share on X Share by Email Sophia Harris             -             CBC News Posted: January 23, 2015 Last Updated: January 23, 2015 Employees of Target's 133 Canadian stores are being offered 16 weeks pay during the wind-down. But some are unhappy with the way they are being treated during their final days with the company. (Geoff Robins/Reuters) When Target invaded Canada and started hiring thousands of new staff, workers flocked to the beloved American retail giant. They were eager to be part of something fresh. But some believe their journey is now closing on a very sour note, saying Target has missed the mark on employee compensation and communication. When Sarah first started working at an Ontario Target store almost two years ago, she was brimming with excitement. \"We thought, this is it, we’re the bee's knees, we’re setting up a store that’s going to take over.\" Sarah is not her real name. She wants that withheld, she says, because \"we’ve been told as a team that we’re not to speak to the press or we could be terminated early.\" Target spokesman Eric Hausman said in an emailed statement that it’s standard practice that media only deal with the company’s public relations department. ADVERTISEMENT Breaking news: you’re out of work Sarah believes her bright beginning at Target has deteriorated into the darkest of endings. The team floor member first learned Target Canada was doomed, not from her employer, but from the television news in the staff lunch room. \"Within half an hour of it being on the news, we had [customers] coming in going, 'When’s it all going liquidation, when’s the sales start?’ Like, whoa, we just found out half an hour ago we’re losing our jobs. Let us wrap our head around that.\" Sarah says it wasn’t until at least an hour after learning the news that management started informing employees that Target was closing its 133 Canadian stores and letting go its approximately 17,600 workers. Target closes all 133 stores in Canada, gets creditor protection Target store closures: What will happen to 17,600 employees Target’s Hausman told CBC News that it broke the news to workers at about the same time it released details to the media. Uncertain future \"That day was probably a day I’ll never forget,\" says Sarah. \"You couldn’t go anywhere without seeing a team member absolutely in tears or in shambles, [saying] what am I going to do now?\" You couldn’t go anywhere without seeing a team member absolutely in tears. — Anonymous Target employee \"We live in a city where unemployment is skyrocketing. There’s no jobs here. So everybody is panicking,\" adds the single mother. ADVERTISEMENT Sarah’s colleague, Rachel -- again not her real name -- is also the sole breadwinner in her family. When she started working at Target almost two years ago, she was close to declaring bankruptcy. \"What's going to happen?\" she asks. \"Am I going to end up not being able to pay my rent and not being being able to feed my kid?\" It’s not severance Target is providing all eligible team members at least 16 weeks of pay starting on January 25th. But both Rachel and Sarah feel the deal is unfair. That’s because some workers may have to work the entire time to get that money and others won’t while the stores wind down operations. The law firm, Koskie Minsky LLP, is representing Target employees in the insolvency. In a webinar (online seminar), it informs workers, \"You will likely be required to report to work for a number of weeks (and in some cases all) of your notice period.\" But it also notes that eligible employees who work fewer than their normal hours during the final weeks will still get paid. \"That’s the sad part, we’re begging to be laid off first,\" says Sarah. \"If we work the full 16 weeks, it’s 'Thank you very much for your hard work, goodbye.’ We get nothing. So it’s not severance I’m getting. It’s a paycheque.\" Target's Hausman told CBC News that there is no severance because Target Canada is insolvent. The company has applied for creditor protection and created an employee trust, providing workers with a guaranteed minimum 16 weeks pay. ADVERTISEMENT Hausman said it’s a good deal, stating: \"I’d encourage you to look at how others are talking about this Trust. I have seen others quoted [in the media] as calling this set-up unprecedented for a [Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act] proceeding.\" He gave no details why it should be considered \"unprecedented.\" Labour expert Maurice Mazerolle believes the trust deal is \"as good as it gets\" for Target workers given the complex situation. But he says he understands why it would breed employee resentment because some will have to work until the bitter end and others won’t. \"Do you really want to create this, kind of indirectly, two-tiered system?\" he asks. The Ryerson University professor suggests Target should consider extra compensation for those who remain on the job: \"Give them a bonus or something at the end of this in order to thank them for soldiering on when others weren’t.\" No clear message Both Sarah and Rachel also complain that since the bad news broke on Jan. 15, Target hasn’t been upfront about what its ill-fated employees can expect during the final weeks on the job. \"We’re all just so scared,\" says Rachel. \"We need to know what is happening, when are the liquidators coming, what is going to be the process with that, are we losing half the staff? And if so, is it going to be by volunteer? Is it random picking?\" We’re all just so scared — Anonymous Target employee \"It’s very tight-lipped,\" adds Sarah. \"I don’t feel they’re providing me with information. If anything, It’s kind of like team members have to eavesdrop on the management’s conversations.\" ADVERTISEMENT In response, Target’s Hausman said, \"In terms of communications, leaders have messages for their teams and all team members have opportunities to ask any questions they may have during this difficult period.\" Life after Target? Both Sarah and Rachel must now figure out their futures. Rachel wants out of the retail business. Sarah says she and many of her colleagues can’t see past their present troubles. She says they want details about what their job will entail in the next 16 weeks and if they’ll even be working. \"We want answers before we can even comprehend what we can do in the future,\" she says.

The boys died in an early-morning fire Wednesday in a two-storey farmhouse in southern Manitoba, despite the efforts of their parents and older brother to save them. The fire started about 12:30 a.m. in the Froese family’s home near Kane, a hamlet about 20 kilometres west of Morris on Highway 23. FACEBOOK PHOTO\nFour brothers (from left) Timmy, 12, Danny, 10, Henry, 9, and Bobby Froese, 15  died in an overnight fire in a two-storey farmhouse in rural southern Manitoba, despite the efforts of their parents and older brother to save them. Surrounded by family, Beverley Eberhardt briefly described the grandsons she lost. “They’re wonderful boys, very close,” said Eberhardt, from Winkler. “They’re together all the time.” “Bobby loved reading. Timmy loved computers and his phone, and he was the hunter. He loved hunting with his dad,” she said. “Henry was a little bit shy, much closer to his mom. Danny was the hyper one. You couldn’t keep him down.” Doralee Eberhardt, 34, was alone with seven of her eight children when the fire started. Her partner, Jake Froese, and the couple’s oldest son, Steven, 18, who were working a late shift at a plant in Winkler, arrived home to find the home engulfed in flames. Doralee and three younger children — an eight-year-old girl, her five-year-old sister and two-year-old brother — escaped and were outside when the father and son arrived. After calling the local volunteer fire department, Jake tried to get inside but was turned back by the intense heat and smoke. The four boys sleeping on the second floor could not be saved. Family members identified them as Bobby, 15, Timmy, 12, Danny, 10, and Henry, 9. Beverley said Jake and Steven tried using a ladder to rescue the kids, but flames shooting out the windows drove them back. “(Jake) tried to get them out. He was going through the window, but he couldn’t wake them. The smoke and flames blew him right down,” she said. “He’s at (Health Sciences Centre). I don’t know how he’s doing.” Doralee and Jake suffered from smoke inhalation and were transported to hospital in Winnipeg. The surviving children were taken to a neighbour’s home. Beverley said there is great concern for Jake’s health, but her daughter didn’t suffer serious injuries. “Physically, my daughter is OK, but mentally she isn’t good,” she said. Jake’s cousin, Susan Ryman, later said by telephone from Winkler she understood he was “now out of his coma and able to speak.” ‘Bobby loved reading. Timmy loved computers and his phone,  and he was the hunter. He loved hunting with his dad’ ‘Henry was a little bit shy, much closer to his mom.  Danny was the hyper one. You couldn’t keep him down’ Beverley said the oldest boy remains in a state of disbelief. “Steven said he just won’t believe his brothers are gone until he actually sees them,” she said. Frank Krahn, president of Tri Koating Inc., the industrial painting firm where Jake and his oldest son work, described the father as a family man and said the thoughts of the company and its employees were with the family. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Provincial fire officials were still on scene late Wednesday afternoon. Bernard Schellenberg, the RM of Morris fire chief based in nearby Rosenort, said crews couldn’t search the home because the fire was out of control. The 20-member crew, arriving with three trucks and a water tanker, was informed four boys were sleeping in rooms on the second floor. “When they arrived on scene, the (newer) addition had been fully involved, and the walls had collapsed,” Schellenberg said, adding firefighters helped Doralee, Jake and the younger kids who managed to escape. The tragedy will certainly have a deep impact on the volunteer firefighters. “When firefighters deal with a tragedy like this, as tough as we seem to (be), we are aching inside for the family,” Schellenberg said. Grief and crisis counselling has been made available to his volunteer crew. There was nothing left standing at the farmhouse site as it smouldered most of Wednesday. RM of Morris Reeve Ralph Groening said it’s too early to determine what support the family will need and what counselling the firefighters will need in the coming days and weeks. “We’ve already received offers — there’s a home that’s been offered,” he said. “The strength of small communities. They’ve been there very quickly. We know the community is willing to provide the support needed to ensure they can, as best as possible, move on with their lives.” BORIS MINKEVICH / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\nAn overnight house fire killed four brothers near the village of Kane, about 20 kilometres west of Morris on Highway 23 Wednesday. Their parents and four other children escaped the fire, but they weren't able to rescue the boys. Red River Valley School Division superintendent Pauline Lafond-Bouchard said crisis response teams were at schools the boys attended in Lowe Farm and Rosenort on Wednesday. The boys were in different grades, said Lafond-Bouchard. “It’s pretty tragic. We’re just trying to support everyone as much as possible. “(Students and staff) would know the family well,” she said. RM of Morris chief administrative officer Larry Driedger said the community has already come together. The Access Credit Union, which has 17 branches across southern Manitoba, including one in nearby Lowe Farm, has set up a donation account for the family.

In an interview last month with CBC's chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge, Baird said he didn't want to become one of the \"lifers\" in federal politics, which is why he made the decision to leave politics to pursue career opportunities in the private sector. So far, Baird has not indicated whether he has a new job lined up. Baird, 45, has been in politics most of his adult life.

Train carrying crude oil derails near Gogama, Ont. \"The rail cars involved are new models, compliant with the latest federal regulations. Yet they still failed to prevent this incident,\" Thibeault said in a statement. Five of the oil tankers are in the Makami River, four kilometres outside of Gogama. This is the third CN derailment in northern Ontario in less than a month, (GlennThibeault/Twitter) ​CN Rail has confirmed that five of the 35 tanker cars that derailed are in Makami River, which is part of the Mattagami River System. The train was 94 cars long and all were tanker cars carrying crude oil from Alberta. Firefighters are working to control the flames and smoke from the burning oil tankers, about four kilometres outside of Gogama. This is the third CN derailment in northern Ontario in less than a month, and the second in the same area. Crews are still working to clean up a similarly fiery derailment near the community just three weeks ago. That prompted Ontario Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca to say in a statement Sunday that he \"will be contacting Federal Transport Minister Lisa Raitt, CN and CP this week to reiterate our government's serious concerns with respect to ensuring our railways are safe.\" Raitt responded with a statement saying she is \"very concerned\" with the spate of accidents. \"Should non-compliances be found, the company will face the full force of the law,\" she said. There's no sign that drinking water or air quality near the site of the train derailment have been affected, according to CN Rail's latest update Sunday afternoon. The company has launched its emergency response plan, bringing in experts in engineering, operating, environment and dangerous goods. CN crews have already started constructing a 460-metre stretch of bypass track to divert around the derailment site. Chief operating officer Jim Vena apologized to local residents for the disruption caused by the derailment, adding that he is heading to the scene. 'Very hard to accept' Rick Duguay, who runs Gogama's general store, woke early Saturday morning to what he described as a strange banging noise. Duguay has lived in the community his entire life and is accustomed to the sound of trains, but said this sound was different. He's relieved the derailment happened outside of town. \"Luckily it's not right here at the railroad crossing, but it's close enough and very hard to accept the things going on,\" Duguay said. He wants to see changes put in place to make railroads safer, but doesn't think the two recent crashes are enough to prompt change. \"The worry was always there that a train wreck could happen in town ... but I mean, we lived with it all our life.\" Morris Neveau said the two derailments so close together have left many in the Mattagami First Nation, just downstream from the recent derailment, unnerved. \"It affects our thinking and how we live, you know, because we live in fear, eh?\" 'What can we do now?' Gogama residents spent much of the weekend looking up at the large plume of black smoke looming over the town. CN says indications are that 'the drinking water supply to Gogama Village and the nearby First Nation are not affected at this time.' (@GlennThibeault/Twitter) Dawn Simoneau, 33, said her two daughters have been asking questions about the derailment. \"Like, 'Are the fish going to be okay?' and they are concerned as well,\" said  . Simoneau, a life-long Gogama resident, has lived her entire life with trains rumbling past and an ever-present fear that something might happen. \"This is just always the way it's been. And now ... we're thinking, 'What can we do now to make sure this doesn't happen again?'\" The derailment has some residents talking about the Energy East oil pipeline, which has faced opposition in other parts of northern Ontario. Nickel Belt New Democrat MP Claude Gravelle said he didn't want to get into that debate while visiting Gogama on Saturday. \"Well, that's a different discussion for a different day, but there certainly are some concerns about pipelines. But there are concerns about rail cars. What's the safest? Accidents are accidents.\" The intense heat of the fire has kept investigators away from the site so far, but investigators hope to find some answers Sunday about how much oil was spilled and what caused the derailment.

Social Sharing Albertans will head to the polls on May 5 knowing the province faces an uncertain financial future given the recent collapse of oil prices. \"This is a turning point, and Albertans deserve the right to choose,\" Alberta Premier Jim Prentice told a cheering crowd in Edmonton this morning. Cinco de Mayo, Nickelback tweets surface after Alberta election call He has been leader of the PC Party since last fall, and spoke about his government's 10-year plan for the province released on budget day . Prentice vowed to create a leaner, smarter and more innovative government, as well as ensuring the province remains an environmental leader while opening new markets for Alberta products. But with the collapse of oil prices over the past months, Prentice also had a warning for Albertans. \"Any meaningful plan must contain hard truths,\" he said. \"We have made the realistic choices. And we have presented a budget that will have this province back in balance in three years, whether oil prices recover or not.\" He said raising corporate taxes would drive away investment and cost Albertans jobs, so the province instead focused on so-called \"sin taxes\" and a progressive tax regime in its budget proposal. 'Political opportunism' He then asked a rhetorical question, one that has likely been on many minds: why choose his Progressive Conservative government, which has been in power for almost 44 years? \"Every day, in every action, we must earn the trust of Albertans,\" Prentice said. \"I want to be a premier that Albertans can be proud of. I want this to be a party that reflects the values of Albertans.\" Prentice said the coming election will answer one fundamental question. \"Who is being honest with Albertans? And who has a realistic plan to put things right for Albertans?\" NDP Leader Rachel Notley kicked off her campaign by saying Albertans are getting the wrong kind of leadership from the PCs. Wildrose Leader Brian Jean accused Prentice of cynically ignoring his own government's fixed election legislation. Opposition parties slam 'early' election while launching campaigns Liberal Leader David Swann said this election will be about building and maintaining trust with Martha and Henry's family, the new generation of Albertans who are now driving this province. Alberta Party Leader Greg Clark called the election \"nothing more than the usual PC political opportunism.\" Official Opposition race The PC party heads into the election holding 70 of Alberta's 87 seats. Many political experts say the real race is for Official Opposition status after the Wildrose Party saw its caucus reduced to five seats in December when former leader Danielle Smith and eight other MLAs crossed the floor to join the government. Five Liberals, four NDP and one independent hold the balance of seats. The PCs have been in power since 1971. Fixed election-date legislation had set the next provincial election to be held no later than the spring of 2016, but an earlier date comes as no surprise. Over the past weeks, Prentice has continued to say he needed a mandate to put this year's budget into action. Follow along below as CBC reporters tweet live updates on the election call.

(Combat Camera/DND) Social Sharing The Canadian military conducted its first airstrike on an ISIS target in Syria today, according to the Department of National Defence. Two Canadian CF-18s were involved in the airstrike against an ISIS garrison near Raqqa, Syria, the department said in a release. Raqqa is about 160 kilometres east of the embattled city of Aleppo. The department added that the Canadian Armed Forces aircrew and aircraft have safely returned to base. A total of 10 coalition aircraft, including six from the U.S., took part in the airstrike. The nationality of the two remaining aircraft was not disclosed. ANALYSIS | Is Canada's ISIS mission ready for Syria's moral maze? MPs vote to extend, expand ISIS mission into Syria Syrian airstrikes could help al-Qaeda It follows the Conservative government's decision to extend and expand the Canadian military's contribution to the U.S.-led coalition against the jihadist organization. MPs voted last week to support a government motion to extend Canada's involvement until March 2016 and to expand its role to include bombings over Syria. Most opposition MPs voted against the motion. Although this was the first airstrike in Syria since the mission expansion, the department noted, it was not the first air sortie. Three sorties have taken place since the government's decision to expand the mission. The sorties provide opportunities to assess new areas of operation, the department said. Since last September, only the U.S. and at least three Persian Gulf countries had been bombing in Syria, which has been riven by a brutal four-year civil war. None of Canada's Commonwealth allies, including Britain and Australia, are engaged in airstrikes in Syria. The last reported strikes of Canadian jets came on April 4, when they hit targets west of Mosul, in northern Iraq, where extremists had established a roadside bomb-making facility.

Premier Wade MacLauchlan calls long-expected spring election CBC News · Posted: Apr 06, 2015 6:34 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 7, 2015 P.E.I. Premier Wade MacLauchlan announces a provincial election for May 4. (CBC) Social Sharing Prince Edward Islanders will go to the polls May 4. Premier Wade MacLauchlan made the announcement at his nomination meeting to represent the district of York-Oyster Bed on Monday night. The Liberal Party heads into the election holding 23 of 27 seats, with three Progressive Conservatives and one Independent holding the balance of the seats. The Liberals have governed since 2007. Fixed election-date legislation had set the next provincial election for Oct. 5, but an earlier date comes as no surprise. A spring election call was set up when Robert Ghiz announced his resignation as premier in November, pending the selection of a new Liberal leader. MacLauchlan was named leader on Feb. 21 and sworn in as premier two days later. Few expected he would wait until October to attempt to win his own mandate. 4 new party leaders A major theme for the coming campaign is likely to be renewal, as all four parties — Liberal, Progressive Conservative, New Democrat and Green — have new leaders. None of the leaders has served in the legislature. Progressive Conservative Leader Rob Lantz says his party is ready for the election. (CBC) The Liberals enter the election campaign with some prominent members not reoffering , giving them the opportunity to bring in some fresh faces in addition to the new leader. The new Progressive Conservative leader is Rob Lantz, who was a popular city councillor in Charlottetown for two terms. The Tories moved up their leadership convention, which had been scheduled for May, and Lantz was elected leader on Feb. 28 , when he warned the Liberals that his party was election ready. Mike Redmond, the NDP's fifth leader in five elections, is looking to get the party back into the legislature. (Kevin Yarr/CBC) The Tory leadership convention was its most successful ever, with almost 3,000 votes cast. The Tory campaign effectively started when Lantz was named leader, and government accountability has emerged as a key theme. Lantz has already promised a royal commission on accountability in government that would focus on controversial aspects of the Robert Ghiz government: the provincial nominee program, the e-gaming venture, and the lending and write-off practices of government. Greens and NDP While either the Liberals or Progressive Conservatives will almost certainly form government after the election, the Greens and the NDP are hoping for representation in the legislature. Green Party Leader Peter Bevan-Baker has been vocal in the weeks leading up to the election call. (Kevin Yarr/CBC) The NDP is the only party apart from the Liberals and Tories to have elected a member to the legislature, and that was just once — Herb Dickieson from 1996-2000. Since that achievement, the party's fortunes have faded considerably. In the last three elections, the NDP has failed to gather more than 3.2 per cent of the popular vote. Under new leader Mike Redmond , the NDP has attracted a lot of attention. In early 2013, public opinion polls suggested the NDP had the support of one in four voters , well ahead of what the Progressive Conservatives were polling at the time. Numbers have slipped for the NDP since then, and Redmond will face a challenge to win his seat. The Green Party has been active over the last few weeks. Leader Peter Bevan-Baker has been vocal in commenting on issues, and the party has already released its platform . How the unproven four leaders perform over the next few weeks will likely play a significant role in their parties' fortunes on voting day.

Photograph by: Bradley Karp\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, MyMcMurray.com A mother trying to kill bed bugs in her Fort McMurray apartment used an imported pesticide that fatally poisoned her infant and left her other children critically ill. The substance used in the apartment was a pellet form of phosphine, an agricultural pesticide that is strictly controlled in Canada and requires special training to use. When exposed to the air, the pellets react with moisture and release phosphine gas, said James Kehrer, a toxicologist at the University of Alberta. As a gas, it’s often used to fumigate large batches of grain. “It will kill the bed bugs, but it’s nasty stuff,” said Kehrer. “Children are more susceptible to these things ... It should only be used by a professional.” The pellets were mainly spread around one bedroom, but fire crews detected the substance throughout the unit, said Brad Grainger, deputy chief of operations for the Fort McMurray fire department. “It’s airborne, but it’s low to the ground,” he said. “You can imagine children crawling on the ground.” Crews found readings of 4.0 parts per million in the bedroom. It’s immediately lethal at 50 parts per million, but can be harmful at 1.0 parts per million after just 15 minutes, he said: “There was significant exposure.” The family brought the bottle of phosphine pellets to the hospital when the children fell ill. Authorities were able to contact the woman’s family in Pakistan to check what the substance was, and then test further to confirm the contents. The mother used a pesticide to fumigate her apartment last Tuesday that she brought back from Pakistan during a recent trip, said her sister, Shazia Yarkhan. The woman’s five children started showing signs of illness Saturday night. They all vomited and one of them had diarrhea, Yarkhan said. On Sunday morning, their mother took them to the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre. One of the children, an eight-month-old, died in hospital that afternoon. Wood Buffalo RCMP said two children, ages two and six, were taken to the Stollery Children’s Hospital in Edmonton by air ambulance on Sunday. The other two children, ages four and seven, remained in hospital Monday in Fort McMurray. All the children were reported to be in critical condition. “She says she can’t talk now because she is very upset,” Yarkhan said of her sister, who is in hospital in Fort McMurray under observation. The father is in Edmonton with the other children. Their names will not be released at the family’s request, police said. RCMP spokesman Cpl. George Cameron said the incident appears accidental. Police received a call shortly after 3 p.m. Sunday from firefighters who requested help evacuating the main floor of a four-storey apartment building at 81 Fraser Ave. Tenants were allowed to return to their apartments at around 6:30 p.m. Sunday after air quality tests determined there was no threat to the rest of the building. Phosphine was also implicated in the 2012 deaths of two Quebec sisters, Audrey and Noemi Belanger, in Thailand. Days after they arrived at a popular tourist destination, a maid found the sisters dead in their hotel room. In January 2014, a family in Jerusalem was poisoned from phosphine after a section of their apartment was fumigated for pests, and two young children died from the poisoning.

Brandon Rowe is speaking with passengers who say communication has not been good. By Meredith Bond Posted February 17, 2025 3:00 pm. Last Updated February 18, 2025 11:00 am. Flights have resumed at Toronto’s Pearson airport, but two runways are closed as investigators from Canada’s Transportation Safety Board begin their work on what may have caused a plane crash Monday. At least 18 people were injured after the plane crashed on landing, flipping upside down. Toronto Pearson said the incident happened upon landing and involved a Delta Airlines plane arriving from Minneapolis just after 2 p.m. on Monday. Arrivals and departures have resumed at the airport after being put on hold for several hours. No one was killed in the crash.

Ornge says they transported one pediatric patient to Sick Kids, a male patient in his 60s to St. Michael’s Hospital, and a third patient to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. All three suffered critical injuries in the crash but are expected to survive. A spokesperson with Toronto Pearson confirmed 18 people had been injured in the crash of the 76 passengers and four crew on board. Seventeen people were transported to hospital right after the crash, while the last person was transported after the others. There were 22 Canadians on board, while the rest were multinational. Some passengers have already been reunited with friends and family while others “are in a comfortable place right here at the airport, in an environment where getting a lot of care and support from my staff,” said Pearson CEO Deborah Flint. The airport’s fire chief, Todd Aitken, said it was “really important that we do not speculate” on the cause of the crash. “What we can say is the runway was dry, and there were no crosswind conditions,” he said. Delta Airlines says the flight, operated by Endeavor Air, using a Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR aircraft, was involved in a single-aircraft accident at the airport. Endeavor is a subsidiary of Delta based out of Minneapolis. Delta cancelled all their flights in and out of Pearson for the rest of the day. “The hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected by today’s incident at Toronto-Pearson International Airport,” read a statement from Delta CEO Ed Bastian. “I want to express my thanks to the many Delta and Endeavor team members and the first responders on site.” Incoming flights were diverted to Montreal for several hours, but Pearson confirmed that arrivals and departures had resumed at 5 p.m. on Monday. Flint said three runways are currently in operation, and the two others will be closed for an investigation. “We do expect that there will be some operational impact and some delays at the airport over the next few days while the two runways remain closed for the investigation, and we will be sharing information periodically for those traveling to continue to look at our website and be in touch with your respective carrier as well,” shared Flint. A Delta Airlines plane has crashed upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) said they are deploying a team of investigators to the incident. “The TSB will gather information and assess the occurrence.” Doug Ford responded to the crash, saying he was relieved there were no casualties. “Provincial officials are in contact with the airport and local authorities and will provide any help that’s needed.” Delta Airlines plane has crashed and flipped over upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Audio recording from the Pearson airport tower shows Delta Air Lines flight 4819 was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. ET, and the tower warned the pilots of a possible air flow “bump” in the glide path from an aircraft in front of it. There were no further conversations with the Delta flight until the tower confirmed at 2:12 p.m. that a plane had crashed, with air controllers quickly redirecting traffic to accommodate the crash scene. The CRJ900, a popular regional jet, was developed by Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. The last major crash at Pearson was on Aug. 2, 2005, when an Airbus A340 landing from Paris skidded off the runway and burst into flames amid stormy weather. All 309 passengers and crew aboard Air France Flight 358 survived the crash. With files from The Canadian Press Submit a Correction Accessibility Feedback",

        "text": "Life sentence for hitman who killed suspect in 1985 Air India bombings 29 January 2025 Share Save Jessica Murphy and Nadine Yousif BBC News, Toronto Share Save Reuters Ripudaman Singh Malik pictured here leaving a Vancouver court in 2005 after he was found not guilty of murder A hitman who was one of two people who shot and killed a man acquitted in the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight has been jailed for life in Canada without the possibility of parole for 20 years. Tanner Fox, 24, was sentenced on Tuesday by a British Columbia Supreme Court judge. Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty in October to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022. Lopez will be sentenced on Friday. The sentencing came after an emotional morning, in which Malik's relatives begged Fox to reveal who hired him to carry out the murder. \"We plead with you to reveal the names of the people who hired you,\" said Malik's daughter-in-law Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, according to reporters inside the New Westminster courtroom. The two men entered their guilty pleas on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder. Malik was shot several times in his car outside his family business in Surrey, in the Canadian province of British Columbia, on the morning of 14 July 2022. Police found a burnt-out vehicle nearby. Prosecutor Matthew Stacey told the court that Fox and Lopez planned a \"deliberate killing\" of Malik. \"They were financially compensated for killing him,\" he added. The killing happened more than a decade after Malik was acquitted in the devastating double bomb attack - Canada's deadliest terrorist attack in history. On 23 June 1985, Air India flight 182 from Canada to India blew up off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens visiting relatives in India. About the same time, a second bomb exploded prematurely in Japan, killing two baggage handlers The bombings - widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion - remain Canada's deadliest terror attack. Following a two-year trial, Malik and his co-accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings, after a judge ruled that testimony against them was not credible. According to the agreed statement of facts, Fox and Lopez were contracted to kill Malik, but the evidence did not establish who had hired them. Malik's family has urged them to co-operate with police to bring to justice whoever had directed the killing. In her testimony to court on Tuesday, Malik's daughter-in-law said the lack of answers has left the family afraid for their safety. \"This fear and anxiety comes from not knowing who hired you,\" she told Fox. \"Are we next?\" According to Fox's lawyer, the 24-year-old was born in Thailand and was adopted at age three by parents in Abbotsford, British Columbia. \"It's impossible to say where he went awry, went wrong in his youth that took him to this horrible offence,\" lawyer Richard Fowler has said. In court, Fox stood up to apologise for his actions. \"I'm sorry for all the pain and hurt that I've caused,\" he said.

(Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP, File) Read More By JIM MORRIS Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — The leader of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, on Wednesday triggered a snap election, saying he needs a strong four-year mandate to fight the tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump . Doug Ford, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, said the 25% tariffs threatened by Trump would devastate Canada’s economy and cost Ontario thousands of jobs. “The people of our province, like people across Canada, are facing unprecedented times,” Ford said in Windsor, Ont. “I am asking the people of Ontario for their trust. I’m asking (...) for a strong, stable, four-year mandate to do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.” The move would send Ontarians to the polls on Feb. 27, more than a year before the June 2026 fixed election date. Ford already has a large majority government, with 79 of the 124 seats in the Ontario legislature. Trump has threatened to introduce tariffs on Canadian goods starting Saturday. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt , told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that the plan was “still on the books” for that day. “This is a game to the president,” said Ford, who is the equivalent of a U.S. state governor. “He seeks to divide and conquer.” RELATED COVERAGE Canada’s oldest company to liquidate all but 6 stores starting Monday With Trump’s zigzag actions on trade, March came in like a lion and won’t be going out like a lamb Don’t click on those road toll texts. Officials issue warnings about the smishing scam Ford said the provincial government is prepared to spend “tens of billions of dollars” to protect jobs and the economy of Ontario, Canada’s manufacturing and automobile hub. “We’ll fight these tariffs with every tool in our toolbox,” he said. Ford has said there would be a dollar-for-dollar tariff retaliation on American goods entering Canada. He has also said that if Trump applies tariffs, he will instruct Ontario’s liquor control board to pull all American-made alcohol from shelves. Trump has said that Canada can avoid tariffs if it becomes the 51st state and he has incorrectly claimed that the U.S. has a $200 billion deficit with its major trading partner. Opposition parties accuse Ford of calling an early election before any potential charges emerge from a police investigation into his now-scrapped plan to develop lands under environmental protection. Elections Ontario, the independent office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario responsible for the administration of provincial elections and referendums, said Wednesday the election will cost about $189 million Canadian dollars ($131 million). That money, said Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, would be better spent on health care and affordable housing. “This isn’t a necessary election,” Crombie told a news conference on Wednesday. “He is trying to cling to power.” Daniel Beland, a political science professor at Montreal’s McGill University, said Ford is taking “a calculated risk.” “The opposition is divided between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party, which is very likely to allow him to stay in power, at least if he runs an effective campaign,” said Beland. The Ontario election is being held at the same time as the federal Liberal Party is selecting a new leader to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who announced his resignation Jan. 6 . Trudeau will remain prime minister until a new Liberal Party leader is chosen on March 9. The next Liberal leader could be the shortest-tenured prime minister in the country’s history. All three opposition parties have vowed to bring down the Liberals’ minority government in a no-confidence vote after parliament resumes on March 24 which would trigger a spring election. “We need a strong leadership that is prepared to do whatever lies ahead despite the chaos we now see in Ottawa,” said Ford. “Trump’s threats are not going away at a time when the federal government has left Canada drifting, exposed and vulnerable. We need a mandate that will outlive and outlast the Trump administration.”",

Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March. That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on Jan. 20 when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy. \"I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process,\" Trudeau said. \"This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election.\" To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of \"political gimmicks\" rather than focusing on what was best for the country.

After last-minute calls with Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to reinforce his country's border with the US to clamp down on migration and the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl. Earlier, Trump made a deal with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. She agreed to reinforce the northern border with troops. In return the US would limit the flow of guns into Mexico. But a US tariff of 10% on Chinese imports has come into effect, after a deadline of 00:01 EST (05:00 GMT) on Tuesday passed. Shortly after, Beijing announced it was imposing retaliatory tariffs on a raft of American products, including 15% on coal and liquefied natural gas and 10% on crude oil and agricultural machinery. Trump earlier said he planned to speak on the phone to his Chinese counterpart soon. He described the 10% import taxes as the \"opening salvo\" and said they could become \"very, very substantial\" if no agreement is made. Monday's breakthrough with Canada and Mexico came as they prepared retaliatory tariffs on American goods. After two phone calls on Monday, Trump and Trudeau posted on social media that they had reached a temporary agreement on securing the border that would avoid tariffs for at least 30 days. Both leaders portrayed the plan as a win. \"As president, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome,\" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. Watch: US anthem booed at basketball and hockey games in Canada Trudeau said Canada was implementing a $1.3bn (£1bn) border plan that included nearly 10,000 frontline workers and more resources to halt the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic drug 50 times stronger than heroin, which Trump has cited as a major concern. The prime minister also said Canada would appoint a \"fentanyl czar\" and launch a joint strike force with the US to combat crime, fentanyl and money laundering. Much of the border security plan had already been announced by Canada in December. It includes enhanced co-ordination with US law enforcement, increased information sharing, limiting traffic at the border, and the deployment of drones and Black Hawk helicopters for surveillance. The news came just hours after Trump paused a separate tariff on Mexican goods in exchange for that country sending 10,000 National Guard troops to its border with the US. President Sheinbaum broke the news on X, writing she had had a \"good conversation with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty\" with her US counterpart. Trump described his phone conversation with the Mexican leader as \"very friendly\". In 2019, Mexico's government agreed to send 15,000 soldiers to its northern frontier to avoid tariffs from the first Trump administration. The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war - what comes next? Who won and lost as Trump's trade war is delayed - for now What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them? Trump has framed tariffs as a tool for growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. \"Tariffs for us, nobody can compete with us because we're the pot of gold,\" he said on Monday afternoon. \"But if we don't keep winning and keep doing well, we won't be the pot of gold.\" Economists, however, have warned that tit-for-tat tariffs could raise prices for a wide range of products, including cars, lumber, steel, food and alcohol. Items had already been removed from some shelves, and stock markets lurched downwards on Monday before recovering slightly with the announcement that tariffs had been suspended. Reuters Andrew Furey, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, acknowledged that the 30 days had brought some relief, but warned Canadians that a trade war still loomed. He told the BBC he looked forward to using \"the calm Canadian diplomatic approach to try to resolve any future tariffs\", but cautioned against further \"chaotic\" actions from the US president. \"We're left as Canadians feeling a bit confused by this attack from our closest friend, our largest trading partner, our ally, family,\" Furey said. Getty Images The premier of Ontario - Canada's most populous province, which makes up about 38% of the country's GDP - welcomed the pause and said he would suspend plans for retaliatory measures. Premier Doug Ford wrote on X: \"Make no mistake, Canada and Ontario continue to stare down the threat of tariffs. \"Whether it's tomorrow, in a month or a year from now... President Trump will continue to use the threat of tariffs to get what he wants.\" On Sunday, Trump indicated the 27-nation European Union would be his next target for tariffs, without providing further details. The American president suggested that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared much duties.

The final report of the Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference found “no evidence of traitors” in the country’s parliament, but Commissioner Marie-Josée Hogue warned that one of the biggest threats to democracy was foreign actors sowing disinformation in both the traditional media and social media. “Distinguishing what is false is becoming increasingly difficult and the consequences are extraordinarily harmful,” Hogue told a news conference in Ottawa where she did not take questions. The Canadian government established the public inquiry in September 2023 to investigate whether China, Russia and other countries interfered in Canadian federal elections in 2019 and 2021 that re-elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals. The report said China is the “most active perpetrator” of foreign interference in Canada and accused India of being the second most active.

India has denied those allegations. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s killing and are awaiting trial. Russia, Pakistan and Iran are also considered foreign interference threats in Canada. Ronald Au-Yeung, a fellow with the political science department at the University of Notre Dame, said the rules surrounding Canadian federal elections are strong, but added that the report failed to adequately address the threat of foreign interference when political parties select their candidates. He explains that foreign governments can purchase memberships during a nomination race to help prevent its critics from receiving a party’s nomination to run for government. In the report, Hogue encouraged parties to adopt “more stringent rules who is entitled to vote in nomination and leadership contests.” The report includes seven volumes and lays out 51 recommendations for the federal government, nearly half of which she says should be considered before the next election. The report comes as Canada’s Liberal Party is selecting a new leader to replace Trudeau who announced his resignation Jan. 6 . He will remain prime minister until a new Liberal Party leader is chosen on March 9. The next Liberal leader could be the shortest-tenured prime minister in the country’s history. All three opposition parties have vowed to bring down the Liberals’ minority government in a no-confidence vote after parliament resumes on March 24 which would trigger a spring election. Among the report’s recommendations are calls to improve federal preparedness, foster transparency, shore up electoral integrity and counter threats against diaspora communities. Hogue said the Canadian Security Intelligence Service should clearly flag reports it views as particularly relevant for senior decision-makers. There is a recommendation for the government to create an entity to monitor online information for misinformation and disinformation that could impact the democratic process. The report also calls on Ottawa to develop a comprehensive foreign interference strategy, encourage political party leaders to obtain top secret-level security clearances, and consider creating a new agency to monitor online spaces for misinformation and disinformation.

The Trump administration said tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants into the US, but they potentially risk substantial price increases for American consumers across an array of common goods from avocados to sneakers to cars. Hours later, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced “far-reaching” retaliatory levies. China’s commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures,” without elaborating. The tariffs, and subsequent retaliation, risk igniting a trade war that could significantly damage the economies of the targeted countries and the United States. In anticipation, Trump’s executive action includes a clause that allows the president to expand the tariffs if a country imposes new tariffs on the United States. The new policy represents a reversal of virtually duty-free trade among the three North American nations that’s existed for several years — and an expansion of a frosty trade war between China and the United States that has escalated over the past two administrations. President Donald Trump speaks as he signs an executive order in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, on Friday. Carlos Barria/Reuters Related live-story Trump announces new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China As Trump has repeatedly promised over the past several months, the tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States. The tariffs will have no exemptions, and the executive action Trump signed Saturday will close the so-called de minimis loophole that had allowed shipments of $800 or less to come into the United States tax-free — a key provision used by many American small businesses but also Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu. Trump administration officials said the loophole prevented customs officials from properly inspecting those packages. Although Trump administration officials said Saturday the tariffs were designed to stop the flow of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants, they gave no specific benchmark for the new import taxes to be lifted — other than the cessation of the drugs and undocumented immigrants coming into the country. Notably, the tariffs included an important carve-out — the tariff on Canadian energy products will be 10%. Many Americans rely on Canadian energy products, including oil, electricity and natural gas, for fuel and home heating. The cost of those items could rise when the tariffs hit. To put the tariffs in place, Trump in his executive action declared a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which authorizes a president to unilaterally manage imports during a national emergency. The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 am ET. “Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China,” Trump said in a message posted to Truth Social on Saturday. He said he used the IEEPA “because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all.” Igniting a potential trade war The tariffs  could lead to potentially much higher costs, disrupted supply chains and the loss of jobs. In a call with reporters Saturday, a Trump administration official said any retaliation from Mexico, China or Canada would likely result in even higher tariffs for that country. Even Trump acknowledged the potential for adverse consequences on American consumers. “There could be some temporary, short-term disruption, and people will understand that,” Trump said Friday when pressed by reporters on the cost of tariffs being passed on to importers and, by extension, consumers. “But the tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong — and we’re going to treat other countries very fairly.” Hours after Trump’s action, Trudeau announced retaliatory 25% tariffs on US goods, that will be “far-reaching and include everyday items,” making good on his promise that Canada would retaliate forcefully and swiftly if the United States imposed levies. The country’s trade representatives met with Trump administration officials as recently as Friday in an attempt to stave off the tariffs. “Tonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% trade tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods,” the Canadian leader said in a news conference Saturday night. “This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days’ time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.” Affected items will include American alcohol, produce, clothing, shoes, household appliances, furniture, materials such as lumber, and “much more,” Trudeau said. Avocados and bananas from Mexico are displayed at a grocery store in San Francisco on Thursday. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Here’s what will get more expensive from Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China Mexico’s Sheinbaum also struck a defiant tone Saturday. “When we negotiate with other nations, when we talk with other nations, [it is] always with our heads held high, never bowing our heads,” Sheinbaum said, speaking in Chicoloapan de Juárez, east of the country’s capital. “I instruct the Secretary of Economy to implement plan B that we have been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico’s interests,” Sheinbaum said later in a post on X. It is not clear exactly what the retaliatory tariffs involve. A White House fact sheet on the tariffs said Mexican drug trafficking organizations have an “intolerable alliance” with the country’s government, accusing the government of providing a “safe haven” to cartels. Sheinbaum strongly denied “having alliances with criminal organizations,” calling the accusation “slander.” Meanwhile, China’s Ministry of Commerce said the imposition of tariffs “seriously violates” World Trade Organization rules. “China will file a complaint with the WTO, and will take corresponding countermeasures to resolutely defend its rights,” it said. It is not clear what the measures will be. Beijing’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said tariffs are “not constructive” and will only “undermine” work by both nations to combat narcotics. China “provides support to the US on the issue of fentanyl” but ultimately, “fentanyl is America’s problem,” the ministry said. Tariffs are one of the few policies Trump has consistently supported for decades, a rare through-line from his days as a New York developer to his time in public office (another is immigration). As a candidate, he swore he’d use tariffs — “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” — to wield US leverage abroad. But tariffs are unpopular among mainstream economists, who largely agree they cause inflation. That’s because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices. New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump’s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food. Businesses lash out at Trump’s tariff plan Corporations and business groups were apoplectic about the tariffs Saturday. The US Chamber of Commerce slammed the levies, warning they will raise consumer prices. In a statement, the powerful business group acknowledged that Trump is right to focus on securing the border and to fight the illicit flow of fentanyl. “But the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains,” said John Murphy, senior vice president and head of international at the chamber. “The Chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.” The National Association of Manufacturers said the tariffs would hurt American factories and their employees. “The ripple effects will be severe, particularly for small and medium-sized manufacturers that lack the flexibility and capital to rapidly find alternative suppliers or absorb skyrocketing energy costs,” said NAM CEO Jay Timmons. “These businesses—employing millions of American workers—will face significant disruptions. Ultimately, manufacturers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, undermining our ability to sell our products at a competitive price and putting American jobs at risk.” The Distilled Spirits Council of the US, the Mexican Chamber of the Tequila Industry and Spirits Canada said in a joint statement shared with CNN on Saturday that they are “deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries.” Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to US Department of Agriculture data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.

Kent Nishimura/Getty Images Related article With stiff tariffs he promised now in place, Trump opens a new trade war The energy industry was unsatisfied with the reduced tariffs on Canadian oil, gas and electricity. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents Big Oil and natural gas companies, said in a statement that it wanted to be fully left out of the tariffs. It noted fuel prices would rise on the $14.4 billion of oil and natural gas imported each year from Canada. “We will continue to work with the Trump administration on full exclusions that protect energy affordability for consumers, expand the nation’s energy advantage and support American jobs,” American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. NEMA, which represents the electricity industry, urged the Trump administration to take a more cautious approach to tariffs, noting the electricity and the electronics industries make up a large chunk of America’s imported and exported goods. Western Growers, which represents farmers, said the tariffs would hurt America’s food producers. “While we appreciate the border security issues apparently motivating the Trump Administration, rival growers of specialty crops outside of the U.S. will move quickly to seize the new business opportunities created by these tariffs to sell into the Canadian, Mexican and Chinese marketplaces,” its CEO Dave Puglia said in a statement. Consumer advocacy groups also warned Trump’s plans would raise costs for Americans. “Tariffs are a tax increase on American households and manufacturers,” National Taxpayers Union President Pete Sepp said in a statement. And new Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin came out swinging in a statement, offering an early preview of how his party intends to message more aggressively against Trump on kitchen table issues: “Here’s the thing about Donald Trump’s erratic tariff policy: Trump isn’t going to make corporate billionaires pay for these tariffs – working families and small businesses will. He’s using American workers as pawns in his petty political games,” Martin said. “If a president promised that they’d help my family get by, and then they did this, I’d be pretty pissed off. So, you should be pissed off.” Why those countries? Key trading partners Mexico, China and Canada are the United States’ three largest trade partners. And in 2023, Mexico overtook China as the top nation exporting goods to the US, marking the first time in two decades China was not the top-ranking exporter. Tariffs the first Trump administration put in place, which Joe Biden’s administration largely maintained, have negatively impacted the amount of goods the US imports from China. Mexican and Canadian goods have been imported in the US virtually duty-free as a result of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated with America’s bordering nations during his first administration. Tractor trailers wait in line at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, on the US-Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Carlos Moreno/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Trump just gave his clearest picture yet of what new tariffs could look like Mexico maintained that top position last year as well, exporting $467 billion worth of goods to the US, followed by China and Canada, which exported $401 billion and $377 billion worth of goods, respectively. That’s according to Commerce Department figures from last year through November, the most recent month of available data. Collectively, the three countries accounted for 42% of the nearly $3 trillion worth of goods the US imported worldwide last year. Canada was the top country the US exported goods to last year, valued at $322 billion, followed by Mexico and China, which received $309 billion and $131 billion worth of goods from the US, respectively. US exports to the three countries accounted for over 40% of the $1.9 trillion worth of goods the US exported globally last year. That means Americans could pay a lot more for a wide range of goods. For instance, the US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, according to Commerce Department data. Both are likely to get more expensive almost immediately after any new tariffs that impact Mexican car exports to the US. Automakers have operated as if Canada, Mexico and the United States were one unified market for decades, moving vehicles and parts across borders as they assemble vehicles. Even cars assembled at US auto plants all have parts that come from both Mexico and Canada, and vehicles assembled in those two countries have parts that come from US factories. Canada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group. Gas, fresh produce, consumer electronics — some of the top goods the US imports from Mexico, China and Canada — could also be set to get more expensive with blanket tariffs.

The federal government announced its own high-speed rail line at a news conference in Montreal on Wednesday. (Claude Paris/The Associated Press) Social Sharing The Liberal government launched a six-year, $3.9-billion design and development plan Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says will eventually connect Quebec City and Toronto with a high-speed rail line. \"Today I'm announcing the launch of Alto, the largest infrastructure project in Canadian history,\" Trudeau said from Montreal. \"A reliable, efficient, high-speed rail network will be a game-changer for Canadians.\" Trudeau said the new rail network will run all-electric trains along 1,000 kilometres of track, reaching speeds of up to 300 km/hour, with stops in Toronto, Peterborough, Ottawa, Montreal, Laval, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City. A government statement said the project will stimulate the economy, \"boosting GDP by up to $35 billion annually, creating over 51,000 good-paying jobs during construction.\" Trudeau said that once built, the new high-speed rail network will take passengers from Montreal to Toronto in three hours — about half the time it takes to drive and at double the speed of Via Rail's current trains. Federal government going ahead with high-speed rail between Quebec City and Toronto Could new rail line be 'costly boondoggle' or economic boon for Toronto? Liberals announce plans for new 'high frequency' rail lines from Toronto to Quebec City Construction on the new line will not begin until the design phase is done, which could take four to five years. Funds are to be allocated at the end of that time period, so it's possible a future government could modify or cancel the project. Last month, Trudeau announced he would be stepping down as prime minister. The race to succeed him is in full swing, with a new Liberal leader and prime minister set to be selected by March 9. An election is expected in the spring. Watch | 'This is real now': Trudeau says high-speed rail is coming to Canada: 'This is real now': Trudeau says high-speed rail is coming to Canada 2 months ago Duration 2:20 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking from Montreal on Wednesday, announced a plan for a 1,000 km high-speed rail network connecting Quebec City and Toronto — and took a question about what makes this announcement different after decades of discussion about the possibility of a high-speed rail corridor in the densely populated region. \"High-speed rail in this country was always going to be a project that would take long enough to build that it would cover multiple governments … from municipal to provincial to federal,\" Trudeau said. \"Obviously, future governments will make their determinations about how they invest. But this investment in Canadians, which starts right now, is going to be very difficult to turn back on,\" he added. Contract with consortium yet to be signed Trudeau said the consortium Cadence — made up of CDPQ Infra, AtkinsRéalis, Keolis, SYSTRA, SNCF Voyageurs and Air Canada — was selected to build the line. The group was only informed in the last 24 hours that their bid was the best of the three submitted, according to sources that spoke to Radio-Canada. Transport Minister Anita Anand said that Alto, the Crown corporation created to oversee the project, and Cadence will be signing a contract \"in the coming weeks\" that will outline the first-phase design work, such as where track will be laid and where stations will be built. A government statement said the initial development stage funding will be spread over six years starting this year, but Anand and Trudeau said in Montreal Wednesday that the design stage of the project might only last four to five years. Martin Imbleau, Alto's president and CEO, said the long lead time is necessary to ensure the project will not encounter problems when construction begins. \"We're going to take our time, properly develop the project, look at the different phases and in four or five years, we'll know what we're building,\" Imbleau said. WATCH | What Canadian high speed rail could look like: What Canadian high speed rail could look like 6 months ago Duration 2:33 The time it takes to travel from one city to another could be cut in half, which could have a massive effect on how many people travel, and even where people live. But some say the costs associated with the federal government’s plan may keep high-speed rail in Canada out of reach. As Radio-Canada first reported in October, the Liberal government had opted for a high-speed train rather than a slower high-frequency train project to transport passengers between Quebec City and Toronto. A government statement said \"Canada's investment in the co-development phase of the project represents $3.9 billion over six years, starting in 2024-25,\" in addition to the $371.8 million announced in the budget. Transport Canada initially estimated that the cost of a high-speed rail link between the two cities could be as high as $80 billion. Conservatives, Carney, Freeland react CBC News asked the Conservatives if they would support the project's completion should they form the next government, but they did not provide a direct answer. Conservative MP Philip Lawrence, the party's transport critic, dismissed the announcement as little more than a photo-op. \"The prime minister will be gone in two weeks. The minister of transport will not be seeking re-election. Today's announcement is a lame duck statement from a lame duck government,\" Lawrence said in a statement. \"Today's announcement is yet another promise with no details that will take years and $3.9 billion on planning and bureaucracy, without laying a single piece of track,\" he said. High-speed train pushed by Quebec, Ontario Ontario's dream of a bullet train may have died a quiet death Ontario budget 2018 Liberals' $11B pledge for high speed rail highlights long list of major infrastructure promises Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney welcomed the news on Wednesday, saying a new high-speed rail network could bring large economic benefits. \"This has all the potential to be the type of project, a public-private partnership, that the country needs,\" Carney said at a news conference in Scarborough, Ont. He added that if he becomes the Liberal leader, he would \"ensure that the project going ahead benefits all Canadians.\" Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, another candidate for the Liberal leadership, also backed the project. \"I think it's a great project. I think we need to be building more infrastructure. We need to have more connections between the cities in our country. This is a great investment in Canada's economy, in Canadian people,\" she said. A history of toying with high-speed rail Canada is the only G7 country without some form of high-speed rail, although the idea has been studied for decades. A joint Ontario, Quebec and federal government study completed in 1995 found that the idea of running trains between Quebec City and Windsor was feasible if they were at least 300 km/h and the private sector assumed half the cost and all the risk. In 2008, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and Quebec Premier Jean Charest agreed to conduct another study of the project. When that study suggested it could cost more than $21 billion , however, enthusiasm waned. In 2017, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne announced plans to build a high-speed rail network between Toronto and London by 2025, but that was axed when Doug Ford took office. Clarifications The headline on this story was updated from an earlier version that referred to a \"six-year, $3.9B plan\" for high-speed rail. In fact, that describes only the design and development phase and does not include construction.

Instead, the Canadian team stood at the blue line, arm in arm, player and coach, wearing their championship hats while the maple leaf flag was lowered behind the 4 Nations Face-Off trophy and the national anthem reverberated across the Americans’ home ice. The fans who remained, many of them in their red Team Canada jerseys, sang along. Connor McDavid scored at 8:18 of overtime to give Canada a 3-2 victory over the United States on Thursday night as the North American rivals turned what had been a tune-up for the 2026 Olympics into a geopolitical brawl over anthems and annexation as much as international hockey supremacy. Or, to put it another way: It was the 51st U.S. state 3, Canada’s 11th province 2. AP AUDIO: Connor McDavid scores in OT to give Canada 3-2 win over United States in 4 Nations Face-Off final Canada avenged last week’s loss to the United States with an overtime win on Thursday to claim the 4 Nations Face-Off. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. “You can’t take our country — and you can’t take our game,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X in a cross-border callback to President Donald Trump’s chatter about turning one of the United States’ closest allies into the 51st state. ”A lot of stuff going on with Canada and the USA right now, and us playing against each other was kind of a perfect storm for our sport,” said Nathan MacKinnon, who was selected the MVP of the new tournament with four goals in four games. “It was much more popular than even we would have imagined. It was getting so much attention from our whole continent.” RELATED COVERAGE Czech leaders condemn Russian threats against NHL great Dominik Hasek Wild’s top line more than the Golden Knights can handle through first 2 games Kaprizov’s 3-point game leads the Wild to a 5-2 win over the Golden Knights, tying the series Jordan Binnington stopped 31 shots — including the last 20 in a row — on the same ice where he helped the St. Louis Blues win the Stanley Cup as a rookie five years ago. MacKinnon and Sam Bennett also scored for Canada, which made it 2-2 in the second period and then played a scoreless third. After a flurry of saves by Binnington early in the overtime, Canada gained a faceoff in the U.S. zone and Mitch Marner got the puck along the boards before popping it into the center to McDavid for the winner. The Canadians poured over the boards to celebrate, shook hands with the vanquished Americans, and then took turns skating with the never-before-awarded trophy. “Just to see the reaction. Just to know what it means to us. I know it’s just a quick tournament, and it’s not an Olympic gold medal or anything like that, but it means the world to our group, as you can see,” McDavid said. “I hope (the new fans) love it,” he said. “It’s a great game, it’s a great sport and I hope we put on a good show these last couple days and gained some fans, ultimately. You can’t ask for a better show than that.” Brady Tkachuk and Jake Sanderson scored for the Americans, and Connor Hellebuyck stopped 22 shots in regulation and three more in OT. The U.S. has lost all but one game against Canada in best-on-best international play dating to the preliminaries of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; the lone victory was in the 4 Nations round-robin, a game so good it turned Thursday’s sequel into one of the most anticipated international hockey events in decades . “I think guys that are at home watching this, I’m hoping they’re wanting a piece of it,” U.S. forward Dylan Larkin said. “This grew the game really well, but I hope it pushes guys to want a piece of this and then the next generation that got to watch this, they’re going to watch the Olympics next year and hopefully there’s a different outcome.” The already ripe rivalry between the two North American hockey powers took on an added intensity during the tournament following Trump’s tariff threats and talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Trump called the American team Thursday morning to wish it well, then turned to Truth Social to take a poke at “Governor Trudeau.” The political backdrop combined with the quality of the round-robin game, which the United States won 3-1 on Saturday, to bring the atmosphere of a Stanley Cup Final or Olympic gold medal game to the TD Garden. Fans in their team jerseys waved flags , shouted for their countrymen and continued the ritual booing of the opposing national anthem that has become an nightly undercard for a tournament that returned the NHL’s stars to the international scene after missing the last two Winter Games. The pregame hype video was a callback to the 1980 Olympics, when the undermanned U.S. team upset the powerful Soviet machine in the midst of the Cold War. “Miracle on Ice” Olympic hero and honorary U.S. captain Mike Eruzione wore a Johnny Gaudreau jersey to honor the memory of former Boston College and Calgary Flames star who was killed by a drunk driver while bicycling in New Jersey at his sister’s wedding last summer. The American fans chanted “Johnny Hockey!” to spur their team on, and broke into frequent cheers of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” — just like in Lake Placid. But this time it was the team in red that came away with the win. “We wanted this one,” Canada forward Mark Stone said. “You’ve got 40 million Canadians, sitting at home, and you feel the energy. Anytime you have the chance to play for our country, or the flag on our chest, it’s a special, special feeling. ... It brings us together. And just glad we got to get this one.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL JIMMY GOLEN Golen covers Boston sports for The Associated Press, with a little bit of sports law and Olympic beach volleyball and curling mixed in. twitter mailto",

Surgeon-turned-politician makes surprise announcement Ryan Cooke · CBC News · Posted: Feb 25, 2025 12:42 PM EST | Last Updated: February 25 Social Sharing Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey held a news conference in St. John's on Tuesday, where he announced his resignation as premier. (Paul Daly/The Canadian Press) Andrew Furey — the 14th premier of Newfoundland and Labrador — has announced his resignation. The move came as a shock on Tuesday afternoon, as Furey addressed the media and his supporters on short notice, immediately following a caucus meeting at Confederation Building in St. John's. The province has been abuzz with rumblings of a forthcoming election for weeks. Instead, the premier announced he'd be returning to his job as an orthopedic surgeon. \"It has been a wild and unexpected journey, right from the start to bring us here to today, to the finish,\" he said. \"It is with a heart full of pride and hard-earned confidence in the future of Newfoundland and Labrador, that I must now move on.\" He finished his address with tears in his eyes, saying: \"God bless the beautiful people of this province, and God guard thee Newfoundland and Labrador.\" He then walked off the stage to his wife and kids, wrapping them in his arms. The premier was tight-lipped with his decision, with even his deputy premier Siobhan Coady saying she found out just before his announcement. Furey embraced his family following his resignation speech. (Paul Daly/The Canadian Press) Decision comes after Furey crosses off major goal His resignation comes three months after securing a memorandum of understanding with Quebec on a new deal for hydroelectric power flowing from Churchill Falls in Labrador. The memorandum of understanding would see the controversial 1969 contract torn up and replaced 16 years early. Furey and Quebec Premier François Legault say the new agreement would provide $200 billion in value to each province over its lifetime. WATCH | Andrew Furey steps down as premier of Newfoundland and Labrador: FULL SPEECH | Andrew Furey announces his resignation as N.L. premier 2 months ago Duration 11:08 In an unexpected move, the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador announced Tuesday afternoon that he is stepping down. Andrew Furey cited improvements to health care and child care programs, support for Ukraine and his role in repatriating the Unknown Soldier as some of his career highlights Furey referred to the accomplishment on Tuesday as \"history made and past wrongs rewritten,\" and called it a \"rock solid foundation for our province moving forward.\" He also made reference to \"blind sides\" — such as the adversity of the pandemic, the financial woes of the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, and the potential trade war with the U.S. In recent months, Furey has been on the front lines of that fight, making several trips south of the border with other Canadian premiers. After meetings earlier this month, Furey told reporters that President Donald Trump's officials informed them the president was \"very serious\" about his 51st state comments. \"We're looking at four years of erratic, crazy, bonkers behaviour by the president of the United States,\" Furey said on Tuesday. \"This is going to be a pervasive problem for Canadians for the next four years.\" Furey said the province's natural resources put it in an optimal position for economic uncertainty and a trade war with Canada's closest ally. Decision made with family in mind After departing the stage and hugging members of his family and caucus, both Andrew and Allison Furey spoke to a crowd of reporters. \"It was the balance of family, combined with the electoral timing rules and what I felt was best for the stability of the province,\" he said. The province's fixed election laws mean voters must head to the polls in October or November — depending on the timing of a federal election — at the latest. The province also has a rule stating there has to be an election within one year of a governing party changing leaders. WATCH | Furey explains what happens next as he resigns as N.L. premier amid Trump turmoil: Furey explains what happens next as he resigns as N.L. premier amid Trump turmoil 2 months ago Duration 1:22 Andrew Furey, who is stepping down as premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, explains what will happen next in terms of picking a new premier — and says whoever ends up leading the province will face 'tumultuous' times in the face of erratic rhetoric and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, describing him as a ‘maniac.’ Furey said that could have resulted in him leading the Liberals through an election before the fall, only to trigger another election once he stepped down. \"We felt that this was the most stable thing to do, the most responsible to do for the people of this province,\" he said. Furey confirmed he will stay on until a new Liberal leader has been chosen. He said he will not be running in the upcoming federal election. 'We've enjoyed every second of this' Furey's tenure as premier wasn't all roses. He ascended to the role in August of 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. He faced scrutiny over the decision to call an election in the spring of 2021, which was blindsided by an outbreak of COVID-19 cases that caused voting to be delayed. Furey said he made the decision after conversations with his wife, Dr. Allison Furey, around the Valentine's Day weekend. (Paul Daly/The Canadian Press) Even as the pressures of the pandemic relented, Furey was in charge of a health-care system in a state of permanent crisis. There was controversy with the province's reliance on travel nurses, a fisheries protest that disrupted a provincial budget last year and a fishing trip with a billionaire that resulted in a conflict of interest probe — he was ultimately cleared of conflicts in the latter case. On the bright side, Furey pointed to the MOU with Quebec, a multi-billion dollar rate mitigation deal with the federal government, and the repatriation of an unknown soldier from France as his favourite accomplishments. \"We've enjoyed every second of this,\" he told reporters. Allison Furey told reporters how proud she was of her husband over the past five years. \"I think the province knows Andrew as somebody who gives 150 per cent, and he's done that for the last five years in this role as premier,\" she said. \"I'm feeling a little bit of relief, a little bit of sadness and nostalgia. I think our future is bright. I think he's left this place in a better spot than he found it, and we're very proud of him.\" Quebec Premier Francois Legault and Andrew Furey, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador shake hands after signing a memorandum of understanding during an announcement in St. John's on Dec. 12. (Paul Daly/The Canadian Press) Furey also received a message of support from the Quebec premier immediately following his announcement. The two formed an unlikely friendship during their time as premiers, setting aside decades of bad blood between the neighbouring provinces. \"I will remember for the rest of my life what we accomplished together in reaching a new agreement on the Churchill Falls power plant, its expansion and on the new Gull Island power plant,\" Legault wrote on social media. \"With this historic agreement, we have transformed the relationship between Quebec and Newfoundland, making it one of the strongest relationships in the country.\" What's next? Furey will stay on as premier until a new leader is selected — a process deputy premier Siobhan Coady says remains without timelines, since nobody knew this decision was coming. His resignation comes at a tricky time for the party, as there were questions about whether or not a number of senior caucus members — Coady included — would be seeking re-election. When asked if she would consider a run, Coady said she hadn't had a chance to think about it. \"I haven't even spoken to my husband since this announcement,\" she said with a chuckle. \"Let me take a few days, obviously. I think there will be a lot of people who will think about this over the next number of days. There are a lot of leaders in our caucus and a lot of leaders in the community who might want to step up as well.\" Download our free CBC News app to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

Pat King, 47, was found guilty in November of five criminal charges including mischief and disobeying a court order. He faced up to 10 years in prison. In its ruling Wednesday, an Ontario Superior Court judge gave King nine months credit for time already spent in custody before and during his trial. On top of the house arrest, he will have to complete 100 hours of community service at a food bank or men’s shelter. Two other organizers, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, are awaiting the outcomes of their trials. The February 2022 protests, dubbed the Freedom Convoy, were sparked by a Canadian government vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government.

Just after midnight, Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Beijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. In an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, “they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” Trump also acknowledged there could be “a little disturbance” from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market’s sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation. “It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,” he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. “You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days. “Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said. President Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. Here’s what you need to know about them. Later in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico “in the middle,” with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. Lutnick told Fox Business Network that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise.

A Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford’s press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he’ll go harder. The official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau’s “very dumb” comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump’s trade war. AP AUDIO: Trump’s trade war draws swift retaliation as Mexico, Canada and China impose tariffs on the US AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s blistering rejection of the Trump tariffs. China indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X. The president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient. Import taxes are “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,” Trump said Monday. “And now we’re using them.” Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday’s hikes will lift America’s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. “We’re in a new era for sure.” As the trade disputes escalated, stocks racked up more losses Tuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next. A truck drives past the passenger entry point at the United States and Canada border in Surrey B.C., on Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Ethan Cairns /The Canadian Press via AP) During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs only after lengthy investigations — into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. But by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, “he can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,’’ House said. “It’s chaotic.” Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs. “Presidents don’t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Abusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn’t leadership — it’s dangerous.” Even some Republican senators raised alarms. “Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. Truck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he’s done for decades. Like many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. “Things could change drastically,” Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S. Alan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump’s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States. “Nobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,” Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn’t find enough workers in the United States.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) U.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada. Sales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. “They’re putting that 25% on studs.’' Builders will strain to stay within their budgets. After years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada’s crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold. “That hurts,” he said. At his small distillery “every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.” Bard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky’s Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin. The China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling,” as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.

Conservatives say MLA Brodie mocked abuse victims, oust her from caucus The move comes after Brodie publicly mocked, belittled testimony from former residential school students Lauren Collins Mar 7, 2025 1:04 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Conservative Party of B.C. Leader John Rustad says Vancouver-Quilchena MLA Dallas Brodie has been kicked out of his party's caucus. (Wolf Depner/News Staff) Listen to this article 00:03:32 Conservative Party of B.C. Leader John Rustad says Vancouver-Quilchena MLA Dallas Brodie has been removed from his party's caucus, and will not be welcome to return. The move comes after Brodie challenged the caucus to \"fire her\" and asked Conservative MLAs to have a vote on removing her on Thursday (March 6), according to a release from the Conservatives Friday. Brodie reportedly walked out of the caucus room. Rustad said her removal is a \"result of her decision to publicly mock and belittle testimony from former residential school students, including by mimicking individuals recounting stories of abuses — including child sex abuse.\" \"Horrible things happened to vulnerable children at Residential Schools — including pedophiles preying on children; at Kamloops Indian Residential School, Gerald Mathieu Moran was charged and convicted by Canadian courts with several dozen sex crimes he committed against children while working there,\" Rustad said. \"In a recent podcast appearance, Dallas Brodie uses a mocking, child-like voice to belittle testimony from former residential school students, saying things like 'my grandmother’s truth' and 'my truth, your truth' in a child-like ‘whining’ voice.\" Rustad said he believes strongly in free speech, \"however, using your stature and platform as an MLA to mock testimony from victims alleging abuse, including sex abuse, is where I draw the line.\" However, Rustad drew the line at denouncing Brodie's comments around burials and grave sites at former residential school sites. He said her removal is about an elected MLA using her position of authority to mock testimony of survivors of abuse, including child sex abuse. \"I want to be clear — this has nothing to do with whether or not there are undiscovered remains at Kamloops Indian Residential School, where it is objectively true that no new bodies have been found.\" Brodie first posted to X on Feb. 22 as the party's then-attorney general critic claiming \"apparent mistreatment\" of a lawyer who is suing his own law society for libel after having asked the society to reword training materials around residential schools. In her posts, she said \"the confirmed number of child burials at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School site is zero ... No one should be afraid of the truth. Not lawyers, their governing bodies, or anyone else.\" Brodie refused to take down the post and posted her letter to Attorney General Niki Sharma on March 4. She came under fire from her Conservative colleague and house leader, Chilliwack-Cultus Lake MLA A'Aliya Warbus, who posted to X in the days after to: \"Inform yourself, get the latest facts, research AND talk to survivors. Questioning the narratives of people who lived and survived these atrocities, is nothing but harmful and taking us backward in reconciliation.\" The Conservative Party of B.C. will be taking over Brodie's files, \"including advocating to ensure the Law Society of BC uses accurate language in training materials, and does not unduly agitate against its members,\" Rustad said. \"The privilege, and platform, of being a Conservative MLA comes with an expectation and responsibility to do the right thing — mocking former residential school students giving testimony, including testimony about child sex abuse by pedophiles, is beyond the pale.” Breaking News You Need To Know Sign up for a free account today and start receiving our exclusive newsletters.

        "text": "Britain’s King Charles III welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday as the monarch faces criticism in Canada over being silent about U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor. While royal officials did not provide details about the private talks at the monarch’s royal residence Sandringham, Trudeau suggested he and the king discussed Trump’s comments that Canada should become the 51st state. “We spoke about matters of importance to Canadians — including, above all, Canada’s sovereign and independent future,” Trudeau wrote on X late Monday. Charles is the head of state in Canada, a member of the Commonwealth group of many former British colonies and territories. Trudeau on Sunday said “nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation.” Get breaking National news For news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.

Trudeau flew to London to join an emergency defense summit on Ukraine over the weekend, where British Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans to end the war in Ukraine and rallied European counterparts to throw their weight behind the country as U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy. The king’s meeting with the Canadian leader came after Charles met Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to show solidarity with Ukraine after Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy in a heated exchange in the Oval Office.

Starmer delivered that invitation to Trump in Washington last week, noting it was an “unprecedented” honor since Trump already had been given the royal treatment by Queen Elizabeth II during his first term. Starmer insisted to lawmakers on Monday that the U.S. and Britain have “the closest of relationships,” and that it would be “a huge mistake at a time like this to suggest that any weakening of that link is the way forward for security and defense in Europe.” Advertisement",

        "text": "Toronto Ontario's Progressive Conservatives cruise to rare 3rd-straight majority Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his Progressive Conservatives cruised to their third straight majority government Thursday, after a snap winter election fought amid the spectre of U.S. tariffs. Premier Doug Ford is first Ontario party leader since 1959 to win 3 majorities Lucas Powers · CBC News · Posted: Feb 27, 2025 9:08 PM EST | Last Updated: March 1 Ontario's election night in under 3 minutes 2 months ago Duration 2:58 From Ford's historic victory to a humbling loss in Mississauga for Crombie, check out the highlights from the province's snap winter election, waged in the face of Donald Trump's tariff threats. Social Sharing Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his Progressive Conservatives cruised to their third straight majority government Thursday, after a snap winter election fought amid the spectre of U.S. tariffs. The win secured Ford's place in the annals of the province's political history: it was the first time since 1959 in Ontario that a party leader has won three consecutive majorities. Get all the results from the 2025 Ontario election When Ford triggered the $189-million election he asked voters for \"the largest mandate in Ontario's history\" to combat continued economic threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. On that front, it was a bittersweet night for Ford and his PCs, who are likely to return to Queen's Park with roughly the same number of seats after a campaign his rivals called a cynical and unnecessary power play. With two ridings going to automatic recounts because they were within a 25 vote margin, the PCs were on track for 80 seats — just one more than they had when the legislature dissolved in January and three fewer than the party picked up in its 2022 majority win. Nonetheless, Ford struck an optimistic tone in an address to supporters at his election night headquarters in Etobicoke. \"This election, we asked the people for a mandate. A  strong mandate that outlives and outlasts the Trump administration. A mandate to do whatever it takes to protect Ontario. Well friends, the people have spoken. They're ready to stand up for Canada,\" Ford continued. \"Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region. Donald Trump doesn't know what we know. He is underestimating us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people, the Canadian spirit,\" he said. WATCH | Ford says he'll take on tariffs: 'We have made history,' says Doug Ford in victory speech 2 months ago Duration 4:28 Speaking to supporters after winning a historic third majority, Doug Ford underscored his commitment to doing \"whatever it takes to protect Ontario\" from the threat of U.S. tariffs. NDP returns as Official Opposition The Ontario NDP secured enough seats to remain as the province's Official Opposition with Leader Marit Stiles at the helm, albeit with a slightly reduced caucus at Queen's Park. The New Democrats were likely to win 27 seats, one fewer than they held at dissolution. Public polling throughout the campaign consistently suggested the NDP could lose as much as half their caucus or more, so Thursday's outcome was relatively positive for the party. \"The results aren't everything that we hoped for,\" Stiles told supporters in Toronto. \"Our job is to hold this government to account, and that is the job we're going to do, with our usual fight and our determination, but also with love and hope and optimism,\" she added. Stiles also said she would work with Ford in Ontario's response to looming U.S. tariffs. \"I really do want to offer him any possible help that we can provide in the face of the threat of Donald Trump. The threat is real and I deeply believe we can overcome it with a strong Team Ontario and a strong Team Canada approach.\" WATCH | Stiles says she will help fight tariffs: Stiles vows to help Ford in fight against U.S. tariffs 2 months ago Duration 1:48 While acknowledging that supporters \"might be disappointed\" with the Ontario election results, NDP Leader Marit Stiles congratulated Doug Ford on his victory and promised to hold his government to account on key issues like affordability and health care. The New Democrats were able to fend off the PCs in a number of key ridings in the Windsor, London and Niagara areas, as well as in the north. NDP incumbent Jennifer French also kept her seat in Oshawa, the only one of 30 Greater Toronto Area ridings the PCs didn't win in 2022. As of Friday morning, the PCs had only managed to flip two seats from the NDP: Algoma–Manitoulin and Hamilton Mountain. Everything that happened on election night in Ontario Crombie falls in Mississauga, but Ford's rivals rack up wins in Toronto The PCs also made a strong push in Haldimand-Norfolk, where Bobbi Ann Brady was running for re-election as an independent, but she resoundingly defeated the party for a second time. Crombie fails to win seat Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie was unable to win in Mississauga East–Cooksville, losing to PC Silvia Gualtieri. Crombie was a three-term mayor of Mississauga and former federal Liberal MP. When she was elected to lead the party in December 2023, Crombie vowed to flip every PC seat in Peel Region. The PCs held all five Brampton seats and looked set to win five of six Mississauga ridings. The sixth, Mississauga–Erin Mills, was going to a recount, though the PCs led on election night. The Liberals successfully flipped five seats elsewhere, three in Toronto, one in the 905 region and another in the Ottawa area. Four of those gains came from the PCs and one from the New Democrats. They will return to Queen's Park with a caucus of 14, up from the nine seats they previously held. That means the Liberals surpassed the benchmark of 12 seats to regain official party status for the first time since 2018. Party status comes with increased financial resources, debate time and roles at Queen's Park. In a speech to supporters, Crombie was defiant, saying she intends to stay on as the party's leader. \"I know tonight isn't exactly the result we were looking for, but you should be very, very proud of what we did tonight. People counted us out. They said the Ontario Liberal Party was dead. Ha. Tonight, you proved them wrong,\" she said. WATCH | Crombie says she intends to stay on as leader: Crombie reacts to Ontario election loss 2 months ago Duration 3:49 While acknowledging the election results weren't what the party had hoped for, Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie celebrated regaining official party status and vowed to hold Ford accountable as premier. The Liberals also managed to increase their provincewide vote share to nearly 30 per cent, surpassing the NDP by more than 11 per cent. NDP support, however, was more concentrated in specific ridings. ONTARIO VOTES 2025 Here are the Ottawa-area winners in the provincial election ONTARIO VOTES 2025 PCs take Hamilton Mountain for 1st time in 30 years, while NDP win Hamilton Centre Meanwhile, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner won re-election in the riding of Guelph and the party also held Kitchener Centre, a seat they first picked up in a 2023 byelection. \"I say to Mr. Ford, congratulations on a majority government. The two Ontario Green MPPs will do our job to hold your government accountable. We will do it as the unofficial official opposition,\" Schreiner said. \"And I also want to be clear at the same time, we're ready to work across party lines to put people before politics and deliver for the people of Ontario and the people of our communities.\" The Greens were unable to flip Parry Sound–Muskoka, where they poured considerable resources trying to unseat PC incumbent Graydon Smith, who will represent the northern riding once again. Voter turnout was a lingering concern given the winter weather, with some regions of the province under weather advisories throughout election day. Elections Ontario projected turnout to be 45.4 per cent, with 99.93 per cent of polls reporting as of Friday morning. That's up slightly from 2022's 44 per cent, the lowest-ever turnout in Ontario's history. Official voter turnout numbers are expected early next week, Elections Ontario said in an email to CBC Toronto. Ford campaigned on tariff fight Ford's election call came as he was enjoying national attention as one of the faces of Canada's response to the looming shadow of Trump's economic policy. Often sporting a \"Canada is Not for Sale\" hat, Ford campaigned almost singularly on the pitch that he is the only provincial party leader who could navigate four years of economic chaos. The PC election platform included roughly $40 billion in new spending promises, nearly half of it geared toward staving off potentially devastating consequences of tariffs on key industries. Highly unusual for a provincial election race, Ford left the country for two anti-tariff trips to Washington, D.C., during the four-week campaign. And despite declining any one-on-one interviews with media in Ontario, Ford also appeared semi-regularly on American cable news programs.

(Dax Melmer/The Canadian Press) The PCs used the backdrop of economic uncertainty to expand on its strategy of targeting traditionally working class voters and tradespeople. Throughout the contest, Ford kept a relentless focus on the economy and jobs, often pivoting to the subject even when asked about other issues. Ford also spent considerable time campaigning in NDP-held ridings, though those efforts fell short of flipping several key seats from the New Democrats. London and area riding results for Ontario's 2025 election Video NDP's Lisa Gretzky wins in Windsor West, spoiling Ford's bid to turn region blue Perhaps the splashiest campaign pitch Ford made was a promise to build a tunnel under Highway 401. He has not offered up any ballpark cost estimates for such a massive project, and a feasibility study Ford said he ordered last year is not complete, but he said it will get built regardless. Experts have said the mega project would cost between $60 billion and $100 billion. Ford's opponents argued he cynically used the tariff threat as a pretext for a costly election, in part because the PCs already had a considerable majority and more than a year left in their mandate. Ford first publicly mused about the possibility of an early vote last May, six months before Trump threatened to impose tariffs. The NDP, Liberal and Green leaders also repeatedly alleged Ford was attempting to pre-empt the results of an ongoing criminal investigation by the RCMP into his government's Greenbelt scandal. They also tried, albeit with limited success, to turn the focus of the campaign to Ford's record on issues like health care, housing and education. About 2.5 million Ontarians don't have a family doctor, emergency room wait times are at record highs and hallway health care is a persistent problem. Despite a promise from the PCs during the last election to build 1.5 million new homes by 2031, housing starts in the province have essentially stalled out. Meanwhile, Ontario's school repair backlog is nearly $13 billion. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Lucas Powers Senior Writer Lucas Powers is a Toronto-based reporter and writer.

The list includes Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel and La Nueva Familia Michoacana, and was announced a day after the U.S. government formally designated eight Latin American organized crime groups as “foreign terrorist organizations.” “The measures will help keep fentanyl off Canadian streets and from entering the United States,” McGuinty told a news conference. The announcement was Canada’s latest response to U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s claim that the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigration into the U.S. were behind his threats of imposing a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods – with the exception of 10% on energy. Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4. U.S. border patrol statistics show that less than 1% of all fentanyl seized is found at the northern border. But Canadian officials have expressed a willingness to do more to combat the deadly synthetic opioid. RELATED COVERAGE Singer of Canadian anthem at 4 Nations Face-Off changes lyric to protest Trump’s 51st state remarks American fans lightly boo ‘O Canada’ before 4 Nations Face-Off title game Canada’s new fentanyl czar says goal is to totally stop the drug from entering the US The other organizations designated as terrorist groups are Cartel del Golfo and Carteles Unidos, also from Mexico; Tren de Aragua, in Venezuela, and the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, which started in California but became a dominant criminal force in El Salvador. The designation effectively freezes a group’s assets and property. “Banks and brokerages will freeze these entities’ assets, which can then be the subject of seizure, restraint or forfeiture,” said McGuinty. It is also an offense to knowingly participate in, or contribute to, any activity of a listed terrorist group. The listing process begins with intelligence reports that indicate whether an organization has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity. McGuinty said listing a group as a terrorist entity follows a rigorous process that “must meet a legal threshold.” If the public safety minister believes that threshold has been met, the minister may recommend to the federal cabinet that the organization be added to the list. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the RCMP has intelligence indicating that crime cartels operate in Canada. “There’s also strong intelligence that Canadians have actually moved to Mexico and South America to facilitate the transport of certain commodities into Canada,” Duheme said. Canada recently appointed Kevin Brosseau , a former member of the RCMP and a former national security and intelligence adviser, as its fentanyl czar to help stop drugs entering the U.S. The Canadian government has also announced it is spending $1.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$910 million) on increased border security, including new helicopters, technology and personnel.",

The shooting took place at 22:39 on Friday local time (03:39 GMT Saturday) near  Scarborough city centre in eastern Toronto. Authorities said six people suffered bullet wounds and others were hurt by flying or broken glass. The injuries were not life-threatening, they said. Toronto police said the three men, armed with an assault rifle and handguns, had entered the pub and \"opened fire indiscriminately\". A motive \"right now remains unclear and we're chasing down all leads\", said Police Supt Paul MacIntyre. \"This was a brazen and reckless act of violence that's really shaken our community and the city itself,\" he added. Police said they were deploying all available resources to find the suspects. Earlier, they said that one suspect, wearing a black balaclava, had been seen fleeing the scene in a silver car. The victims ranged in age from 20s to mid-50, according to police. \"I'm happy to report, by the grace of God, that there have been no fatalities,\" Supt MacIntyre said, which he called \"extremely lucky.\" He said he and other officers were \"horrified\" by video of the shooting. \"These guys just looked at the crowd and opened fire. It was horrible.\" Glass walls were shattered and there was \"blood all over the floor\", including in the basement, where some people ran to hide before police arrived, he said. Mayor Olivia Chow expressed deep concern over the mass shooting, telling reporters on Saturday that she was \"deeply troubled\" by the incident. \"It is troubling because of the magnitude of the shooting and the number of people hurt,\" Mayor Chow said. She said that police have been actively investigating the case throughout the night and into the morning. Ontario Premier Doug Ford also condemned the violence, stating in an X post on Saturday that he fully supports the Toronto Police Service in their search for the suspects. The number of those injured in this incident is high compared to other shootings in the area in 2024. Last year, eight people were injured and two killed in shootings and firearm discharges in the police division where Friday's incident occurred, the department's data shows. In Toronto, which has a three million population, 43 people were killed in shootings last year. Canada has a lower rate of firearm homicides than its neighbour the US, with 0.6 per 100,000 people compared to 4.5 per 100,000, according to 2021 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The reversal came six hours after Trump announced his plan to double import duties on the Canadian metals in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday afternoon that he was pausing that surcharge following discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Navarro was asked on CNBC's \" Closing Bell: Overtime \" if the developments meant that \"we're not going to see 50% tariffs come tomorrow.\" Navarro replied, \"Correct.\" Lutnick \"did a beautiful job negotiating that,\" he said. Ford's threat to add a surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota came in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. The premier earlier in the day had vowed to keep his countermeasures on the U.S. in place, warning, \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.\" But he and Lutnick had a \"productive conversation\" later in the day, and they agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss a \"renewed\" trilateral trade agreement, according to a joint statement from the two men. Trump's new trade threats The moves marked the latest twists in an escalating and increasingly unpredictable trade war between the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday morning, Trump threw gas on the smoldering conflict with a Truth Social post announcing the new tariffs, while also repeating his calls for Canada to be absorbed into the U.S. as the \"Fifty First State.\" Trump said he was imposing the latest tariffs in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. That move by Ford was itself issued in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. \"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on \"Electricity\" coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. \"This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,\" he wrote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losses after Trump's announcement, falling more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. Markets were already reeling from the impact of Trump's tariffs and broader fears of a recession. Minutes after Trump's announcement, Ford said he would keep his countermeasure on U.S. energy in place. \"We will not back down. We will be relentless,\" Ford said on MSNBC. \"I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs, and it's unacceptable.\" In an interview on CNBC's \" Money Movers \" later Tuesday morning, Ford said he would be willing to shut off his province's energy supply to the U.S. if Trump \"continues to hurt Canadian families.\" \"I won't hesitate to do that,\" Ford said, adding, \"that's the last thing I want to do.\" Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in early February, before delaying them for one month and then reimposing them — and then partially delaying them again.

No one else.\" A senior administration official told CNBC at the time that Trump had not signed the formal paperwork to raise tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum, but that the order was \"in the works.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the president's thinking, said Trump's escalation was intended to \"lay down the gauntlet\" in response to Ford's action. watch now VIDEO 2:22 02:22 Trump raises Canadian steel, aluminum tariffs to 50% in retaliation for Ontario energy duties Squawk on the Street Separately in the Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump demanded that Canada \"immediately drop\" an \"Anti-American Farmer Tariff\" on certain U.S. dairy products. He also warned that he \"will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.\" \"This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,\" Trump wrote. The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war .

Sources have told Radio-Canada that the Liberals will choose their next leader by March 9. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Liberals will choose their next leader — and Canada's next prime minister — on March 9, the party said in a media release on Thursday night. After a frenzy of formal and informal meetings this week following Justin Trudeau's decision to step down as prime minister, the Liberal Party's national council decided on the date Thursday night. The party is also setting the entry fee for potential candidates at $350,000 — a significant jump from the $75,000 fee set by the party for the previous leadership race. Candidates will have to declare their intention to run and pay the entry fee by Jan. 23. People can register with the party to vote in the leadership race up until Jan. 27. Changes to who can vote The party is limiting who can vote to Canadian citizens and permanent residents. As the Liberals did during their last leadership race in 2013, they're allowing people 14 years of age or older to vote. Unlike general elections where the voting age is 18, parties can set their own age restrictions. The Conservatives allowed people 16 years or older to vote during their last leadership contest in 2022. Previously, non-Canadian residents were allowed to vote in Liberal Party riding nomination and leadership contests, which have been called a \"gateway\" for foreign interference . A growing contingent of Liberal MPs have urged the party executive to heed those warnings.

The party executive did not say if cabinet ministers would have to vacate their portfolios if they want to run for the top job. Former central banker Mark Carney has also said he's interested. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, former B.C. premier Christy Clark and House Leader Karina Gould are said to be gathering supporters, too. Prior to Thursday's meeting, Ottawa MP Chandra Arya and former Montreal MP Frank Baylis both said they will be running. Whoever is chosen to take over for Trudeau, they will have a tight timeline before the House of Commons returns. Gov. Gen. Mary Simon has prorogued Parliament until March 24, giving the new prime minister only a few weeks to make the transition.

        "text": "China executed four Canadians for drug crimes, says Ottawa 20 March 2025 Share Save Koh Ewe BBC News Share Save Getty Images The four executed Canadians were dual citizens, authorities say Four Canadians were executed in China on drug-related charges earlier this year, Canadian authorities have confirmed. All of them were dual citizens and their identities have been withheld, Canada's foreign minister Mélanie Joly said. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canada urged Ottawa to \"stop making irresponsible remarks\", as pundits feared a further downturn in relations between the countries after years of strain. China's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had acted \"in accordance with the law\", while the embassy said there was \"solid and sufficient\" evidence for their crimes. Beijing had \"fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned\", the embassy said, urging Canada to respect \"China's judicial sovereignty\". China does not recognise dual citizenship and takes a tough stance on drug crimes. However, it's rare for the death penalty to be carried out on foreigners. Joly said she had been following the cases \"very closely\" for months and had tried with other officials, including former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to stop the executions. In a statement to Canadian media, Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said Canada had \"repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere\". China imposes the death penalty on serious crimes including those related to drugs, corruption and espionage. While the number of executions are kept secret, human rights groups believe China has one of the highest execution rates in the world. \"These shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,\" said Ketty Nivyabandi, from Amnesty International Canada. \"We are devastated for the families of the victims, and we hold them in our hearts as they try to process the unimaginable. \"Our thoughts also go to the loved ones of Canadian citizens whom China is holding on death row or whose whereabouts in the Chinese prison system are unknown.\" In 2019, Canadian national Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was sentenced to death in China for drug smuggling, in a high-profile case condemned by the Canadian government. He was not among the Canadians who were executed. \"We'll continue to not only strongly condemn but also ask for leniency for other Canadians that are facing similar situations,\" Joly said on Wednesday. Relations between Canada and China have been icy since 2018, after Canada detained a Chinese telecom executive, Meng Wanzhou, on a US extradition request. China arrested two Canadians shortly afterwards, both of whom have now been released. In 2023, Canadian media released reports, many based on leaked intelligence, about detailed claims of Chinese meddling in the country's federal elections. China denied the reports, calling them \"baseless and defamatory\". More recently, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports after Ottawa placed levies on Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminium.

Carney, 59, takes on the role as Canada is locked in a potentially catastrophic trade war with the US , long its closest ally and largest trading partner. Last week Donald Trump announced a 25% tax on all Canadian goods, with a carveout for the automotive and energy sectors. The tariffs have the power to push Canada’s fragile economy in a recession. “America is not Canada . And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney told supporters, laying bare the existential crisis that has outraged Canadians, riven the longstanding relationship with the US, and promises to be the overarching theme in his tenure as prime minister. “We didn’t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,” Carney said. “So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win.” Before the announcement, the outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau , electrified the crowd by telling Liberals he was “damn proud” of his government’s legacy. View image in fullscreen Before the announcement, Trudeau said he was ‘damn proud’ of his government’s legacy. Photograph: Blair Gable/Reuters But he warned of dangerous time for the country. “This is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,” he told supporters. He also drew on the “elbows up” rallying cry to intense applause – a phrase from ice hockey legend Gordie Howe popularised in recent weeks after threats from Trump to annex Canada. It is unclear when Carney, who was governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, will assume office. Trudeau and the new Liberal leader are expected to hold conversations in the coming days to determine the outgoing prime minister’s final day in office. With 85.9% of the vote, Carney beat the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the former government house leader Karina Gould and the former member of parliament Frank Baylis. Carney has followed an unusual path to power : he will be only the second Canadian prime minister with no concrete links to parliament at the time of his appointment, including no seat in the House of Commons. While no rule bars this, convention suggests Carney will need to quickly announce plans to run for a federal seat. He will also be the first Liberal prime minister from western Canada, a valuable identity in a country that is politically divided along geographical lines. Carney spent much of his campaign pitching himself as an outsider, despite years-long ties to the Liberal party, including serving as an economic adviser to Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister. His definitive victory, foreshadowed by fundraising success and a spate of key endorsements from senior cabinet members with vast organising networks, could energise the incumbent Liberals. In recent weeks, the party has reversed its political freefall, sharply rebounding to such a degree that a previously expected Conservative majority in the next general election looks increasingly unlikely. Polls The shift in the polls has been so dramatic that pollsters have struggled to find any historical precedent. In a leaked memo, the leftwing federal New Democratic party recently warned its members Carney would probably call a snap election within days of winning the leadership race, capitalising on his rising popularity and depriving the opposition parties the rich political optics of bringing down the Liberal government through a vote of non-confidence to force an election. The move in the polls is, in part, explained by repeated threats by Trump to annex Canada. In polling, Carney is widely viewed as the most trusted federal leader to navigate the current trade crisis because of his extensive economic background. “My government will keep the tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,” said Carney. Carney also attacked the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, the current frontrunner if an election were held soon, calling him a “career politician” who was running a deeply divisive campaign. “Division doesn’t win in a tariff war,” Carney said. Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chance Read more But in recent weeks, several fumbles have underlined the challenges in moving from the corporate world to politics. Carney has waffled over his role at the investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, when it moved its headquarters from Toronto to New York – a politically sensitive issue given recent pressure from the US on businesses to uproot and move south. His attempts to clarify the issue prompted the Globe and Mail’s editorial board to praise him as a “fast learner in the art of prevarication and hairsplitting”. He has promised to put his substantial assets, believed to be valued at more than C$30m (£16m), into a blind trust immediately. Speaking before the new leader was announced, former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Trump had united Canadians “like never before” and jokingly called on him to receive the country’s highest honours as thanks. “From one old guy to another old guy. Stop this nonsense. Canada will never join the United States,” he said to raucous cheers. “No one will starve us into submission because Canada is and will remain the best country in the world. Vive le Canada!” This article was amended on 10 March 2025. An earlier version said Mark Carney will be only the second prime minister in Canadian history without a seat in the House of Commons.

Investigators said the man gained unauthorized access to the east block of Canada’s parliament on Saturday afternoon and barricaded himself inside the building. In a post on social media hours later, police said the man had been taken into custody without incident. There was no immediate word on charges or motive. Police initially released a warning Saturday afternoon telling anyone in east block, which houses parliamentary offices, to seek shelter in the nearest room, close and lock all doors and hide. People were evacuated from the building and police shut down a significant stretch of Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill, blocking traffic and pedestrians. More than three hours after the lockdown began, police extended the exclusion zone from Wellington Street one block back to Sparks Street. Ottawa police Insp. Mark Bouwmeester told reporters that the circumstances of this incident were “suspicious,” but gave few details about what was happening inside.

Tamara Lich and Chris Barber were key figures and organizers in the massive protest that saw hundreds of vehicles and thousands of people occupy downtown Ottawa and insist they would stay until COVID-19 public health mandates were eliminated. The February 2022 protests, dubbed the Freedom Convoy, were sparked by a Canadian government vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government. In finding the two guilty of mischief, Ontario Court Justice Heather Perkins-McVey said the evidence shows that the two routinely encouraged people to join or remain at the protest, despite knowing the adverse effect it was having on downtown residents and businesses.

Perkins-McVey found Lich and Barber not guilty of intimidation, counselling someone to commit intimidation, obstructing police and counselling someone to obstruct police. Barber also was found guilty of counselling to disobey a court order for telling people to ignore an injunction issued by a judge directing convoy participants to stop honking their truck horns in downtown Ottawa. The truckers’ convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant honking of horns and music from parties. Truckers also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest. Trudeau’s government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada. The Freedom Convoy shook Canada’s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was blocked. It carries more than 25% of trade between the countries, who are each other’s largest trading partners.",

Rankin was elected following a vote by Nova Scotia Liberal Party delegates, with the results announced Saturday night during a virtual convention. Rankin tops fellow former cabinet ministers Labi Kousoulis and Randy Delorey Michael Gorman · CBC News · Posted: Feb 06, 2021 4:25 PM EST | Last Updated: February 7, 2021 Iain Rankin addresses supporters after winning the leadership of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party at a virtual convention in Halifax on Saturday. (The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Iain Rankin will be the next premier of Nova Scotia. Rankin was elected following a vote by Nova Scotia Liberal Party delegates, with the results announced Saturday night during a virtual convention. He defeated fellow former cabinet ministers Randy Delorey and Labi Kousoulis. Delorey was dropped following the first ballot after earning the fewest points. About 97 per cent of the 8,100 delegates cast a ranked ballot. \"It's a monumental task and I'm up for it,\" Rankin told reporters. He instantly becomes leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party and is now premier-designate. Stephen McNeil remains premier of the province until Rankin and his cabinet are sworn in, likely in a few weeks, although Rankin could not say for sure when he expected an event to take place. Plans for a greener economy At 37, Rankin was the youngest of the three candidates and he positioned himself as a candidate for generational change. Much of his policy was framed around the environment, with Rankin pledging to form an economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic rooted in green policies. He believes that resonated with voters. \"Obviously, younger people want to see action on a number of files that I spoke to, but the Liberal Party has always been a pragmatic party and one that really valued social progress,\" he said. Rankin said that won't come at the expense of good fiscal management; now, he said, it will be done through a green lens. Rankin has pledged to get the province off coal and increase the use of renewable energy sooner than commitments established by McNeil's government, and make Nova Scotia the first province in the country to be net carbon neutral. He has also promised to implement the recommendations of the Lahey Report on forestry practices, which would see a drastic reduction in clear-cutting. A premier for everyone He dismissed suggestions that he was particularly different than McNeil, whom he said \"has shown more political courage than any premier in our history.\" Instead, Rankin said his plans are simply an evolution of things McNeil started and reflect things people want now, including confronting systemic racism. \"[People] want to see action on climate change. They want to see us continuing down the path of righting historic wrongs,\" Rankin said. \"[McNeil] believes in those things, too, and I'm just proposing that we start taking those steps forward together and the party, I think, by and large, wants to see action in those areas.\" Rankin, left, accompanied by his wife, Mary, addresses supporters after winning the leadership of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party at a virtual convention in Halifax on Saturday. (The Canadian Press) During his acceptance speech, Rankin acknowledged it was Liberal delegates who put him in the position to become the next premier and he pledged to be a voice for everyone. \"Whether you're a union member or a business owner, whether you live in downtown Halifax or in a rural community, whether you work in an office or on the land or on the sea, or you are a student or are retired, I'll be calling on your skills, your experience and your expertise to guide our decisions,\" he said. Next steps Rankin inherits a province with a low COVID-19 case rate but a massive deficit as a result of the pandemic. With mass vaccinations not expected before the fall and the province's vital tourism sector already bracing for another down year, Rankin has acknowledged that efforts to tackle the deficit must take a backseat to keeping as many small businesses above water as possible. He said his top priority would be meeting with Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang to discuss the province's pandemic response. Rankin pledged to follow McNeil's example of allowing the advice of Public Health, not politics, to take precedence in making decisions. He also plans to speak with Kousoulis and Delorey on Sunday to discuss what role each will take in his cabinet, as well as opposition leaders to see what areas of common ground there are ahead of the spring sitting of the legislature. Between then and now, a budget and throne speech also have to be finalized. McNeil says goodbye Rankin declined to discuss his transition plans, but said more news on that would be coming soon. Bringing Kousoulis onside will be particularly important as the party works to achieve a unified front ahead of the next provincial election. On the second ballot, Rankin received 52.4 per cent of the points to Kousoulis's 47.6 per cent. Saturday's event also included a tribute video to McNeil's time as leader of the party and premier. He announced last summer that he would be stepping down and not re-offering in the next election. During his own address to the convention, McNeil talked about the importance of party members coming together quickly following the result and said the next 48 hours would be crucial. \"We've never been in a better position to grow, to take off, to launch,\" McNeil said.

Photograph: Adrian Wyld/Reuters Canada This article is more than 4 years old Canada’s governor general resigns after report finds workplace harassment This article is more than 4 years old Anonymous staff members say they were berated by Julie Payette to the point of tears, prompting an independent investigation Leyland Cecco in Toronto Thu 21 Jan 2021 23.02 GMT Last modified on Fri 22 Jan 2021 10.56 GMT Share Canada ’s governor general has resigned after an external report found that the Queen’s representative had overseen a toxic work environment in which staff were bullied to tears. The report, which was to be released early next week, painted a damning picture of Julie Payette’s leadership and had raised concerns among senior government figures over her ability to continue in the vice-regal role. Picked by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau , in 2017, Payette, 57, is the representative of Queen Elizabeth II as head of state – a largely ceremonial position. Until Thursday, however, no governor general in Canada had ever been forced to resign. Payette’s unprecedented departure from the job follows previous allegations that she bullied staff at her official residence at Rideau Hall and on foreign trips. “Tensions have arisen at Rideau Hall over the past few months and for that, I am sorry,” Payette said in a statement on Thursday. “For the good of the country and of our democratic institutions, I have come to the conclusion that a new governorgeneral should be appointed. Canadians deserve stability in these uncertain times.” Last July, a number of anonymous staff told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation they were berated by Payette to the point of tears. Others said that she would call their work “shit” and order them out of her office. Trudeau accused of attempting to cover up scandal by proroguing parliament Read more Weeks later, the privy council office, which manages Canada’s federal bureaucracy and reports to the prime minister, opened an investigation, hiring an independent consulting firm. “Harassment has no place in any professional workplace,” a spokesperson for the privy council office said in a statement at the time. “It is a public service priority to advance efforts to more effectively prevent and resolve issues of harassment.” Payette, a former astronaut and scientist, also faced criticism after hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent renovating Rideau Hall, including installing a private staircase to ensure the governor general’s privacy. Acknowledging growing controversy, Trudeau defended Payette in September and dismissed speculation that he would ask her to step down. “We have an excellent governor general right now and I think, on top of the Covid crisis, nobody’s looking at any constitutional crises,” he said. “We have put in place a process to review some of the working conditions at Rideau Hall, but that’s not something that we’re contemplating right now, going further than that.” As part of its report, the firm spoke with dozens of current and former employees. The report was recently completed and sent to the privy council. Payette’s top staffer and close friend Assunta Di Lorenzo has also resigned following allegations that she, too, harassed employees. Citing the “problems” with Trudeau’s selection of Payette – and the political realities of a minority parliament – opposition leader, Erin O’Toole, called on Trudeau to meet with party leaders to discuss selecting the next governor general. “In the case of Ms Payette, there was clearly no due diligence. The prime minister didn’t determine if she was really appropriate for the job – and the result was a disaster,” said Dr Michael Jackson, president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada. “It’s been very disappointing … I would urge the prime minister to take a sober second thought. There’s no need to rush.” Even with speculation of an upcoming election – which requires the governor general to dissolve parliament – acting governor general Richard Wagner, chief justice of Canada’s supreme court, has the same powers. While the events have left Ottawa reeling, Jackson is hopeful Payette’s resignation will help Canadians better understand the role. “We often take it for granted, especially because we’ve had a string of good governor generals,” said Jackson. “But like democracy, it’s fragile. You want these institutions to be healthy.” Explore more on these topics Canada Americas Justin Trudeau Monarchy news Share Reuse this content",

Garneau’s new role will see him take over responsibility for handling Canada’s tense relations with China, and that will include working with the incoming Biden administration in the U.S. on key files, including the push to secure the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, arbitrarily detained by China for more than two years.

As it stands now, they need the support of one other federal party to remain in power. According to new polling done by Ipsos exclusively for Global News, the Liberal handling of the pandemic so far has them flirting with — but not yet firmly within — possible majority territory. That comes as Conservative support drops, particularly in the key electoral background of Ontario. The Ipsos numbers have the Liberals at 36 per cent support among decided voters nationally — up from 35 per cent in December — and the Conservatives dropping to 29 per cent support. Trending Now Gunmen open fire on tourists, killing over 20 people at Kashmir resort Advance voting over last 4 days shatters records, Elections Canada says Story continues below advertisement That’s a drop of three per cent for the official Opposition since last month. Much of the drop in support comes from declining prospects in Ontario and British Columbia. The Tories are down five points in both provinces, sitting at 29 per cent versus the Liberals’ 42 per cent in Ontario, while the NDP are at 21 per cent and the Greens at six per cent in the battleground province. Nationally, the NDP are at 19 per cent of decided voter support and the Greens are at eight per cent. Ontario’s significant number of federal ridings make it the key decider of which party will form power in federal elections, with the majority of those located in the Greater Toronto Area. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole represents the GTA riding of Durham and has billed himself as a strong contender in being able to help the party retake ridings in the region that it would need to unseat the Liberals and form a government of their own. The latest numbers suggest the party remains far from that goal, however. While the Conservatives continue to hold a commanding lead in Alberta over all other parties, their lead over the Liberals has narrowed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Story continues below advertisement The Conservatives currently hold 40 per cent of decided voter support in those provinces, compared to the Liberals at 34 per cent. That’s a drop from the 54 per cent support the Conservatives held there just last month — numbers that had the Liberals trailing far behind at 26 per cent of decided support. 0:32 Conservatives slip as Liberals maintain solid lead nationally: Ipsos poll Exclusive Global News Ipsos polls are protected by copyright.

(Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press) Social Sharing Conservative delegates at the party's policy convention have voted to reject adding green-friendly statements to the policy book — including a line that would have stated the party believes \"climate change is real\" and is \"willing to act.\" The Portneuf—Jacques—Cartier riding in Quebec, which proposed the policy change, also asked delegates to recognize that \"Canadian businesses classified as highly polluting need to take more responsibility\" and \"reduce their GHG emissions.\" The policy proposal also included a call to support \"innovation in green technologies\" so that Canada can become \"a world-class leader\" in an emerging industry. Delegates issued a rebuke to climate-minded Conservatives and rejected the policy shift by a margin of 54 per cent to 46. In fact, it was one of only four policy proposals or modifications on a list of 50 pitched by electoral riding associations (EDAs) that were voted down by the delegates. While delegates from each of the Atlantic provinces and Quebec embraced the \"climate change is real\" proposal — 70 per cent of delegates from New Brunswick and Quebec were onside with it — those from every other province and the territories voted against the change. In B.C., the \"no\" side had just a two-point edge, while the vote was much more lopsided in Saskatchewan (73 per cent against), the territories (69 per cent opposed), Alberta (62 per cent opposed) and Ontario (58 per cent opposed). A double majority of delegates — a majority of delegates overall and the majority of delegates in the majority of provinces — must agree to an official policy change. The clear rejection came hours after Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole urged party members to embrace change or risk losing again to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals in the next election. O'Toole said\u0000 if party members are serious about winning, they must embrace new ideas — even if they go against party orthodoxy. O'Toole told delegates the party \"cannot ignore the reality of climate change\" and that the debate \"is over.\" \"We must also recognize that Canadians expect us to have a real plan for the environment. We need to boldly reclaim the environment as an area where Conservatives are leaders,\" he said. O'Toole also said he doesn't want Conservative candidates to be branded as \"climate change deniers\" in the next election campaign. WATCH: Erin O'Toole delivers speech to the Conservative policy convention Erin O'Toole delivers speech to Conservative policy convention 4 years ago Duration 29:48 Opposition leader Erin O'Toole delivers speech to the 2021 Conservative policy convention. During a question-and-answer session with delegates today, O'Toole was asked about members rejecting calls for a more forceful approach to climate action. One delegate, Moshe Appel, said the failure to adopt the policy proposal could hurt the party's standing with voters. O'Toole said he won't be dissuaded from addressing the problem of climate change. \"Climate change is real. We will have a serious and comprehensive plan,\" he said. \"It's important to me as a father of young children, as a member of Parliament. Fighting climate change is important to the Conservative Party.\" O'Toole did, however, vow to scrap the national carbon tax — he said it's \"unfair for working families\" — while promising to make \"big emitters\" pay. The party's national campaign manager, Fred DeLorey, also tweeted that, despite the vote, \"the debate is over and we need a real plan that works, not Trudeau's carbon tax.\" While delegates rejected the \"climate change is real\" proposal, the \"policy document already has a section on climate change,\" DeLorey said. \"Akin to us needing to say 'water is wet.'\" (The policy book does state that \"in order to have a strong economy and maintain good health, Canada must have strong, coordinated and achievable environmental policies.\") Speaking to CBC News, Appel, a resident of Vancouver Island, said that while he's happy to hear O'Toole say he's serious about the environment, he's \"very frustrated\" and \"very disappointed\" with other members who wouldn't endorse a \"coherent policy.\" While he supports Canada's \"ethical oil\" and some natural resource development, Appel said he thinks the world must embrace the Paris climate accord and drive down emissions to avoid catastrophic consequences. \"People don't want to hear these conspiracy theories. They don't want to hear these problems with proven science, which is what climate change is,\" he said. \"It's definitely something we have to address.\" During the Q&A, O'Toole also faced a number of questions from delegates about how a government led by him would revitalize the oil and gas sector, which has been hurt by low commodity prices and constrained pipeline capacity for the last half-decade. Pro-pipeline supporters rally outside a public hearing of the Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources regarding Bill C-69 in 2019. Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said the Liberal government has \"mocked\" Western Canadians and passed divisive environmental legislation. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press) \"Our resource economy is the best in the world. We should be supporting it and exporting,\" he said. \"We need to get our resources to market.\" He said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has \"mocked\" resource workers while passing environmental legislation that has fuelled Western Canadian alienation. 'Buzzwords' There was a fierce debate over the proposed green policy shift during the policy convention Friday, with a clear split in the party ranks over how far the Conservatives should go. Some delegates embraced a shift in posture, saying they want Canada to adopt green technology while still supporting extractive industries like the oil and gas sector. Others called the proposal an unnecessary gesture to appease climate activists. \"I'm not sure why it's necessary for the Conservative Party to declare climate change is real,\" one delegate from Scarborough-Centre said. \"The way this section is worded befuddles the issue and may cost us some support. Conservatives need to lead with clarity, focus and intelligent solutions, not buzzwords.\" Conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention Another delegate, from Perth—Wellington in Ontario, said environmental policy should not be focused on driving down greenhouse gas emissions. \"It's not the only pollutant that we have to worry about,\" he said. \"I'm opposed to this amendment because it unfairly centres on greenhouse gas emissions.\" Justin Jones, a resident of northeastern B.C. who also spoke in favour of the resolution during the debate, said many in the party are concerned about climate change — and this vote will only solidify the impression that all Conservatives are climate skeptics. \"I think one of the biggest misconceptions out there is that the Conservatives don't care about the environment. I'm 30 years old, I have kids, I want the world to continue to be prosperous and the environment to not be affected,\" he told CBC News — adding he supports Canadian oil and gas projects, which he said adhere to high environmental standards. \"I think the wording in that policy addition just caused a big misunderstanding. It wasn't the greatest. It's already evident that the party does recognize climate change.\" But he conceded the resolution vote may haunt O'Toole as he tries to shift the Conservative message on climate change. \"I believe it's going to be a real issue any time Erin is going to speak in support of protecting our environment,\" Jones said. \"He's got a battle ahead of him because, maybe, some misinterpreted or the words were taken out of context. The media focuses on the issues we're divided on.\" Delegates also reject medical assistance in dying Delegates also rejected a modification to the policy book that would have changed the party's stance on medical assistance in dying — swapping the statement that the party would not support any legislation that would \"legalize euthanasia or assisted suicide\" for one that says it would oppose \"the extension of euthanasia and assisted suicide\" to minors and people living with \"psychological suffering.\" By a 55-45 vote, delegates voted to keep the status quo. This policy modification may have been rejected because delegates also voted for a similarly worded resolution that reaffirms the party \"opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide\" and will stand against any expansions of the current law. The federal government recently extended access to medical assistance in dying with Bill C-7 . Delegates also voted down proposals that would have scrubbed a Conservative policy position backing a national missing persons' registry. They also voted to maintain their stance on section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Erin O'Toole says Conservatives must change or risk losing again to Trudeau That section — which is no longer in force, having been repealed by a Conservative private member's bill in 2014 — prohibited online communications which were \"likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt\" on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, such as race, national or ethic origin, colour or religion. Complainants could bring their cases to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This section of the act was loathed by free speech advocates, who said it went too far in policing online content. Walied Soliman — O'Toole's fundraising director in the leadership race and chair of Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the country's largest law firms — said Saturday the party needs to grow its base and \"speak to more Canadians\" if it wants to win the next election. He said the membership needs to hear O'Toole's call for renewal. Soliman said the party can only win if it recaptures crucial battleground ridings like those in the suburbs around Toronto — and O'Toole's call for a policy shift will help in that effort. \"That doesn't mean we dilute who we are — we should never do that,\" he said. \"Our membership has to listen to Erin's speech over and over again and realize we have to grow this tent.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR John Paul Tasker Senior reporter J.P.

(Nationalist.ca) Social Sharing The RCMP have charged the leader of the Canadian Nationalist Party after he posted an allegedly anti-Semitic video on YouTube. Travis Patron, 29, of Redvers, Sask., has been charged with wilful promotion of hate in connection with a video titled Beware the Parasitic Tribe. The video refers to \"inside manipulators\" who infiltrate the media and the central bank. The RCMP began investigating after the video was flagged by the Canadian Anti-Hate Network in June 2019. Since then, police have received four additional reports of new videos and flyers issued by Patron. Police are still investigating those reports. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center had raised alarms about Patron's videos, stating that the language he was using was dangerous and hateful. \"He's promoting some of the most vile and dangerous anti-Semitic tropes in history,\" said Jaime Kirzner-Roberts, director of policy with the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center. Kirzner-Roberts said Patron \"refers to Jews as parasites. He accuses Jews of being invaders, of controlling the media, the banking system.\" Human rights group files hate-speech complaint against Canadian Nationalist Party leader Canadian Nationalist Party Leader Travis Patron charged after 2 women attacked in Regina \"He has called for the removal of Jews from Canada. This is ethnic cleansing he is calling for, it's a crime against humanity,\" she said. \"We are pleased the RCMP have finally decided to lay charges against Mr. Patron.\" Kirzner-Roberts said she hopes the charges will send a message. \"If you promote hatred or genocide against Jews or any other people in our country, you will face justice.\" She said there is \"unparalleled growth of anti-Semitic hate online\" and that there is evidence of \"escalating numbers of hate crimes being committed against the Jewish community.\" Patron appears in court via phone Patron was arrested by the RCMP on Monday and made his first court appearance on Tuesday via telephone at the provincial court in Weyburn, Sask. He appeared in a Regina court on Wednesday afternoon, also via telephone. His next court appearance will be on April 14 in the town of Carlyle, Sask. Patron posed a question to Provincial Court Judge James Rybchuk on Wednesday. \"I am respectfully asking if charges have been formally laid and if so under what authority. Your administration does not have the authority to proceed on these matters,\" Patron told the court. \"I feel otherwise,\" Rybchuk said. Evan Balgord is executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, which filed the complaint against Patron in 2019. He says the charges should have been laid sooner. Taking '601 days to lay charges for this offence ... is far too many,' he says. (Skype) The executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, Evan Balgord, said the charges should have come sooner. Taking \"601 days to lay charges for this offence ... is far too many,\" he said. \"We have rang the bell at every level. It is past time he's charged.\" Balgord's group filed the criminal complaint against Patron. He alleged that since then, Patron has continued to promote hate. \"It's about time he's rotting in a jail cell.\" Criminal charges don't affect party's status Patron founded the Canadian Nationalist Party in 2017, and it became an officially registered party in 2019. A spokesperson for Elections Canada said a party's status is not affected if its leader is charged or convicted of a crime. However, a person who is incarcerated cannot run for office. Balgord called it the first \"Neo-Nazi party\" in Canada since the 1930s and said being a registered party gives Patron access to donations and voter information. \"It means that, in part, federal public funds were going to support his party as part of a contribution rebate program. It also means Elections Canada handed him a copy of the voters' list, which means Travis Patron had access to the name, address and date of birth of every Canadian.\" The president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) commended the RCMP for \"responding to Travis Patron's use of social media to promote hate against Jewish Canadians.\" Far-right group accused of white nationalism closer to party status — and increased scrutiny \"Patron's lengthy rant about 'swindlers,' 'snakes' and 'inside manipulators' — as well as a subsequent reference to Jews and 'the synagogue of Satan' — make his anti-Semitic agenda crystal clear,\" Shimon Koffler Fogel said. Fogel said the CIJA and others reached out to Saskatchewan's justice minister last July \"urging him\" to provide the required consent for Patron's prosecution. Meanwhile, Patron is facing a separate charge of assault causing bodily harm . He is scheduled to appear in court in Regina next month. And on Feb. 9, Patron lost an appeal against the City of Saskatoon. He argued that he should be able to represent the Canadian Nationalist Party in court. The party now owes the city $1,500.

(Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick) Social Sharing Canada's national statistics agency says it's ready to conduct the 2021 census next month despite concerns about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the coming months. Census director general Geoff Bowlby told CBC News the fact that several provinces are tightening public health restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 case numbers won't change Statistics Canada's approach. \"We planned for this reality. We planned right from the start to operate within the confines of a pandemic ... before vaccinations were widespread and before the pandemic has turned the corner,\" said Bowlby. \"That's why we have the safe protocols in place — no visits inside the house, masks, limiting the number of visits at the door by making greater use of the internet, by making greater use of ... telephone calls.\" The agency says it has a plan in place for a \"contactless\" census to protect the health and safety of both census staff and those participating. All staff collecting census information in person are expected to follow the relevant public health guidance by observing physical distancing, staying outdoors and using personal protective equipment. Census Day is May 11 Starting May 3, Canadians will receive documents in the mail from Statistics Canada containing instructions on how to fill out the long-form and short-form questionnaires. The agency said it expects nine out of 10 households to complete the census online or by phone — the same percentage as in 2016. The remaining 10 per cent will be contacted by phone first to remind them to fill out the forms. Those who fail to complete the survey after being contacted by phone might receive an in-person visit from a census enumerator beginning in late May or June. That enumerator will be under strict instructions to wear a mask, stay two metres distant and only conduct interviews outside. \"Our health and safety folks working with public health authorities say that that is still the safe way to go,\" said Bowlby. The census collects demographic information on the Canadian population. The data are then used by governments, businesses, associations, community organizations and others for research and to make evidence-based decisions at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. Census day is May 11 this year. A winter ice road in 2015 near Shoal Lake, Manitoba. Statistics Canada says it's going to be sending more census enumerators than ever to survey people in Indigenous communities in Northern Canada. (John Woods/The Canadian Press) Statistics Canada has hired 900 supervisors already and plans to bring in roughly 31,000 field staffers to go door-to-door. The agency said it will hire a record number of local enumerators to survey people in Indigenous communities in Northern Canada. Concerns about low response rate Bowlby said he worries the unique circumstances of the pandemic might lead to a low response rate. He said the goal is to match the 2016 response rate of 98.3 per cent, and that anything less than 98 per cent could compromise the quality of the data. \"We have ways to make up for that as we process the data … But there's a limit to those techniques and we need to make sure that those data are high quality,\" said Bowlby. \"The census data are so important to be used for important financial transfers between the federal government and the provincial and territorial governments. They are being used now for the vaccination campaigns, so that we know where to send vaccines and how we can track the success of the vaccination program.\" StatsCan plans 'contactless' census for 2021 in response to COVID-19 Statistics Canada celebrates 'best census since 1666' For the first time, this year's census includes questions to count transgender Canadians, veterans, active military personnel, people who have minority language rights, Inuit enrolled in land claims and members of Métis groups. It also includes new questions aimed at learning how people commute to work using public transportation and why Canadians work part-time or seasonally. Bowlby said some of the data collected this year will give an indication of how the pandemic has reshaped society and transformed individual behaviour. \"All of this information will really provide a really rich portrait of Canada when we release it in February of 2022, when the first estimates of the census come out,\" said Bowlby. \"There's going to be more data available for Canadians than ever before.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error Related Stories StatsCan plans 'contactless' census for 2021 in response to COVID-19 StatsCan undertakes hiring spree ahead of 'contact-free' census Statistics Canada celebrates 'best census since 1666' Statistics Canada loses, mishandles hundreds of sensitive census, employment files StatsCan planning to ask gender questions in 'pilot' census — and answering is mandatory Add some “good” to your morning and evening.

Simon Jolin-Barrette, the minister responsible for the French language, tabled his proposed legislation that casts a wide net Thursday morning at the provincial legislature in Quebec City. Bill 96 aims to “reinforce” French as the “common language” in the Quebec nation, he said. It also seeks to change the Canadian Constitution to ensure that French is recognized as the only official language of the province. “The French language unifies us,” Jolin-Barrette said. READ MORE: Quebec municipalities concerned over potential loss of bilingual status The proposed legislation entails changing parts of the landmark Charter of the French language known as Bill 101 , which was first adopted in 1977 by the René Lévesque government. It overhauled the linguistic makeup of the province, though it has been widely hailed and criticized for more than 40 years. Story continues below advertisement The wide-ranging proposed measures are “diverse,” said Jolin-Barrette. The bill contains more than 200 articles that touch on the use of French in the workplace, tighten access to English CEGEPs and expanding access to language classes. Bill 96 seeks to apply the provisions of the French language charter to small businesses, between 25 to 49 people. The revamp also includes the creation and appointment of a French language commissioner to oversee the situation in the province. It also seeks to grant new powers to the French-language watchdog, and set new language rules for professional orders.

The potential loss of that status had already prompted concerns from certain towns and cities . The Association of Suburban municiapalites (ASM), bringing together 15 mayors of cities within the agglomeration of Montreal, said Thursday it welcomes certain provisions of the bill, namely the mechanism by which they can maintain bilingual status. Of the 15 cities represented by the association, 13 have a bilingual status. The group said, however, it will have to study the bill further to understand its impact on other issues such as the language of communication with businesses. Story continues below advertisement “As everyone knows, in legal matters, the devil is in the details,” said Beny Masella, ASM president and the mayor of Montreal West. The groups is hoping to be allowed to take part in planned consultations in order “to help achieve the desired balance in respecting the rights of all our citizens.” READ MORE: Quebec government plans to table expanded French language law next year Bill 96 comes as the François Legault government has recently cited concerns over the decline of French in Quebec, particularly in Montreal. Legault described the proposed legislation as reasonable and necessary. As someone who grew up in Montreal’s West Island, the premier says he understands how fragile the status of French is in the province and there is an urgency to act. “My priority is to protect the French language,” he said. The new bill also points to the use of the notwithstanding clause also known as the override clause or Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and is part of the Canadian Constitution.

There is mounting evidence that the third wave of COVID-19 incidence is declining, yet variants of concern (VOCs) continue to present public health challenges in Canada. The emergence of VOCs has sparked debate on how to effectively control their impacts on the Canadian population. Provincial and territorial governments have implemented a wide range of policy measures to protect residents against community transmission of COVID-19, but research examining the specific impact of policy countermeasures on the VOCs in Canada is needed. Our study objective was to identify provinces with disproportionate prevalence of VOCs relative to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in provinces and territories in Canada. We analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors, summarized in 3 measures: (1) strength of public health countermeasures (stringency index), (2) the extent to which people moved about outside their homes (mobility index), and (3) the proportion of the provincial or territorial population that was fully vaccinated (vaccine uptake). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index, and full vaccine uptake. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the prevalence of VOCs (Alpha, or B.1.1.7; Beta, or B.1.351; Gamma, or P.1; and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) across the clusters. We identified 3 clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures. Cluster 1 consisted of the 3 Canadian territories and was characterized by a higher degree of vaccine deployment and fewer countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and the Atlantic region) was typified by lower levels of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster, which consisted of provinces in the Pacific region, Central Canada, and the Prairies, exhibited moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures. The overall and variant-specific prevalences were significantly different across the clusters. This “up to the point” analysis found that implementation of COVID-19 public health measures, including the mass vaccination of populations, is key to controlling VOC prevalence rates in Canada. As of June 15, 2021, the third wave of COVID-19 in Canada is declining, and those provinces and territories that had implemented more comprehensive public health measures showed lower VOC prevalence. Public health authorities and governments need to continue to communicate the importance of sociobehavioural preventive measures, even as populations in Canada continue to receive their primary and booster doses of vaccines. Keywords: COVID-19, variants of concern, stringency index, mobility index, vaccination coverage, machine learning, Canada The devastating impacts of COVID-19 cannot be overemphasized. With an estimated 423 million cases and 6 million deaths (as of February 21, 2022) worldwide [ 1 ], the pandemic is one of the worst in human history. In Canada alone, about 3.2 million people, representing 8.4% of residents, have been infected with COVID-19 [ 2 ]. Canada’s case fatality rate for COVID-19 is 1.1% (ie, 36,000 deaths) [ 2 ]. At the time our analyses were performed (June 15, 2021, when the third wave was waning), there were 3 forces in “tension”: vaccine uptake, newly emerging variants of COVID-19, and calls to “re-open the economy.” Since then, the emergence and spread of additional variants of concern (VOCs) and the expansion of vaccination campaigns have changed the complexion of the pandemic. Variants, as expected, have added complexity to the nature of COVID-19. At the same time, following a slow start to vaccination rollouts, vaccine uptake has been increasing in Canada, and many provinces and territories, who are largely responsible for vaccination and public health policy in Canada’s decentralized federation, have become eager to relax public health countermeasures. However, public health experts remain uneasy about variant-led surges and outbreaks and are calling for the reapplication of some measures. As of February 21, 2022, 5 phylogenetic VOCs declared by the World Health Organization are being tracked in Canada. The Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants, first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, India, and South Africa, respectively, are spreading in Canada and the rest of the world [ 3 ]. Canada confirmed its first cases of the Alpha variant in a couple from Toronto who had contact with a traveler from the United Kingdom on December 26, 2020 [ 3 ]. The Beta variant was first reported in Alberta on January 8, 2021 [ 3 ]. The Gamma variant was first confirmed in Ontario in an international traveler from Brazil on February 8, 2021 [ 3 ]. On April 4, 2021, the Delta variant was first reported in British Columbia [ 3 ]. The latest variant (Omicron) was first detected in Ontario from 2 travelers from Nigeria on November 28, 2021 [ 3 ]. Although much still remains to be learned about the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and sequalae of these 5 VOCs, using the data available at the time of analysis, we sought to understand the spread of VOCs in Canada and how they might be held in check by vaccine uptake and public health countermeasures. Although lab-based research and modeling have shown the need to combine public health countermeasures with vaccination to achieve epidemic control [ 4 , 5 ], there has been a paucity of population-level studies to assess the effects of nonpharmaceutical public health measures on VOCs. In a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission in New York City, public countermeasures such as mask wearing and social distancing were shown to have immediate impact on the epidemic [ 5 ]. The synergistic effects of vaccination and public countermeasures in reducing new COVID-19 cases cannot be overemphasized [ 5 ]. Alpha and Delta variants are more transmissible than the initial strains of the virus, but the Gamma, Beta, and Delta variants hugely impact vaccine effectiveness. A major concern is the continuous genetic evolution of the virus, which complicates reopening plans across Canada. Although studies are underway to determine the degree of virulence of Omicron variants, it is believed that a subvariant known as BA.2 is more contagious than its predecessor, BA.1, and currently dominating in Canada [ 6 ]. This “up to the point” analysis of VOCs in Canada (ie, during the downward trajectory of the third wave) examines (1) clustering patterns of COVID-19 mitigation efforts and (2) cluster differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 VOCs in Canada. In doing so, it aimed to provide insights into the differences in the subnational responses to inform ongoing policy and public health interventions at the provincial and territorial levels of government. This analysis centered on publicly available data with no identifiable information about the people studied. Therefore, research ethics board approval was not required for this study. We analyzed provincial- and territorial-level data on COVID-19 VOCs in Canada along with data on COVID-19 mitigating strategies from publicly available data sources. Our outcome variable—prevalence of VOCs by type and total—was estimated as the proportion of cases with VOC per 1 million population as of June 15, 2021. The cumulative number of VOC cases for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants was extracted from a COVID-19 VOC tracker in Canada [ 7 ]. Populations at risk were predefined as the first quarter, 2021, provincial population estimates obtained from Statistics Canada [ 8 ]. Our independent variables—vaccine uptake (the percentage of each provincial or territorial population fully vaccinated against COVID-19), policy response (stringency index—see the following paragraphs for more details), and behavioral changes (mobility index) were mapped with the VOC prevalence outcome. These mitigating factors were selected based on growing evidence that uptake of primary series of vaccination (2 doses) [ 9 - 15 ], reduction in human mobility [ 16 - 18 ], and social distancing policies [ 19 , 20 ] are effective in curtailing community transmission of COVID-19. During the study period, 3 COVID-19 vaccines (ie, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) were authorized and in use in vaccination campaigns in Canada. Full vaccination coverage rates were retrieved from the COVID-19 Tracker Canada [ 21 ]. As opposed to first dose (ie, partial immunization) rates, full vaccination (2 doses) rates were analyzed in this study because complete vaccination is widely believed to offer greater protection than partial vaccination in slowing down COVID-19 transmission, hospitalizations, disease sequalae, and fatalities [ 22 ]. The stringency index is a composite score generated by the researchers at the University of Oxford to document how the governments’ coronavirus responses are changing around the world and over time. The metric is an additive score of 9 indicators (ie, school and workplace closures, restrictions on public transport, cancellation of public events and gatherings, stay-at-home policies, travel restrictions, public information campaigns, testing policies, contact tracing, and masking), measured on an ordinal scale, and rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. The lowest possible score is 0 (mildest), and the highest score is 100 (strictest). The policy index was publicly available at the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) website [ 23 ]. The constituent variables used in generating the stringency index are summarized in Multimedia Appendix 1 . It should be noted that the stringency index is not a measure of effectiveness of government policies in response to COVID-19 but rather a measure of the degree to which and the comprehensiveness of governmental response. To account for the changing patterns of COVID-19 containment policies, average stringency indices for the period of January 1, 2021, to June 15, 2021 were reported. To assess individuals’ compliance with government stringency measures (especially reduction in human movement to slow the spread of the virus), we obtained mobility reports from Google LLC [ 24 ]. Recent infodemiological and infoveillance studies [ 25 - 29 ] have utilized mobility reports from Google [ 24 ] to observe changes in the movement of people to places designed as high risk based on relative frequency, time, and duration of visits during the pandemic. The technical details of data aggregation and anonymization procedures have been fully described by Aktay et al [ 30 ]. Through Google Map’s location history feature, daily anonymized data on people’s movement to places such as retail and recreation, grocery stores and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas were collected from smartphones and compared to the baseline 5-week prepandemic period (January 3, 2020, to February 6, 2020). Due to privacy issues, Google could not provide information on the inter- or intraprovincial and territorial movement [ 30 ]. Also, in a bid to ensure additional privacy protections, a metric for a given place is discarded when the counts of the opted-in Google users are less than 100 people or the geographical area is less than 30 km 2 [ 30 ]. As deemed useful by public health researchers to make critical decisions about COVID-19, the Google community mobility reports help provide insights into how busy certain places are and, thus, the extent to which individuals are engaging in social distancing [ 30 ]. To determine mobility patterns across the provinces and territories, we estimated the average number of visits to each category of place (eg, park or workplace) between January 1, 2021, and June 15, 2021. The average of the mobility patterns across the entire study period was estimated to account for changes in movement due to weather and holidays, as well as any within-province variations of public health countermeasures. Using the first component of principal component analysis (PCA), the dimensions of the 6 variables that measured changes in movement of people relative to the pre-COVID era were reduced with the singular value decomposition method and z-score transformation (ie, mean of 0 and variance of 1). The first component (interpreted as the mobility index) explained 60% of the total variance, and its eigenvalue was 3.60. The first component had positive loadings on residential areas (0.47) and parks (0.36), but negative loadings on workplace (–0.5), transit stations (–0.49), grocery stores (–0.11), and retail or recreational centers (–0.39). For each variable, a positive loading suggests a higher mobility index, and negative loading indicates a lower mobility index. Descriptive statistics were generated. We conducted a spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning) to detect clusters of spatial (dis)similarities in COVID-19 mitigating factors in GeoDa version 1.18 software [ 31 ]. Furthermore, we determined differences in prevalence of VOCs across the clusters. A symmetrical distance-based weight matrix with an optimal arc distance of 7000 km was generated. After many calibrations, single-linkage clustering with an Euclidean distance function and geometric centroid weight of 1 was considered appropriate and used. A spatial hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the mitigating factors (ie, vaccine uptake, public health countermeasures, and mobility). With the single linkage, intercluster distance was determined by the closest distance between the observations (ie, closest neighbor clustering). The first step was to transform the independent variables using z-score standardization since they were in different scales. Z-score standardization is an important preprocessing step for a machine learning algorithm, which involves rescaling the features to have a normal distribution. Data standardization before PCA has been shown to outperform an unscaled data set [ 32 ]. In an attempt to select the number of clusters that provided the best fit (distinct clustering), we used a stopping rule—the Duda-Hart index. We selected groups with the highest Duda-Hart index (0.6) and lowest pseudo T-squared (4.4). The stopping rule corresponds to the 3 clusters reported. The Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-population rank test was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of VOCs among the clusters using Stata version 17.0 software [ 33 ]. A rank-based nonparametric test was used because the sample size is small (ie, 11 provinces and territories). Post hoc pairwise (posteriori) comparisons of the clusters were performed with the Dunn test; false detection rates were minimized by using Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. The statistical significance was set at 2-sided P <.05. To visualize the relationships between the prevalence of VOCs, vaccine uptake, and countermeasures, bivariate choropleth maps were generated in QGIS version 3.12.1 software [ 34 ]. The bivariate maps were based on a quantile classification (ie, tertile); see Figures 1 - 3 . As shown, the 3x3 2D color palette density becomes progressively darker as it moves from lower to higher tertiles and highlights the differences in relative position of features. The tertile classification is based on the sample distribution. We report the observed value ranges for each tertile classification.  Association between variants of concern and 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Canada as of June 15, 2021.  Association between variants of concern and mobility index in Canada as of June 15, 2021. Table 1 shows the distribution of COVID-19 VOCs in Canada. As of June 15, 2021, when our analysis was performed, 4 VOCs (Alpha, B.1.1.7; Beta, B.1.351; Gamma, P.1; and Delta, B.1.617.2) had been identified, for a prevalence of 6157.5 per 1 million population and 16.7% of all cases. Nova Scotia reported the lowest, at 89.9 per 1 million population, to Alberta the highest, at 10,848.1 per 1 million population. At 91.4% of all VOCs, the Alpha variant was the predominant strain in Canada. The Gamma variant accounted for 6.5%, Beta variant for 0.8%, and Delta variant for 0.8% of the mutant strains. Although Alberta and Ontario had a higher prevalence of the Alpha variant, lower prevalence of this strain was observed in Yukon and Nova Scotia. The prevalence of the Beta variant was highest in Ontario, followed by Quebec. The Gamma and Delta variants were more common in British Columbia and Alberta. Geographic-specific distribution of COVID-19 variants of concern in Canada, June 15, 2021 (per 1,000,000 population). Compared with the baseline (January 3, 2020-February 6, 2020), mobility related to home or residential areas increased by 12.7% between January 1, 2021, and June 15, 2021, among Canadians. On average, movement of people to parks and outdoor spaces increased by 38.8%; however, in Prince Edward Island, it decreased (average trend=–45%). Overall, mobility related to visits to grocery or pharmacy stores decreased by 4.6% across Canada but increased in Nova Scotia (by 2.6%), British Columbia (2.5%), and Saskatchewan (1.9%). Across Canada, movement related to public transport stations decreased by 56.5%, retail and recreational centers by 29.4%, and workplaces by 31.3%. The average national stringency index for COVID-19 was 73.6% (lowest in Yukon at 47.2% and highest in Ontario at 90.7%). The Canadian population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 was 13.8% (lowest in Newfoundland and Labrador at 5.7% and highest in Yukon at 61.6%). Cluster analysis with the single-linkage method identified 3 cluster profiles of VOC prevalence, vaccine uptake, public health countermeasures, and mobility among Canadian provinces or territories (see Table 2 ). The clusters were significantly different from one another in their average prevalence of COVID-19 variant cases and variant-specific prevalence, vaccine uptake, and public health countermeasures (see Table 2 ). Multimedia Appendix 2 shows the frequency distribution of the variables after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for post hoc pairwise comparisons. Characteristics of clusters from spatial hierarchical clustering analysis of mitigating factors. a YT: Yukon. b NT: Northwest Territories. c NU: Nunavut. d NB: New Brunswick. e NL: Newfoundland and Labrador. f NS: Nova Scotia. g PE: Prince Edward Island. h QC: Quebec. i AB: Alberta. j BC: British Columbia. k MB: Manitoba. l ON: Ontario. m SK: Saskatchewan. n Intercluster differences assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test. o Analyses of the differences in vaccine coverage, stringency index, and mobility index across the clusters were not conducted because they contributed to the cluster analysis. Probabilistic assessment of the differences of these 3 variables across the clusters, therefore, was inappropriate. Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut—the first cluster—had a moderate prevalence of VOCs, high vaccine uptake (fully vaccinated), and low countermeasures. The 4 Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec—the second cluster—had a low prevalence of VOCs, low vaccine uptake (fully vaccinated), moderate mobility, and moderate countermeasures. The 4 western provinces, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, along with Ontario—the third cluster—showed a high prevalence of VOCs, moderate vaccine uptake, high mobility, and high countermeasures. Compared with the other clusters, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon were characterized by a moderate prevalence of aggregated VOCs and the Alpha variant (533 per 1 million population) and the Gamma variant (22 per 1 million population). It is important to note that the Beta and Delta variants had not been identified in the 3 territories of cluster 1. In addition, cluster 1 had the highest proportion of Canadians who had received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines (58.5%), lowest mobility index (–2.1), and lowest stringency index (58.5%). Compared with the other clusters, cluster 2 was characterized by the lowest prevalence of aggregated VOCs (237 per 1 million population), the Alpha variant (230 per 1 million population), and the Gamma variant (1 per 1 million population). However, it had relatively moderate levels of the Beta (12 per 1 million population) and Delta (2 per 1 million population) variants. In addition, cluster 2 had the lowest full vaccination coverage rates (10.5%), a moderate mobility index (0.4), and a moderate stringency index (68.6%). Compared with the other clusters, cluster 3 had the highest prevalence of VOCs (5461 per 1 million population) and variant-specific prevalences—Alpha (5200 per 1 million population), Beta (33 per 1 million population), Gamma (280 per 1 million population), and Delta (73 per 1 million population). Also, cluster 3 had moderate fully vaccinated coverage rates (15.9%), the highest mobility index (1.3), and the highest stringency index (71.6%). Figure 1 shows the distribution of VOCs and the proportion of Canadians who received the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine by province. Provinces shown in the darkest color (towards the top right in the legend in map) have relatively high VOC prevalences and high vaccination rates; those in the lightest color (bottom left) have low VOC prevalences and low vaccination rates. Of all provinces and territories, Alberta was classified as having a marginally higher vaccine rate and high VOC prevalence: 18.9% of people fully vaccinated and VOC prevalence of 10,848 per 1 million population. Ontario (9919 per 1 million population), Saskatchewan (5461 per 1 million population), and Manitoba (4598 per 1 million population) had the high prevalences of VOCs and relatively moderate vaccine uptake rates (Ontario: 13.8%; Manitoba: 15.9%; and Saskatchewan: 18%). At the opposite end, meaning low VOC prevalences and low vaccine rates, the Atlantic provinces with low VOC prevalences and low vaccine rates were Nova Scotia (VOC prevalence of 90 per 1 million population and 5.6% vaccine rate), Prince Edward Island (175 per 1 million population and 10.9%), New Brunswick (237 per 1 million population and 10.5%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (374 per 1 million population and 5.7%). Québec and British Columbia had moderate VOC prevalences and vaccine uptake rates (Quebec, VOC prevalence of 900 per 1 million population and vaccine rate of 11.9%, and British Columbia, VOC prevalence of 3626 per 1 million population and vaccine rate of 12.8%). Yukon had a low prevalence of VOCs (190 per 1 million population) and high vaccine rate (41.6%), followed by the Northwest Territories (1706 per 1 million population and 58.53%) and Nunavut (533 per 1 million population and 40.4%). Figure 2 shows the relationship between the prevalence of VOCs and government stringency measures to curb COVID-19. The provinces of Ontario and Manitoba showed higher prevalences of VOCs (9919 and 4598 per 1 million population, respectively) and high scores on the stringency index—Ontario: 90.7% and Manitoba: 75.9%. Saskatchewan recorded a higher prevalence of VOCs (5461 per 1 million population) and lower stringency (57.9%). Alberta had a high prevalence of VOCs (10,848 per 1 million population) and moderate stringency (68.5%).  Association between variants of concerns and stringency measures in Canada as of June 15, 2021. The province of Quebec had a moderate level of VOC prevalence (900 per 1 million population) with high stringency (73.2%). British Columbia and Northwest Territories had moderate prevalences of VOCs (3626 per 1 million population and 1706 per 1 million population, respectively) and moderate levels of stringency—British Columbia: 64.8% and Northwest Territories: 64.8%. At the low end of VOC prevalence, Yukon, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick had lower stringency—Yukon: 47.2%; Prince Edward Island: 58.3%; and New Brunswick: 58.3%. Nova Scotia reported a lower prevalence of VOCs (90 per 1 million population) and relatively higher stringency (81.5%), and Newfoundland and Labrador had a lower prevalence of VOCs, at 374 per 1 million population, and moderate stringency, at 71.8%. Figure 3 presents the association between the prevalence of VOCs and changes in movement of people in relation to the beginning of the pandemic (mobility index). Among the provinces reporting higher VOC prevalences, populations in Ontario and Alberta showed higher mobility indices—Ontario: 3.0 and Alberta: 1.3. In this higher-prevalence VOC group, Manitoba and Saskatchewan populations had moderate mobility indices—1.2 and 0.2, respectively. Among the provinces and territories reporting moderate VOC prevalences, Quebec and British Columbia recorded higher mobility indices—Quebec: 2.1 and British Columbia: 1.3—while Northwest Territories (–1.0) and Nunavut (–3.2) had lower mobility indices. Two of the 4 Atlantic provinces, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon recorded low VOC prevalences and low mobility indices—Prince Edward Island at –2.7, Newfoundland and Labrador at –1.0, and Yukon at –2.1. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick recorded low prevalences of VOCs and moderate mobility, at 0.7 and 0.4, respectively. This study shows markedly elevated prevalence of COVID-19 VOCs in Canada and wide geographical variation across the provinces and territories. We observed that the provinces in cluster 3—the Pacific region, Central Canada, and the Prairie provinces—were hot spots of VOCs as determined by the highest cluster-level prevalence of aggregated and variant-specific VOCs. We also observed that there was “north-south” disparity between the territories and the provinces in the prevalence of variant-specific VOCs, vaccine coverage, and public health countermeasures. As with most COVID-19 research, this study sought to understand the disease as it is unfolding: specifically, COVID-19 VOCs in Canadian provinces and territories. By June 15, 2021, the daily new case rates in all Canadian provinces and territories were declining, indicating the resolution phase of the third wave of the epidemic curve. Many provinces set in motion plans to relax public health countermeasures, relying on vaccination rates as the criterion for reopening. At the same time, however, there was since-validated concern that the VOCs, in particular the Delta variant, could trigger widespread outbreaks, especially among the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Across Canadian provinces and territories, we have shown a pattern of VOC spread, vaccine uptake (both doses), and policy countermeasures that can be profiled in 3 clusters. The first cluster, comprising all 3 Canadian territories, is characterized by moderate VOC prevalence, higher degree of vaccine uptake, and lesser degree of governmental countermeasures. The second cluster, comprising the Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, along with the province of Quebec, is characterized by low VOC prevalence, low vaccine uptake, and moderate stringency of countermeasures. The third cluster, comprising Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, is characterized by high prevalence of VOCs, moderate vaccine uptake, and more stringent countermeasures. Strikingly, intercluster disparity in the prevalence of VOCs is more evident for cluster 3, making the provinces in that group VOC hot spots. As governments across Canada continue to enact plans for easing public health countermeasures, there is concern that provinces and territories need to have much higher rates of vaccination with both primary and booster doses. Although per capita case rates are declining across Canada, there has been a recent increase in the highly transmissible VOCs, Delta and Omicron, in provinces [ 35 , 36 ]. These recent regional outbreaks were seen mostly among unvaccinated people [ 37 ]. As Canadian health officials strive to get as many people vaccinated within the shortest time possible, policy countermeasures may need to be further calibrated depending on the local spread of VOCs and vaccine hesitancy and refusals [ 38 , 39 ]. There have been several alarms raised that the B.A2 subtype of Omicron variant could become dominant if an insufficient proportion of the population did not complete the full COVID-19 primary vaccination regimen and receive booster doses [ 13 ]. In a past study conducted in Scotland, the first dose was shown not to confer complete immunity against the emerging variants versus the Alpha variant; however, full vaccination (2 doses) combined with booster shots improves immune effectiveness [ 38 ]. Our present study confirms that, in the postvaccine period in Canada (ie, December 2020), vaccination coverage rates are uneven across the country. At least three strains of VOC with different transmission risks and responses to COVID-19 vaccines were concomitantly identified in more than half of the provinces. Like in the United States [ 15 ], in the first quarter of 2021, the dominant variant in Canada was the Alpha variant. According to Davies et al [ 14 ], the Alpha variant had a high reproductive number (43%-90%). However, a more worrying observation during the study period was the identification of 2 highly virulent variants (Beta and Delta) in 77% of the provinces. Due to the key mutations at E484K and K417N receptor-binding sites of the spike proteins for Beta [ 10 - 13 ] and L452R receptors for Delta [ 40 ], both variants are capable of escaping recognition by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), thus evading both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Also, T478K is not well recognized as responsible for immune evasion for Delta variants and may, like N501Y, be more relevant for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding; however, additional mutations at K417N have been reported for the Delta variant [ 41 ]. Given the relatively high prevalence of the Gamma variant in some provinces or territories (ie, British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Yukon), the Gamma variant also evades the immune system (but less so than the Beta variant) through a significant change in an nAb epitope (E484K and K417T). This observation has far-reaching consequences on health outcomes and prolongation of the epidemic due to new infections. Considering the high prevalence of Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants in some provinces (ie, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), stakeholders should continue to emphasize 2-dose vaccine uptake combined with booster shots and maintenance of public health countermeasures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Although the structural and operational barriers to vaccination (eg, vaccine stock shortages, long wait times, and vaccine refusal or hesitancy) need to be tackled, people must be adequately sensitized to complete the second and booster doses to offer full population protection against the VOCs (especially Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron), thereby reducing future risk of new variants. The discordance between VOC prevalence and stringency measures warrants cautious interpretation. Our analysis could not show whether the relaxation of countermeasures in the territories of Canada was informed by declining COVID-19 cases and progressive vaccine rollout, or vice versa. This inverse relationship, which is quite possible, means the timing of implementation of polices in relation to the changing epidemiological contexts of the pandemic is important. The degree of social compliance with government stringency measures might also depend on seasonality effects. Stringency measures may reduce COVID-19 incidence not only directly, for example, by reducing mobility, exposure, and public circulation but also indirectly through weather on mobility patterns [ 18 , 42 ]. Although we attempted to reduce the effect of weather by taking the average of mobility indices from January 2021 to June 2021, there might be some residual effects because of the varying daily temperatures across the provinces and territories. In our study, we observed low mobility index and stringency index in the territories, in contrast to the provinces. At the time of conducting this study, no comprehensive time series data were easily available for Canada. Further investigation with time series will shed more light on the observed phenomenon. However, we could establish that successful immunization campaigns and reducing human mobility in the territories in northern Canada have played a role in lowering VOC cases. Fast tracking second-dose vaccination not only is key to return to normalcy but also has been shown in previous studies [ 14 , 43 ] to curtail transmission of COVID-19 variants. Our results noted some spatial outliers (ie, discordant areas) for the relationship between the selected public health measures and VOCs in Ontario and in the Canadian Prairie provinces. To optimize public health impacts, these provinces need to revisit some of their approaches and reprioritize specific interventions. It is also noteworthy to further examine the intraprovincial variations between the public health measures and patterns of VOCs for the spatial outliers. The novelty of this study is that no known published study has described spatial clusters based on VOCs, vaccination coverage, and public health measures for Canadian jurisdictions. Overall, this study contributes to the current information needs to guide stakeholders on preventive measures to curtail VOCs during subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, evidence from this study could serve as a comparison point for informing interventions for future variant-driven outbreaks and surges. Also, the bivariate choropleth map eased readability of spatial patterns, compared with proportional symbol maps. This study has some limitations. The recommendations for administration of different vaccine products (eg, messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]–based, viral vector–based) have been quite fluid in Canada; we have not taken into consideration the spatial associations between different vaccine products and VOCs. Further research is needed to specifically assess the geographical patterns of vaccine products and VOCs, especially for the Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. As mentioned, this is an ongoing information need, rather than a one-time project. The biggest limitation, however, is the time lag and the uneven testing, detecting, and sequencing efforts to identify VOCs in Canada. Whole genomic sequencing (WGS) efforts to identify VOCs by large volumes are currently lagging in Canada. Also, there is selection bias of the samples that are sent for sequencing. The provinces and territories have different criteria for sending samples for sequencing, which could delay detection and bias the proportion of VOCs associated with the Beta and Gamma variants. For example, in Ontario, the WGS was triggered from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing for E48K. The samples with the E48K mutations were prioritized for WGS. However, in May 2021, the WGS algorithm changed to randomly selected sampling of 10% positives, with the proportion then increasing to 50% and now to all positives. This calls for new and rapid detection methods for VOCs even as Canada continues to fully vaccinate its populations. Also, there is possibility of systematic bias in the Google mobility index being underestimated among people without smartphones, who opted-out of the Google’s location history feature, or who had poor internet connection (especially in the territories). Due to how the mobility patterns were captured by Google LLC—geographical jurisdiction—it is challenging to delineate international travels and interprovincial and territorial mobility. This study found that COVID-19 VOCs in Canadian provinces and territories, to date, show discernible geographical clustering patterns: The territories recorded low VOC prevalences, Atlantic provinces and Quebec recorded moderate VOC prevalences, and the Western provinces and Ontario recorded high VOC prevalences. A fuller picture of VOC emerges when its prevalence is correlated with the proportions of populations having received 2 doses of vaccines, governmental countermeasures, and mobility. The implementation of COVID-19 public health measures including mass full vaccination of populations are key to controlling VOC prevalence rates in Canada. Surveillance of VOCs should continue across Canada, while accelerating the rollout of second and booster doses of vaccines. Achieving a balance in relation to lifting and relaxation of public health countermeasures and full-dose vaccine coverage is prudent to preempt any VOC-driven COVID-19 surges.

New bill seeks to bolster the French language in public and workplaces after studies showed decline Kate McKenna · CBC News · Posted: May 13, 2021 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: May 14, 2021 Quebec's Minister Responsible for the French Language, Simon Jolin-Barrette, walks with Premier François Legault after presenting Bill 96. (Sylvain Roy Roussel/CBC) Social Sharing The Quebec government has tabled a bill to tighten the province's language laws, seeking to change the Canadian Constitution to add clauses defining Quebec as a nation with its official and common language being French. That's one part of a sweeping new bill that, if passed, would become the most stringent law to bolster the status of the French language in Quebec since Bill 101 passed in 1977. Much of the 100-page bill is aimed at increasing the use of French in public and workplaces after a series of studies indicated French is on the decline, particularly in Montreal. \"French will always be vulnerable because of Quebec's situation in North America,'' Premier François Legault told reporters Thursday, alongside Simon Jolin-Barrette, the province's minister responsible for the French language. \"In that sense, each generation that passes has a responsibility for the survival of our language, and now it's our turn.\" The bill, called Bill 96, includes the following proposed measures: Adding clauses to the Canadian Constitution, saying Quebec is a nation and that its official and common language is French. Applying Bill 101 to businesses with 25-49 employees and federal workplaces. Forcing all commercial signage that includes non-French-language trademarks to include a \"predominant\" amount of French on all sign. Capping the number of students in English CEGEPs at 17.5 per cent of the student population. Quebec's Minister Responsible for the French Language Simon Jolin-Barrette says anglophones will be given admission priority for English CEGEPs. Giving access to French language training for those who aren't obligated by law to go to school in French. Removing a municipality's bilingual status if census data shows that English is the first language for less than 50 per cent of its population, unless the municipality decides to maintain its status by passing a resolution to keep it. Creating a French Language Ministry and the position of French-language commissioner, as well as bolstering the role of the French-language watchdog, the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF). Provincially appointed judges will not be required to be bilingual. Requiring that all provincial communication with immigrants is in French, starting six months after they arrive in Quebec. WATCH | Quebec seeks to change Canadian Constitution with new language bill: Quebec tables sweeping new French-language bill 4 years ago Duration 2:04 The Quebec government is hoping to bolster the use of French in the province through a sweeping new bill which would affect students, businesses  and new immigrants among many others. Invoking the notwithstanding clause The new bill pre-emptively invokes the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to protect it from legal challenges. The notwithstanding clause, officially called Section 33, allows provincial or federal authorities to override certain sections of the charter for a period of five years. \"The notwithstanding clause is a legitimate tool that balances between individual rights and collective rights,\" Legault said. Canada's notwithstanding clause — what's that again? \"We have the right and we have a duty to use the notwithstanding clause when the basis of our existence as a francophone people on the American continent is at stake.\" This is the second time Legault's government has used the notwithstanding clause. The CAQ government used it to shield its law barring some civil servants from wearing religious symbols, known as Bill 21, from legal challenges. As far as changing the Constitution, the CAQ government believes other provinces will not need to be consulted because it involves amending a matter within Quebec's constitution. WATCH |Simon Jolin-Barrette explains how Bill 96 is a balancing act: Quebec's minister responsible for the French language explains his reform of Bill 101 4 years ago Duration 5:55 Simon Jolin-Barrette is Quebec's minister responsible for the French language Legault said a letter has been drafted to other provinces explaining what Quebec is trying to do. The province will, however, need permission from Ottawa. \"We are aware of the bill tabled by the Government of Quebec and will study its contents carefully,\" Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages Mélanie Joly said in a statement. \"As we stated in our reform document last February, the protection and promotion of French is a priority for our government. Municipalities in the Montreal area are voting to maintain their bilingual statuses. (Sylvain Roy Roussel/CBC) Bill sets dangerous precedent, English-language group says Marlene Jennings, head of the Quebec Community Groups Network, an umbrella group of Anglo groups, said the proposed law sets a dangerous precedent. \"It establishes the hierarchy of rights, creating collective French community rights that would have precedence over individual rights,\" she said. Among political parties, however, the reaction was more positive. In fact, the leader of the Parti Québécois, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, said he supports aspects of the bill, but feels it doesn't go far enough. \"Unfortunately, the CAQ gave us the absolute minimum.\" The Parti Québécois has called for the Quebec college system, CEGEP, to fall under the purview of Bill 101, which would require the vast majority of students who go to elementary and high school in French to go to a French CEGEP. Quebec's proposed language law shakes English CEGEPs Analysis With Bill 101 reforms, François Legault risks upending Quebec's hard-won linguistic peace Plamondon said he was disappointed that the bill didn't include that measure. \"That bill cannot reasonably change the steep decline of the French language in the Montreal region.\" Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade said she was pleased to see so many of her party's proposals made it into the bill, including French-language classes, but she says there's room for improvement and hopes the government will be open to collaboration. As for changing the Constitution, Anglade said she needs to \"better understand what it truly changes.\" Decline of French in Quebec The proposed legislation comes after a number of studies from the OQLF that found the French language is in decline in the province. A 2018 study projected that the percentage of Quebecers who speak French at home will drop from 82 per cent in 2011 to about 75 per cent in 2036. The second study, also completed in 2018, examined language spoken in workplaces. It found that a quarter of Montreal employees surveyed said they use French and English equally at work, and only 18.7 per cent said they speak French exclusively at work. Quebec's language laws and identity have long been a source of tension in the province. Bill 101, adopted in 1977 by René Léveque's Parti Québécois government, was a bid to bolster and protect the French language in the province. It makes French the sole official language of the government, courts and workplaces. (Ron Poling/The Canadian Press) Bill 101 a 'watershed' moment The original law, adopted in 1977 by René Léveque's Parti Québécois government, was a bid to bolster and protect the French language in Quebec. Bill 101, or the Charter of the French Language, makes French the sole official language of the Quebec government, courts and workplaces. It includes restrictions on the use of English on outdoor commercial signage and put restrictions on who could study in English in Quebec. Lorraine O'Donnell, a Quebec historian who runs the Quebec English-Speaking Communities Research Network, said the original Bill 101 has had a lasting impact. \"Bill 101 is seen as a watershed moment in Quebec history,\" she said. \"It has marked the consciousness and the perspective of English-speaking Quebec.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Kate McKenna Kate McKenna is a senior reporter with CBC News.

(Submitted by Cowessess First Nation) Social Sharing WARNING: This story contains distressing details. The Cowessess First Nation announced a preliminary finding Thursday of 751 unmarked graves at a cemetery near the former Marieval Indian Residential School. The Marieval Indian Residential School operated from 1899 to 1997 in the area where Cowessess is now located, about 140 kilometres east of Regina. Children from First Nations in southeast Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba were sent to the school. The First Nation took over the school's cemetery from the Catholic Church in the 1970s. Earlier this month Cowessess started using ground-penetrating radar to locate unmarked graves. It was not immediately clear if all the remains are connected to the residential school. Cowessess Chief Cadmus Delorme spoke at a virtual news conference Thursday morning. \"This is not a mass grave site. These are unmarked graves,\" Delorme said.

Delorme said there may have at one point been markers for the graves. He said the Roman Catholic church, which oversaw the cemetery, may have removed markers at some point in the 1960s.

Teams were unable to confirm if there were more remains, but said there were 751 \"recorded hits\" at the site and noted there could be more than one set of remains at each \"hit.\" He said the penetrating radar work has a 10 to 15 per cent error rate. Technical teams would be able to provide a verified number in the coming weeks, Delorme said. Thursday's announcement marked \"Phase 1\" of the First Nation's search efforts, he said.

Bolen said his organization would help Cowessess First Nation take the lead in any efforts that are to be undertaken and he offered the community whatever help it needs going forward. In terms of records, Bolen said the school was run by oblates and the Archdiocese didn't have full school records. The organization had records of which priests were present at the school while it was operating, along with some records of baptisms and funerals, but the records were mostly incomplete. \"What we have, to the extent that privacy laws allow, we want to share, we want to be as helpful as we can in this regard,\" Bolen said. \"We can also support the Cowessess First Nation in their relations with the oblates in order to get documents and information.\" Support is available for anyone affected by their experience at residential schools, and those who are triggered by the latest reports.

He also acknowledged that his advancing age might force him to travel less in future. Share full article Francis held a news conference on Friday aboard the papal plane on his flight to Rome from Canada. Credit... Pool photo by Guglielmo Mangiapane By Jason Horowitz July 30, 2022 ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis has called the devastation visited on generations of Indigenous people in Canada by European colonizers — carried out with the blessing of the Roman Catholic Church — a “genocide” as he returned to Rome after a six-day trip to the North American country. As well as again denouncing the abuse against Indigenous people, which he had previously called “evil,” the pope noted that the Canada visit had showed that the limitations of his mobility and the advancement of his age would force him to slow down and possibly reduce the tours that have been a hallmark of his papacy. “I don’t think I can go on with the same rhythm of previous travels,” Francis said during comments to reporters on the papal plane on Friday, after limping to a wheelchair set up for him in the back of the aircraft. Although the pope used a wheelchair throughout the trip, it was his first time using one during his traditional in-flight news conference. “I think at my age, with these limitations, I think I have to save my energies a little to serve the church,” or consider stepping aside, he said, adding that it would not be a disaster if he were out of the picture. “You can change popes. No problem. But I think have to limit myself a little.” Asked later if he had thought about retiring , he repeated his usual formulation. “The door is open,” he said, but added that he had not used it yet and had “not thought about this possibility.” “Also this visit was a little bit a test, no? I see one can’t do trips in this state. I must maybe change the style, reduce,” he said, while noting that it would be God who told him when the time had come, one way or another.

EPA, via Shutterstock Francis added that he did hope to visit Ukraine, as well as travel to South Sudan and Congo for an Africa trip that he had been forced to cancel because of torn ligaments in his knee. “I have all the good will,” he said. “Let’s see how my leg goes.” He said that he had decided against an operation on his knee in part because he refused to undergo anesthesia, noting that he still felt the negative effects of it a year after a major intestinal operation last year. In his news conference, Francis appeared in good spirits, as engaged, gregarious and frustratingly vague and desultory as ever. He talked about how the church needed to keep developing with history, though he would not say specifically what concrete changes it needed to make. He argued that the church’s traditions gave it the strength to move forward, but that people too attached to the traditions, who often called themselves traditionalists, were instead “backwardists.” “Backwardism is a sin because you don’t go forward with the church,” he said. He also revealed that the Vatican’s secretariat of state had been behind a terse and unsigned document slamming the brakes on a group of progressives within the influential German church who had advocated for priests to marry, for women to become deacons and for same-sex couples to receive the church’s blessing. Francis said that he had said everything he needed to on the matter in a letter years ago, when he said it was a process that should be led by the Holy Spirit rather than policy priorities. The pope had called his visit to Canada a “pilgrimage of penance” that focused on his begging forgiveness for the wrongs perpetrated in church-run residential schools that for generations used Christianity as a blade to separate children from their families. Children in the schools suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Many died, and many languages died, too. Survivors of the schools, their relatives and advocates blame the church for its role in seeking to assimilate those Indigenous cultures and for driving them to the brink of extinction. Francis spent a week fulfilling a demand by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he travel to the land of the Indigenous and apologize. He did so at the site of one notorious residential school, in Alberta; in Edmonton churches; at a shrine in the pilgrimage site of Lac Ste. Anne; in Quebec City; and to the Inuit in the Arctic Circle. Image Graves in Iqaluit, Nunavut. Children in church-run residential schools suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse.

But, he added, “I described the genocide and asked for forgiveness, forgiveness for this ‘operation.’” “It is true,” he added, “it was genocide.” On Friday, the last day of his visit, the pope spoke to a delegation of Indigenous peoples at the archbishop’s residence in Quebec City, telling them that he had come to Canada “despite my physical limitations to take further steps forward with you and for you” and “as a brother, to discover firsthand the good and bad fruit borne by members of the local Catholic family in the course of the years.” He then headed farther north than he had ever traveled, to Iqaluit, the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut, a vast area spanning time zones in the Arctic Circle. He met with survivors inside a school, sat outside on a chair covered in sealskin and faced the Arctic Sea as he listened to throat singers and watched drum dancers. “Today, too, in this place, I want to tell you how very sorry I am and to ask for forgiveness for the evil perpetrated by not a few Catholics,” he said, adding, “How evil it is to break the bonds uniting parents and children.” Susie Alainga, 49, an Inuit, watched from the back of the crowd in an orange shirt bearing the words, “Every Child Matters.” She said that she had attended not so much for the pope, but rather to give support to survivors of abuse, including her sister. She said that the possibility of rescinding any old papal decrees that provided the rationale for spreading Christianity during the colonial era, as many Indigenous people have called for, would mean little to her. “It’s too late for that,” she said.

        "text": "TORONTO — A man accused of mowing down five members of the same family with a black pickup truck in an Ontario city Sunday, killing four and seriously injuring a 9-year-old boy, targeted them because they were Muslim, police said Monday, in what the city’s mayor branded an act of “mass murder.”\n\nPolice said the victims were struck while waiting to cross an intersection on a warm and clear Sunday evening in London, Ontario.\n\nA GoFundMe page identified the victims as Salman Afzaal, 46; his wife, Madiha Salman, 44; their daughter, Yumna Salman, 15; and Afzaal’s 74-year-old mother, who was not named. His 9-year-old son, Fayez Salman, is in the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. A GoFundMe spokeswoman said the page was the “verified” fundraiser for the family.\n\n“Based on information collected during the course of the investigation, we believe that this was an intentional act and that the victims of this horrific incident were targeted,” London Police Chief Steve Williams told reporters Monday. “We believe the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetective Superintendent Paul Waight said police Sunday arrested the suspect, Nathaniel Veltman, in a mall parking lot four miles from where the attack occurred “wearing a vest that appeared to be like body armor.” The 20-year-old was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.\n\nPolice are in contact with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about whether terrorism charges should be pursued, Waight said.\n\nLondon Mayor Ed Holder ordered flags outside the city hall to be lowered for three days of mourning.\n\n“Let me be clear: This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims — against Londoners — and rooted in unspeakable hatred,” he said. “The magnitude of such hatred can make one question who we are as a city, and who we are as Londoners.”\n\nNews of the attack drew condemnation from leaders around the world. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “horrified” by the news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“To the Muslim community in London and to Muslims across the country, know that we stand with you,” he tweeted Monday evening. “Islamophobia has no place in any of our communities. This hate is insidious and despicable — and it must stop.”\n\nTo the Muslim community in London and to Muslims across the country, know that we stand with you. Islamophobia has no place in any of our communities. This hate is insidious and despicable - and it must stop. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) June 7, 2021\n\nIn Parliament on Tuesday, Trudeau called the attack “a brutal, cowardly and brazen act of violence.”\n\n“This killing was no accident,” he said. “This was a terrorist attack motivated by hatred in the heart of one of our communities.”\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was “saddened to learn of the killing of a Muslim Pakistani-origin Canadian family.” He called it an “act of terrorism” that “reveals the growing Islamophobia in Western countries.”\n\nWaight said there was no known connection between Veltman and the family. He declined to say whether Veltman, a London resident, had confessed to targeting Muslims. So far, Waight said, police do not know of his membership “in any specific hate group.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaige Martin, a resident of the city roughly 120 miles southwest of Toronto, told local media that she was returning from getting gas when she came upon a scene of “chaos” in the “seemingly mostly quiet neighborhood.”\n\n“There was people everywhere and running, just citizens trying to direct the emergency vehicles where to go,” she said. “There was a lot of pointing and screaming and arms waving. It was just absolutely like something out of — that you never want to see.”\n\nIn an April report, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the country’s national intelligence agency, warned that the coronavirus pandemic had “exacerbated xenophobic and anti-authority narratives.” It cited “ideologically motivated violent extremism,” which includes racially motivated violence, as a growing threat.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, there were 1,946 police-reported hate crimes in 2019, the most recent year for which data is available, up 7 percent from the previous year. The national statistics agency said there were more incidents targeting Muslims that year, particularly violent hate crimes targeting Muslim women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNawaz Tahir, a London lawyer, told reporters that the “horror” of the attack is “unfathomable.”\n\nHe pointed to recent examples of Islamophobia-motivated violence, including a shooting at a Quebec City mosque in 2017 that left six dead and scores injured. Justice François Huot of the Quebec Superior Court said at a sentencing hearing that the gunman was motivated by a “visceral hatred toward Muslims.”\n\n“We must confront and stamp out Islamophobia and Islamophobic violence,” Tahir said. “Not tomorrow, today. For the sake of our children, our families, our communities.”\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims said a vigil for the family would be held Tuesday at the London Muslim Mosque. Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford planned to attend.\n\n“Muslims in Canada have become all too familiar with the violence of Islamophobia,” Mustafa Farooq, the council’s chief executive, said in a statement. “But this loss of a family, the loss of a child in our community because of Islamophobia — this is a sorrow that will run deep for a long time. But let that sorrow be the ground where we stand for justice, and stand for change.”",

Afin de bénéficier de cet assouplissement, les voyageurs devront entrer les informations sur leur état de santé et leur historique de vaccination en moyen de l'application ArriveCAN avant leur arrivée à la frontière canadienne. Les voyages non essentiels pour les étrangers arrivant au Canada resteront aussi interdits jusqu'à nouvel ordre, mais cela pourrait changer «dans les prochains mois», a soutenu le ministre des Affaires intergouvernementales Dominic LeBlanc. Écoutez l'entrevue avec Michel Archambault, Professeur émérite en tourisme sur QUB radio : Pour le ministre LeBlanc, cette annonce se veut un «premier pas» du gouvernement dans son approche progressive pour la réouverture des frontières. C’est aussi l’approche que préconise la santé publique canadienne. De plus, Ottawa renonce à la prise de température avant le vol pour les voyageurs internationaux qui arrivent au Canada. Selon le ministre des Transports Omar Alghabra, cela laissera le temps au personnel à l’aéroport de rentrer les informations sur la santé et l’historique de vaccination. Le ministre a expliqué que de nouvelles files prendront forme à l’aéroport, basées sur le statut de la vaccination des personnes. Ces décisions permettront d’écourter le temps passé à attendre aux aéroports du pays. Ottawa rend aussi possible dès aujourd’hui l’arrivée au pays des résidents permanents non citoyens. Plus précisément, les personnes dont le statut de résidence permanente a été officialisé après le 18 mars 2021 peuvent venir au Canada. Les assouplissements annoncés lundi seront «ajustés» au cours de l’été, à mesure que la campagne de vaccination poursuit son cours et que le nombre de nouveaux cas de COVID-19 continue à diminuer. Les vols avec l’Inde toujours interdits Par ailleurs, Ottawa a prolongé jusqu’au 21 juillet l’interdiction des vols directs avec l’Inde, mais a annoncé qu’il s’agit de la dernière extension. Ainsi, à moins d’un changement majeur, les vols directs avec l’Inde reprendront dès le 22 juillet. Le gouvernement permet toutefois, dès lundi, la reprise des vols avec le Pakistan, dont les liaisons directes avaient été coupées en avril, au même moment que l’interdiction avec l’Inde. · Écoutez l’entrevue de l’épidémiologiste Nimâ Machouf à QUB radio Les vols avec ces pays avaient été interrompus dans le but d’éviter la prolifération du variant Delta, auparavant dénommé variant indien. Ouverture progressive Du côté de Québec, le premier ministre François Legault s’est dit favorable à une ouverture partielle des frontières. La question a été abordée lors d’une réunion des premiers ministres provinciaux, puis avec le premier ministre fédéral, jeudi dernier. «La position du Québec, c’est qu’on est d’accord pour ouvrir les frontières, à commencer par les États-Unis, mais à condition qu’on exige que les personnes aient reçu leurs deux doses», a déclaré M. Legault en mêlée de presse après avoir lui-même reçu une seconde injection du vaccin contre la COVID-19. Démontrer qu’un voyageur a été pleinement immunisé, «ça suppose d’avoir une preuve vaccinale». «Donc, il va falloir que le gouvernement fédéral travaille, entre autres avec les États-Unis, pour s’assurer de la façon dont on peut avoir cette preuve d’une vaccination complète», a ajouté le premier ministre. Photo Agence QMI, TOMA ICZKOVITS Une vaccination complète signifie deux doses des vaccins présentement utilisés au Canada ou une dose de celui du fabricant Johnson & Johnson, qui requiert une seule injection. «Ce que je comprends, c’est qu’au début de juillet on pourrait envisager d’ouvrir la frontière, mais seulement pour les personnes qui ont reçu deux doses», affirme M. Legault. Casse-tête pour les ex-COVID-19 La réouverture éventuelle des frontières cause des maux de tête aux Québécois rétablis de la COVID-19. Québec les considère comme pleinement vaccinés après une seule dose, alors que des pays pourraient exiger deux injections. Une résidente de Saint-Jérôme l’a appris à ses dépens au moment de recevoir sa première injection. «Quand l’infirmière a su que j’avais eu la COVID-19 au mois de mars, elle a annulé mon deuxième rendez-vous en me disant que je n’en aurais pas de besoin», raconte Christine Hébert. «Donc, je n’ai pas de preuve comme quoi je suis pleinement vaccinée. Autrement dit, si je veux aller en Italie, ça va être le bordel», lance-t-elle. En point de presse, François Legault a reconnu qu’un flou persiste à ce sujet. «Ce n’est pas clair, pour l’instant, que ce soit avec les États-Unis ou avec l’Europe, si ça sera considéré comme une vaccination complète», a-t-il convenu. Au ministère de la Santé, on assure qu’«avec consentement éclairé, il est possible de recevoir deux doses si on le souhaite». Pour le virologue et professeur au département de sciences biologiques de l’UQAM, Benoit Barbeau, il n’existe pas de contre-indication pour une personne rétablie de la COVID-19 qui souhaite recevoir une seconde dose. «En fait, je présume qu’on priorise les deuxièmes doses à ceux qui n’ont pas été infectés pour établir une protection optimale», affirme-t-il.

        "text": "Canada weather: Dozens dead as heatwave shatters records 30 June 2021 Share Save Share Save Watch: Canadians say the conditions are \"unbearable\" Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records. Police in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor. Canada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. The US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities. Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwave Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change US President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network. On Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. Before Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to \"disastrous consequences for families and for communities\". The number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers. In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. \"I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,\" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number. He said people were arriving at relatives' homes and \"finding them deceased\". Dozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday. Allow Twitter content?

Resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been \"almost impossible\" to go outside. \"It's been intolerable,\" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper. \"We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47.\" Canada temperature reaches record 49.6C Many homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. One Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: \"I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again.\" The country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Jodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes. How to ward off the heat Stay cool. It may sound obvious, but if your body hits 40C (104F) heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help, as it could lead to loss of consciousness, organ failure, even death. Danger signs include sweat stopping - feeling hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties Food and water. Again obviously, drink water (and avoid diuretics like caffeine) - and don't take your thirst as a guide, as you could still be dehydrating. Food with high water content is good; having to digest heavy meals isn't Stay in the shade. Indoors if you can. Limit travel to cooler parts of the day if possible. Be careful with exercise Clothing. Try to keep covered, but with fabrics like linen and cotton that are more breathable. Wear a hat, preferably with ventilation Cooling methods. If you find air-conditioning eco-unfriendly or don't have it, try fans (maybe with ice cubes in front), gels, face sprays, a cold water bottle, a cool shower. Draw the curtains to cool the room temperature How to look after yourself in hot weather Records fall in western US In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. At least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave. A doctor in a Seattle hospital told the Seattle Times the number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt. Seattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. \"It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,\" he told Reuters. The heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter .

Agricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat. One worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon. One Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: \"Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous.\" Amazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.

Article content The coroners service said it has not received any other reports of deaths linked to the fire, but officials have said that some people remain unaccounted for, in large part due to the hasty evacuation of the village on Wednesday night. Article content That evacuation was the subject of criticism earlier Saturday, as the head of the Nlaka’pamux Nation Tribal Council — of which the Lytton First Nation is a member — said the government ignored the needs of community members in the early hours of the emergency. Article content Chief Matt Pasco said the tribal council was forced to try to save lives with little to no help from the government. Article content Pasco, who operates a ranch near Ashcroft, north of Lytton, said the first contact he received from the government came 12 hours after evacuations began, and it was regarding his cattle, not about affected community members. Article content Article content “It was an abysmal attempt at the very thing they’re meant to do,” he said in an interview Saturday. “They had processes in places for our cattle but none for Nlaka’pamux people.” Article content Article content READ MORE Article content B.C.

Hundreds under evacuation order after 'fast-moving' wildfire flares in B.C.'s Okanagan Valley CBC News · Posted: Jul 20, 2021 10:51 AM EDT | Last Updated: July 21, 2021 An aircraft drops fire retardant near the Nk'Mip fire on Tuesday. (Submitted by Mike Fitzpatrick) Social Sharing A provincewide state of emergency has been declared in B.C. as wildfires continue to grow, forcing hundreds from their homes and putting thousands more on evacuation alert. It comes after days of calls from local municipal leaders for the province to declare a state of emergency. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said the declaration will help deal with the mass evacuations quickly and allow the government to secure accommodation for those people if necessary. Nearly 300 fires were burning across the province on Tuesday, including several that were encroaching on communities that have issued evacuation orders or alerts. Federal government sending military to B.C., Manitoba to help tame wildfires Most of resort town Sicamous, B.C., under evacuation order or alert due to wildfire There are more than 40 evacuation orders affecting about 5,700 people or almost 2,900 properties in the province. There are also 69 evacuation alerts affecting just under 33,000 people and about 16,000 properties. \"We have reached a critical point,\" Farnworth said. More than 3,000 square kilometres of land have been burned by 1,145 wildfires in B.C. this season so far, which is three times the 10-year average for this time of year, according to B.C. Wildfire Service director of operations Cliff Chapman. The state of emergency will stay in effect for 14 days but may be extended as needed. Nk'Mip Creek fire more than doubles in size The Nk'Mip Creek fire continues to burn on Osoyoos Indian Band land between the towns of Oliver and Osoyoos, about 40 kilometres south of Penticton. The B.C. Wildfire Service had previously referred to the fire as the Inkaneep Creek wildfire, but changed the name on Tuesday. As of 2:30 p.m. PT, the fire was estimated to cover 20 square kilometres — up from seven square kilometres on Monday night.

You can definitely see the scorched trees and yet many didn't catch fire as well.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BCWildfires?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BCWildfires</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fpwgiAEXuS\">pic.twitter.com/fpwgiAEXuS</a> &mdash; @anitabathe Those fighting the fire Tuesday are up against unrelenting wind, which has been blowing flames across tinder-dry terrain. \"Crews have been quite challenged by these steady winds,\" said Taylor MacDonald with the B.C. Wildfire Service. The Oliver Fire Department posted a brief video Tuesday showing the fire in its early stages. The post said crews worked in shifts through the night to protect buildings from the flames. Frantic evacuations Hundreds of people were ordered to evacuate properties Monday after the wildfire exploded in size. Geraldine and Rod Foley fled their home near Mount Baldy in rural Oliver with a few treasured photos and their pets: eight dogs, two cats and two parrots. \"From our balcony, you could see the smoke. It was horrendous. Then all of a sudden, within five minutes, the flames were just booming up in the air,\" Rod said Tuesday. A regional official \"walked up the hill and yelled, 'You gotta go, now,'\" he said. Geraldine took half the animals with her in the truck, and Rod rode behind with the other half inside the couple's motorhome, where they plan to stay. Geraldine said her son, a firefighter, told her they could be in danger of losing the home to the fire if the wind shifts. Rod and Geraldine Foley fled their home in Oliver on Monday after a nearby wildfire exploded in size. (Brady Strachan/CBC) \"It makes me want to cry,\" Geraldine said. \"That's my home.\" The wildfire quickly grew from 0.03 square kilometres to more than three over the course of a few hours Monday afternoon. It was seven square kilometres as of 9 p.m. PT. A helicopter flies over homes in the Oliver, B.C., area on Monday to help fight the wildfire known as the Nk'Mip fire, which forced dozens of evacuations. (Submitted by Mike Fitzpatrick) Evacuations happened so frantically that officials haven't been able to confirm exactly how many people are out of their homes. \"The total number [of evacuees], I haven't had a chance to add up,\" Erick Thompson, an information officer with the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen (RDOS), said in an early-morning interview. The Oliver-Osoyoos region is a popular tourist destination, known for its wineries. The legion hall in Oliver was opened Tuesday morning as a reception centre for evacuees. All evacuees are asked to register online with Emergency Support Services (ESS) , even if they don't need referrals for assistance such as housing. Dry, smoky conditions persist as wildfires rage in B.C. and beyond Drought danger grows as some parts of B.C. see no rain for almost 5 weeks Despite the fire's growth, the mayor of Oliver said crews who worked on the fire overnight appear to have made progress. \"Just visually, from what I can see, things do look a lot better. The wind definitely did not come up, but the fire was quite visible overnight in certain areas for sure,\" Mayor Martin Johansen told CBC News on Tuesday. \"I believe, you know, we've kind of gotten through maybe the initial worst of it. We'll see where it goes today … everything was put on this fire as quickly as possible.\" The first evacuation order, covering almost 200 properties, was issued by the Osoyoos Indian Band on Monday evening. Chief Clarence Louie with the Osoyoos Indian Band said the Oliver Fire Department did an \"outstanding job\" to save houses closest to the fire. Members of the band who evacuated are staying in hotels in the Oliver-Osoyoos area for the time being, he said. Some have elected to stay behind. Flames are visible in the hills behind cottages in Oliver. (Anita Bathe/CBC) The RDOS has an evacuation order in place for several dozen properties east of the wildfire. On Tuesday evening, an evacuation order was extended to 140 properties in the area. Further to the order, several dozen properties in the region — as well as within the town of Oliver — are under evacuation alert and are being asked to prepare to leave if an order is issued. WATCH | Wildfire in B.C.'s Okanagan Valley forces hundreds from their homes: Fast-growing wildfire near Osoyoos, B.C., forces hundreds from homes 4 years ago Duration 2:28 As British Columbia declares a state of emergency and Ottawa sends in military help, a new, fast-growing wildfire near Osoyoos, B.C. has forced hundreds of people from their homes and put even more on alert. The RDOS has declared a local state of emergency. The town of Oliver, which has a population of about 5,000, has also declared a local state of emergency. In the North Okanagan, near Vernon, more than a dozen properties were ordered evacuated on Tuesday due to a wildfire on the east side of Mabel Lake . Officials are urging residents on evacuation alert to have an evacuation plan in place and leave their properties immediately when put on evacuation order. \"From working in this branch for 20 years, I would be taking my family out if I was on an evacuation order today,\" Chapman said. In B.C.'s Southern Interior, most of the resort town of Sicamous, B.C., is on an evacuation order or alert due to a wildfire sparked by a highway accident. At least 1,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes. Evacuees struggle to find accommodation Residents under evacuation have been scrambling to find safe accommodations, with hotel rooms at a premium. Thompson-Nicola Regional District chair Ken Gillis said there are no available places to stay in Kamloops, Merritt or Salmon Arm. \"They're absolutely full,\" he said. The RDOS encouraged evacuees to consider making arrangements to stay with family or friends due to the shortage of hotel accommodations. The district also called on tourists to be cognizant of the wildfire situation around them before heading into the area. \"Certainly, the message from anyone who is involved in tourism is that this region is still open for business.… The issue is, with fast-moving wildfires, anyone who is scheduled to be in this area or who is visiting has to be very situationally aware,\" said Thompson, with RDOS. \"The Okanagan is complex in that way now.\" The Nk'Mip Creek wildfire is burning about six kilometres north of Osoyoos, B.C., on Osoyoos Indian Band land. (B.C. Wildfire Service/Twitter) More resources coming Farnworth said more than 3,100 people are part of the firefighting effort in B.C., right now. Another 500 are expected to arrive in the coming days. Firefighting and evacuee support resources, however, are \"thin,\" he said. 📍British Columbia: Wildfires are continuing to threaten communities across the province. In response to a request for assistance, we are sending up to 350 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CanadianForces?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CanadianForces</a> members to help the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BCGovFireInfo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BCGovFireInfo</a> extinguish hot spots on contained fires and monitor the situation. &mdash; @HarjitSajjan \"I want to assure British Columbians that we are deploying all available personnel and equipment to fight the fires in communities across our province,\" Farnworth said. \"Every opportunity is being pursued.\" The B.C. RCMP says it is continuing to send officers to communities throughout the province to help with evacuations. So far, 100 officers and support staff have been deployed, and more are on standby, in the event more fires break out. Weather 'a huge concern' The weather in the Interior is also challenging for fire crews. There was no rain in the southern half of the province over the weekend, and some areas haven't seen rain for nearly five weeks . Conditions are expected to stay hot, bone-dry and windy through the week. \"[The winds] have been contributing to the growth of the fire and they're expected to continue all the way until Thursday,\" said MacDonald with the B.C. Wildfire Service. The BC Wildfire Service has issued a wind advisory for the Interior, southern Interior and southeastern B.C. from Tuesday, July 20 to Thursday, July 22, 2021. Winds in the southeast of the province are expected to gust between 50 and 70 km/h. Johansen, the mayor of Oliver, said the entire community is keeping its eye on the weather. \"The weather is a huge concern and we're only in the middle of July. This is our second, third fire in this region. I won't be surprised if we get more,\" he said. \"I just hope everybody does everything they can to be safe and do everything they can to avoid, you know, accidentally creating any fires … We're all very concerned and we've got a long road ahead.\" LISTEN | Oliver mayor speaks about the Nk'Mip Creek wildfire: Anyone placed under an evacuation order must leave the area immediately. Evacuation centres have been set up throughout the province to assist anyone evacuating from a community under threat from a wildfire.

WATCH | Wildfire in B.C.'s Okanagan Valley forces hundreds from their homes: Fast-growing wildfire near Osoyoos, B.C., forces hundreds from homes 4 years ago Duration 2:28 As British Columbia declares a state of emergency and Ottawa sends in military help, a new, fast-growing wildfire near Osoyoos, B.C. has forced hundreds of people from their homes and put even more on alert. The RDOS has declared a local state of emergency. The town of Oliver, which has a population of about 5,000, has also declared a local state of emergency. In the North Okanagan, near Vernon, more than a dozen properties were ordered evacuated on Tuesday due to a wildfire on the east side of Mabel Lake . Officials are urging residents on evacuation alert to have an evacuation plan in place and leave their properties immediately when put on evacuation order. \"From working in this branch for 20 years, I would be taking my family out if I was on an evacuation order today,\" Chapman said. In B.C.'s Southern Interior, most of the resort town of Sicamous, B.C., is on an evacuation order or alert due to a wildfire sparked by a highway accident. At least 1,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes. Evacuees struggle to find accommodation Residents under evacuation have been scrambling to find safe accommodations, with hotel rooms at a premium. Thompson-Nicola Regional District chair Ken Gillis said there are no available places to stay in Kamloops, Merritt or Salmon Arm. \"They're absolutely full,\" he said. The RDOS encouraged evacuees to consider making arrangements to stay with family or friends due to the shortage of hotel accommodations. The district also called on tourists to be cognizant of the wildfire situation around them before heading into the area. \"Certainly, the message from anyone who is involved in tourism is that this region is still open for business.… The issue is, with fast-moving wildfires, anyone who is scheduled to be in this area or who is visiting has to be very situationally aware,\" said Thompson, with RDOS. \"The Okanagan is complex in that way now.\" The Nk'Mip Creek wildfire is burning about six kilometres north of Osoyoos, B.C., on Osoyoos Indian Band land.

RCMP says it is continuing to send officers to communities throughout the province to help with evacuations. So far, 100 officers and support staff have been deployed, and more are on standby, in the event more fires break out. Weather 'a huge concern' The weather in the Interior is also challenging for fire crews. There was no rain in the southern half of the province over the weekend, and some areas haven't seen rain for nearly five weeks . Conditions are expected to stay hot, bone-dry and windy through the week. \"[The winds] have been contributing to the growth of the fire and they're expected to continue all the way until Thursday,\" said MacDonald with the B.C. Wildfire Service. The BC Wildfire Service has issued a wind advisory for the Interior, southern Interior and southeastern B.C. from Tuesday, July 20 to Thursday, July 22, 2021. Winds in the southeast of the province are expected to gust between 50 and 70 km/h. Johansen, the mayor of Oliver, said the entire community is keeping its eye on the weather. \"The weather is a huge concern and we're only in the middle of July. This is our second, third fire in this region. I won't be surprised if we get more,\" he said. \"I just hope everybody does everything they can to be safe and do everything they can to avoid, you know, accidentally creating any fires … We're all very concerned and we've got a long road ahead.\" LISTEN | Oliver mayor speaks about the Nk'Mip Creek wildfire: Anyone placed under an evacuation order must leave the area immediately.

(Cpl. Justin Dreimanis/DND-MDN Canada/Reuters) Social Sharing Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are back on home soil, almost three years after they were first detained in China. The two men landed in Calgary shortly before 8 a.m. ET Saturday aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force Challenger aircraft. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau were at the airport to welcome the two men, who had flown from China along with ambassador Dominic Barton. Trudeau announced Friday evening that the two were out of Chinese airspace, just hours after the extradition case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was dropped. Meng reached a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities related to fraud charges against her on Friday and landed back in China Saturday morning. Michael Kovrig reboarded a plane in Calgary to fly on to Toronto, where Vina Nadjibulla, his wife (separated), and his sister Ariana Botha spoke before he landed. \"There are no words to describe the emotions that have been running through us these last 24 hours. Joy, relief, overwhelming gratitude for everyone who has worked to make this happen,\" Nadjibulla said.

Their detention is widely considered to be a retaliatory action in response to the Huawei executive's arrest. Michael Spavor gives a thumbs up after landing in Calgary Saturday morning. He and Michael Kovrig returned home after being detained in China for nearly three years. (Colin Hall/CBC) 'Sorry for the inconvenience caused': Meng Chinese authorities had consistently denied that the cases were linked. In a statement Saturday, China's foreign ministry said the charges against Meng were \"purely fabricated.\" \"It has long been a fully proven fact that this is an incident of political persecution against a Chinese citizen, an act designed to hobble Chinese high-tech companies,\" the statement said. Spavor was found guilty of spying and sentenced to 11 years in prison and deportation by a Chinese court in August. The trial for Kovrig concluded in March, but he had not yet been sentenced.

Speaking Friday outside a Vancouver courthouse after her extradition case was dropped, Meng thanked the court and the Canadian government for \"upholding the rule of law.\" \"I'm also grateful to the Canadian people and media friends for your tolerance. Sorry for the inconvenience caused,\" she said. Meng spent her time in Canada under house arrest at her multimillion-dollar home in Vancouver, in stark contrast to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who endured poor conditions in detention and whose legal processes were criticized by Canadian officials.

Robertson told CBC's The House \"it really was one for the other\" in an exchange that was reminiscent of Cold War swaps. \"The timing, it's totally undeniable that the two Michaels were unjustly detained because of the arrest of Ms. Meng in Vancouver,\" Lynette Ong, a specialist on China at the Munk School of Global Affairs, told The House host Chris Hall.

Trudeau has said the return of the so-called \"two Michaels\" has been a top foreign policy priority for the government. David Morrison, a foreign affairs and defence adviser to the prime minister, and Kirsten Hillman, ambassador to the United States, were both deeply involved in the efforts leading up to the release of the two Michaels. But the prime minister deflected questions Friday about how the return on the two men would affect Canada's relationship with China. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are on their way home!

But as long as you respect international treaties, international obligations and you don't engage in bullying tactics,\" he said. Ong said she believes the relationship with China has been permanently damaged. She said public opinion in Canada has turned decisively against China and a return to normal would be \"very hard\" to execute. \"I don't think Canada-China relations could actually be repaired.

Other experts were quick to point out South Africa’s low rates of vaccination, which currently sit at under 30 per cent of the total population, as well as a lack of evidence suggesting the variant is deadlier than the current dominant strains of the virus.

Alistair Waters/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account The union representing operating engineers in B.C. says anyone assembling or disassembling a construction crane should have to go through a specific, mandatory certification process because the work is extremely dangerous and often done under tight deadlines. The International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 115, representing people in construction and industrial shops throughout British Columbia and Yukon, made the recommendation Wednesday, two days after a crane collapsed in Kelowna, B.C., killing five people. Four construction workers, as well as another person working in an adjacent building that was crushed when the crane came down on top of it, were killed. The body of the person in the adjacent building was recovered from the rubble Wednesday morning. RCMP, WorkSafeBC and the BC Coroners Service are investigating the accident. Both the police and WorkSafe have declined to speculate on the cause of the accident. The crane was being used in the construction of a 25-storey residential tower in downtown Kelowna. Two of the dead – Eric and Patrick Stemmer – were identified on social media as brothers working for Stemmer Construction Ltd., based in Salmon Arm, B.C. A former worker for one of the company’s previous projects called the construction firm a “solid, safe working company.” Chris Manning of Abbotsford, B.C., described Eric as a nice, smart guy and a good leader. Eric was “working hard all the time, always making sure his guys were busy on top of everything. A solid man,” Mr. Manning texted through Facebook Messenger. Andy Watson, a spokesman for WorkSafeBC, said crane operators in B.C., including those for tower cranes, must have a certificate to operate the structures. But no additional certification is required for assembly or disassembly. Instead, he added in an e-mail, the agency’s requirement is that that work must be done by qualified persons in accordance with the instructions of the crane manufacturer or a professional engineer. But Frank Carr, a spokesman for the IUOE, said the union believes specialized certification is required for crane assembly and dismantling. “It’s dangerous work and it’s highly technical,” said Mr. Carr. “We’ve been lobbying for mandatory tower crane operator certification and approved safety standards for almost 20 years,” he said in an interview. “We believe it’s essential to improve the safety standards.” B.C. Labour Minister Harry Bains said in a statement it would be inappropriate for government to speculate on the cause of the accident while multiple investigations are under way. “Once we have those findings and understand the cause of this incident, the province will be able to take appropriate action toward ensuring something like this does not happen again,” the statement reads. The union said in a news release the City of Vancouver implemented a number of recommendations from it and BC Crane Safety as part of a pilot project to improve tower crane safety. These include requirements for preassembly and postassembly meetings and checklists, pedestrian and cycling lane closings, and granting permit extensions and additional full days for crane assembly and dismantling to reduce pressure on workers to get the job done under tight timelines. “Unfortunately, this incident, it shows how big of a crash zone or how big of a footprint that is encompassed when a tower crane collapses. Unfortunate for the public to learn this way,” Mr. Carr said. “It’s a tragedy. Part of the process prior to this was to educate the public when they’re walking by these sites, what’s taking place above them and how critical and dangerous it is.” Several GoFoundMe pages have been set up in the past few days.

(Natasha MacDonald-Dupuis/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Read Story Transcript Emergency department physician Raghu Venugopal stood by himself, in his scrubs, outside Toronto General Hospital Monday holding up a sign that said \"Protect Hospitals\" in an effort to counter dozens of protesters who are opposed to COVID-19 public health measures. Across the country, people stood in protest outside hospitals , the result of an effort organized by a group called Canadian Frontline Nurses, which was founded by two Ontario nurses who have promoted conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Venugopal's photo spread quickly across social media. He said he felt compelled to take action outside the hospital because so much important health-care work took place inside and he wanted to defend his fellow health-care workers, registered nurses in particular. \"I think this is particularly abominable by protesters to do this when nurses are leaving acute care hospitals in droves because the working conditions [are] simply too much for them,\" he told As It Happens host Carol Off while on his way to another hospital emergency room. Here is part of their conversation. Dr. Venugopal, why did you decide to stand outside alone and face down these protesters today? Carol, hospitals are places where people who are injured and who are sick come for care, come for compassion, come for respect, and I honestly thought that to protest at that particular hospital in Toronto today was honestly a defilement of very sacred ground for many patients and for many families and many staff who work and get treated there. There's a photograph of you standing alone in front of Toronto General Hospital with this very simple handmade sign, \"Protect Hospitals.\" What kind of reaction did you get from people? There were a lot of patients and staff who said, honestly, thank you. And there was a research student who got me a bottle of water because it's really hot. And most of the protesters were very friendly, [but] it got quite heated, though. And I had to step behind the police line because at some point I really start getting scared. Why, what happened? It's the jeers, it's the nasty tone in the voice, it's when you're the only one standing in a uniform and there are a lot of people, quite hostile, around you. It disgusted me to no end that they would target that particular hospital where I know such good cancer care and transplant care and medical and surgical care is done. - Emergency physician Raghu Venogopal And you're wearing your scrubs, you're wearing a mask, you're wearing your stethoscope around your neck. What were some of the things people said or ... the jeers that made you so uncomfortable? People said things like, \"You're a doctor, tell the truth,\" and I wasn't trying to hide my identity and I wasn't trying to hide that I worked there. But the reality is, is that, you know, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or are against mandates or are for them, you know, when they're a patient, honestly, we treat them with respect and dignity and compassion. And I think for the nurses and doctors and respiratory therapists and cleaners who work in our hospital, we ask the public to treat us with dignity and respect as well. And in particular, I just want to signal a group that suffered the most during the pandemic, which is registered nurses. And I think this is particularly abominable by protesters to do this when nurses are leaving acute care hospitals in droves because the working conditions [are] simply too much for them. Venugopal said he thinks many of the protesters are reasonable, but called on government to legislate against protests outside hospitals in order to protect health-care workers. (CBC ) And yet the group ... that calls itself Canadian Frontline Nurses seems to be the one behind organized protests, and these kinds of demonstrations in cities, across the country. What do you say to them? First of all, these are not practicing nurses and these are not practicing health-care professionals. And I think if you need any nurses or doctors who actually see patients, who actually take care of COVID patients, they would say get vaccinated. And if you're not sure about getting vaccinated, ask your doctor for more information. People have a right to protest, but these laws of the land are not written behind the hospital walls. The laws of the land are written by our governments, in our municipal governments and in our federal governments — in Toronto, for example, at Queen's Park. And I would respectfully ask protesters to go there. But let me be clear, Carol, that honestly, the vast majority of people I meet, which is in the emergency room, are patient, are supportive of vaccine mandates, of their understanding of the science, are asking good questions and know how to make good decisions. And I honestly think that the protesters that we're seeing today and across the country are a tiny minority of Canadians. Protesters linked arms outside of Queen's Park in Toronto for several minutes ahead of the planned demonstrations against COVID-19 measures at hospitals across the country on Monday. (Patrick Morrell/CBC) But why confront them at all then? I mean, online and [on] Twitter today these past days, the people who were in these protests, who say they're part of them, are not just saying that they're against vaccines, they're threatening violence in some cases, that some of these protesters, if you can follow what they're saying on Twitter, have violent intentions. And so why did you go out to confront them? The hospital chosen in Toronto is a very special place where some of the best medicine and science in this country is done. And it disgusted me to no end that they would target that particular hospital where I know such good cancer care and transplant care and medical and surgical care is done. It disturbed me and I thought the best way to express my opinion would be to very respectfully hold a sign saying, \"We need to protect hospitals.\" And we have a legislative record in this country and in our municipalities of protecting health-care sites. And what I think our municipal leaders and solicitor generals in each province need to do is to look at the laws so that in the future, harassment, intimidation, physical assault, psychological assault of healthcare workers, patients and families is no longer tolerable. And I think the majority of Canadians would feel that's reasonable. You mentioned the legislatures and their responsibilities. The provinces, including Ontario, where you work, they can pass injunction laws, can't they? I mean, they can do something about this. What do you make of the fact that they're not? The people in the hospital are not of any political stripe. And what we have to ask honestly is why is the mayor of Toronto and why is the premier of Ontario acting so slowly? We know clearly that First Nations and Indigenous communities, when they have protested, they have been met by police violence. And the very tepid response by authorities and politicians to this particular group speaks volumes that I don't need to further, you know, articulate. But really what we need is protection of patients and families and decency around health-care institutions. And that's a very simple ask. And I think, again, most people would be in favour of that.

Près de 5000 livres jeunesse parlant des Autochtones ont été détruits dans un but de réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, a appris Radio-Canada. Une cérémonie de purification par la flamme s’est tenue, en 2019, afin de brûler une trentaine de livres bannis, dans un but éducatif . Les cendres ont servi comme engrais pour planter un arbre et ainsi tourner du négatif en positif . Une vidéo destinée aux élèves explique la démarche : Nous enterrons les cendres de racisme, de discrimination et de stéréotypes dans l’espoir que nous grandirons dans un pays inclusif où tous puissent vivre en prospérité et en sécurité . Extrait d'une vidéo destinée aux élèves où l'on voit une partie de la cérémonie où des cendres de livres ont été déposées dans un trou pour planter un arbre. Photo :  CSP Providence Des cérémonies semblables devaient se tenir dans chacune des écoles, mais la pandémie les a reportées à plus tard. L’idée initiale de brûler tous les livres a aussi été écartée, par crainte de susciter un tollé chez les parents d’élèves et les enseignants. Ces livres ont été recyclés ou sont en voie de l’être , explique la porte-parole du Conseil scolaire Lyne Cossette. Elle ajoute que les ouvrages retirés des bibliothèques avaient un contenu désuet et inapproprié . Il s’agit d’un geste de réconciliation avec les Premières Nations, et un geste d’ouverture envers les autres communautés présentes dans l’école et notre société. Une citation de : Lyne Cossette, porte-parole du Conseil scolaire catholique Providence Le Conseil scolaire catholique Providence accueille près de 10 000 élèves, au sein de 23 écoles primaires et 7 secondaires francophones, réparties majoritairement dans les régions de Windsor, London et Sarnia. Un document de 165 pages, que nous avons obtenu, détaille l'ensemble des titres éliminés, ainsi que les raisons invoquées. On y retrouve des bandes dessinées, des romans et des encyclopédies. Un comité formé de membres du conseil scolaire et d’accompagnateurs autochtones a analysé de 500 livres jeunesse au sujet des Premières Nations. Des représentants du ministère de l’Éducation de l’Ontario auraient aussi participé selon le conseil scolaire, mais le ministère ne nous l'a pas confirmé. Le retrait des livres en chiffres 155 œuvres différentes ont été retirées, 152 ont été autorisées à rester en place et 193 sont en évaluation actuellement. Au total 4716 livres ont été retirés des bibliothèques du conseil scolaire, dans 30 écoles, soit une moyenne de 157 livres par école. L’auteure de la vidéo destinée aux élèves est Suzy Kies, présentée comme une gardienne du savoir autochtone. Elle fait partie de ceux qui ont accompagné le conseil scolaire dans sa démarche, à partir de 2019 dans son cas. Elle dénonce les personnages autochtones présentés dans les livres pour enfants comme pas fiables, paresseux, ivrognes, stupides… . Quand on perpétue ce genre d’image dans la tête des jeunes, c’est difficile de s’en débarrasser. Les gens paniquent avec le fait de brûler des livres, mais on parle de millions de livres qui ont des images négatives des personnes autochtones, qui perpétuent des stéréotypes, qui sont vraiment dommageables et dangereux. Une citation de : Suzy Kies, « gardienne du savoir » autochtone qui a accompagné le conseil scolaire Selon elle, le simple titre du livre Les Cowboys et les Indiens , publié en 2011, a justifié son retrait des bibliothèques. C’est vraiment atroce , dit-elle. Qui est Suzy Kies? Suzy Kies en photo avec le premier ministre Justin Trudeau, en 2018. Photo : Facebook/CPA Suzy Kies se présente comme une chercheuse indépendante . Elle offre des formations aux écoles à travers l’Ontario. Le Conseil scolaire Providence note qu’ elle possède des connaissances approfondies sur plusieurs différentes nations autochtones . Elle est aussi coprésidente de la Commission des peuples autochtones du Parti libéral du Canada depuis 2016. Le site du parti de Justin Trudeau la présente comme une autochtone urbaine de descendance abénaquise et montagnaise . Selon le Conseil scolaire Providence, ce « comité autochtone [est] consulté par le Premier Ministre du Canada » Justin Trudeau. Suzy Kies affirme travailler avec d’autres conseils scolaires ontariens qui veulent s’inspirer du projet. Tintin en Amérique , un livre raciste? Le Conseil scolaire reproche à la bande dessinée Tintin en Amérique , un langage non acceptable , des informations erronées , une présentation négative des peuples autochtones et une représentation fautive des Autochtones dans les dessins . Dans la BD d’Hergé, parue en 1932, une des plus vendues de l’auteur dans le monde, on retrouve notamment l'appellation Peau-Rouge . Le Temple du Soleil a aussi été retiré des rayons. Agrandir l’image ﻿ (Nouvelle fenêtre) ﻿ Extrait de la bande dessinée Tintin en Amérique , publiée en 1966. Photo : Éditions Casterman Le livre Les Esquimaux , publié en 1981, a été retiré parce qu’il utilise un terme aujourd’hui péjoratif pour qualifier les Inuits. L’utilisation du mot Indien a aussi été un motif de retrait de nombreux livres. Un livre est même en évaluation parce qu’on y utilise le mot « amérindien ». Trois albums de Lucky Luke ont été retirés. Un des reproches souvent fait par le comité est le débalancement de pouvoir avec les Blancs et les Autochtones perçus comme les méchants . La Conquête de l'Ouest : Les Amérindiens, les pionniers et les colons a été retiré à cause du mot conquête dans le titre. On veut [r]abaisser une population , écrit le comité d’évaluation pour justifier le retrait. Le Conseil scolaire reproche au livre Vivre comme les Indiens d’Amérique de ne pas identifier les différentes cultures autochtones, mais de les présenter comme un tout . Des livres qui présentaient des bricolages qualifiés d’ appropriation culturelle ont aussi été retirés. Un livre a été considéré comme manque de respect envers la culture , car on y proposait une activité baptisée mange, écris, habille-toi comme les Amérindiens .

Il ressent beaucoup de tristesse, beaucoup d’incompréhension . En 2011, le livre a été finaliste du prix Tamarac, remis par l'Association des bibliothèques de l'Ontario. En 10 ans, je suis passé de presque gagnant d’un prix à auteur banni. La BD humoristique se déroule durant la guerre de la Conquête, à l’époque Nouvelle-France, et s’amuse des relations entre les Autochtones et les soldats français et anglais.

Le but de notre BD c’est de divertir avant tout, ce n’est pas de faire un cours théorique. Une citation de : Marcel Levasseur, coauteur de la bande dessinée Laflèche Marcel Levasseur est tellement abattu par la nouvelle du retrait de sa BD qu’il remet en question la production du 4e album, en préparation. De me rendre compte que ça peut-être aussi fragile, que ça peut devenir du jour au lendemain un objet de honte… Est-ce que j’ai le goût de continuer à me battre? L’auteur raconte qu’il a déjà dû faire face à des critiques, même parmi ses proches, parce qu’un de ses personnages autochtones est alcoolique.

Aucun auteur n’a été informé du retrait de son livre. C’est incroyable. De quel droit font-ils une chose pareille? C’est complètement ridicule , dénonce Sylvie Brien, dont le roman jeunesse L’affaire du collège indien a été retiré. Le conseil scolaire ne spécifie pas la raison du retrait. Il s’agit d’une histoire qui se déroule en 1920 avec des personnages et lieux fictifs. Dans l’histoire, une adolescente défend un Autochtone accusé à tort d’un incendie. L’auteure rejette tout préjugé : Au contraire, j’ai dénoncé des choses qu’on ne disait pas . Elle affirme être une des premières auteurs jeunesse à avoir abordé les horreurs des pensionnats en se basant sur des documents d’époque. Bibliothèques et archives Canada ﻿ (Nouvelle fenêtre) ﻿ a déjà écrit à propos de ce livre que Sylvie Brien [y] aborde avec justesse le sujet des pensionnats où les jeunes autochtones, arrachés à leur famille, étaient éduqués loin de leurs parents et de leurs traditions . Des biographies jetées au recyclage Deux biographies de Jacques-Cartier publiées dans les années 1980 ont été retirées pour des informations jugées désuètes et fausses . La biographie de l’explorateur Étienne Brûlé, Le Fils des Hurons , a aussi fait les frais du comité, notamment pour fausse information historique .

Leur travail a reçu plusieurs distinctions ﻿ (Nouvelle fenêtre) ﻿ . On a été très rigoureux dans notre recherche et on trouve ça très décevant , réagit Jean-Claude Larocque. Le Fils des Hurons est inspiré de la thèse de doctorat de l’archéologue Bruce G. Trigger. Les travaux de ce dernier ont été tellement appréciés et reconnus qu’il a reçu le titre de membre honoraire de la Nation Huronne-Wendat ﻿ (Nouvelle fenêtre) ﻿ . C’est une pure censure!

Une citation de : Jean-Claude Larocque, coauteur du livre Le Fils des Hurons Est-ce qu’on retourne à l’Index , demande Jean-Claude Larocque, en référence à la liste des livres interdits dans les écoles catholiques jusqu’aux années 1960. Suzy Kies juge que ce sont des histoires écrites par les Européens, d’une perspective euro-centriste et non pas des Autochtones . Elle affirme que les « gardiens du savoir », comme elle, qui mémorisent la connaissance transmise oralement, sont plus fiables que les archives écrites. C’est ça le problème, ils ont fait des recherches historiques basées sur les comptes-rendus des européens. [...] On n’essaie pas d’effacer l’Histoire, on essaie de la corriger. Une citation de : Suzy Kies, « gardienne du savoir » autochtone qui a accompagné le conseil scolaire Le comité de révision reproche aussi à la biographie d’Étienne Brûlé une représentation fautive dans les dessins .

Photo : Editions de La Martinière Jeunesse Selon le comité formé par le Conseil scolaire, dessiner des Autochtones torse nu constitue de la fausse représentation et a justifié d’éliminer des tablettes un livre pour enfants. Sur cette question, l’avis des spécialistes est moins tranché. Oui, s’il faisait chaud, les hommes étaient torse nu. Les femmes aussi, à l’occasion , affirme la professeure de sociologie à l’UQAM Leila Inksetter, membre du Centre interuniversitaire d’études et de recherches autochtones. Nous avons demandé l’avis de l’anthropologue Nicole O’Bomsawin, membre de la communauté d’Odanak et ex-directrice du musée des Abénakis de 1984 à 2006. C’est un peu gênant de voir la représentation des autochtones torses nus dans des contes pour enfants , explique-t-elle. J’imagine mal des guerriers torse nu . Aller à la pêche ou à la chasse torse nu, ça ne doit pas être facile d’affronter les mouches noires. Une citation de : Nicole O’Bomsawin, anthropologue autochtone La sexualisation des femmes autochtones a aussi dérangé le Conseil scolaire catholique Providence. Suzi Kies déplore la sexualisation de l’Autochtone qui tombe en amour avec Obélix dans Astérix et les Indiens . La jeune femme est représentée avec un décolleté plongeant et une mini-jupe. Irais-tu courir dans les bois avec une mini-jupe? Mais les gens le croient pareil , regrette-t-elle. On a développé ce qu’on appelle la sauvagesse sexuelle, une image des femmes autochtones comme étant des femmes faciles. Pocahontas, elle est tellement sexuelle et sensuelle, pour nous, les femmes autochtones, c’est dangereux.

Photo : Disney Que devrait-on faire avec tous ces livres ? On ne peut pas les enlever. Je ne suis pas certaine que c’est la bonne chose à faire. Ça fait partie d’une époque , répond l’anthropologue autochtone Nicole O’Bomsawin. Durant sa carrière, elle a visité des centaines d'écoles et rencontré des milliers d'étudiants au Québec pour partager une autre version de l'histoire, faire tomber les préjugés et les stéréotypes et aussi actualiser l'image de l'amérindien. Selon Madame O’Bomsawin, il faudrait quand même aviser les bibliothécaires qu’il faut faire attention aux stéréotypes . Nicole O’Bomsawin fait le parallèle avec les gens qui veulent déboulonner des statues. Il y aurait moyen de faire une mise en contexte sur le lieu et faire en sorte qu’il y ait une explication pour parler de l’Histoire, plutôt que d’effacer l’Histoire. Les bibliothécaires scolaires du Québec sont de cet avis. Nos valeurs sont d’aller le moins possible vers la censure, car certains enseignants peuvent décider d’aborder des livres controversés comme choix pédagogique de contre-exemple , dit Ariane Régnier, présidente de l’Association pour la promotion des services documentaires scolaires. Je pense que c’est sain d’avoir toutes sortes de livres dans le milieu [scolaire], même des livres qui peuvent susciter des malaises. Une citation de : Ariane Régnier, bibliothécaire scolaire et présidente de l’Association pour la promotion des services documentaires scolaires Des écoles québécoises auraient décidé de garder des livres controversés, mais de les ranger dans un endroit spécial. Selon Ariane Régnier, il n’y a pas de centre de service scolaire au Québec qui a entamé un processus semblable à celui du sud-ouest ontarien. Les livres ont été retirés des bibliothèques des 30 écoles francophones du conseil scolaire Providence, dans le sud-ouest de l'Ontario. Photo : Radio-Canada / Benoit Jobin La représentante des bibliothécaires scolaires québécois explique que chaque enseignant est libre de retirer ou non un livre de sa classe. Selon elle, c’est aussi la responsabilité de bien accompagner l’élève dans sa lecture, de faire la mise en contexte . Suzy Kies n’est pas de cet avis. Dans un monde idéal, on pourrait prendre le temps d’expliquer la situation à chaque enfant, avec chaque livre, mais on ne vit pas dans ce monde-là. Selon la gardienne du savoir , on peut très bien parler des livres en question sans demander aux enfants d’aller les lire. Quand les enfants seront à l’université, ils pourront faire la distinction. Les enfants dépendent de nous pour leur ce qui est vrai ou faux, ce qui est bien ou mal.

Une légende qui raconte la création de l’Île-du-Prince-Édouard et la vie des Mi’kmaq a été retirée des bibliothèques du Conseil scolaire Providence, sous le prétexte que les auteurs ne sont pas Mi’kmaq. Un autre livre intitulé Les Indiens , publié en 2000, a été jeté au recyclage, entre autres parce qu’il s’agit d’un produit de France, sans consultation des communautés autochtones du Canada . Selon Suzy Kies, un livre sur les Autochtones ne peut pas être écrit par un non-Autochtone, à moins qu’un Autochtone ait révisé ou collaboré à l'œuvre. Jamais à propos de nous sans nous , dit-elle, en citant un principe qui fait de plus en plus son chemin . Depuis peu, la maison d’édition Prise de parole, en Ontario, fait une révision culturelle par des Autochtones des livres qui portent sur des sujets autochtones. Certaines maisons d’édition le font aussi au Québec. Des auteurs autochtones sont aussi passés à la trappe Même des auteurs autochtones ou de parents autochtones ont été envoyés au recyclage, à cause de l’usage de mots jugés inappropriés. Le roman jeunesse Hiver Indien , de Michel Noël a été écarté pour propos raciste , langage plus acceptable , information fausse , pouvoir des Blancs sur les Autochtones , et incapacité des Autochtones de fonctionner sans les Blancs .

Il y a une différence entre intégrer le livre ou pas dans un cours et le retirer d’une bibliothèque.

Une citation de : Arnaud Foulon, vice-président d'Hurtubise et président de l'Association nationale des éditeurs de livres Le philosophe spécialiste de l’éducation Normand Baillargeon amène une réflexion nuancée sur le sujet. Que le moment soit venu de repenser ce que l’on enseigne sur l’Histoire autochtone, c’est normal et sain , mais que l’on brûle des livres me semble extrêmement troublant, ça a des relents historiques que je n’aime pas du tout. L'auteur et philosophe Normand Baillargeon Photo : Radio-Canada / Mathieu Arsenault Selon lui, il peut y avoir des raisons de retirer un livre, par exemple s’il contient des faussetés objectivement constatables . Mais le philosophe précise que les raisons devraient être très sérieuses, étudiées très attentivement . Normand Baillargeon ajoute d’autres nuances : Ce n’est pas la même chose d’avoir un langage inacceptable dans un récit fantastique, avec un personnage, que dans un livre d’Histoire . De la même façon, ce n’est pas la même chose d’avoir un dessin fautif quand il s’agit d’une bande dessinée, que quand il s’agit d’une encyclopédie . Imaginez que tous les groupes sociaux se mettent à réclamer qu’on coupe ce qui ne fait pas leur affaire. Une grande quantité de livres seraient rapidement éliminés des bibliothèques. Une citation de : Normand Baillargeon, philosophe spécialiste en éducation Le ministère de l’Éducation de l’Ontario explique que le choix des livres dans les bibliothèques relève de la responsabilité de chaque conseil scolaire. Ils doivent s’assurer qu’un processus efficace est en place afin de procéder à la sélection et à l’approbation des ressources qui seront utilisées dans les écoles et que les ressources sélectionnées sont exemptes de tout préjugé et de toute forme de discrimination et qu’elles favorisent l’inclusion , explique la porte-parole du ministère, Ingrid Anderson.

        "text": "Straight Talk Lower Kootenay Band says remains of 182 human beings found in unmarked graves near residential school by Charlie Smith on June 30th, 2021 at 10:56 AM 1 of 1 2 of 1 A third large gravesite has been found near a residential school in Canada in just over a month. The Lower Kootenay Band says that a search using ground-penetrating radar has located the remains of 182 people. They were in unmarked graves south of the former St. Eugene's Mission Residential School near Cranbrook. Some of the graves were as shallow as three to four feet. \"It is believed that the remains of these 182 souls are from the member Bands of the ktunaxa nation, neighbouring First Nations communities, & the community of aqam,\" the band said in a statement. According to the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia, the first Kootenay or St. Eugene's residential school opened in 1890. It was replaced in 1912. The school was operated through much of its history by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. It is a missionary congregation of the Catholic Church founded in 1816 by a French priest, Saint Eugène de Mazenod. \"An Indian Agent reported in 1935 that, as a result of poor food, overwork, and sickness, he had to force parents to send their children to the school,\" the IRSHDC states on its website. \"Despite a change in the principal, school attendance and runaways were ongoing problems. There were also recurring outbreaks of influenza, mumps, measles, chicken pox, and tuberculosis.\" The federal government took over operations of the residence in 1969 before closing it the following year. The IRSHDC states that the students came from the following home communities: St. Mary's; Lower Kootenay; Tobacco Plains; Lower Similkameen; Similkameen; Okanagan; Inkamoop / Inkammoep / Inkameep; Termission; Creston; Vernon; Enderby; Comox; Little Shuswap; Upper Nicola; Spallumchene / Spallumcheon / Sallumchene; North Thompson; Lake Similk.; Neskainlith; Tsartlip; Osoyoos; Penticton; Columbia Lake; Shuswap; Tsartlip; Westbank; Athelmer; Cranbrook; Kamloops; Cardston and Seabird Island. One of the former principals, Rev. G.P. Dunlop, left in 1958 to become the head of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, which was also run by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. On May 27, Kukpi7 (Chief) Rosanne Casimir of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc Nation disclosed that the remains of 215 Indigenous children had been found on the grounds of the former Kamloops school in unmarked graves. Casimir said at the time that these deaths were \"undocumented\". It's not known when the bodies were buried. That was followed on June 24 by Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme's revelation that 751 unmarked graves were found near the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. It was also operated by the Catholic Church. In the Cranbrook area, local First Nations have converted the former residential school into the St. Eugene Golf Resort & Casino , which includes a 125-room hotel. \"The beautiful Spanish-colonial-styled Resort you see today was once the St. Eugene Mission, a residential school for First Nations youth,\" the website states. \"Today, we employ approximately 250 people and have become an entertainment destination for people across North America. The owners and associates at St. Eugene Golf Resort & Casino are proudly devoted to sharing our First Nations culture as well as the history of our magnificent Resort.\" Click here to report a typo.

(Cpl. Justin Dreimanis/DND-MDN Canada/Reuters) Social Sharing Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are back on home soil, almost three years after they were first detained in China. The two men landed in Calgary shortly before 8 a.m. ET Saturday aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force Challenger aircraft. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau were at the airport to welcome the two men, who had flown from China along with ambassador Dominic Barton. Trudeau announced Friday evening that the two were out of Chinese airspace, just hours after the extradition case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was dropped. Meng reached a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities related to fraud charges against her on Friday and landed back in China Saturday morning. Michael Kovrig reboarded a plane in Calgary to fly on to Toronto, where Vina Nadjibulla, his wife (separated), and his sister Ariana Botha spoke before he landed. \"There are no words to describe the emotions that have been running through us these last 24 hours. Joy, relief, overwhelming gratitude for everyone who has worked to make this happen,\" Nadjibulla said. Michael Kovrig, middle, with his wife (separated) Vina Nadjibulla, left, and sister Ariana Botha after arriving at Pearson International Airport in Toronto on Saturday. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press) She said she had spoken over the phone with Kovrig while he was in Calgary and said he felt it was like \"coming into another world.\" Kovrig spoke briefly to reporters after he landed early Saturday afternoon, saying he felt \"fantastic.\" Kovrig, a diplomat, and Spavor, an entrepreneur who worked in North Korea and China, were first detained in December 2018 — just after Meng was arrested in Canada on behalf of U.S. authorities. Their detention is widely considered to be a retaliatory action in response to the Huawei executive's arrest. Michael Spavor gives a thumbs up after landing in Calgary Saturday morning. He and Michael Kovrig returned home after being detained in China for nearly three years. (Colin Hall/CBC) 'Sorry for the inconvenience caused': Meng Chinese authorities had consistently denied that the cases were linked. In a statement Saturday, China's foreign ministry said the charges against Meng were \"purely fabricated.\" \"It has long been a fully proven fact that this is an incident of political persecution against a Chinese citizen, an act designed to hobble Chinese high-tech companies,\" the statement said. Spavor was found guilty of spying and sentenced to 11 years in prison and deportation by a Chinese court in August. The trial for Kovrig concluded in March, but he had not yet been sentenced.

Speaking Friday outside a Vancouver courthouse after her extradition case was dropped, Meng thanked the court and the Canadian government for \"upholding the rule of law.\" \"I'm also grateful to the Canadian people and media friends for your tolerance. Sorry for the inconvenience caused,\" she said. Meng spent her time in Canada under house arrest at her multimillion-dollar home in Vancouver, in stark contrast to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who endured poor conditions in detention and whose legal processes were criticized by Canadian officials. Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said Spavor's sentencing followed a \"mock sham trial.\" Welcome home, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Experts Colin Robertson, Guy Saint-Jacques and Lynette Ong join The House to discuss. Robertson told CBC's The House \"it really was one for the other\" in an exchange that was reminiscent of Cold War swaps. \"The timing, it's totally undeniable that the two Michaels were unjustly detained because of the arrest of Ms. Meng in Vancouver,\" Lynette Ong, a specialist on China at the Munk School of Global Affairs, told The House host Chris Hall. The rapid series of events Friday \"was a surprise,\" said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa.

They arrived in Calgary aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force Challenger on Saturday morning, and Kovrig later flew to Toronto. She noted that Spavor's and Kovrig's detention had already sent a message to other countries \"that if they cross China, then Beijing will just pick up a couple of their citizens and hold them hostage.\" \"And that's a chilling message for other countries to be receiving today.\" Robertson said Canadians should give significant credit for the release of the men to U.S. President Joe Biden. \"As the prime minister said, this was the top issue in terms of Canada-China relations, but also a top issue in Canada-U.S. relations,\" he said. \"President Biden has delivered now for Justin Trudeau.

He shares his reaction to the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and what he went through after being released by the Chinese government. Changed relationship with China The release of the two men was enthusiastically welcomed by Canadian politicians late Friday. Trudeau has said the return of the so-called \"two Michaels\" has been a top foreign policy priority for the government. David Morrison, a foreign affairs and defence adviser to the prime minister, and Kirsten Hillman, ambassador to the United States, were both deeply involved in the efforts leading up to the release of the two Michaels. But the prime minister deflected questions Friday about how the return on the two men would affect Canada's relationship with China. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are on their way home! Our family shares the elation of millions of Canadians that our citizens are coming home. Thank you to all diplomats involved! 🇨🇦 &mdash; @erinotoole Guy Saint-Jacques, who served as Canada's ambassador to China from 2012 to 2016, said it is impossible to ignore China, given its strength and importance in the world, but the approach should be \"strategic\" and \"restrained.\" \"The message to China is simple, it's we have no problem with you being a superpower. But as long as you respect international treaties, international obligations and you don't engage in bullying tactics,\" he said. Ong said she believes the relationship with China has been permanently damaged. She said public opinion in Canada has turned decisively against China and a return to normal would be \"very hard\" to execute. \"I don't think Canada-China relations could actually be repaired.

Story continues below advertisement Canada pledged $15 million to the so-called Elsie Initiative, part of a package of financial commitments totalling more than $45 million for UN programs and peacekeeping missions. But UN officials had been fervently holding out hope that the Trudeau government, which has repeatedly asserted its support for peacekeeping over the years, would agree to their request to extend the Mali mission. The UN wrote a letter last month in which it asked the government “to consider a short extension of its contribution,” specifically to continue full operations until Sept. 15 and more limited operations until the Romanians arrived.

The UN, which has faced shrinking budgets for peacekeeping, says a short extension by Canada would be more cost efficient given that Canada already has the people and equipment in Mali for the mission. Civilian helicopters also aren’t able to provide the same level of comprehensive medical treatment the Canadians are set up to offer, the UN has said, and are more restricted in when and where they can operate. WATCH: Treacherous conditions for Canada’s troops in Mali 2:21 Exclusive: Treacherous conditions for Canada’s troops in Mali Critics have pointed to the Liberals’ refusal to extend the Mali mission as emblematic of the government’s failure to make good on its larger promise to support the UN and peacekeeping.

La Presse canadienne à Ottawa Publié le 12 janv. 2019 Société Trois personnes ont été tuées et 23 autres ont été blessées, vendredi, à Ottawa, lorsqu’un autobus à impériale a heurté un abribus. L’accident s’est produit à 15 h 50, en pleine heure de pointe du vendredi, à la gare de Westboro, en banlieue ouest d’Ottawa. L’autobus se dirigeait vers la banlieue de Kanata, a relaté le maire d’Ottawa Jim Watson en conférence de presse en soirée. Deux des victimes étaient dans l’autobus, l’autre était dans l’abribus. Le centre de traumatologie de l’hôpital d’Ottawa disait avoir reçu neuf patients « dans un état grave ». Les photos publiées sur Twitter montrent d’importants dégâts à l’avant de l’imposant véhicule de tourisme, le toit de l’abribus bien encastré dans le deuxième étage de l’autobus à impériale. « La plupart des blessures graves sont survenues sur le côté supérieur droit de l’autobus », a affirmé le chef de la police d’Ottawa, Charles Bordeleau qui a offert ses condoléances aux familles des victimes au nom de tous les services d’urgence. La police enquête toujours sur la cause de l’accident. La chauffeuse d’autobus a été arrêtée sur place et elle a été interrogée par les enquêteurs, a ajouté M. Bordeleau. Elle a été relâchée en fin de soirée. Elle ne fait face à aucune accusation pour l’instant. Longue enquête Le chef de police a refusé d’en dire plus sur les raisons de l’arrestation de la chauffeuse. Il s’est contenté de répéter que les policiers avaient observé des choses qui nécessitaient d’emmener la femme au poste. « Ce sera une longue enquête », a-t-il prévenu. Il a précisé que l’enquête allait se poursuivre toute la nuit et une partie de la journée de samedi. Le chef du service ambulancier, Myles Cassidy, a confirmé le transport de 25 personnes à l’hôpital. Ce qui laisse croire que l’une des victimes n’aurait pas pu être ranimée sur place et que les deux autres ont rendu l’âme à l’hôpital. L’accident a provoqué un important embouteillage alors que les équipes d’urgence se rendaient sur les lieux. La police exhortait les résidants à éviter le secteur, et les autobus de la société OC Transpo ont été déroutés. Les réactions ont afflué sur les réseaux sociaux dans la foulée du drame. « Je présente mes plus sincères condoléances aux familles des victimes et à toutes les personnes touchées par le tragique accident d’autobus survenu aujourd’hui à Ottawa.

Mayors argue the religious symbol is a heritage object CBC News · Posted: Apr 02, 2019 4:30 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 3, 2019 Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume says the crucifix hanging in the chambers at Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. (Daniel Coulombe/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Less than a week after the CAQ government said once its religious neutrality legislation, Bill 21, passes, it will remove the crucifix that has hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly for more than eight decades, two major Quebec municipalities have announced they will not be following suit. Quebec City and Sherbrooke have both announced the crucifix on the wall of their respective city council chambers will stay put — unlike in Montreal, where Mayor Valérie Plante announced last month the crucifix in that city's chamber would be removed. In Quebec City, the debate over whether the crucifix should be removed hasn't come up in the council chambers, the vice-chair of the executive committee, Coun. Rémy Normand, said last month. Mayor Régis Labeaume said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. POINT/COUNTERPOINT Should the crucifix in Quebec's National Assembly come down? Labeaume said the crucifix in Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. \"I don't like it when people trivialize the past,\" Labeaume said Thursday. \"Believe me, I'm secular. I don't necessarily practise religion.\" In Sherbrooke, elected officials ruled Monday night the crucifix will remain in the chambers of city council chambers and the borough council. (Daniel Mailloux/Radio-Canada) Sherbrooke city council votes Meanwhile, in Sherbrooke, council voted Monday night for the crucifix to remain on the wall of city council chambers, as well as borough council chambers. Ten councillors voted to keep the crucifix in the room, and five against. Coun. Annie Godbout said the question was met with passionate debate. \"I would have preferred to take the time to see how the debate will unfold in Quebec,\" Godbout said. \"I'm extremely disappointed with how we went about this.\" Sherbrooke Mayor Steve Lussier said he sees the crucifix as a symbol of the past. \"If it stays, for me, it doesn't change anything,\" Lussier said. Crucifix in Montreal council chambers coming down, executive committee says In Montreal, Mayor Valérie Plante said the decision to remove the crucifix was a recognition of the role of secularism in a democratic institution. The crucifix is an important part of Montreal's heritage and history, but as a symbol, it does not reflect the modern reality of secularism in democratic institutions, Plante said. The cross will be placed in a special museum space at City Hall that will be accessible to all Montrealers, she said. The crucifix that's hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly since 1936 will also find a new home elsewhere in the government building, in the wake of the motion promising to remove it that passed on March 28 — the same day the controversial religious symbols bill was tabled. Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. (Daniel Coulombe/Radio-Canada) The motion passed easily, although just last fall, a newly elected Premier François Legault had said the crucifix was there to stay — describing it not as a religious symbol but a historical one. Quebec government's proposed secularism law would ban public workers from wearing religious symbols Legault said the CAQ government's initiative to take down the crucifix was meant as a sign of good faith to Quebecers who oppose Bill 21 that he is willing to compromise. Other cities' plans Trois-Rivières, in Quebec's Mauricie region, has a cross hanging in the council chambers and a crucifix in a side room where the council gathers before public meetings. The council has not taken an official position on moving or removing the cross and crucifix, said city spokesperson Cynthia Simard. Gatineau and Saguenay don't have crucifixes in their city council chambers. A spokesperson for Saguenay said the city doesn't want to wade into the controversial debate. In 2015, a Supreme Court ruling forced former Saguenay Mayor Jean Tremblay to stop reciting a Catholic prayer at the start of city council meetings. At a 2015 news conference, Tremblay invoked the memory of Quebec's religious founders, saying \"we are all children of these people.\" He made reference to Quebec's motto, as well — \"Je me souviens,\" or \"I remember.\" Former Saguenay mayor Jean Tremblay led a battle to retain the recitation of a Catholic prayer before council meetings all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, but lost in April 2015. (CBC) \"We have to stand up for our customs, for our traditions,\" Tremblay said. The legal battle surrounded the prayer and the presence of the Sacred Heart statue, and not a crucifix, a Saguenay spokesperson said.

After years of opposition from some members of the Red Chamber — who said they feared televising debates would undermine their quality — administrators will flip the switch on Monday. Social Sharing 42 years after the House of Commons began broadcasting, Senate chamber proceedings to be televised John Paul Tasker · CBC News · Posted: Mar 18, 2019 4:48 PM ET | Last Updated: March 19, 2019 The Senate of Canada building and Senate Chamber are pictured in Ottawa on Monday, Feb. 18, 2019. The Senate will remain in what is Ottawa's Old Train Station during the renovations of the Parliament Hill Centre Block. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) Starting today, and for the first time ever, the Senate of Canada's chamber proceedings will be televised. The change comes after years of opposition from some members of the Red Chamber — who said they feared televising debates would undermine their quality. While the debates in the House of Commons have been beamed into the nation's homes since 1977 , the upper house has been notably camera-shy. In fact, the Senate is believed to be the last legislative chamber in the Western world that hasn't televised its proceedings. To date, only people willing to attend Senate proceedings in person, listen to streamed audio or read next-day transcripts have been privy to all that goes on in the place. Senator Claude Carignan said the lack of cameras in the chamber has left Canadians with an incomplete understanding of what senators do. (Sean Kilpatrick/CP) (There have been notable exceptions to the no-camera rule for high-profile moments, including some of the Senate's debates on assisted dying legislation and cannabis legalization .) Playing to the cameras Some members of the Senate have said they fear bringing in broadcast equipment will change fundamentally the nature of debate in a chamber of appointees that was designed to offer \"sober second thought\" on government business. Some senators worry that members of the upper house — who traditionally have carried out their work with a minimum of partisan rancour — will become like so many MPs who prefer playing to the cameras to engaging in serious debate. Conservative Manitoba Sen. Don Plett said as much in an interview with the National Post, arguing that the presence of cameras has turned some MPs into actors. \"I would like to believe that it will maybe improve behaviour, and maybe it will,\" he said. \"But my fear is that it will do the opposite, it will make us more flamboyant and it will make us put on shows for the camera.\" Sen. Peter Harder speaks on Parliament Hill. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press) B.C. Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, the leader (or 'facilitator') of the Independent Senators Group, said that while he thinks broadcasting generally is a good idea — and could discourage some of the \" obstructionist activity \" he's seen in the place in recent months — he fears an increase in \"theatrics\" by some members of the Conservative opposition. Woo told CBC News that while sunlight can be the best disinfectant, \"sunlight also encourages people to grandstand, to put on displays of partisan activity. \"If in fact we have senators trying to use broadcasting as a platform for electioneering or partisanship point-scoring, that would become very obvious to the viewers ... and will be very less desirable from my perspective,\" he said. \"It's left to be seen ... We're hoping broadcasting will bring out the best in our efforts to be less partisan and to demonstrate to Canadians that this place is not a mirror of the House of Commons. We are not here to replicate their work ... (to) mimic the partisan antics in the House. We are a complementary chamber.\" Other members of the Senate say they believe that by broadcasting more of the chamber's work (most Senate committees have been broadcast on the Cable Public Affairs Channel — CPAC — and online for some time), they'll be able to do a better job of showing Canadians what senators actually do. Conservative Quebec Sen. Claude Carignan, the former leader of the Conservative party in the Senate, supports the change and endorsed the Senate modernization committee's report on the matter . \"Because the work of the Senate is not televised, unlike the work of its committees, Canadians are misinformed about the concrete action being taken by senators in shaping our country's legislation. Canadians do not see how much discussion and debate occurs regarding bills that will affect them,\" Carignan said. 'Very concerning': Senate watchdog hasn't finished an ethics probe since 2017 Senate rejects calls for outside oversight of expenses Senate proceedings should be televised, committee says \"Broadcasting our proceedings will surely be a new and important step on our journey toward transparency in the Senate and in our efforts to make the public aware of senators' legislative work. The lack of visual exposure gives people the impression that the Senate is outdated.\" Following the Senate expenses scandal, the internal economy subcommittee on communications commissioned a study — a \"blueprint\" on how to move forward after years of bad press, while improving its outreach with the media and the public. One of the report's recommendations, ultimately approved by the Senate, was to broadcast the chamber's proceedings on TV through an agreement with CPAC and on the Senate's own website. And now that the Senate has settled into its new temporary home in the former Ottawa train station while Centre Block undergoes a decade-long renovation, senators are now finally ready for their on-camera debut. 'A necessary evil' \"Broadcasting from the chamber is inevitable. It's a necessary evil. It compounds the perception that we are a private club, non-transparent and not accountable, if we don't broadcast,\" one unnamed senator told the auditors preparing the communications blueprint report. The report did document some entrenched skepticism. \"I have mixed feelings about TV in the Chamber because, [while] it could contribute to transparency and we do televise committees, in the Chamber … the leader is the only one rising to speak [in Question Period] and he is … very scripted. It's not an accurate reflection of the Senate's good work,\" one said. \"I am not in favour of cameras in the Chamber as it will not serve us well. It will damage us because we have duty rosters that say that half of us are in the Chamber at a time, so that's not a good camera shot,\" another senator said. Regular viewers of Commons proceedings will notice some differences if they tune into the Senate. The government's representative in the Senate, Ontario Sen. Peter Harder, fields virtually all of the questions in question period — a Q&A session that typically isn't quite as long as the one in the Commons. Before the expenses scandal and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's reforms, the Senate government leader (or \"representative\") usually was the only member of cabinet who sat in the Senate — the only one who could speak with ministerial authority on government matters. Harder has taken on the job even though he sits outside cabinet and identifies as a \"non-affiliated\" member of the Senate. Since the reforms, some ministers have appeared before the Senate for special 40-minute \"ministerial question periods.\" Also, senators don't have to address the Speaker when making their remarks or engaging in debate in the chamber; they speak directly to one another for most exchanges. In the Commons, everything must go through the Speaker and MPs cannot use a member's name. And unlike the House, the Senate runs through the order paper in full each day so that any senator can speak to an active issue. This can make for a more time-consuming process.

(Daniel Coulombe/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Less than a week after the CAQ government said once its religious neutrality legislation, Bill 21, passes, it will remove the crucifix that has hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly for more than eight decades, two major Quebec municipalities have announced they will not be following suit. Quebec City and Sherbrooke have both announced the crucifix on the wall of their respective city council chambers will stay put — unlike in Montreal, where Mayor Valérie Plante announced last month the crucifix in that city's chamber would be removed. In Quebec City, the debate over whether the crucifix should be removed hasn't come up in the council chambers, the vice-chair of the executive committee, Coun. Rémy Normand, said last month. Mayor Régis Labeaume said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. POINT/COUNTERPOINT Should the crucifix in Quebec's National Assembly come down? Labeaume said the crucifix in Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. \"I don't like it when people trivialize the past,\" Labeaume said Thursday. \"Believe me, I'm secular. I don't necessarily practise religion.\" In Sherbrooke, elected officials ruled Monday night the crucifix will remain in the chambers of city council chambers and the borough council. (Daniel Mailloux/Radio-Canada) Sherbrooke city council votes Meanwhile, in Sherbrooke, council voted Monday night for the crucifix to remain on the wall of city council chambers, as well as borough council chambers. Ten councillors voted to keep the crucifix in the room, and five against. Coun. Annie Godbout said the question was met with passionate debate. \"I would have preferred to take the time to see how the debate will unfold in Quebec,\" Godbout said. \"I'm extremely disappointed with how we went about this.\" Sherbrooke Mayor Steve Lussier said he sees the crucifix as a symbol of the past. \"If it stays, for me, it doesn't change anything,\" Lussier said. Crucifix in Montreal council chambers coming down, executive committee says In Montreal, Mayor Valérie Plante said the decision to remove the crucifix was a recognition of the role of secularism in a democratic institution. The crucifix is an important part of Montreal's heritage and history, but as a symbol, it does not reflect the modern reality of secularism in democratic institutions, Plante said. The cross will be placed in a special museum space at City Hall that will be accessible to all Montrealers, she said. The crucifix that's hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly since 1936 will also find a new home elsewhere in the government building, in the wake of the motion promising to remove it that passed on March 28 — the same day the controversial religious symbols bill was tabled. Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. (Daniel Coulombe/Radio-Canada) The motion passed easily, although just last fall, a newly elected Premier François Legault had said the crucifix was there to stay — describing it not as a religious symbol but a historical one. Quebec government's proposed secularism law would ban public workers from wearing religious symbols Legault said the CAQ government's initiative to take down the crucifix was meant as a sign of good faith to Quebecers who oppose Bill 21 that he is willing to compromise. Other cities' plans Trois-Rivières, in Quebec's Mauricie region, has a cross hanging in the council chambers and a crucifix in a side room where the council gathers before public meetings. The council has not taken an official position on moving or removing the cross and crucifix, said city spokesperson Cynthia Simard. Gatineau and Saguenay don't have crucifixes in their city council chambers. A spokesperson for Saguenay said the city doesn't want to wade into the controversial debate. In 2015, a Supreme Court ruling forced former Saguenay Mayor Jean Tremblay to stop reciting a Catholic prayer at the start of city council meetings. At a 2015 news conference, Tremblay invoked the memory of Quebec's religious founders, saying \"we are all children of these people.\" He made reference to Quebec's motto, as well — \"Je me souviens,\" or \"I remember.\" Former Saguenay mayor Jean Tremblay led a battle to retain the recitation of a Catholic prayer before council meetings all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, but lost in April 2015. (CBC) \"We have to stand up for our customs, for our traditions,\" Tremblay said. The legal battle surrounded the prayer and the presence of the Sacred Heart statue, and not a crucifix, a Saguenay spokesperson said.

(RCMP) Social Sharing RCMP believe they have found the bodies of B.C. fugitives Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky in northern Manitoba, ending a lengthy cross-Canada search for the suspects in three killings that gripped the world. The remains of two men were found Wednesday at around 10 a.m local time in dense brush, eight kilometres northeast of where a burnt-out Toyota RAV4, which police believe the two fugitives were driving, was found. The bodies of tourists Chynna Deese and Lucas Fowler, left, were found near Liard Hot Springs, B.C., on July 15. University lecturer Leonard Dyck, right, was found dead four days later near Dease Lake, B.C. (New South Wales Police; University of British Columbia) \"At this time, we believe that these are the bodies of the two suspects wanted in connection with the homicides in British Columbia,\" said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of the Manitoba RCMP. Autopsies in Winnipeg on Thursday will determine, conclusively, the identities of the bodies and causes of death, the RCMP said. Police were seen loading caskets onto an RCMP plane in Gillam Wednesday evening. McLeod, 19, and Schmegelsky, whose 19th birthday was Aug. 4, are suspects in three homicides in northern British Columbia. Timeline: How 3 killings in B.C. turned into the cross-Canada pursuit of 2 teenagers The pair were charged July 24 with second-degree murder in the death of botanist Leonard Dyck. The 64-year-old was found dead July 19 at a highway pullout about two kilometres from a burnt-out camper truck — believed to be driven by McLeod and Schmegelsky — south of the B.C.'s Stikine River Bridge on Highway 37. The lifelong friends are also suspected of gunning down a young couple, Lucas Fowler, 23, an Australian, and Chynna Deese, 24, an American. Their bodies were found on Alaska Highway, south of Liard Hot Springs, B.C., on July 15. MacLatchy said she hopes Wednesday's announcement brings closure. \"I know it has been so very difficult,\" she said. Sheila Deese, the mother of Chynna Deese, declined to speak with CBC News about the RCMP's discovery Wednesday, saying she is \"speechless.\" Over the course of 16 days, RCMP scoured more than 11,000 square kilometres in northern Manitoba — an area about twice the size of P.E.I. — and logged more than 4,500 hours during the search. The shell of a burnt-out Toyota RAV4 was found near Fox Lake Cree Nation in northern Manitoba. (Billy Beardy) Officers, with help from the military, searched from the air, by boat, underwater, through spongy, wet muskeg and amid dense scrub, teeming with insects. The two men considered themselves survivalists, Schmegelsky's father told Victoria's CHEK News. But locals warned that the remote area was treacherous, home to bears, and impossible for someone without local knowledge to navigate. For nearly two weeks, the key evidence tracing the two suspects to the area was a confirmed sighting of the pair on July 22 and the burnt remains of the Toyota SUV, which was found the same day in Fox Lake Cree Nation, on a dead-end road into Manitoba's north. On Wednesday, the RCMP confirmed the vehicle belonged to Dyck. The RCMP scoured more than 11,000 square kilometres in northern Manitoba. (Gilbert Rowan/CBC) As concerns about the two men spread, places like Sudbury, Ont., and Kapuskasing, Ont., reported alleged sightings. RCMP received more than 1,000 tips. Search crews in Manitoba briefly shifted focus to York Landing, Man., on July 28 after a volunteer with the Bear Clan reported seeing them near the dump. The tip led nowhere. The hunt spanned four provinces and more than 2,000 kilometres, with the fugitives choosing remote, isolated routes to evade detection. \"This is like travelling from London to Moscow, to put things in perspective,\" said B.C. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Kevin Hackett. Hackett called it one of the most unpredictable investigations he's had in recent years. Buggy, boggy and brutal: Area of northern Manitoba search is unforgiving, experts say On July 31, after nine days without a trace of the two men, the RCMP announced they were scaling down the search. But as MacLatchy noted on Wednesday, they didn't stop looking. \"We knew we needed just to find that one piece of evidence,\" she said. Two days later, on Friday, police got a break. A damaged boat and several personal items linked to the fugitives were found along the Nelson River which flows north between Gillam and Fox Lake and eventually empties into Hudson Bay. \"Following this discovery, we were at last able to narrow down the search,\" said MacLatchy. The Nelson River flows north from Lake Winnipeg to Hudson Bay, and Gillam is located near its banks. (Angela Johnston/CBC) Clint Sawchuk, owner of Nelson River Adventures, thinks he might have helped draw RCMP attention to the wide, fast-moving river that powers several hydro-electric dams. He spotted what appeared to be a sleeping bag caught in willows and reported it to the RCMP. He believes the Mounties spotted the boat as they flew by helicopter to investigate. \"I'm very happy it's over and they found them,\" he said. Across northern Manitoba, there was a sigh of relief following news of the discovery. Throughout the hunt, RCMP had repeatedly warned the public they believed McLeod and Schmegelsky were armed and dangerous. Residents had locked doors and travelled in groups while the men were considered at large. A casket is loaded by RCMP into a plane near Gillam, Man. RCMP said Wednesday they believe they have found the bodies of B.C. fugitives Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky near the northern Manitoba community. (Angela Johnston/CBC) \"[I'm feeling] just a sense of relief for all communities involved in the north here … knowing that we don't have to be concerned about the presence of these individuals any longer,\" said Dwayne Forman, mayor of Gillam. In Fox Lake Cree Nation, the community where police believe McLeod and Schmegelsky abandoned the RAV4, was grateful that the search is over. \"It comes with huge relief to the community of Fox Lake Cree Nation that this ordeal may finally be coming to a conclusion,\" said Chief Walter Spence. John Peters, a resident of Fox Lake Cree Nation, said there are feelings of relief in his community — but also a sense of sadness. \"I can't speak for anyone else but I feel this ending is tragic,\" he said. \"It will feel nice to get back into the bush, though, without feeling I need to always be on the lookout, that tension will be gone.\" What we know about Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky, targets of national manhunt In Depth Transfixed by tragedy: mystery of alleged 'team killers' captures world's attention Spence and Forman plan to hold community meetings to discuss \"post-traumatic effects\" the search had, said Spence. Meanwhile, RCMP in British Columbia said late Wednesday the investigation is not over. \"We still need to ensure that our investigative findings… eliminates any other possibilities or suspects,\" said Hackett. Police said it's difficult to guess what may have been the motive behind the three killings — and it may now be impossible to determine that if the bodies are indeed those of the two men. Corrections An earlier version of this story said Bryer Schmegelsky's birthday was Aug. 5 when in fact, according to a self-published book by his father Alan Schmegelsky, he was born Aug. 4, 2000.

Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account François Legault’s government passed a ban on some public servants wearing religious symbols in a final vote late Sunday night, enshrining into law a measure decried by opposition parties, minority groups and human-rights observers as an affront to personal liberty. The National Assembly debated Bill 21 under closure in a marathon special weekend session that ended with Mr. Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec government forcing passage of the law by a 73-35 vote, with backing of the Parti Québécois. Earlier Sunday, the CAQ used its majority to push through Bill 9, a law that enables new French-language and values tests that the government says will protect Quebec identity while refocusing immigration on economic interests. The weekend in the legislature was marked by acrimony reflective of the debate that has roiled Quebec for more than 10 years over the place of religious minorities in the province. Some exhausted MNAs cursed at each other, others said they were on the verge of tears at times. At the very last minute Mr. Legault’s government added a provision to allow inspectors to verify the law is being followed. “Securalism police!” shouted Quebec Liberal member Marc Tanguay in one of the final outbursts of the debate. Another last-minute amendment said the inspector could impose corrective measures and supervision. A final addition said “the targeted employee could be subject to disciplinary measures for failing to comply.” Bill 21 will ban teachers, police, government lawyers and others in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols such as Muslim head coverings and Sikh turbans. Police officers, provincial jail guards and prosecutors who wear religious symbols are rare in Quebec but the province has dozens of female Muslim teachers. Religiously dressed teachers already on the job will have acquired rights to continue wearing the garments but they will not be able to take a transfer, promotion or new job and wear them. The law will also require people receiving or giving government services to uncover their faces for security purposes or confirming identity – a measure that mostly affects Muslim women who wear a full-face veil. The law includes the notwithstanding clause to prevent challenges based on religious freedom under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also modifies Quebec’s Charter of Rights to reduce religious rights, marking the first time the National Assembly changed the landmark 1975 rights legislation without a consensus. Religious groups and rights lawyers say they will try to strike down the law anyway. The law will most affect Muslim women and the notwithstanding clause cannot be used to shield gender-discrimination cases. Montreal school boards and some municipal leaders have said they will not apply the law. On the weekend, the School of Education at Bishop’s University became the latest group to reject the law, calling it “a dangerous precedent that creates a climate of suspicion, fear and hostility that serves to render the profession of teaching unsafe, and schools less safe, for everyone.” Several opposition members called Sunday a dark day for Quebec. Mr. Legault said he is putting to rest a divisive debate and is acting on the will of the people. His law is popular, particularly among the province’s francophone majority. “There are collective rights, and Quebeckers have a right to tell the rest of Canada, ‘This is how we live in Quebec,’” Mr. Legault told reporters. In the shadow of the Bill 21 controversy, Bill 9, the immigration law passed Sunday, is also a source of conflict. The province’s plan to deny residency to immigrants who fail French-language and values tests is in protracted negotiations with Ottawa. The bill is also controversial because it throws out 18,000 applications already filed under the old system. Iranian computer programmer Armin Khodaei first applied to immigrate to Quebec five years ago and spent more than $1,200 for test and application fees, French lessons and postage. His file is now in the dustbin. “I’ve invested a big part of my life into this project, and unfortunately I know now it was the wrong decision,” he said. Mr. Legault says applicants such as Mr. Khodaei can reapply under the new system and will get quicker answers. Mr. Khodaei, 30, says he is moving on to other potential destinations. But unanswered questions remain about Bill 21, which makes Quebec the only jurisdiction in North America with a religion-based dress code. It’s not clear who will decide if a head scarf is a fashion statement or a religious one. Just last week, Mr. Legault was uncertain if a wedding ring might be banned. (He later said it would not be.) The Quebec Liberal Party and Québec Solidaire were against the law. “We have been proud of the progress we’ve made on discrimination since we passed our bill of rights unanimously in 1975 to include religious liberty,” said Hélène David, the Liberal critic on the bill. “It’s a sad day.” Left-wing separatist Québec Solidaire MNA and co-spokesperson Sol Zanetti predicted the government will send religious minorities “into the arms of Canada to defend their rights and freedoms. Mr. Legault says he’s protecting social cohesion; it’s this law that puts social cohesion in peril.” Other hard-line Quebec nationalists said the government did not go far enough to limit religious expression. The Parti Québécois wanted the law to include daycare instructors, a job that is often a first entry point into the work force for immigrant women, including hundreds of Muslims. “The issue is coherence,” PQ interim leader Pascal Bérubé said. “Quebeckers strongly favour including daycare and private schools. Why spare them?”",

First Canadian woman to win tourney since Faye Urban in 1969 John Chidley-Hill · The Canadian Press · Posted: Aug 11, 2019 2:16 PM EDT | Last Updated: August 11, 2019 Bianca Andreescu, 19, kisses the winner's trophy after being declared Rogers Cup champion on Sunday when tennis legend Serena Williams was forced to retire from the match with a reported upper-back injury. Andreescu is the first Canadian woman to win the tourney in 50 years. (Evan Mitsui/CBC News) Social Sharing As soon as Bianca Andreescu heard that Serena Williams was retiring from their Rogers Cup final, she went to her opponent's bench, took a knee, and started consoling the veteran tennis player. Lost in that moment of empathy was the fact that Andreescu had just become the first Canadian to win the tournament in 50 years. Rogers Cup Bianca Andreescu hailed as 'old soul' in abrupt victory over Serena Williams \"I started tearing up because she was tearing up. It's because I know how she feels,\" said Andreescu on Sunday. \"Injuries really, really suck.\" Andreescu, from Mississauga, Ont., was up 3-1 in the first set at Aviva Centre when Williams called for a medical timeout. Less than a minute later, the chair umpire announced that Williams was retiring from the match, handing Andreescu her second WTA Premier title of the season. WATCH | Canadian teen sensation Bianca Andreescu wins her 1st Rogers Cup: Bianca Andreescu consoles Serena Williams after abrupt end to Rogers Cup final 6 years ago Duration 2:14 Bianca Andreescu and Serena Williams shared an emotional embrace after Williams was forced to retire from the Rogers Cup final due to injury.  Andreescu is the first Canadian woman to win the Rogers Cup since Faye Urban in 1969. \"It's not the way I wanted to win, but a win is a win so I'm really happy,\" said Andreescu, who is the first Canadian to win the title since Faye Urban of Windsor, Ont., beat Vancouver's Vicki Berner in 1969. The tournament was still played on clay courts and called the Canadian Open when Urban won. Williams was impressed with the 19-year-old Andreescu's class in that shared moment on the bench, calling her a \"great sportswoman\" and an \"old soul.\" \"She's wiser than her, what is she? Nineteen years old?\" said the 37-year-old Williams, who added that the brief encounter with Andreescu was the highlight of the tournament for her. \"She definitely doesn't seem like a 19-year old in her words, on court and her game, her attitude, her actions.\" Andreescu also won at Indian Wells in March, the beginning of a 17-match win streak, not counting when she has had to retire from matches due to injury herself. She holds victories over seven of the top 10 players in the world this season, including Williams.

Truly an inspiration to players across Canada. Today you showed tennis fans what sportsmanship is all about. &mdash; @JustinTrudeau \"I would say that the win in Indian Wells was — I mean, it was a hard-fought battle,\" said Andreescu, referring to her three-set win over No. 8 Angelique Kerber. \"So I felt like it was a sweeter victory at the time. \"But (the Rogers Cup) is at home. I've dedicated so much hard work and sweat on that tennis court and in this gym, so this tournament is definitely ten times more special.\" Lou Marsh favourite Andreescu and golfer Brooke Henderson are early front runners for the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's athlete of the year and the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award, The Canadian Press's female athlete of the year honour. Henderson has won two LPGA events this season and has set the all-time record for wins by a Canadian professional golfer. Andreescu has her two titles this season and her world ranking will rise from 27th to 14th on Monday. Her previous high was 22nd. Andreescu's Rogers Cup win was so fresh that she hadn't even considered that she might earn all-around honours like the Marsh or Rosenfeld.

But if I win that, then it would be awesome. I'm not complaining right now,\" said Andreescu. \"I haven't really thought about anything other than this win. So anything outside of this is a bonus.\" The Rogers Cup was Andreescu's first tournament after a right-shoulder injury sidelined her since the French Open in May. Battle of attrition Andreescu had been on the court more than any other player at this year's Rogers Cup at 10 hours 54 minutes heading into Sunday's final. All that playing took a toll on Andreescu, who needed a medical timeout in her quarterfinal win over world No. 3 Karolina Pliskova to have her groin taped. Both legs were wrapped and taped for her next two matches. Sunday's final lasted only 16 minutes before Williams's medical timeout brought it to a premature end. \"It's not easy for Serena, for sure, to pull out, especially to pull out in a final,\" said Andreescu. \"I know how she feels because I've done that many times in my short career. But sometimes you just have to listen to your body.\" WATCH | Bianca Andreescu post-match press conference: Bianca Andreescu hopes Rogers Cup win inspires next generation of Canadian tennis 6 years ago Duration 13:39 Bianca Andreescu addressed the media following her win over Serena Williams in the finals of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. Williams said the injury is a recurring back spasm that doesn't affect her ability to walk but makes serves and overhand shots painful. She expected to go to Cincinnati for the next stop on the WTA Tour to test it out ahead of the U.S. Open. \"The most frustrating part is that I've had these awful spasms a lot in my career,\" said Williams. \"And they're incredibly painful, but it goes away after, like, 24, 36, maybe 48 hours, and like clockwork. \"So I do different treatments. I take a day off. But obviously, I didn't have 24 hours or plus to take off (ahead of the Rogers Cup final).\" WATCH | Serena Williams post-match press conference: Serena Williams says she's officially a fan of Bianca Andreescu 6 years ago Duration 5:50 Serena Williams spoke to the media after having to retire from the Rogers Cup final due to injury.

On the men's side in Montreal, Milos Raonic of Thornhill, Ont., retired after two sets against Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime in a much-anticipated all-Canadian matchup.

A co-ordinated social media campaign, a physical presence at community events, free election swag, and recruiting young people as poll workers and outreach workers are just some of the strategies Elections NWT is undertaking to spread awareness and influence young people to vote. Voting in the N.W.T. is about to become easier The main message the organization wants to send: young people can make a difference. \"We're essentially wanting them to understand that the government is shaping the North and their future, that they should have a hand in shaping the government,\" said Nicole Latour, chief electoral officer of the N.W.T. \"If they all did come out to the polls, they collectively are very influential.\" Young adult turnout low in 2015 The agency has a difficult task ahead of it, as voter turnout among young adults for the 2015 election was extremely low. In a report released in May , Elections NWT found that 2,411 people between the ages of 18 and 35 voted, out of a total of 12,042 eligible voters or 20 per cent. Voters in Yellowknife were the biggest no-shows. Out of the seven electoral districts that make up the territorial capital, only 16.7 per cent of young adults came out to vote. Total voter turnout in the territorial election was 44 per cent. Latour said the issue is a lack of awareness among young adults. \"I don't think in the North we've been particularly good about providing the information to young adults,\" said Latour. \"At 16, they know they can get a driver's licence, and at 19 they know they can get into a licensed establishment, but nobody seems to know that at 18 you become an eligible elector.\" Youth ambassador program Elections NWT wants young people take the lead in promoting awareness, said Nara Dapilos, who is responsible for co-ordinating the agency's youth programs. \"It's important that we kind of empower each other as youth … that we see people our age engaging and voting and participating,\" she said. To that end, Elections NWT is recruiting \"youth engagement ambassadors\" from each community across the N.W.T. to start conversations with young people on social media and at community events about the details of the election: how to register, where and when to vote, and the importance of voting. The youth ambassadors will be in place during the writ period from Sept. 2 until election day on Oct. 1 and will receive a $500 stipend for their efforts. Elections NWT will also hire people between the ages of 18 and 24 to work as poll workers on voting day. Latour said she hopes this will have a ripple effect and they will encourage their friends and family to vote. The agency has also started the hashtag #TruantNoMore in the hopes of spreading awareness on social media. \"'Truant no more' is basically just a statement saying, 'We are going to vote, we are combating absenteeism and we are going to participate,'\" said Dapilos. Beyond engaging youth, Latour said recent changes to the electoral process , including the introduction of online voting, a longer voting period, and the launch of a new website, Electorhood — a digital platform that allows voters to track the progress of the election in real time — will help reduce barriers to voting and influence more people of all ages to cast their ballots. Latour says she hopes a public information campaign will drive better voter turnout in the coming territorial election. (Avery Zingel) Northern challenges Jerald Sabin, a politics professor at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke, Que., who studies northern politics, said communities in the North face particular challenges when it comes to electoral participation, from the consensus governance system to demographics. \"The absence of political parties really places a high informational burden on voters to learn about the issues and to learn about where each candidate in their riding stands,\" said Sabin. \"They can be a barrier to people feeling comfortable to vote.\" Elections NWT launches contest to galvanize young voters Sabin said the \"high turnover\" among the settler population in the territory is another factor. \"With people moving into Yellowknife, and then moving back out for job opportunities or for education, it means that people haven't put down the roots necessary to participate in the electoral system,\" he said. \"It takes a while to establish yourself in the community, to get engaged in politics, and to become interested in participating.\" Latour believes Elections NWT can overcome these challenges. \"The more that [young people] engage their friends and they come out and have discussions amongst themselves and decide who's the best representation for them, the more that they play a role in what happens in the future of the North,\" she said.

The government has since partly backed off on the issues, offering to instead increase average high school class sizes to 25 and require two online learning courses.

        "text": "Man who flew to Toronto from China is Canada's first coronavirus case Nicole Thompson, The Canadian Press Published Saturday, January 25, 2020 5:39PM EST Last Updated Sunday, January 26, 2020 7:39PM EST TORONTO - A man in his 50s who travelled to Toronto from China earlier this week has become the first Canadian case of the new coronavirus, health officials said Saturday as they urged calm in the face of an international outbreak. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said the case was considered “presumptive positive” until the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg finds the same positive results as the tests conducted in Toronto. Still, officials said they were taking all precautions to keep people safe, interviewing all those who were in contact with the man between Wednesday, when he landed in Toronto, and Thursday, when he went to hospital. “The risk to Ontarians is still low and things are managed and well-controlled,” Williams said. “As I hoped, the system is operating as it should.” Williams said provincial authorities are also working with their federal counterparts to contact people who sat within a few rows of the man on the plane he took to Toronto, but he noted that even those people shouldn't worry too much. “You have to be more than just casually walking by someone,” he said. He added that the widely available information about the illness appears to have contributed to the early detection of this case. “The individual, knowing his responsibility, when feeling unwell, even without having really severe symptoms, was concerned enough and informed prompt enough,” Williams said. “That just tells you that people have knowledge of it, they want to take proper precautions to protect their health and protect their family members and others.” His deputy, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, said the positive test result came in on Saturday afternoon, two days after the patient called 911 to report feeling ill. As of Saturday evening, he was in stable condition in a negative pressure room, which is used in hospitals to contain airborne contaminants. “The emergency service was aware of his travel history and used full precautions,” she said, noting he had spent time in Wuhan, the virus's epicentre. The news of Canada's first coronavirus patient comes as authorities around the world grapple with the new type of virus, which originated in China but has since spread to Europe and North America. There are more than 1,975 cases so far, including three in France and two in the United States. While 56 people have died of the virus in China - most of the deaths have been older patients - the World Health Organization has not declared the outbreak an international public health emergency. Toronto Mayor John Tory stressed in a statement following news of the city's first coronavirus case that health officials have made it clear the risk continues to remain low. He also praised the city's public health officials for their quick response. “Our front-line health-care workers are the best in the world and have procedures in place to keep people safe,” Tory said. Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu echoed the sentiment in a written statement, saying officials are taking all necessary precautions. “The Government of Canada has been working closely with provincial and territorial counterparts, and international partners, since China first reported 2019-nCoV cases to ensure that our country is prepared to limit the spread of 2019-nCoV in Canada,” she said. The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a common cold. But in late 2002, a coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome erupted in southern China, causing a severe pneumonia that rapidly spread to other countries. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, including 44 Canadians. Toronto was hard hit in that outbreak. In 2012, another coronavirus dubbed Middle East respiratory syndrome began sickening people in Saudi Arabia. MERS is still prevalent, causing small numbers of infections each year. The World Health Organization has counted nearly 2,500 cases in the Middle East and beyond, and more than 850 deaths. SARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected visited or worked at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been placed under quarantine since the outbreak. Bustling streets, malls and other public spaces have turned eerily quiet, masks are mandatory in public, and some hospitals have run low on medical supplies. Transportation has also been shut down in roughly a dozen Chinese cities, home to roughly 36 million people. Canadian officials have said such mass quarantines won't happen here, even if there is an outbreak. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12,200 hospitalizations and about 3,500 deaths in Canada yearly.

Article content Flight 752 went down shortly after Iran launched the missile strikes against the two bases, including one in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil where Canadian special-forces soldiers have been operating for the past five years. Article content The attack, which did not cause any casualties, was in response to a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad, Iraq, that killed Iranian Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani last week. Article content Earlier Friday, the head of Iran’s national aviation department, Ali Abedzadeh, told a news conference that “what is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane.” If the U.S. and Canada are sure, he added, they should “show their findings to the world.” Article content While Western countries may hesitate to share information on such a strike because it comes from highly classified sources, videos verified by The Associated Press appear to show the final seconds of the ill-fated airliner’s flight.

Photo by Ebrahim Noroozi / Associated Press Article content Iran has invited Ukraine, Canada, France and Boeing, which built the jetliner, to participate in the investigation into the cause of the crash. The Transportation Safety Board issued a statement Friday saying two investigators were preparing to make their way to the area. Article content “However, the full extent of the TSB’s role in this investigation — including the degree of site access and the type of work to be carried out once at the site or elsewhere — is still being determined,” it added. Article content Iran is already facing questions about its investigation. Article content Some of those questions revolved around allegations much of the debris at the crash scene had already been cleared and that the site had not been secured, while others focused on whether Iran would try to evade responsibility if one of its missiles did indeed shoot down the plane. Article content Asked about those fears, Champagne said: “Over the course of the next few days, we will see if they are genuine.” Article content The foreign minister added that the immediate priority is getting Canadian officials into the country as Iran has so far only issued two visas. Global Affairs Canada has deployed a team to identify victims’ remains but its members were waiting in Turkey when he spoke. Article content Article content “Obviously it starts with the visas because until and unless we can have our people physically on the ground, at the site, at the meeting, we are obviously not in a position to have all the influence we want,” Champagne said. Article content “So we have been stressing to the Iranian government to issue these visas as quickly as possible.” Article content Iranian authorities said Friday they had recovered the black-box flight recorders from the plane. Article content Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said recovering data from the recorders could take more than a month and that the entire investigation could stretch into next year. Article content Ukrainian investigators were given access Friday to the flight recorders that were recovered from the wreckage of the plane, which was bound for Kyiv, as well as access to recordings of the air-traffic controllers at the Tehran airport, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said. Article content But while investigators had also been to the crash site, “there are certain pieces that up until this time have not been found or gathered,” he added. Article content Transport Canada, meanwhile, said it had “issued a notice to Canadian air operators advising them not to enter the airspace of Iraq and Iran due to the potential risk of heightened military activity in the area.” Article content This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 10, 2020.

The warning said staff were responding to an incident at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station east of Toronto. A second alert was sent out almost two hours later saying the initial message had been a mistake. It was not clear what caused the error. Pickering Mayor Dave Ryan said he was \"demanding a full investigation\". The first message, sent province-wide, was sent out at around 07:30 local time (12:30 GMT) on Sunday, and alerted people who were within 10km (six miles) of the facility. The warning was generated by the Ontario government's Provincial Emergency Operations Centre. Reuters The messages were sent to people's mobile phones on Sunday morning The alert said: \"An incident was reported at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. There has been NO abnormal release of radioactivity from the station and emergency staff are responding to the situation. People near the Pickering Nuclear Generation Station DO NOT need to take protective actions at this time.\" The Ontario Power Generation, which runs the plant, later said the message had been \"sent in error\" and that there was \"no danger to the public or environment\". A second alert, at 09:11, said there was \"NO active nuclear situation\". On Twitter, Mayor Ryan said: \"Like many of you, I was very troubled to have received that emergency alert this morning. While I am relieved that there was no actual emergency, I am upset that an error such as this occurred.\" The plant is located on the shores of Lake Ontario some 50km from Toronto.

A man in his 80s who lived at a North Vancouver nursing home died late Sunday, according to provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. The man had pre-existing health problems prior to contracting the coronavirus, Henry said. The Lynn Valley Care Centre facility was identified as a COVID-19 hotspot three days ago. \"This is obviously a very sad day for all of us, but especially for the family and loved ones,\" said B.C.

Officials from Vancouver Coastal Health have been at the home since a health-care worker there, a woman in her 50s identified as \"Case 21,\" was diagnosed with the virus last week. Henry said Case 21 is not believed to have brought the virus into the home, nor is a second health-care worker who also tested positive. Henry says it is believed both workers and both residents contracted the virus from an unidentified person in the home. \"Very likely both the residents and both the care workers were infected from someone else within that setting,\" she said. Henry said one of the workers also works in two other homes. \"That is part of the ongoing investigation … to find out where else the workers have worked,\" she said.

        "text": "Flooding forces 13,000 from downtown Fort McMurray By Colette Derworiz News Politics April 29th 2020 Share this article Red Cross volunteer Karen Wyonzek (left) registers displaced person Shanna Skinner at an evacuee registration centre at an ice arena in the Thickwood Heights neighbourhood of Fort McMurray on Tue., April 28, 2020. Photo by The Canadian Press/Greg Halinda Joseph Enverga kept hoping the flooding would slow down or even stop as his apartment lights flickered on and off. The 35-year old was prepared for an evacuation of downtown Fort McMurray, Alta., on Sunday afternoon. By dawn on Monday, he looked out his window and saw the reflection of his building in the parking lot that was covered in water. He decided it was time to go. \"In my vehicle, I had my clothes ready, I had my documents ready,\" he says. \"On top of that, I had my slack line ready, I had my bag of my favourite board games ready. 'How much can a person take?' Flooding forces 13,000 from downtown Fort McMurray \"I was telling myself: this is going to be the best evacuation ever.\" Like many Fort McMurray residents, Enverga is no stranger to evacuation orders. He was forced out of his home during a raging wildfire in May 2016 that led to the evacuation of the entire city and destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings. On Tuesday, municipal and provincial officials were keeping a close eye on river levels after a 25-kilometre ice jam caused major flooding and forced nearly 13,000 people from their homes in the downtown. Colleen Walford, a river forecaster with Alberta Environment, said a monitoring flight just before noon Tuesday determined that the ice jam had shortened by about one kilometre and was melting. \"We have nice sunny conditions up in Fort McMurray today. We hope that continues tomorrow and it will continue to deteriorate the ice jam.\" But officials with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo said it remains a critical situation. \"We are not in the home stretch yet,\" Scott Davis, director of emergency management, told reporters. Data shows the Clearwater River was still rising and the Athabasca River had only dropped by about four centimetres. Mayor Don Scott said it has caused the worst flooding in the region in recent memory. \"This is a one-in-100-year flood,\" he said. \"This is something that we haven't seen in this generation. \"And it's actually happening during the COVID-19 pandemic , which is a dual combination of issues.\" A second state of local emergency is in effect on top of one declared last month because of the pandemic. Officials said evacuees are being put up in hotels and work camps where they can have their own space. \"We've gone to individual accommodations,\" said Shane Schreiber, director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency. More than 6,000 people have registered at two evacuation centres and the municipality said that number is expected to grow. Officials also said crews had to rescue more than 220 residents. Enverga, who didn't get an evacuation order, said he ended up getting a ride with a rescue boat after he realized his van wasn't going to make it through the water. \"I was sad that I couldn't take my van,\" he said. \"I couldn't take my slack line, I couldn't take my board games.\" Enverga said he was taken to an evacuation centre then went to stay with friends in another Fort McMurray neighbourhood. Others, including Coun. Jeff Peddle and former provincial politician Brian Jean, said they had to leave their flooded homes. Jean, who lost a home in the 2016 wildfire, said his almost-finished new house was under three metres of water. \"I'm very sad. I'm sad for the people. It started with the wildfires then it went to the economy ... then it went to COVID-19, which was an even bigger economy hit, and now the flood,\" he said. \"How much can a person take?\" Premier Jason Kenney and Environment Minister Jason Nixon took a flight over the city Monday. \"It really is ... devastating to see much of central Fort McMurray flooded just four years after the terrible fires of 2016,\" Kenney said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"To imagine people who have just rebuilt their homes now struggling with those homes being flooded and the adversity of that community after four years of economic trials is just heartbreaking.\" Kenney said another 450 people have been affected by ice jams in the Fort Vermilion area. \"We will be ensuring provincial financial support,\" he added. Earlier in the day, Nixon said the government will work with Wood Buffalo to request Ottawa's support if it's needed. \"At this point, we are satisfied that both the province and the municipality have the situation under control,\" he said. The federal government said earlier Tuesday that it is monitoring the situation in Fort McMurray. \"While no formal requests have been made, our government is ready to help when called upon,\" said an emailed statement from federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair. — By Colette Derworiz in Edmonton.

The bill did not affect the three Indigenous school boards in Québec . On Feb. 8 at 3:20 a.m., the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) majority government led by Premier François Legault abolished the 60 French and nine English school boards across the province and transformed Québec’s public and secondary school systems by forcing the adoption of Bill 40 . The CAQ majority used closure to adopt Bill 40 with its 300 clauses , along with 160 last-minute amendments , after a parliamentary session that lasted almost 70 hours . These amendments included the immediate sacking of all 700 French school board commissioners to avoid litigation against the closure of their school boards. The bill also brought in changes to teacher training, forces cities to pay for lands required for new schools and impacts how parents can choose schools. Widespread opposition Véronique Hivon, Parti Québécois education critic and representative for the riding of Joliette, questions the CAQ’s need to invoke closure during question period, Feb. 7, 2020, at the legislature in Québec City. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques Boissinot The CAQ passed Bill 40 despite opposition from the Liberal party, Québec Solidaire and the Parti Québécois, as well as from French- and English-language school boards, teacher unions , advocacy and parent groups, including some who have children with special needs . Opposition parties were frustrated that the CAQ government again used its majority to impose closure to adopt Bill 40. The same tactic was used to impose the law deregulating Hydro-Québec fees , reducing the number of immigrants accepted in Québec and to impose adoption of the controversial secularism law that prohibits teachers and other public workers from wearing religious symbols at work. In October, the English Montréal School Board filed a legal challenge against the secularism law . When Education Minister Jean-François Roberge tabled Bill 40 last October, he justified the move by saying it would save taxpayers $45 million over the next four years and provide more local school-based governance. In the lead-up to the bill, Roberge alleged that a government investigation showed the English Montréal School Board improperly awarded contracts and said he contacted police as a result . He appointed Marlene Jennings, a former Liberal MP, as trustee of the school board . Bill 40 replaced the school boards with French and English service centres whose unpaid members will have little decision-making power other than to adopt Ministry of Education regulations. Anglophones will be allowed to vote for such representatives within English service centres next November. Charter protection of language rights School boards for the English-speaking minority in Québec should be exempted from Bill 40, argues Joan Fraser, vice-chair of Alliance for the Promotion of Public English-language Education in Québec and a former senator. Francophones in New Brunswick and Ontario have highlighted their common cause with Québec anglophones in supporting the maintenance of their hard-fought school boards . The CAQ granted official minority English school boards and their commissioners a 10-month transition period . Bill 101 revisited As a Québécois francophone and social psychologist, part of my research focus is the study of how dominant language majority groups and their national or regional governments treat their linguistic , ethnic and religious minority populations. Camille Laurin, former Québec cultural development minister who was the chief architect of Bill 101, briefs reporters in April 1977 at the legislature in Québec City. The landmark bill was passed in August that year. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Louise Bidault The recent events harken to another law contributing to the systemic decline of the English school system in Québec. Bill 40 can be seen as a complement to the Charter of the French Language ( Bill 101 ), adopted by the Parti Québécois government in 1977 to increase the status and use of French relative to English in Québec. The preamble of Bill 101 asserted that its pro-French legislation would be conducted in fairness while being respectful of existing institutions of the English mother tongue population, then constituting 13 per cent of the Québec population. Despite such assurances, Bill 101 undermined the English primary and secondary school system for the sake of protecting the 80 per cent French mother tongue majority of Québec. ‘Rights holders’ schooling To neutralize the power of attraction to English compared to French, Bill 101 banned immigrant, allophone and francophone pupils from accessing English schools. Bill 101 stipulated that anglophone pupils could attend English schools as “rights holders” only if one parent had spent most of their primary schooling in English in Québec, and later in Canada, following a Supreme Court ruling. In 1971, before the adoption of Bill 101, 255,205 pupils were enrolled in English primary and secondary schools in the combined public and private systems of Québec. By 2018, ministry of education data showed there were only 96,235 pupils left in the English school system representing only 37 per cent of the original 1971 baseline , a drop of 158,970 pupils. Such decline, due to the low birth rates of Québec anglophones, out-migration and restrictions on access to English schools, forced English school boards to rule on painful school mergers and closures for anglophone pupils and parents. Such closures also had the effect of reducing the number of teachers, administrators and staff employed in such institutions, further contributing to the overall out-migration of Québec anglophones to the rest of Canada. Bilingual anglophones Education ministry data also shows that as planned in Bill 101, the number of allophones and immigrant pupils studying in the French school system increased to  91 per cent by 2018 (128,361) from only 15 per cent in 1971 (9,652), before Bill 101. These figures attest to the efficiency of Bill 101 in shifting allophone and immigrant pupils from the English to the French school system, thus contributing to the vitality of French in Québec. Québec Education Minister Jean-François Roberge responds to reporters’ questions Feb. 7, 2020 at the legislature in Québec City. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques Boissinot In July 2019, the education minister forced the transfer of a number of Montréal English schools to Montréal French school boards dealing with overcrowding, a situation caused by laws banning immigrants and allophones to go to English schools. English school boards contesting such transfers received support from francophone minority advocacy groups in Ontario and New Brunswick . English schools in Québec provide quality French teaching for their pupils within their French immersion programs. In 2011, 83 per cent of pupils in English primary schools were enrolled in French immersion classes, and at the secondary school level, the figure was 65 per cent. As pointed out in the Québec government’s 2016 and 2018 reports of the Advisory Board on English Education, English school boards have contributed to the academic strength of Québec schools and supported the training of highly competent French-English bilingual anglophone pupils . Until now, English school boards represented the last level of governance still controlled by and for the English-speaking communities of Québec. In Joan Fraser’s words, minority English school boards should be exempted from Bill 40, to echo the path taken “ by Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island as well as the Yukon Territory for minority French-language school boards when those jurisdictions changed the governance of their education systems .” Maintaining English school boards in Québec is rightfully understood as important for legitimizing the maintenance of French school boards across Canada that contribute to Canadian linguistic duality.

The RCMP reported Tuesday afternoon that the death toll in the weekend rampage has increased to 23, including the shooter. The incident is the deadliest in the country's history since the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique massacre in Montreal. Investigators are now trying to comb through at least 16 different crime scenes, five of which included burned-out buildings. These are spread between rural communities such as Portapique, Debert, Milford, Enfield, and Wentworth. Among the confirmed dead are RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the agency. Another RCMP officer, an 11-year veteran, was wounded but is expected to recover. The RCMP is acting on the notion that one man acted alone and investigators confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the 51-year-old suspect was killed by police. Police said they received 911 calls late Saturday evening of an active shooter in the area of Portapique. When officers arrived at the scene they discovered multiple victims inside and outside of the home. Later Sunday morning, police reported that the suspect may have been driving a vehicle that looked like an RCMP cruiser and was wearing what appeared to be an RCMP uniform. It was originally reported that the suspect was taken into custody near Enfield Sunday afternoon. In another development, the RCMP conceded that it did not know why an emergency alert was not sent out during the incident. Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said Tuesday that the RCMP would have been the agency responsible for activating the alert, which operates similar to the alert system in Ontario. ---with files from Ruby Sweeney  A Windsor man found guilty of a fatal crash near Chatham in 2022 has been sentenced to serve jail time.

Pictured is an example of summer and winter times throughout Canada (provided British Columbia also ends time changes). (Yukon.ca) There will be no falling back after daylight saving time takes effect March 8. As Yukoners have done for years, on March 8 they will move their clocks forward an hour. Unlike all those previous years though, when fall rolls around there will be no falling back on the clock. The Yukon government announced March 5 the seasonal time changes will end after clocks spring forward this year, meaning the territory will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time year-round. The decision comes after a public survey saw more than 4,800 Yukoners and organizations respond. It marked the highest response rate to any Yukon government online survey, surpassing by 1,500 the online response to potential cannabis legislation in 2017. Along with the survey about seasonal time change, another 35 written and emailed submissions came into the territory on the subject. On the survey, a total of 93 per cent of respondents stated their desire for ending the seasonal time change with 70 per cent of those in favour of ending it with Pacific Daylight Saving Time. “Yukoners clearly want to see an end to seasonal time change and we are listening,” Premier Sandy Silver said in a statement. “The response to this engagement speaks to the importance of this issue for people. Thank you to everyone who took the time to voice an opinion. This helped our government make an informed decision for Yukon.” A number of regions, including British Columbia are looking at remaining on daylight saving time but have yet to make a decision. Yukon Chamber of Commerce president Peter Turner said that the change could add to some confusion for businesses dealing with counterparts in other regions that keep seasonal time changes. At the same time the Yukon government was running its survey, the chamber was asking its members for their thoughts on it. A total of 70 per cent stated a preference to keep the Yukon’s time in sync with whatever route B.C. goes, while 20 per cent wanted to see the Yukon move to Alaska’s time zone and another 10 per cent preferred to keep the Yukon’s time as is. From the chamber’s perspective, it’s best to keep in sync with business partners and for many Yukon businesses that often means those in B.C. That said, Turner also pointed out it appears there’s a growing movement across borders to seriously consider not switching the clocks with the season. For many, it seems outdated. In short, Turner noted, there’s no perfect solution, but it would be helpful if all regions stuck with predictable time zones that don’t change with the seasons.

Photo by The Canadian Press/Greg Halinda Joseph Enverga kept hoping the flooding would slow down or even stop as his apartment lights flickered on and off. The 35-year old was prepared for an evacuation of downtown Fort McMurray, Alta., on Sunday afternoon. By dawn on Monday, he looked out his window and saw the reflection of his building in the parking lot that was covered in water. He decided it was time to go. \"In my vehicle, I had my clothes ready, I had my documents ready,\" he says. \"On top of that, I had my slack line ready, I had my bag of my favourite board games ready. 'How much can a person take?' Flooding forces 13,000 from downtown Fort McMurray \"I was telling myself: this is going to be the best evacuation ever.\" Like many Fort McMurray residents, Enverga is no stranger to evacuation orders. He was forced out of his home during a raging wildfire in May 2016 that led to the evacuation of the entire city and destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings. On Tuesday, municipal and provincial officials were keeping a close eye on river levels after a 25-kilometre ice jam caused major flooding and forced nearly 13,000 people from their homes in the downtown. Colleen Walford, a river forecaster with Alberta Environment, said a monitoring flight just before noon Tuesday determined that the ice jam had shortened by about one kilometre and was melting. \"We have nice sunny conditions up in Fort McMurray today. We hope that continues tomorrow and it will continue to deteriorate the ice jam.\" But officials with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo said it remains a critical situation. \"We are not in the home stretch yet,\" Scott Davis, director of emergency management, told reporters. Data shows the Clearwater River was still rising and the Athabasca River had only dropped by about four centimetres. Mayor Don Scott said it has caused the worst flooding in the region in recent memory. \"This is a one-in-100-year flood,\" he said. \"This is something that we haven't seen in this generation. \"And it's actually happening during the COVID-19 pandemic , which is a dual combination of issues.\" A second state of local emergency is in effect on top of one declared last month because of the pandemic. Officials said evacuees are being put up in hotels and work camps where they can have their own space. \"We've gone to individual accommodations,\" said Shane Schreiber, director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency. More than 6,000 people have registered at two evacuation centres and the municipality said that number is expected to grow. Officials also said crews had to rescue more than 220 residents. Enverga, who didn't get an evacuation order, said he ended up getting a ride with a rescue boat after he realized his van wasn't going to make it through the water. \"I was sad that I couldn't take my van,\" he said. \"I couldn't take my slack line, I couldn't take my board games.\" Enverga said he was taken to an evacuation centre then went to stay with friends in another Fort McMurray neighbourhood. Others, including Coun. Jeff Peddle and former provincial politician Brian Jean, said they had to leave their flooded homes. Jean, who lost a home in the 2016 wildfire, said his almost-finished new house was under three metres of water. \"I'm very sad. I'm sad for the people. It started with the wildfires then it went to the economy ... then it went to COVID-19, which was an even bigger economy hit, and now the flood,\" he said. \"How much can a person take?\" Premier Jason Kenney and Environment Minister Jason Nixon took a flight over the city Monday. \"It really is ... devastating to see much of central Fort McMurray flooded just four years after the terrible fires of 2016,\" Kenney said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"To imagine people who have just rebuilt their homes now struggling with those homes being flooded and the adversity of that community after four years of economic trials is just heartbreaking.\" Kenney said another 450 people have been affected by ice jams in the Fort Vermilion area. \"We will be ensuring provincial financial support,\" he added. Earlier in the day, Nixon said the government will work with Wood Buffalo to request Ottawa's support if it's needed. \"At this point, we are satisfied that both the province and the municipality have the situation under control,\" he said. The federal government said earlier Tuesday that it is monitoring the situation in Fort McMurray. \"While no formal requests have been made, our government is ready to help when called upon,\" said an emailed statement from federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair. — By Colette Derworiz in Edmonton.

BLAIR GABLE/Reuters Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account In an unprecedented move, Canada and the United States are closing the world’s longest undefended border to non-essential travel to try and avoid the worst impacts of the coronavirus as it continues to grip Europe. Critically, the partial border closing will not affect the movement of essential goods and workers, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump said in separate news conferences Wednesday. The decision comes two days after Canada closed its borders to other foreigners and as the latest numbers show more and more cases here are linked to travel south of the border. The two countries are still finalizing details on who and what will qualify as essential. The governments haven’t said when the partial travel ban will come into effect, but Mr. Trudeau said it would be done “very quickly.” Travel for tourism and recreation will not be allowed, the Prime Minister said. However, he sought to reassure businesses and individuals that essential travel will continue and supply chains “will not be affected.” Trudeau unveils $27-billion in aid, $55-billion of tax deferrals in coronavirus response Follow the latest coronavirus news Mr. Trump, though, left the door open to a shutting down of cross-border commerce, saying there would be no restrictions on trade “at this moment.” In response, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said there is “absolute agreement” to keep the border open and protect the $2.7-billion in daily trade that is “essential to the economies and well-being of both Canadians and Americans.” The new rules are expected to last for at least 30 days. Also under the umbrella of essential travel will be travel for medical reasons and binational military co-operation, Mr. Trump said. Christopher Sands, director of the Canada Institute at Washington’s Wilson Center think tank, said there has never been a border closing between Canada and the U.S. like this before. The closest analogy was on Sept. 11, 2001. In that case, crossings closed for up to 20 minutes and the main problem was the days-long backlog it created. “Now, we’re talking about a restriction that’s border-wide. … It’s a different order of magnitude.” he said. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said essential workers can take precautions to protect their health. When travelling, “act like you already have it,” she said, and if you do get sick, even with mild symptoms, stay home. On Monday, Canada announced it was closing the border to non-citizens, with the exception of permanent residents, Americans and a few other categories. At the time, Mr. Trudeau said the exception for Americans was made because of the intertwined economies. Mr. Trudeau said the decision was made after negotiations between the two leaders as well as talks between Ms. Freeland, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. British Columbia, which had previously called for the partial ban, and several other provinces welcomed the deal. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce agreed that the exchange of goods needed to continue, and called on Ottawa to keep open lines of communication with businesses. Bruce Heyman, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada, said Mr. Trudeau appeared to have got the best deal possible to fight the pandemic without compromising trade or angering Mr. Trump. ”To be able to thread that needle is difficult and, at least at this point in time, it looks like the Prime Minister has successfully done that,\" Mr. Heyman said. He noted the logistical challenge ahead. Under normal circumstances, about 400,000 people cross at the 120 border crossings each day. Given the wide discretion border guards already have in enforcing the rules, he said, it is possible some points of entry may be easier to get through. Which workers will be considered essential is still a grey area, he said. For example, does a machine repair person qualify if the work is for an essential manufacturer? Those details and the circumstances of people who may have spouses on the other side of the border have not yet been worked out. Daniel Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with clients in both countries, said companies that regularly ship across the border likely will not see significant disruption, thanks to measures adopted after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Three post-9/11 programs – Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, Partners in Protection and Free and Secure Trade – allowed companies to get security clearances and background checks, and register with the governments, showing they have legitimate reasons to cross.",

Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account The Quebec government backtracked Thursday on its plan to allow holiday gatherings over four days at Christmas, saying the COVID-19 situation in the province was unlikely to improve enough for them to be safe. Premier Francois Legault announced that in the province’s red zones, which cover the most densely populated areas of the province, multi-household gatherings of up to 10 people will no longer be allowed between Dec. 24 and Dec. 27. “New cases leads to more hospitalizations, and if we continue in this direction, hospitals will start to overflow,” Legault told a news conference after the province announced 1,470 new COVID-19 infections and 30 more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus. “With the numbers we have, it’s unrealistic to think we’ll be able to change the situation in time for Christmas.” The Quebec government on Nov. 19 gave the green light to the get-togethers on the condition that people isolate for a week before and a week after. But now the risk has been deemed too high with COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths on the rise and a health system deemed fragile due to a lack of staffing. Legault said 6,600 health-care workers were off the job on sick leave or preventive leave as of Thursday. People living alone in red zones are allowed to have one visitor at a time, something Legault encouraged. “We can and we must visit them,” he said. “They need us more than ever.” Gatherings will still be permitted in regions that are not at the highest alert level. The premier hinted earlier this week things were looking grim before pulling the plug on Thursday. He said if he had it do over, he wouldn’t have announced the gatherings last month, but he said at the time there was a sincere hope case numbers would decline. “I’m trying to do my best, like I said in French, I’m not perfect,” Legault said. He said Quebec will maintain a longer school break, as planned, with distance learning several days before Christmas for elementary and high school students. Many businesses and schools had altered their schedules to allow for the now nixed gatherings, Legault acknowledged. “Currently, we are at the worst time of the pandemic, the worst time of the past nine months, so maintaining these measures, I think it can help,” he said. The province has seen COVID-19 cases surge, with more than 1,500 reported on Tuesday. Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec’s director of public health, said community transmission is behind the rising cases. “The virus is everywhere,” Arruda said, adding that the failure by some to follow public health guidelines is fuelling the spread. The province is battling over 1,200 active outbreaks, with most occurring in workplaces, schools and long-term care and seniors’ residences. Montreal reported the largest number of new cases Thursday, with 373, while the Quebec City, Monteregie and Lanaudiere regions each reported 145 cases or more. Legault said he was confident the vast majority of Quebecers would not disregard his latest edict and gather anyway during the holidays, or travel from red zones to the few regions where gatherings are still permitted. “Nobody wants to infect someone else from the same family or some of their friends,” Legault said. “So we’ll have to explain the danger, and when I see the number of deaths in the world in the last few days, I still don’t understand how some people can think that it’s not dangerous.” Of the Quebec deaths announced Thursday, 12 occurred in the last 24 hours. Hospitalizations declined by three to 737, while the number of people in intensive care remained unchanged at 99. Quebec has reported 146,532 cases, 7,155 deaths and 126,179 recoveries since the beginning of the pandemic. Canadian authorities are assessing COVID-19 vaccine candidates while trials are underway, speeding up any eventual approval for wide use. But science reporter Ivan Semeniuk says it’s likely high-risk people will be prioritized for receiving any vaccine first, with some possibly getting it as early as the first part of 2021.

It marks the first year the Grey Cup won't be presented since 1919. The nine-team league announced the move Monday, dashing hopes of a shortened season in the hub city of Winnipeg. \"Our league governors decided today it is in the best long-term interests of the CFL to concentrate on the future,\" commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a statement. \"We are absolutely committed to 2021, to the future of our league and the pursuit of our vision of a bigger, stronger, more global CFL.\" The move comes after the CFL couldn't solve a number of issues in an effort to try to salvage a season. The league was unable to secure financing from the federal government after presenting Ottawa with a $30-million, interest-free loan request Aug. 3 to stage an abbreviated 2020 campaign. News of the deal falling through broke Sunday night. The league had maintained it required government funding to stage a shortened season, despite having a far more stable ownership situation than in previous years. However, Ambrosie has said the league lost more than $20 million last season. \"Even with government funding and a new CBA, our owners and community-held teams would have had to endure significant financial losses to play in 2020,\" Ambrosie said. \"Without it, the losses would be so large that they would really hamper our ability to bounce back strongly next year and beyond. The most important thing is the future of our league.\" The CFL said the federal government suggested the league pursue a commercial loan, which would be partially backed by Ottawa. \"That kind of arrangement would hamper our recovery more than bolster it. On two occasions, in June and again at the beginning of August, the government reached out to us with new indications they might step up and help in a more meaningful way. But at the end of the day, the help we needed to play this year never materialized,\" Ambrosie said. \"This outcome after months of discussions with government officials is disappointing. But we’re focused now on the long-term future and we will continue to work with the federal and provincial governments in that context.\" Approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada also was needed. Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said last Friday he was encouraged by the CFL's plan, but couldn't provide a timeline for a decision the league quickly needed to try to stage a season. With the cancellation, the CFL becomes one of the few major North American pro sports leagues to wipe out play in 2020. Major League Baseball is running a shortened season, while the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer have resumed play. The NFL says it's planning to start its season on time next month. Unlike other major leagues in North America, however, the CFL does not have the luxury of a billion-dollar television contract. While its deal with TSN has become more lucrative over the years, the CFL remains a gate-driven league — which is a major problem when fans aren't allowed in the stands. CFL officials announced in late July they had chosen Winnipeg as a hub city for a regular season with six games, followed by an eight-team playoffs. No fans were scheduled to be in attendance. But it was contingent on the league securing financial assistance from the federal government, solidifying an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and approving health-and-safety protocols. While the CFL said it could have staged the Grey Cup game after its traditional late November date, time was running thin to get about half the league's players back to Canada, follow quarantine rules, stage training camps and hold a season and playoffs. The CFL also couldn't line up federal funding. In late April, Ambrosie told The Canadian Press the CFL was seeking up to $150 million in federal assistance in the event of a wiped-out season. The league dropped its ask to about $44 million in the summer as it tried to find a way to grapple with next to no revenue. Later, it requested the loan of $30 million. Meanwhile, the league also struggled to mend fences with the CFL Players' Association. Politicians from all major parties criticized the CFL for not having its players involved in its initial financial assistance request. While the players eventually supported the league's second financial assistance proposal, the two sides could not come to terms on an extension of the CBA, though the CFL said it was close to a deal when it called off the season Monday. When the pandemic first hit in March, the CFL had time on its side, with training camps not set to open until May. But as the situation worsened around the world, the CFL had to start postponing camps and, eventually, the start of the regular season in June. Later, the CFL pulled the plug on the Grey Cup game in November in Regina, saying the model would not work without fans. The league hoped at the time to play the Grey Cup in either the city with the best record or the hub city. While the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer adopted hub-city formats to get going and Major League Baseball went with a travel plan, the CFL was left watching all those other leagues begin or resume play this summer. It marks the first time the CFL won't crown a champion since it was founded in 1958. Before that, amateur leagues and other circuits competed for the Grey Cup. It was last not awarded in 1919 — which also happened to be during a pandemic — because of a rules dispute in the west, lack of interest in the east and education concerns in the university ranks. The first Grey Cup was held in 1909. The cancelled season is a blow for Ambrosie, who took the job in 2017. One of his biggest objectives has been expanding the CFL's footprint internationally with his CFL 2.0 initiative, holding combines in countries around the world and creating roster spots for international players. But the pandemic quashed plans for a second global draft this year. International players made minimal impact following the first draft last year. Ambrosie appeared to solve one of the league's biggest problems early this year when Toronto businessmen Sid Spiegel and Gary Stern were introduced as owners of the Montreal Alouettes, who were run by the league and financed by other teams last season after owner Robert Wetenhall stepped away. Fresh off their first trip to the playoffs since 2014 under new coach Khari Jones last season and bolstered by new owners, the Alouettes never got a chance to build on that momentum. The league has long-running attendance problems in its two other biggest markets, Toronto and Vancouver, which now will turn their sporting focus to other teams with active seasons. The cancellation also puts the new-look Edmonton team on hold. The team announced it was dropping the name Eskimos this summer after facing pressure from sponsors, along with other teams with racist or stereotypical names. Now, the Edmonton Football Team faces the challenge of creating a new name with extremely limited revenue.",

Case counts of COVID-19 have doubled in territory over last 3 weeks CBC News · Posted: Nov 30, 2020 7:19 PM EST | Last Updated: December 1, 2020 Yukon Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brendan Hanley is speaking at the territory's weekly COVID-19 update on Tuesday. (Philippe Morin/CBC) Social Sharing Officials in Yukon are giving more details on new mandatory mask rules that go into effect on Tuesday, and are asking people to stay home as COVID-19 cases rise in the territory. The territory has now confirmed a total of 47 cases since the pandemic began, with 17 that are currently active. Premier Sandy Silver said at Tuesday's update that the new mask rules will extend to Yukoners over the age of five, after saying last week they would apply to those over the age of two. He also said indoor public spaces include \"indoor areas of a building that are intended for the common use of the whole public.\" This includes public bathrooms, lobbies, hallways, waiting rooms, elevators and stores, along with other spaces, he added. \"If you're not sure whether or not you're in a public space, wear a mask,\" Silver said. He said some exemptions will include people with medical conditions which prevent them from wearing masks, people participating in sports, people in private areas of long-term care homes and anyone eating or drinking in a public restaurant. Silver said the government can give people fine of up to $500 if people don't comply with the rules and can't reasonably verify an exemption. \"Sanctions would only be used in egregious scenarios of non-compliance,\" Silver said. A customer could be refused entry of service if they're not wearing a mask, for example — though at this point, Silver said, the territory is focused on education, awareness, and support as a primary means of compliance. Masks are now mandatory in Yukon. Here are 8 things you should know Yukon reports 1 new COVID-19 case on Monday Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley, said the rules around wearing non-medical masks in indoor public spaces are enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. \"Remember masks are not a substitute. They're an addition to all those measures that are already well-known. It's important that you continue to physically distance and wash your hands, and follow the other measures where applicable,\" Hanley said. He added that for those who can not afford or find a mask, the government will be make them available for a limited time at public facilities. Missed the update? Watch it here: Case counts double in 3 weeks, no evidence of community spread The territory has seen a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases over the last few weeks. \"Our case count … doubled in the past three weeks from 23 cases as of Nov. 10 to 47 cases as of this morning,\" Hanley emphasized on Tuesday. Hanley said that health officials have not yet found signals of community spread in the territory. \"In other words, we're not seeing cases appearing in the community that are not connected to travel or to known cases. However, we haven't ruled it out,\" he said. One new case was announced on the territorial government's website on Monday in an unspecified location, and one new case was announced in Whitehorse Sunday. The territory also added a new public exposure notification over the weekend: Baked Café and Bakery on Nov. 21 between 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. You can read all of Yukon's potential COVID-19 potential exposure notices here Three other cases were also confirmed in Whitehorse on Friday. The Yukon government also listed potential exposure notices for specific bus routes, the Better Bodies gym, the Canada Games Centre Wellness Centre and Sakura Sushi at certain times. Government to provide support for leave Silver emphasized the importance of staying home if they are feeling sick, and said the territorial government supports employers and employees in doing so. \"Our government has [a] paid sick leave rebate program for employers, including those who are self-employed,\" Silver said. \"To compliment this, under new COVID-19 regulations, an employee is also entitled to a leave without pay for a period of up to 14 days if they require.\" The leave is available to employees if they or someone in their care is required to follow a health protection measure such as self-isolating, Silver said, given that they are able to provide a doctor's note. Silver said that approved vaccines are expected to be available by early 2021, but there are still many details to work out on national and territorial levels.

(Jason Franson/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Alberta once again shattered records on Thursday, with 1,854 new cases and a positive-test rate of 9.5 per cent. The province has 17,743 active cases, with 511 people being treated in hospital for the illness, including 97 in ICU beds. Another 14 deaths were reported on Thursday. \"I am very concerned about these numbers,\" Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's chief medical officer of health, said Thursday at a news conference. \"No one should be watching these numbers to determine whether or not they need to change their behaviour. Behaviour needs to change, and that's already a mandate. And what we need to do as we're watching these numbers is determine whether or not there should be further changes.\" The regional breakdown of active cases on was: Edmonton zone: 8,331 Calgary zone: 6,445 Central zone: 1,251 North zone: 991 South zone: 633 Unknown: 92 With case numbers rising in all parts of the province, Hinshaw addressed a portion of her news conference to people who live outside the two big cities. \"While infection rates in Edmonton and Calgary make up the majority of cases in the province, we are seeing increased spread in many rural communities,\" she said. \"COVID-19 is not a Calgary problem or an Edmonton problem. This is a provincial problem within the context of a global problem. 'COVID-19 doesn't care where you live' Among the 15 geographic areas with the highest active case rates in Alberta, one-third of them are outside Calgary and Edmonton. \"We are also seeing growing outbreaks in the Central, North and South zones,\" she said. \"I know that many rural areas did not see widespread transmission in the spring or summer, and so it's natural that some people living in those areas may feel safe from COVID, due to their smaller populations or distance from large urban centres. \"They may wonder why they should wear a mask or not host a party in their home. Unfortunately, our overall active case rates prove that COVID-19 doesn't care where you live or what your postal code is. It only takes one case entering a community to cause significant spread.\" WATCH | Dr. Hinshaw says COVID isn't just a risk for those who live in cities Dr. Hinshaw asks rural Albertans to follow restrictions 4 years ago Duration 1:31 Dr. Deena Hinshaw pleaded with Albertans in rural areas to wear masks and follow public health orders, warning them that their distance from ICUs will make COVID-19 “even more daunting.” It's important that everyone follow public health guidelines wherever they live, she said. \"If people in a community aren't consistently observing physical distancing, wearing masks when appropriate or staying home when they feel unwell, it doesn't take long to infect a large percentage of the population. \"Coping with this virus is a challenge for everyone, but being further away from health care, especially from advanced services like ICUs, can also make the experience even more daunting for those living in rural areas. That's why it's important for all Albertans, rural and urban, take COVID-19 seriously and do everything possible to limit the spread.\" 2nd wave hitting far harder than 1st The second wave of the pandemic has hit Alberta far harder than the first. The province reported its first case of the respiratory illness on March 5. It took until June 28, 116 days, for the total number of cases to reach 8,050. That included 7,255 people who had recovered, 641 active cases and 154 deaths. Alberta reported 8,187 new cases over the past five days alone. As noted above, the past six days have been grim. Alberta reported 1,731 new cases on Saturday, 1,608 on Sunday, 1,733 on Monday, 1,307 on Tuesday and 1,685 on Wednesday, and 1,854 on Thursday. The total number of cases as of Thursday was 63,023, which includes 17,743 active cases, 44,705 people who have recovered, and 575 deaths. Kenney Q&A Premier Jason Kenney hosted a live Q&A on Facebook Thursday night that lasted about 90 minutes. When asked about the potential for further restrictions, the premier said the province is waiting to see what effect the most recent measures have before announcing any new measures. However, Kenney hinted that any possible new restrictions would be linked to the \"hot zones\" of the province —Edmonton and Calgary. \"If we don't start to see a stabilization or a reduction in the growth, then as I announced last week, we'll have to move forward with additional restrictions,\" he said. \"I suspect that if we do that, those restrictions will be likely geographically focused.

Five others were wounded in the Halloween night attack. A man in his mid-20s was arrested shortly before 01:00 (06:00 GMT) on Sunday. Police said an initial probe found the suspect was not affiliated with any extremist groups. The attack took place in the historic Old Quebec neighbourhood. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter , external : \"My heart breaks for the loved ones of the two killed in last night's horrific attack in Quebec City. \"I'm also wishing a full recovery to the injured.

At a news conference on Sunday, Quebec City Police Chief Robert Pigeon said it was believed that the attack was premeditated, adding that the suspect, from the Montreal suburbs, came to Quebec City with \"the intention of doing the most damage possible\". \"Dressed in medieval costume and armed with a Japanese sword, everything leads us to believe he chose his victims at random,\" Mr Pigeon added. The suspect had spoken of conducting an attack \"in a medical context\" five years ago but was not known to police and did not have a criminal record, police said. âFirst reports of the incident near the French-speaking city's national assembly came through shortly before 22:30 local time on Saturday. The suspect was arrested near the Espace 400e business park. Quebec's Le Soleil newspaper reported that he was lying on the ground, barefoot and hypothermic, when he was arrested. He surrendered to police without any resistance, it said. Following his arrest, the suspect was taken to hospital for \"evaluation\".

ORDER OF CANADA BACKGROUNDER Established in 1967 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Order of Canada is the cornerstone of the Canadian Honours System, and recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation. The Order recognizes people in all sectors of Canadian society. Their contributions are varied, yet they have all enriched the lives of others and made a difference to this country. Motto and Levels The Order of Canada's motto is DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (\"They desire a better country\"). Her Majesty The Queen is the Sovereign of the Order, and the governor general is the chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order. Companion – Post-nominal: C.C. recognizes national pre-eminence or international service or achievement; Officer – Post-nominal: O.C. recognizes national service or achievement; and Member – Post-nominal: C.M. recognizes outstanding contributions at the local or regional level or in a special field of activity. Insignia Description The insignia of the Order is a stylized snowflake of six points, with a red annulus at its centre which bears a stylized maple leaf circumscribed with the motto of the Order, DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (\"They desire a better country\"), surmounted by the Royal Crown. It is struck in fine silver and is composed of three individual pieces: the snowflake, annulus and maple leaf. The colour is added by hand through a unique application of opaque and translucent enamel. The design of the insignia of the Order of Canada dates from 1967, and is credited to Bruce Beatty, C.M., S.O.M., C.D. The technical drawings used by the Royal Canadian Mint in this new generation of the insignia were developed by the Canadian Heraldic Authority at the Chancellery of Honours, part of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General. The insignia is manufactured by the Mint at its Ottawa facility. Investiture Ceremony Following their appointment to the Order of Canada , all Companions, Officers and Members are invited to an investiture ceremony, which is normally held in person, where they are presented with their insignia. Four investiture ceremonies are typically organized each year for groups of approximately 40 appointees. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person investiture ceremonies were postponed indefinitely, which resulted in a greater number of appointees than usual who had not yet participated in an investiture ceremony. As such, the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General organized a virtual investiture ceremony with six appointees of the Order of Canada on December 15, 2020 as a way to continue to recognize outstanding Canadians in an environment that accommodates the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. All appointees of the Order are celebrated from the moment their appointments are announced to the moment they receive their insignia. Each member of the Order earns the right to wear the appropriate ribbons or devices, miniatures, and lapel badges, as well as the authorized use of post-nominal letters. The typical in-person investiture ceremony is a closed event for the recipients, their family and loved ones. Normally, media are invited to attend investiture ceremonies and may be invited to participate in future virtual investiture ceremonies. Eligibility All Canadians are eligible for the Order of Canada , with the exception of federal and provincial politicians and judges while in office. The Order's constitution permits non-Canadians to be considered for honorary appointments. Members of the Royal Family, governors general and their spouses are appointed in the extraordinary category. There are no posthumous appointments. Officers and Members may be elevated within the Order in recognition of further achievement, based on continued exceptional or extraordinary service to Canada . Usually, promotions are considered five years after the first appointment. Nominations Any person or group is welcome to nominate a deserving individual as a candidate for appointment to the Order of Canada . Appointments are made on the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Order of Canada , an independent council chaired by the chief justice of Canada . Members of the Advisory Council for the Order of Canada reflect the diversity and excellence in Canadian society. Certain members are appointed by virtue of their office; others are appointed for a fixed term to achieve a balanced representation of the various regions of the country.

        "text": "By ROB GILLIES Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday Canada will get up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech before the end of December. The vaccine is expected be approved by Health Canada as soon as Thursday. Trudeau had come under criticism from opposition parties for saying Canadians won’t be among the first to get a vaccine against COVID-19 because the first doses will likely go to citizens of the countries they are made in. Canada doesn’t have mass vaccine-production facilities. Trudeau said Canada recently amended the contract with Pfizer so that it would deliver up to 249,000 doses this month. That will mean about 124,500 of the highest risk Canadians will get vaccinated at first as two doses are required per person a few weeks apart. “We are now contracted to receive up to 249,000 of our initial doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine in the month of December,” Trudeau said. “Pending Health Canada approval, the first shipment of doses is tracking for delivery next week.” Canada has contracts with six other vaccine makers as well. Trudeau said 14 distribution centers will be located in large Canadian cities initially. There will be one in each province and two each in Canada’s four largest provinces. He said millions of more doses will be on the way. “It has been a difficult year, and we are not out of this crisis yet,″ Trudeau said. ”But now, vaccines are coming.” Retired Gen. Rick Hillier, who leads the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Task Force in Canada’s largest province of Ontario, said he expects Ontario to get about 85,000 doses this month for roughly 42,500 people. Hillier said seniors and workers in long-term care homes are among those expected to get the vaccine first. And he expects Ontario to get at least 1.2 million people in vaccinated in the first three months of next year. Ontario has a population 14.5 million.",

Liberals gain a seat formerly held by veteran Tory MHA David Brazil Alex Kennedy · CBC News · Posted: Jan 30, 2024 6:30 PM EST | Last Updated: January 31, 2024 Social Sharing Liberal candidate Fred Hutton has won the byelection in Conception Bay East-Bell Island and will become Newfoundland and Labrador's newest MHA. (Heather Gillis/CBC) Liberal candidate Fred Hutton has won the byelection in Conception Bay East-Bell Island and will become Newfoundland and Labrador's newest MHA. Through all 51 reported polls, Hutton defeated PC candidate Tina Neary, 2,603 votes to 2,152 votes — securing 45.9 per cent of the vote to Neary's 37.9 per cent. The NDP's Kim Churchill garnered 14.9 per cent of the votes with 846, while Independent candidate Darryl Harding received 70 votes for 1.2 per cent of the vote. \"Tonight, we start a new chapter,\" Hutton told supporters shortly after the win was projected. \"It feels great.\" The win marks the first time the district has switched hands since 2003. David Brazil, who had been the district's MHA since 2010 — winning 56.2 per cent of the vote in the 2021 election — resigned in December to focus on his health following a heart attack in 2022. Premier Andrew Furey was quick to celebrate the win, welcoming Hutton to the podium. \"Twenty years a Tory district. Tory no more, Fred Hutton,\" Furey said with a large smile. \"Fred's going to contribute a lot. He's already contributed a lot to the province [and] wants what's best for Newfoundland and Labrador.\" Hutton is a prominent former journalist with stints at NTV, VOCM and the CBC. He has also worked alongside Furey since he was elected in 2020, often travelling with him to news conferences and events. Huttton took a leave from his office to run in the byelection. \"I've sat at the desk before when I've watched and read the announcements coming in for the numbers in elections. I always found that very exciting. I can tell you it's very different from this side,\" he said with a laugh. Hutton told the crowd he was skeptical and nervous about deciding to run, but speaking with residents of the district affirmed for him that it was the right thing to do. \"Thank you for your endorsement, thank you for your confidence, thank you for your trust,\" he said. WATCH | Fred Hutton speaks with supporters following the win: Fred Hutton celebrates win in Conception Bay East-Bell Island byelection 1 year ago Duration 1:35 Liberal candidate Fred Hutton secured nearly 46 per cent of the vote in the Conception Bay East-Bell Island byelection Tuesday night and says he's ready to represent his home district. Voting took place from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., a day later than scheduled, after a winter storm that hit the Avalon Peninsula on Monday forced a delay. About 45 per cent of the district's 12,612 eligible voters, according to Elections N.L., cast a ballot. Issues on the minds of voters, highlighted at a debate earlier this month, include the cost of living, improving ferry service for the region, frequent emergency room closures in Wabana and improving health care. Byelection candidates say they were prepared for possibility of weather forcing postponement Ferry service and health care among top topics at Bell Island byelection debate Hutton said the vote is an endorsement of Furey and the work the party has done, adding he was saddened that he couldn't celebrate the win with his friend and former cabinet minister Derrick Bragg, who died earlier this month following a diagnosis of tongue cancer last year. Asked whether he was considering calling a general election following the momentum of the win, Furey said he's only focused on celebrating the victory for the people in the district and the province. \"The election, as I've said many times, it'll sort itself out,\" he said. The party has another vacancy following Bragg's death, but Furey said he hasn't thought about calling a byelection. \"I personally have been in a period of mourning,\" he said. \"I haven't given any thought to it.\" Losing parties see small victories Neary told CBC News she sees the support for her campaign as a victory. \"It isn't what we were hoping for, but at the end of the day, you know what, as far as I'm concerned it's still a win for us. We had an amazing team of supporters,\" she said. PC candidate Tina Neary congratulates Hutton after the winner was declared. (Heather Gillis/CBC) Neary said she'll continue to advocate for people as a town councillor in Portugal Cove-St. Philip's and would like to be back for a future campaign if the opportunity arises. For now, she said, she hopes Hutton keeps the promises he and the party made for residents. \"They've made a lot of commitments and, you know, I can only hope that they stand true to their word.\" The provincial NDP released a statement thanking Churchill for her candidacy following the vote. \"For a political first-timer her effort and dedication was nothing short of awe-inspiring. She stood up and demanded better for the people of the district, and we look forward to her success in future campaigns,\" said provincial party president Raj Sharan in the statement.

So we shared that and we all recovered … That’s how the day started. “And then we heard about a plane crash … That was not official news — that was word of mouth about the plane crash.” She said by 3 p.m., the town’s residents heard about exactly what had happened and the scale of the tragedy. “(It’s) not easy to describe,” she said. “A plane crash is very physical, but when tragedy hits your heart, it’s hard to describe. “When you’re looking in the eyes of other people you’ve known for 40-plus years and their souls are speaking tragedy, it’s pretty different.” Kikoak said she and her fellow community members are trying their best to cope with what has happened. “I’ll try to be strong for my community … a light of some sort, of kindness and joy — somehow.” Story continues below advertisement A candlelight vigil was planned for St. Joseph’s Cathedral in Fort Smith on Wednesday night so that residents can offer comfort to one another. –With files from The Canadian Press and Global News’ Karen Bartko and Emily Mertz",

Unofficial results show that MacFarlane earned 1,226 votes for 48.9 per cent of the 2,507 votes cast, compared to the PC candidate's 964 votes, for 38.5 per cent. Liberal Gordon Sobey came in third with 272 votes and the NDP's Karen Morton was in last place with 40. Including the mail-in votes and three days of advance polls, Elections P.E.I. said almost 59 per cent of eligible voters in the district had cast a ballot by Wednesday night. The agency noted that there was a 92 per cent return rate from people who requested mail-in ballots. Unofficial results from the Elections P.E.I. website The most recent P.E.I. provincial byelection before this one, in Cornwall-Meadowbank, had a voter turnout of 55 per cent. MacFarlane, a lawyer with Key Murray Law in Summerside, lives in Augustine Cove on the Island's south shore. Matt MacFarlane, shown campaigning earlier this month, said the byelection amounted to 'a mid-term exam for the Dennis King government.' (CBC) The byelection was made necessary by the resignation of Progressive Conservative Jamie Fox, who left the seat after deciding to run for the Conservatives in the next federal election. \"This was a mid-term exam for the Dennis King government,\" MacFarlane told supporters Wednesday night. \"The residents and voters of District 19 graded that exam, and they graded it with a failing grade.\" Summerside hospital's progressive-care unit being cut from 8 beds to 4 Government record on health care and housing at centre of byelection debate He said the vote showed that Prince Edward Islanders are unhappy with the King government's management of health care, and said he would make advocating for the return of a full eight-bed intensive care unit at the Prince County Hospital his top priority as MLA. Health care pushed buttons Health care became a major issue for King's PC government in recent weeks after services at that hospital in nearby Summerside were reduced. The hospital's intensive-care unit was downgraded to a progressive-care unit in mid-2023, meaning patients who needed critical care would be sent to Charlottetown's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, an hour's drive away, if their condition didn't warrant being airlifted to hospitals off the Island. A large crowd filled a conference room at Credit Union Place in Summerside on Feb. 1 for a town hall to address concerns about health services at the city's Prince County Hospital. (Sheehan Desjardins/CBC) Then in January, Health P.E.I. cited staff shortages as the reason behind reducing the number of beds in Summerside's progressive-care unit from eight to four, saying patients would have to be sent to Charlottetown if those four beds were full. Hundreds pour into Summerside town hall to object to hospital service reductions P.E.I. is failing in its health recruitment efforts, say workers and former board chair \"As [past] co-chair of the South Shore Health and Wellness Centre, I fought for improved access to health care right here in our district and I know we can accomplish much more with a strong, dedicated voice in the legislature,\" MacFarlane was quoted as saying in a message on the Green Party's campaign website. How will the win change the legislature? MacFarlane's win in District 19 leaves his party tied in the P.E.I. legislature with the Liberals, with three seats each compared to the PCs' 21. The Liberals are currently the Official Opposition, which gives them more debate time in the house and a larger budget for staffing. Workers at the District 19 byelection polling station in Crapaud said voting was steady all day, with the lineup out the door at times. (Kerry Campbell/CBC) There is no rule or precedent on record in this province to determine which party should form the Official Opposition when two parties are tied. But other jurisdictions have dealt with this situation, and according to the clerk of the P.E.I. Legislative Assembly, incumbency has been the determining factor in deciding who should form the Official Opposition. Based on that precedent, the Liberals will maintain their status. PEI Votes P.E.I. Greens drop to 3rd-party status, 4 years after making history PEI Votes P.E.I. election result revives talk of proportional representation Following his win Thursday, MacFarlane said the party should push for Official Opposition status because the Greens won more votes in the 2023 general election. \"I think that the Green Party should be the Official Opposition,\" he said. \"That was a bridge we weren't really crossing until we'd come to it, and it appears we're at that bridge threshold now.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Stephen Brun Journalist Stephen Brun works for CBC in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

Getty Images Story highlights 5 former members of Canada's world junior hockey team face charges The allegations date back to an alleged assault in 2018 The case sparked parliamentary hearings in 2022 Investigators have scheduled a news conference for Monday CNN — Four NHL players and one former NHL player are facing sexual assault charges in Canada in connection with allegations from 2018, their attorneys said Tuesday – a fresh development in a case that has wrapped Canada’s national hockey governing body in controversy . The charges relate to a woman’s accusation that multiple members of Canada’s world junior hockey team sexually assaulted her in London, Ontario, in 2018. All five of the players facing charges were members of that team at the time. One of the players facing charges, former Ottawa Senators forward Alex Formenton, who now plays professionally in Switzerland, turned himself in to police in London on Sunday, his legal team said. The others facing charges, according to their lawyers or their clubs, include New Jersey Devils center Mike McLeod ; Devils defenseman Cal Foote ; Philadelphia Flyers goalie Carter Hart ; and Calgary Flames center Dillon Dube . The current NHL players have been instructed to surrender to authorities in connection with the allegations, London police have said. The case garnered widespread attention in May 2022 when Canadian broadcaster TSN reported the woman had settled a lawsuit she’d filed against Hockey Canada – the nation’s governing body for the sport – and members of the junior team over the assault allegations. A cascade of developments followed, including June 2022 parliamentary hearings over Hockey Canada’s handling of the case, and July 2022 announcements that London police and Hockey Canada would reopen their investigations. Investigators are scheduled to address the London police investigation and pending charges in a news conference scheduled for Monday. Formenton “will vigorously defend his innocence and asks that people not rush to judgment without hearing all of the evidence,” his attorneys, Daniel Brown and Lindsay Board, said in a release. Formenton, who played for the Senators in 2017, took an indefinite leave of absence from Swiss hockey club Ambri-Piotta last week. McLeod “denies any criminal wrongdoing,” his attorneys, David Humphrey and Seth Weinstein, said in a release. “He will be pleading not guilty and will vigorously defend the case. Foote “is innocent of the charge and will defend himself against this allegation to clear his name,” a lawyer for Foote said. “What is most critical at this time is the presumption of innocence, and the right to a fair trial that everyone in Canada is entitled to.” Hart “is innocent and will provide a full response to this false allegation in the proper forum, a court of law,” his attorneys Riaz Sayani and Megan Savard said in a joint release. Dube “will plead not guilty and maintains his innocence,” and “will defend the allegations in court,” his attorneys, Louis P. Strezos and Kaleigh Davidson, said in a statement. The Flames are “aware of the charge of sexual assault that has been laid against Dillon Dube,” the club said Tuesday. “We take this matter very seriously. Because the matter is now pending legal proceedings, we will have no further comment at this time.” The Flames had said January 21 that Dube was “ granted an indefinite leave of absence from the team while he attends to his mental health.” On Tuesday, the club said it had “no knowledge of pending charges at the time Dillon’s request for a leave of absence was granted.” The Devils, for whom McLeod and Foote play, are “aware of the reports” and have “been told to refer all inquiries regarding this to the league,” the team told CNN Tuesday. The NHL declined to comment Tuesday when reached by CNN. CNN also has sought comment from the woman’s lawyer and Hockey Canada. Hockey Canada apologized in 2022 for its handing of the case A month after the TSN report, the Canadian government in June 2022 announced it was freezing federal, public funding for Hockey Canada until the organization had submitted the complete results of its original, two-year investigation and plans for implementing change within Hockey Canada. During parliamentary hearings in June 2022, executives for Hockey Canada disclosed that it was notified of the incident the day after it was alleged to have taken place in 2018. “We immediately initiated a process to investigate, beginning by contacting police. We commissioned an independent investigation and appointed an independent adjudication panel of judges to review the findings of that investigation,” said Tom Renney, Hockey Canada’s former CEO, during testimony. Renney confirmed during the hearings that Hockey Canada had settled a civil lawsuit that the woman field in April 2022, but he did not reveal settlement amount. In July 2022, Hockey Canada published a letter apologizing for it said was inadequate action regarding the assault allegations, and said it was reopening an internal investigation. Three months later, the organization announced its CEO and board of directors were being replaced. CNN’s David Close contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Residents of Westlock , Alta., have voted in favour of prohibiting non-governmental flags from being flown on municipal flagpoles and the painting of town crosswalks in any other way than a traditional white-striped pattern. The result of the plebiscite, which by law was automatically triggered by a petition brought forward to council in October 2023, means that the town’s Pride crosswalk will need to be removed. The vote on Thursday was a close one, with 663 people voting in favour of the changes and 639 people voting against them, according to unofficial results posted by the town on Thursday night. In a news release, Mayor Jon Kramer noted that town council did not support the bylaw because it “went against our commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion.” “This plebiscite is binding, and as such, the bylaw does restrict how we are able to show this commitment,” he said “However, we will continue to find ways to embrace those in our community who need a helping hand, including marginalized groups.

That’s a violation of human rights.” The petition for the bylaw came to town council five months after a Pride crosswalk was painted in the town . The crosswalk was painted on June 27. Stephanie Bakker helped organize the petition. In November she said the initiative was aimed at keeping town council “neutral” after plans were made to paint a crosswalk in Pride colours. Over the summer, Bakker and the “Westlock Neutrality Team” gathered signatures from more than 700 residents, forcing town council to begin the process of adopting the proposed bylaw. “We were grateful,” she said on Friday when asked what her reaction to the vote was. “We had no idea which way the vote would go. Story continues below advertisement “I think the best way to make an inclusive community is for public spaces to be just a neutral black canvas. And the government should not be arbitrating one ideology or another.” Bakker said upon learning months ago that the town had plans for a Pride crosswalk, she voiced her concerns to town council but found the reaction to be “dismissive.” “I just really feel things like this segregate our community more, especially if it’s the government stepping in and doing it,” she said. “I have no problem whatsoever with private citizens trying to create better relationships with the Pride community or any minority community at all — that’s fine. That’s a beautiful thing. “And our town — surprisingly for a little hick farming town — it’s very diverse. There’s a lot of different people in this community. I just decided to make my case for neutrality.” Bakker indicated she would have raised the same concerns if the plans were for “a Buddhist crosswalk or a Black Lives Matter crosswalk.” She said she has planned a community get-together with the hope of uniting the town regardless of how different people feel about the plebiscite and the results.

In the video on X, formerly known as Twitter, Smith said parents of children aged 16 and 17 will not need to consent to the changes but will need to be notified.

Smith’s video was posted on X and reporters were not given an opportunity to ask questions.

Making permanent and irreversible decisions regarding one’s biological sex while still a youth can severely limit that child’s choices in the future. Prematurely encouraging or enabling children to alter their very biology or natural growth, no matter how well-intentioned and sincere, poses a risk to that child’s future that I as premier am not comfortable with permitting in our province.” Gender identity can be a hard thing to talk about, especially when you are involved.

It has taken no time for the misinformation campaigns and threats to ramp up on social media. “To make this announcement on social media platforms with no journalistic engagement is a calculated move, meant to fuel highly charged ideological and political rhetoric, leading up to a media availability that will be used to blame trans allies for misrepresenting the intent.” Story continues below advertisement Former Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi said while Smith’s delivery was “communicated well and with compassion,” the policy is cruel and inhumane. “In particular, it means even abusive parents must be told, and Child Protective Services will get involved later,” he posted on X. “I hope that as details emerge, this issue is amended quickly.

The Canadian Medical Association Journal published a study in 2022 that suggests homosexual and transgender youth showed five times the risk of suicidal ideation compared to their cisgender peers. A study by the Stigma and Resilience Among Vulnerable Youth Centre at the University of British Columbia suggests 64 per cent of transgender and gender-non-conforming youth aged 14 to 25 years surveyed reported they had seriously considered suicide in the previous 12 months. Transgender and gender-non-conforming youth also have a higher probability of many risk factors for suicidality, such as peer victimization and family dysfunction.

Schilling previously told Global News the ATA was not consulted on the parental rights policy, and the premier’s office did not answer questions about who was consulted. “I’m very concerned about, the safety and the wellness of all of our students, but particularly about the safety of our trans students and our 2SLGBTQ+ students. They’re some of the most vulnerable students that we have within our schools and we need to ensure that they are protected and safe,” Schilling said. He says he’s worried the policy will have unintended consequences for children and teachers across the province if passed in legislature. A lot of teachers will not be able to help students who might be struggling with their gender identity, he said.

Smith made a speech last November to party members promising to protect parents’ rights. The delegates overwhelmingly passed a motion requiring parental consent if a child under the age of 16 wishes to use a different name or pronoun at school, mirroring legislation recently passed in Saskatchewan that has drawn harsh criticism from LGBTQ2 advocates. Story continues below advertisement “One of the things that was talked about at that meeting in the fall was a bill of rights that would deal with parental consent around their children, and education and healthcare decision making,” Hardcastle told Global News. “So it isn’t clear if this is going to be part of a broader set of legal changes or whether we’re simply going to see more narrow changes, for example to health insurance legislation.” Hardcastle said the policy could be a part of a larger suite of changes being discussed among the party. “In some ways, this is a political move more than it is a change to the health care that lots of people receive. For example, it isn’t clear if children under 18 are currently receiving surgery anyway. And so I would question whether the change is meant to address something that’s actually occurring or if it’s meant more to pander to the premier’s political base,” she said. But she said it’s also important to remember that this is a policy, not a piece of legislation. “If this is just going to be a policy change and isn’t going to be legislation, then unfortunately, we won’t have the benefit of legislative debates on this issue. If these kinds of changes are emerging from some of the resolutions that were voted on at the UCP’s annual general meeting — that’s a narrow subset of the public,” she said. Story continues below advertisement “The government should really be consulting with these changes and what they look like with healthcare professionals who treat children in this area, we should be hearing from adults who are parents to children who are seeking gender-affirming care, we should hear from adolescents themselves seeking gender-affirming treatment. those voices seem to be largely missing from this discussion.” Lori Williams, a political scientist at Mount Royal University, said the policy is a “nod” to the social conservatives in the UCP base. The video is “desperately trying to depoliticize something that is highly political and highly controversial,” Williams said. “This does have some consistency with Danielle Smith’s past, her support of LGBTQ2S rights and freedoms, but also trying to recognize the concerns that parents, particularly social conservative parents, have,” she told Global News. Williams added the policy is similar to Saskatchewan’s and New Brunswick’s policies, but may be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. “I guess we’ll see what the courts do. I don’t know if she’s planning to use the notwithstanding clause … Some are concerned that could endanger some children who are already very fragile, who are trying to understand their identity and feeling less than safe in doing so. This doesn’t help those students, particularly,” the political scientist said.",

Civil liberties groups argued law discriminates against Muslim women who wear head coverings Verity Stevenson · CBC News · Posted: Feb 29, 2024 4:00 AM EST | Last Updated: March 1, 2024 Pro-Bill 21 lawyer Guillaume Rousseau, right, comments on the Quebec Court of Appeal ruling in support of Bill 21, Quebec's religious symbols law, in Montreal, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld the province's controversial secularism law in a ruling on challenges to the law's constitutionality released Thursday afternoon. The heavily anticipated judgment is 290-pages long and quashes a previous exception, made by Superior Court Judge Marc-André Blanchard, that allowed English schools to employ teachers wearing religious symbols — such as a head covering — while on the job. A panel of Appeal Court judges heard arguments from civil liberties groups challenging the law, as well as from the government, in November 2022. Premier François Legault's government had appealed the Superior Court decision, rendered in April 2021, that upheld most of the law but made the exception for English schools. His government had said the exception created an unfair distinction between francophone and anglophone schools. In a summary of their decision Thursday, the Appeal Court justices, Manon Savard, Yves-Marie Morrissette et Marie-France Bich, said the law does not go against \"the unwritten principles of the Constitution, nor the constitutional architecture, nor any pre-Confederation law or principle having constitutional value.\" Quebec Court of Appeal to evaluate whether secularism law unfairly targets Muslim women They said their judgment had nothing to do with \"diverse opinions about [the law], whether politically, sociologically or morally.\" \"The Court, like the Superior Court before it, is in fact acting here as part of a process of monitoring the legality of the law (a process initiated by different groups of litigants) and it is not ruling on the wisdom of the law,\" the judges wrote. The secularism law, which has been in place since June 2019, prevents a number of civil servants — including teachers and police officers — from wearing religious symbols while on the job. The justices said that, in their opinion, Blanchard had erred in creating the exception for English schools. They said the law did not impede anglophone students from receiving their minority-language education. \"Rather, what is at issue here is a restriction on the recruitment of personnel, which however remains unrelated to any linguistic consideration,\" the judges wrote. WATCH | What's in the Quebec Court of Appeal decision on Bill 21?: Quebec Court of Appeal upholds CAQ government's secularism law 1 year ago Duration 0:58 The ruling revokes a previous exception, made by a Superior Court Judge, that allowed English schools to employ teachers wearing religious symbols — such as a head covering — while at work. The judges did however maintain another exception created in Blanchard's judgment — that MNAs be exempt from the law — saying elected officials should have the right to wear religious symbols, unlike other representatives of the state in positions of authority such as judges, Crown prosecutors, prison guards, police officers, school principals and teachers. Several groups have challenged the law's constitutionality. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Council of Canadian Muslims were among those arguing Bill 21 discriminates on the basis of religion. Arguments in the Court of Appeal case were heard by a panel of judges a year and a half ago. At the time, the panel of judges hinted that the case hinged on whether the bill disproportionately discriminates against Muslim women who wear the hijab. CBC Explains What's in Quebec's secularism bill: Religious symbols, uncovered faces and a charter workaround Legault: Quebec will continue to use notwithstanding clause A key argument of groups opposed to the law is that it discriminates on the basis of gender by disproportionately targeting Muslim women. Provincial laws that can be shown to be discriminatory on the basis of gender cannot be shielded by the notwithstanding clause. Quebec Premier François Legault arrives to address the media in Montreal, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024, where he gave his reaction to the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision on the province's secularism law, known as Bill 21. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) The CAQ pre-emptively invoked the constitutional notwithstanding clause when drafting the bill to protect it against legal challenges. The clause gives provinces the power to override portions the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for renewable periods of five years. But the Appeal Court judges said the law, and its use of the notwithstanding clause, couldn't be \"invalidated\" based solely on discrimination on the basis of gender. They also said the law itself does not go against that part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a short news conference, Legault told reporters the decision was \"a great victory for the Quebec nation.\" \"The Quebec government will continue to use the notwithstanding clause as long as necessary for Canada to recognize the social choices of the Quebec nation. It's non-negotiable,\" the premier said. English Montreal School Board Chair Joe Ortona holds up a copy of the ruling as he comments on the Quebec Court of Appeal ruling in favour of Bill 21, Quebec's religious symbols law, in Montreal, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Disappointment Joe Ortona, chair of the English Montreal School Board, which first challenged Bill 21 in Superior Court, said he was disappointed by the decision, especially for all the teachers who would be affected by the law from now on. \"My heart goes out to them,\" Ortona said. \"It's part of the reason we launched this challenge to begin with.  We think that teachers should have the right to wear whatever they want.\" Ortona said he would be reviewing the decision before deciding with the board whether to apply for a Supreme Court appeal.

I had to leave my family, my friends, go to a new province that I've never been to before, reacclimatize myself to a new curriculum, and just start from zero,\" Kaur said in an interview with CBC on Wednesday. Other groups that have challenged the law have already said they would take the case to the country's highest court. Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, called the decision \"painful\" and said the organization would pursue its fight against the law. \"What's next as we fight it? We have fought it from the very first day and we will continue fighting in the courts and with the public to get this bill reversed, struck down, anything we can do to restore fundamental rights to everybody,\" said Mendelsohn Aviv. The Fédération des femmes du Québec, which gave expert testimony to overturn the law also said Thursday's decision is a \"considerable loss\" and that Bill 21 reinforces Islamophobia in the province. \"Muslim women are the first targets of the public debate on secularism,\" said the federation's president Sylvie St-Amand in a statement. She adds that she's worried this most recent ruling will lead to an increase in violence already being experienced by Muslim women. \"A feminist society can never tolerate laws that restrict women's rights to make decisions about their bodies and beliefs, that limit their ability to participate in society, obtain services or find employment,\" reads the statement. Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, was at the Quebec Court of Appeal yesterday when the decision to uphold the province's secularism law was published. 'The notwithstanding clause should in our view never be used to violate the fundamental rights of minority groups,' she said. (Kwabena Oduro/CBC) Next, the Supreme Court? Federal Justice Minister Arif Virani said in a statement he expects there will requests to bring the case to the Supreme Court of Canada and if the court agrees to hear the appeal, the case would become a \"national issue.\" \"Our government will be there to defend the Charter before the Supreme Court of Canada. This case concerns fundamental rights and freedoms and concerns the interpretation and application of the Charter. We are absolutely committed to participating in this important national discussion with broad implications for all Canadians,\" Virani said in the written statement. Guillaume Rousseau, a lawyer for the Mouvement laïque québécois , one of the groups in favour of the law and which participated in the appeal of the Superior Court decision, called Thursday's judgment a \"victory on all fronts.\" \"It's a great victory for all of those who support a secular Quebec, and it's a especially a victory for those who support Quebec's liberty, Quebec's autonomy,\" Rousseau told reporters at the courthouse in downtown Montreal. \"This is a clear disavowal for all those who have been telling us for years that it is possible to circumvent the derogation clause.\" Ahead of the Appeal Court decision's release, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a housing announcement in Ontario that he wanted to reiterate his opposition to Quebec's secularism law and said his government would support a Supreme Court appeal. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet criticized Trudeau and Virani for saying they would pick a side in a Supreme Court case. \"Using the courts as a recourse is always legitimate. Supported by the state against another government is something else,\" Blanchet said. Corrections An earlier version of this story said the Fédération des femmes du Québec was pleased with the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision to uphold Bill 21. This is incorrect. In a statement, the federation says the court's decision is a \"considerable loss\" and that the law reinforces Islamophobia in Quebec.

During a media briefing Thursday afternoon, Ottawa police Chief Eric Stubbs said there were initially two calls to 911 around 10:52 p.m. local time Wednesday. He said first responders arrived within minutes to the home on Berrigan Drive near Palmadeo Drive, a residential area close to two schools.

He said Ottawa police had never dealt with either the suspect or the family, and had never been called to that address before Wednesday night. 'Unimaginable loss' During Thursday's update, Stubbs called the killings \"a senseless act of violence perpetrated on purely innocent people.\" He offered his condolences to the victims' loved ones \"for this unimaginable loss.\" \"This [homicide] will undoubtedly weigh on the hearts of everyone for a very long time,\" he said.

PWHL tweaks penalty, short-handed goal, shootout in rule book History in the making: PWHL's Toronto vs. New York begins new era in women's hockey When it came time for GM Gina Kingsbury to address her squad, she felt uncharacteristically speechless. It's a moment she's dreamed about for years, too, having played in leagues that didn't pay, inside community rinks with staff who were volunteers, playing with women who worked long days at second jobs to come to the rink late at night and play a game they loved. \"We are there with the athletes on the ice today,\" Kingsbury told CBC's Andi Petrillo. \"I think we're all so excited that we're finally here and that there's a professional league for these athletes to play in, and that the door of the gate is wide open for the next generation of athletes to walk right in and be a professional athlete.\" WATCH l How we got here: The journey to the creation of the PWHL: How We Got Here: The journey to the creation of the PWHL 1 year ago Duration 2:39 CBC Sports' Andi Petrillo chronicles the long road to a sustainable professional women's hockey league, from the collapse of the CWHL to first puck drop in the PWHL. As excited as she was for the players, Kingsbury said she was also thrilled for the team's staff to get the opportunity to do their jobs in a professional environment. \"For me to be a GM and just talk hockey and to plan and build a team is a dream come true,\" Kingsbury said. \"It's pretty hard to put into words what it means. It's not just the athletes. It's everyone involved.\" 'They keep pinching themselves' During the pre-game ceremony, every member of Toronto's team, including reserve players, heard their name and hometown announced as they skated on to the ice. There were rookies like Emma Maltais and Maggie Connors, who get to start their careers with the kind of resources women before them could only have dreamed about. There was Nurse, who spent countless hours as part of the player committee that negotiated the eight-year collective bargaining agreement that secured players benefits like maternity leave and a housing stipend. It enshrined things that sound basic, like pre- and post-game meals, but haven't always been guaranteed for women who played professional hockey. Toronto PWHL players line up on the blueline before Monday's game. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press) There were Jess Jones and Erica Howe, who spent years making almost nothing in the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), and who have put other careers on hold to be part of this new league. They aren't on their country's national team, but they've kept playing through a folded league and a pandemic, maybe wondering whether they'd get a chance to be a part of this. There was Vespa, who was about to score her first professional league goal in front of a hometown crowd, after spending last hockey season balancing hockey with a job as a snowplow operator with the City of Hamilton. Shortly after, King took the arm of Jayna Hefford, the Hockey Hall of Famer who serves as the PWHL's senior vice president of hockey operations, and they walked to centre ice, waving to the crowd. King kissed the puck before dropping it between New York captain Micah Zandee-Hart and Turnbull.

It was almost five years ago when King and her wife, Ilana Kloss, answered the phone at a Los Angeles Lakers game. When they found a quiet spot to talk, they heard Minnesota forward Kendall Coyne Schofield on the other end of the line, asking for their help. King and Kloss became advisors to the players' association that Coyne Schofield and other players spearheaded, and ultimately convinced Los Angeles Dodgers owner Mark Walter to invest what is now the PWHL. Both King and Kloss sit on the league's advisory board. But the creation of the PWHL is a story that spans more than five years. It weaves through more generations than the women who got to play on Monday. Men have had the NHL for more than 100 years, while women have been waiting for a similar opportunity, King told Petrillo before the game. \"The women are so excited,\" King said. \"They keep pinching themselves. I don't think people realize the yearning that's gone on for generations for this.\" Rematch set for Friday For the last five years, female hockey players have spent a lot of time talking about inequity, about league building, and about a supposed \"rift\" between the players who sat out and those who played in the defunct Premier Hockey Federation. Now, they're all together in one league and they get to talk about playing hockey, with Monday's game the first of 72 across the PWHL this season.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Approximately 70 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members were deployed to Jamaica on Friday to train military personnel from several Caribbean countries who are bound for Haiti as part of a multinational security force led by Kenya and backed by the United Nations. The Canadian personnel will provide training on core peacekeeping skills and combat first aid to troops from Jamaica, Belize and the Bahamas — member countries of the Caribbean economic and political bloc known as CARICOM — the CAF said in a joint press release with the Department of National Defence on Saturday. The CARICOM troops are expected to help support the Haitian National Police in their efforts to restore security for people in Haiti, the statement said. The Canadian-led training mission, known as Operation HELIOS, will take place at the CAF's Operational Support Hub in Jamaica. The Canadian deployment will last for an initial period of one month, where the CAF expects to train around 330 CARICOM troops, said the release. The Canadian personnel deployed are primarily from the 1st Battalion, Royal 22e Régiment from Valcartier, Que. \"Canada is stepping up with important contributions to Haiti's security. We will continue to support Haitian-led efforts to build stability,\" said Minister of National Defence Bill Blair in the release. 'Cataclysmic' situation in Haiti Haiti's gang wars have intensified in recent weeks with heavily armed rivals unleashing fresh waves of attacks, including raids on police stations and  the international airport. Over 1,500 people have been killed so far this year in the ensuing violence, said a UN human rights office report Thursday, describing the \"cataclysmic\" situation in Haiti. A woman walks past burning tires during a demonstration following the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on March 12. (Clarens Siffroy/AFP/Getty Images) The report documents 4,451 killings last year and 1,554 so far this year, up to March 22, as violence has escalated. Some people have been killed in their homes in reprisal for their alleged support for the police or rival gangs. Others have been killed in the street by snipers or in crossfire, the UN report said. One of the victims was a three-month-old baby. Armed brigades filling a security void left by police lynched 528 people suspected of links to gangs last year and 59 so far this year, the UN rights office said. \"The recent escalation of violence has heightened human rights abuses, including killings, kidnappings, and rapes, especially against women and young girls,\" the report said in its conclusions, calling on states to support the rapid deployment of a UN-backed international security force. Canada's involvement Roughly 3,000 Canadians are registered in Haiti, according to Global Affairs Canada (GAC). With airports and roads under gang control, leaving the country has been a challenge. GAC issued an update Thursday that 50 Canadians were evacuated from the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, to the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The department has now assisted 132 Canadian citizens in reuniting with their families, it said. WATCH | Dozens of Canadians evacuated by helicopter from Haiti's capital: 50 Canadians evacuated from Haiti as violence continues 1 year ago Duration 1:55 Fifty Canadian citizens were evacuated by helicopter from Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince to neighbouring Dominican Republic as gang violence continues to create chaos in the streets. On top of efforts to get Canadians out safely, Canada is contributing $80.5 million to the multinational security force but says it will not send soldiers or police to participate directly. A very small number of RCMP officers are deployed to Haiti now, mostly in training roles. Their number fluctuates; the terms of the deployment allow for up to 45 Mounties to be in Haiti at a time, but their current complement numbers in the single digits. Soldiers and police making up the multinational security force will come from Kenya, Benin, Jamaica, Trinidad, Guyana, Barbados and a few other Caribbean island nations. Kenya will take the lead and will be the first to deploy. The Kenya-led mission is not a United Nations operation but it was authorized by the UN Security Council in October. The Haitian government requested the mission in 2022. It has since encountered multiple legal obstacles, including a January court ruling in Kenya that blocked the deployment of Kenyan police officers.

Ryan Albright says he's exploring option of using another company's plant in the meantime Aidan Cox · CBC News · Posted: Mar 06, 2024 3:03 PM EST | Last Updated: March 6, 2024 A fire destroyed the manufacturing plant in Hartland last Friday. (Aidan Cox/CBC) Social Sharing The owner of a New Brunswick potato chip plant destroyed by fire says he plans to rebuild it in the same spot where it burned down. Ryan Albright said he's been working with his insurance company, and while it will likely be a lengthy process, he hopes to rebuild the Covered Bridge Potato Chips manufacturing plant as soon as possible. \"We're also in full design mode, you know, trying to lay out building equipment, looking at timelines,\" Albright said in an interview Wednesday. \"But that'll be an evolving thing over the next days and weeks to come,\" he said, adding that he hopes the plant can will have increased processing capacity along with a more efficient manufacturing operation. Covered Bridge Potato Chips founder and owner Ryan Albright says he's planning to rebuild the plant. (Aidan Cox/CBC) The plant just off the Trans-Canada Highway went up in flames Friday afternoon, and by the next day, all that was left were the charred metal remains of the building and equipment. No one was injured, but the plant alone employed about 120 people, and benefited local truckers and farmers in western New Brunswick. The New Brunswick fire marshal is now investigating, and a cause has not been revealed. 18 years of work up in smoke Albright said he's still waiting on the findings of the fire marshal's investigation but believes the fire started in the part of the plant where the potatoes are fried. He said about 30 employees were at work when the fire started. At the time, Albright was driving to Bangor, Me., to meet his wife, a travel nurse. About an hour into his drive, he said he received a call from an employee telling him about the fire He turned around and drove back to the plant to find the building in flames. A fire tore through the Covered Bridge Potato Chip factory but everyone still in the building got out safely and no one was injured. (Dustin Culberson/Facebook) \"Standing there watching it was, it was pretty devastating, you know, looking at the 18 years of your adult life being gone up in smoke.\" But while the manufacturing plant was destroyed, Albright said that he feels fortunate no one was injured and that other crucial parts of the business are situated in other locations. Those include two large shipping warehouses, a raw materials warehouse and the company's head office in Saint Thomas, about 10 kilometres away. He said the warehouses still have products ready to be shipped to stores. Also, in an effort to keep some production going, Albright said he's working on an interim arrangement that would allow the business to make potato chips at another local company's factory. Working on next steps for employees Albright said the company employed 185 people, with some having relocated permanently from other parts of the world, and others working under the federal temporary foreign worker program. He said for the company's temporary foreign workers, he's working on flying them back to their home countries. As for the other affected employees, Albright said the company has been trying to match them with other jobs in the community. Destruction of Covered Bridge Potato Chips plant a 'nightmare,' says employee Hartland reeling after Covered Bridge Potato Chips plant destroyed by fire \"A lot of our team said, you know, as soon as we rebuild they're [planning to come] back, and we hope that's the situation,\" he said. \"We have an amazing team, so you know, as some people move into some other jobs, you know, hoping that whenever we're back up and running, they know they're going to come back and join us again.\" Information session Friday Paul Bradley, a spokesperson for the provincial government, said WorkingNB, the province's employment agency, is working with the company on how to best support employees.

        "text": "Canada is committing another $132.2 million in humanitarian funding to help people displaced by the violent conflict in Sudan that has been raging for the past year, the government announced Friday. The conflict has killed thousands of civilians, forced millions of people to flee within Sudan and to neighbouring African countries and created one of the world’s worst hunger crises. The United Nations’ World Food Program has warned about a third of the country’s population, or 18 million people, face acute hunger, with five million on the verge of starvation. “The humanitarian situation is dire,” Canada’s International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen told Global News in an interview. The new funding includes $100.7 million in direct humanitarian assistance and $31.5 million to UN projects aimed at addressing sexual and reproductive health rights in Sudan and South Sudan, as well as gender-based violence.

Although Hussen acknowledged “logistical challenges” to ensuring aid is delivered to those who need it within Sudan, he said there has been less resistance and roadblocks in neighbouring countries like South Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia and Central African Republic that have accepted refugees. But many of those countries also have limited resources that are being stretched even thinner by the influx of Sudanese people, Hussen noted, specifically noting the inadequate access to water in Chad.

The summit will mark exactly one year since fighting first broke out between the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the capital Khartoum. Hussen said Canada will be presenting the new aid at the conference as an example that other participating countries should “step up” and follow with their own contributions. Story continues below advertisement The UN says it has asked the global community for $2.7 billion in funding to respond to humanitarian needs but has received $155 million — or six per cent of their request. “If the World Food Program does not receive more support for its Sudan appeal, that they will simply stop serving food because they will run out of money to purchase food supplies,” Hussen said the food agency’s executive director, Cindy McCain, told him recently. He said aid groups and other non-government organizations will also be participating in the talks, which will focus not just on aid but also on how to resolve the conflict and hold those responsible to account. Canada has predominantly responded to the crisis through humanitarian aid, committing $170 million last year. A family reunification program was announced late last year to help get relatives of Canadians out of Sudan, but the program has stalled and faced criticism from families. The federal government has regularly sent aid to the country in recent years as part of its African outreach.

(Lukas Wall/CBC) PC candidate Jim McKenna has won the Fogo Island-Cape Freels byelection, flipping the seat from red to blue. According to Elections N.L.'s numbers, McKenna received 3,290 votes, defeating Liberal candidate Dana Blackmore who received 2,244 votes — securing 58 per cent of the vote to Blackmore's 39 per cent. In a distant third was NDP candidate Jim Gill, who garnered just 169 votes, accounting for three per cent of the vote. The byelection was called after the district's former MHA, Liberal cabinet minister Derrick Bragg, died in mid-January, after announcing in mid-2023 that he had been diagnosed with tongue cancer. Bragg had been MHA of the district since it was created in 2015 with parts of former districts Bonavista North, Lewisporte and the Isles of Notre Dame as well as part of the Terra Nova district. The district includes Fogo Island and the Change Islands, communities on Newfoundland's northeast coast from Cape Freels to Hare Bay, as well as the Dog Bay and Gander Bay areas. Polls were open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. NT.

Social Sharing Millions of people across North America fell into chilly midday darkness on Monday as a total solar eclipse slid across the continent for the first time in seven years, leaving crowds to experience a phenomenon they won't see in Canada again for decades. Parts of southern Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes were momentarily plunged into the dark as the moon slid between the sun and the Earth over the course of a few hours in the afternoon. The sky dimmed, birds went quiet, streetlights came on and the sun's corona — a ghostly white ring around its outer edge — became visible to the human eye. \"This is incredible. That diamond ring ... that's gorgeous,\" said CBC's Chris Ensing, standing at the edge of Lake Erie during totality in Kingsville, Ont. \"What a moment.\" Clouds threatened to block the view of the sun in many areas within the path of totality, but the thin layer of clouds didn't seem to make much of a difference as the moon cast its shadow over parts of Canada. Some crowds clapped at the sight overhead, like those in Kingsville, while others went quiet. The crowd in Niagara Falls cheered for Norma Rois, 58, when she yelled out that it was her birthday during a moment of the totality.

I don't know their names, but we were cheering together,\" she said. Kathy Eller of O'Leary, P.E.I., said she had no regrets after waiting outside for six hours to take in the total eclipse near the province's northwestern tip. \"It was better than fireworks,\" she said. \"I forgot about everybody around, and was just concentrating on the sun and the moon. It was kind of like magic.\" In the nation's capital, a public inquiry looking into foreign interference in Canada's elections paused proceedings so the lawyers, witnesses and journalists could see the show. Thousands of people in Mazatlán, Mexico, were first on the continent to experience totality at 1:05 p.m. ET. Crowds came together in deck chairs on the coastline, looking skyward through eclipse glasses as the moon slipped across the sky. \"It was absolutely remarkable. The sky was a little bit cloudy ... but the eclipse totality was not obscured at all,\" said Joy Daniels, an eclipse chaser who travelled to Mazatlán from her home in Calgary with 13 friends and family members. \"It went quite dark.... The birds, they all went to sleep and the temperature went way, way down.\" The eclipse began over the southern Pacific Ocean before moving into Mexico and the United States. Crowds in southwestern Ontario were the first in Canada to experience the eclipse before the show moved into Quebec and Atlantic Canada, where it ended off the coast of Newfoundland after roughly 30 minutes. In Canada, the path of totality — the stretch where the moon will block the sunlight entirely — included parts of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador. People outside the path of totality in Ontario , Quebec and the Maritimes could see a partial solar eclipse, with just a chunk of the sun obscured by the moon. Here's what else you need to know. What did the total solar eclipse look like? Why was this eclipse so significant? Do I need special glasses to look at eclipses? Can I take photos of eclipses on my phone? Were Canadian cities in the path of totality busy? What did the total solar eclipse look like? A total solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, completely blocking the face of the sun. People watching from the path of totality experience what's called a total solar eclipse. The sky goes dark as if it were dawn or dusk. Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun's corona, the white ring usually washed out by the bright light of the sun. Outside the path of totality, the moon moved between the sun and Earth — but the three didn't line up perfectly. Only a part of the sun was covered, giving it a crescent-like shape. WATCH | The first glimpse of totality in Mexico: VIDEO | 'Oh my goodness!': The moment a total eclipse appeared 1 year ago Duration 1:03 As the moon blocks the sun over Mazatlán, Mexico — one of the first parts of North America to experience totality — CBC's Heather Hiscox and Astronomy in Action's Ryan Marciniak break down what people are seeing. Why was this eclipse so significant? After Monday, the next total solar eclipse over North America won't be until Aug. 23, 2044. Beyond that, this event was particularly special because the path of totality passed over densely populated parts of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. (Most solar eclipses happen over the ocean.) This one was also a longer show, with darkness lasting nearly two minutes longer over some areas in the path of totality than the last solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017. Do I need special glasses to look at eclipses? Yes. It's always dangerous to look at the sun with the naked eye. Space agencies and ophthalmologists agree that looking at a partial solar eclipse without approved eye protection can cause lasting eye damage. The Canadian Space Agency and NASA have both extended advice for protecting your vision. Eclipse glasses are sold at a variety of stores, both in person and online, but it's important to check for one key feature: Your glasses should be marked with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 12312-2 code. That code specifies the properties that a solar viewer should have to protect your eyes. Can I take photos of eclipses on my phone? Photographers don't recommend it. Just like the immense amount of direct light from the sun can damage your eyes, it can damage the lens of a camera. If you're really compelled to take a photo of the sun, photographers say you should cover the lens with a solar filter — though they say their favourite photos are the ones that captured people as they experience the show. Were Canadian cities in the path of totality busy? Busier than usual. Many photographers and eclipse chasers spent months, if not years, planning for the total solar eclipse. Some have spent thousands of dollars travelling to what they hoped would be the best vantage point. Cities in the path of totality expected hundreds of thousands of people to flood their communities on Monday, potentially creating traffic jams. (Niagara Falls, Ont., was expected to be so crowded that the region declared a state of emergency 11 days in advance .

        "text": "Seven killed including Palestinian, Australian, Canadian-US, Polish, and UK citizens in an Israeli air attack in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah. World leaders have expressed horror and anger following an Israeli air strike that killed seven aid workers in the central Gaza Strip, and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire. United States-based aid group World Central Kitchen (WCK) confirmed on Tuesday that its staff members were killed in a “targeted attack” by the Israeli military. The dead were from Palestine, Australia, Poland, the United Kingdom, and US-Canada. The NGO said its team was traveling in a “deconflicted” area in a convoy of “two armored cars branded with the WCK logo and a soft skin vehicle” at the time of the strike. WCK called on Israel to stop “this indiscriminate killing” in Gaza, It also announced that it was “pausing [its] operations in the region”.    A post shared by World Central Kitchen (@wckitchen)  “Despite coordinating movements with the IDF, the convoy was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route,” it said. World leaders echoed the NGO’s anger, as Israel’s onslaught on Gaza continues to worsen its global image. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed one of the killed aid workers was Australian national Zomi Frankcom. Speaking at a news conference in Brisbane, Albanese said Frankcom’s death was “completely unacceptable” and “beyond any reasonable circumstances”. “This news today is tragic. DFAT have also requested a call-in from the Israeli ambassador as well,” Albanese said, referring to Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. “We want full accountability for this. This is a tragedy that should never have occurred. “The truth is that this is beyond any reasonable circumstances that someone going about providing aid and humanitarian assistance should lose their life and there were four aid workers as well as a Palestinian driver in this vehicle,” Albanese added. Albanese also reiterated calls for a “sustainable ceasefire”. “Australians want to see an end to this conflict,” he said. DFAT said earlier in a statement that Australia has been “very clear that we expect humanitarian workers in Gaza to have safe and unimpeded access to do their lifesaving work”. UK Foreign Minister David Cameron described the killings as “deeply distressing”, calling on Israel to investigate and provide an explanation. “British Nationals are reported to have been killed, we are urgently working to verify this information and will provide full support to their families,” Cameron said on X. “It is essential that humanitarian workers are protected and able to carry out their work. We have called on Israel to immediately investigate and provide a full, transparent explanation of what happened.” Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed condolences to the family of its citizen who was killed in a post on X. It added that it “objects to the disregard for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, including humanitarian workers”. A foreign ministry spokesman said Warsaw had requested an “explanation from the Israeli embassy, the security forces and the Israeli military”, adding that the ministry was currently relying on information from the WCK. We extend our deepest condolences to the family of the 🇵🇱 volunteer who was providing aid to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. Poland objects to the disregard for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, including humanitarian workers. — Ministry of Foreign Affairs 🇵🇱 (@PolandMFA) April 2, 2024  Spain’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Jose Manuel Albares said he was “horrified” by the deaths of the aid workers. “Spain supports their work. We demand a ceasefire and the entry of humanitarian aid,” he said. Janez Lenarcic, the European Union’s humanitarian affairs commissioner, also condemned the attack and called for a ceasefire. “This must stop. Now,” he said in a post on X. Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, where the deceased’s bodies were taken, said she had spoken with the aid workers earlier in the day. “Everyone in the hospital is amazed and astonished, they don’t believe Israeli forces targeted internationals,” Khoudary said. The Israeli military has said it is investigating “to understand all the circumstances of the incident” and that it makes “extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid”. Several hours later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the strike was unintended. “This happens in wartime,” he declared. “We are thoroughly looking into it, are in contact with the governments (of the foreigners among the dead) and will do everything to ensure it does not happen again.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

In a statement, it said the Quest, a schooner-rigged vessel, lay at a depth of 390 meters (1,280 feet) off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada's easternmost province. The ship, which was damaged by ice and sank in 1962 when being used by seal hunters, was found intact on Sunday. Sign up here. Shackleton, preparing for his fourth journey to the Antarctic, died of a heart attack aboard the Quest on Jan 5, 1922, near the remote island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic. He was 47.

It was also put into service with the Royal Canadian Navy during World War Two. The society's announcement marks the second time in two years that one of the Anglo-Irish explorer's ships has been found. In March 2022, search teams discovered the remains of the Endurance, which was crushed by Antarctic ice and sank some 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) in November 1915. The 28-man Endurance crew all made it home alive in what is considered one of the great survival stories. They trekked across the sea ice before setting sail in three lifeboats and reaching the uninhabited Elephant Island. Shackleton and handful of crew mates then rowed some 1,290 km (800 miles) to South Georgia and sought help from a whaling station. On his fourth rescue attempt, Shackleton returned to pick up the rest of the crew in August 1916.

Social Sharing For the Edmonton Oilers, the journey from worst to first in the Western Conference is complete — and a chance at the Stanley Cup is their reward. Connor McDavid had a goal and assist in the opening period to get Edmonton going, Stuart Skinner stopped 34 shots for his hometown team and the Oilers capped an improbable run to the Stanley Cup final by beating the Dallas Stars 2-1 on Sunday night in Edmonton. Zach Hyman also scored — like McDavid, on a first-period power play — and Evan Bouchard had two assists for the Oilers, who won the Western Conference in six games and will play for the Cup for the first time since 2006. They'll be heading to Florida for Game 1 of the final series that starts Saturday. Games are scheduled to start 8 p.m. ET. The Panthers are playing in the title series for the third time, after getting swept by Colorado in 1996 and losing to Vegas in five games last year. ZACH ATTACK 💥 <a href=\"https://t.co/dWLNCnBnJK\">pic.twitter.com/dWLNCnBnJK</a> &mdash; @EdmontonOilers \"When the horn went off, that's the loudest I ever heard it,\" McDavid told Sportsnet amid the on-ice postgame celebration as Edmonton fans repeatedly chanted, \"We want the Cup.\" \"Special place to play, honestly. So much history. And these fans, it was great to hear their support.\" The Stars, just like the Rangers , let a 2-1 lead in the conference finals get away. Dallas scored five goals in Game 3 to take the series lead; the Stars managed four goals, total, in the next three games. On Sunday, Mason Marchment scored midway through the third period and Jake Oettinger stopped eight shots for the Stars, who finished the regular season with the second-best record in the NHL: 113 points, just one behind the New York Rangers in the race for the Presidents' Trophy. Oettinger went to the bench with about 2:20 left in the game, but the Stars got only two shots the rest of the way — their desperate tries to tie the game and extend the series coming up short. Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn (14) has his shot deflected by Edmonton Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner (74) during the second period. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press) \"Proud of our group. Proud of our fight. Proud of our battle,\" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. \"We're just gutted. They did leave everything out there.\" Just by getting to the final, Edmonton has done something truly extraordinary — making the title series after finding itself 10 points out of a playoff spot during the regular season. Entering games on Nov. 24, the Oilers were 5-12-1,  which was 10 points back of Seattle and St. Louis for the final wild-card spot in the West and 19 points behind Vegas for the top spot in the conference. Those days are long forgotten now. That's when the Oilers — a couple weeks after Kris Knoblauch took over as coach for Jay Woodcroft, who was dismissed following a 3-9-1 start — went on an eight-game winning streak and began the long climb out of the NHL's basement. Oilers' Zach Hyman (18) celebrates a goal against the Stars in the first period Sunday. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press) Starting with that eight-game win streak, the Oilers, who had a 16-game winning streak not long after the eight-game run ended, were the best team in the NHL for the remainder of the regular season. They were 44-15-5 the rest of the way, leading the league in goals (239) and goal differential (plus-76) in that span. And now, the final awaits. Much like the Panthers on Saturday night, the Oilers didn't touch the conference championship trophy in the post-game celebration. It's the bigger trophy that they're seeking. \"We're not done here. This is just one step in the right direction for us,\" Edmonton's Mattias Ekholm said. Edmonton is just the third team in NHL history to make the final after being 10 points or more out of a playoff spot; the others were Toronto in 1958-59 and St. Louis in 2018-19. The Blues won the Cup that season. Oilers' fans arrive for Game 6 of the Western Conference finals Sunday. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press) The Oilers had only three shots in the first period of Game 6. They were enough. McDavid opened the scoring with a spectacular goal, weaving through traffic before beating Oettinger up high for a 1-0 lead. \"Connor McDavid, doing Connor McDavid things,\" Skinner said.

Afua Baah has the details about the blaze that has reduced a national historic site to rubble. By Nick Westoll Posted June 9, 2024 8:35 am. Last Updated June 9, 2024 10:42 pm. St. Anne’s Anglican Church, a national historic site in the Little Portugal neighbourhood of Toronto, has been destroyed after a four-alarm fire Sunday morning. Father Don Beyers, who has served as the parish priest for the past three years, told reporters it was just before 9 a.m. as he was getting ready to come to the church when he got a text message from a parishioner about smoke. He then got a flurry of calls and messages about the fire. “While this is incredibly devastating for my congregation, it’s devastating for this community,” Beyers said. “At this time, I ask for everyone’s support.” Emergency crews were called to the church, located on Gladstone Avenue near Dundas Street West, just before 8 a.m. Crews and nearby residents reported seeing heavy smoke at the property along with broken windows. In videos shared on social media, flames could be seen shooting out from the top of the church. CityNews received reports the smoke could be seen several blocks away. Toronto firefighters can be seen responding to a blaze at St. Anne’s Anglican Church. HANDOUT / B Diaz Toronto Fire Services deputy chief Jim Jessop said firefighters worked to stop the blaze from spreading. Adjoining properties were evacuated as a precaution and a safety zone was established around the building in case it collapsed. Firefighters set up water towers to deal with flames on the property’s exterior. “The fire was deep-seated at the beginning … but as you can see the building is completely destroyed right now and as [are] all the artifacts inside,” he told reporters, noting the roof caved in. Related: As Toronto’s Little Portugal faces changes, the ongoing push to protect the area’s heritage Jessop said that given the heat of the flames, the building’s age and the amount of water used to extinguish the fire, it’s “probable” there will be further collapses of the structure. Officials said there were no reports of any injuries. Beyers said the church was closed and locked at the time the fire broke out. Jessop said Toronto Fire Services investigators will remain at the site for the next several days while the Ontario Office of the Fire Marshal and Toronto police investigators are expected to conduct a joint probe into the blaze. There weren’t any immediate indications of what caused the fire. According to the church’s website , a Sunday service was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. The church, built in 1907 and 1908, was designated a national historic site in 1996 and in 1980 it was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act by the City of Toronto. “Built in the Byzantine style, St. Anne’s was designed by the noted Toronto architect Ford Howland to serve a large and vigorous parish,” the Ontario Heritage Trust noted . “Renowned for its role in the development of Anglican congregations in western Toronto and for its social mission in the Parkdale district, St. Anne’s remains active in community life.” Firefighters work to put out a blaze at St. Anne’s Anglican Church in Toronto’s west end on Sunday, June 9, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole Burston ‘Priceless’ artwork, cherished Toronto community space lost in fire Early paintings by three Group of Seven members and other prominent Canadian artists were installed along the interior in the 1920s. The murals decorated the chancel and the dome, which was destroyed in the blaze. In 1923, the church commissioned founding Group of Seven member J.E.H. MacDonald to oversee designs depicting the life of Christ on the building’s interior, according to the St. Anne’s website. MacDonald then signed on nine other artists, including Franklin Carmichael and Frederick Varley. The three men formed part of the school of landscape painters known as the Group of Seven, renowned for their vibrant depictions of windswept forests and boreal ruggedness that helped forge a romanticized sense of Canadian vitality and independence. “The artwork was priceless. It was murals, beautiful murals,” Beyers told reporters. “They were stunning.” “This was the only church that featured artwork by members of the Group of Seven and I’m sorry to say that has been lost based on what I see,” he said, adding there were also images of St. Anne and St. George. “It’s something we cannot replace in Canada and the world,” Davenport Coun. Alejandra Bravo noted. The now gutted space hosted choral performances, meals, musical theatre, film productions, weddings and other special events, as well as providing a place of worship and prayer. Bravo said the church was a valued community hub for many. “I don’t think it’s possible to describe the tremendous loss that you see behind us,” she said. “Davenport has lost something that can never be replaced. The grief that people are expressing to our office is tremendous. It’s something that we share. We are here to support the congregation, to support the work that is going to follow.” Beyers said he and the Anglican Diocese of Toronto are committed to rebuilding. “We will rise from this, we will come back stronger and we will have every intention to serve this great community,” he said. Marit Stiles, who represents the riding provincially and also leads the Ontario NDP, echoed his comments of hope. “This is going to be a tremendous loss for the community, but it’s not over, because we will rebuild.” Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow highlighted the perseverance of the church’s parishioners if not its physical form. “The spirit of the place, however – how they are so compassionate to everyone around them – will still be there,” she said.

Father Don Beyers, who has served as the parish priest for the past three years, told reporters it was just before 9 a.m. as he was getting ready to come to the church when he got a text message from a parishioner about smoke. He then got a flurry of calls and messages about the fire. “While this is incredibly devastating for my congregation, it’s devastating for this community,” Beyers said. “At this time, I ask for everyone’s support.” Emergency crews were called to the church, located on Gladstone Avenue near Dundas Street West, just before 8 a.m. Crews and nearby residents reported seeing heavy smoke at the property along with broken windows. In videos shared on social media, flames could be seen shooting out from the top of the church. CityNews received reports the smoke could be seen several blocks away. Toronto firefighters can be seen responding to a blaze at St. Anne’s Anglican Church. HANDOUT / B Diaz Toronto Fire Services deputy chief Jim Jessop said firefighters worked to stop the blaze from spreading. Adjoining properties were evacuated as a precaution and a safety zone was established around the building in case it collapsed. Firefighters set up water towers to deal with flames on the property’s exterior. “The fire was deep-seated at the beginning … but as you can see the building is completely destroyed right now and as [are] all the artifacts inside,” he told reporters, noting the roof caved in. Related: As Toronto’s Little Portugal faces changes, the ongoing push to protect the area’s heritage Jessop said that given the heat of the flames, the building’s age and the amount of water used to extinguish the fire, it’s “probable” there will be further collapses of the structure. Officials said there were no reports of any injuries. Beyers said the church was closed and locked at the time the fire broke out. Jessop said Toronto Fire Services investigators will remain at the site for the next several days while the Ontario Office of the Fire Marshal and Toronto police investigators are expected to conduct a joint probe into the blaze. There weren’t any immediate indications of what caused the fire. According to the church’s website , a Sunday service was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. The church, built in 1907 and 1908, was designated a national historic site in 1996 and in 1980 it was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act by the City of Toronto. “Built in the Byzantine style, St. Anne’s was designed by the noted Toronto architect Ford Howland to serve a large and vigorous parish,” the Ontario Heritage Trust noted . “Renowned for its role in the development of Anglican congregations in western Toronto and for its social mission in the Parkdale district, St. Anne’s remains active in community life.” Firefighters work to put out a blaze at St. Anne’s Anglican Church in Toronto’s west end on Sunday, June 9, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole Burston ‘Priceless’ artwork, cherished Toronto community space lost in fire Early paintings by three Group of Seven members and other prominent Canadian artists were installed along the interior in the 1920s. The murals decorated the chancel and the dome, which was destroyed in the blaze. In 1923, the church commissioned founding Group of Seven member J.E.H. MacDonald to oversee designs depicting the life of Christ on the building’s interior, according to the St. Anne’s website. MacDonald then signed on nine other artists, including Franklin Carmichael and Frederick Varley. The three men formed part of the school of landscape painters known as the Group of Seven, renowned for their vibrant depictions of windswept forests and boreal ruggedness that helped forge a romanticized sense of Canadian vitality and independence. “The artwork was priceless. It was murals, beautiful murals,” Beyers told reporters. “They were stunning.” “This was the only church that featured artwork by members of the Group of Seven and I’m sorry to say that has been lost based on what I see,” he said, adding there were also images of St. Anne and St. George. “It’s something we cannot replace in Canada and the world,” Davenport Coun. Alejandra Bravo noted. The now gutted space hosted choral performances, meals, musical theatre, film productions, weddings and other special events, as well as providing a place of worship and prayer. Bravo said the church was a valued community hub for many. “I don’t think it’s possible to describe the tremendous loss that you see behind us,” she said. “Davenport has lost something that can never be replaced. The grief that people are expressing to our office is tremendous. It’s something that we share. We are here to support the congregation, to support the work that is going to follow.” Beyers said he and the Anglican Diocese of Toronto are committed to rebuilding. “We will rise from this, we will come back stronger and we will have every intention to serve this great community,” he said. Marit Stiles, who represents the riding provincially and also leads the Ontario NDP, echoed his comments of hope. “This is going to be a tremendous loss for the community, but it’s not over, because we will rebuild.” Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow highlighted the perseverance of the church’s parishioners if not its physical form. “The spirit of the place, however – how they are so compassionate to everyone around them – will still be there,” she said.

The blaze began on Friday night and was described by officials as \"exhibiting extreme fire behaviour\". Wildfires have also led to evacuation alerts and orders in the neighbouring province of Alberta. The Canadian government has warned this year's weather conditions would mean a greater wildfire risk in the country. The Parker Lake fire, as it's been called by the British Columbia Wildfire Service (BCWS), was 8sq km (3 sq miles) in size as of Saturday morning after growing rapidly overnight. Some 3,000 people in Fort Nelson - located in northeast BC about 1,600km (1,000 miles) from Vancouver - were ordered to evacuate. Rob Fraser, mayor of the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality, told CBC News the fire began after high winds knocked a tree over and it crashed onto a power line and caught fire. \"And then by the time our firefighters were able to get down there, the wind had whipped this up into a fire that they weren't able to handle with the apparatus that we had,\" Mr Fraser said. Strong winds and dry conditions are making the fire more difficult to fight, according to the BCWS. As of Saturday, the fire was being fought by nine helicopters, as well as ground crews and a structure protection specialist, whose job it is to protect structures affected by wildfires. In Alberta, people in the Grande Prairie region are under evacuation alerts and some have been asked to leave due to a blaze burning 4km east of the hamlet of TeePee Creek in the province's northwest. Residents of Fort McMurray, a town of about 68,000 people, have also been told to be ready to leave as an out-of-control blaze burns some 25km southwest of the city. In parts of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, Environment Canada issued Saturday air quality alerts due to wildfire smoke. Last year was a devastating year for Canadian wildfires, with 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of forest burned - the most destructive season in the country's history. Eight firefighters died and some 230,000 people were displaced from their homes. 'Zombie Fires' burning at an alarming rate in Canada The indiscriminate devastation of Canada's wildfires Why is the world getting warmer? An update by Environment Canada this week predicted challenging weather conditions that could lead to another difficult wildfire season ahead. Higher temperatures in the spring and summer could \"exacerbate the risk and intensity of both natural and human-caused wildfires\", officials said. A warmer-than-normal winter that left little snow on the ground also compounded droughts in several regions. Globally, last year was the hottest on record. It was driven by human-caused warming, but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño. Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world, including in Canada. But climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body. Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation.

Some parliamentarians were accused this week of conspiring with foreign governments, but their exact numbers and their identities remain a mystery to the public — and to many of their colleagues. Stunning allegations triggered outrage and distrust on Parliament Hill — but what can be done? Brennan MacDonald · CBC News · Posted: Jun 08, 2024 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: June 8, 2024 Liberal member of Parliament David McGuinty, Chair of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, responds to questions from reporters before heading into a meeting of the Liberal Caucus in Ottawa, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Some parliamentarians were accused this week of conspiring with foreign governments, but their exact numbers and their identities remain a mystery to the public — and to many of their colleagues. The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) — a group of MPs and senators who hold top secret security clearances and are permanently bound to secrecy under the Security of Information Act — released a heavily redacted report on foreign political interference Monday. In it, NSICOP alleged that some MPs and senators are \"wittingly\" helping foreign governments like China and India meddle in Canadian politics. The allegation sparked outrage and expressions of distrust on Parliament Hill, and the Conservatives called on the Liberal government to reveal the identities of the parliamentarians under suspicion. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc has been refusing to do so, saying it would be inappropriate to release the names and citing his obligations under the Security of Information Act. NSICOP chair David McGuinty said the committee's \"hands are tied\" and it can't divulge the identities of the parliamentarians cited in the report. He said it's now up to the RCMP to decide what happens next. Analysis A foreign interference report lobbed bombshells at Parliament. Now what? Conservative leader calls on Liberal government to release names of MPs accused of helping foreign states The RCMP says it won't comment on whether there is an active criminal investigation into any parliamentarian. The police service did confirm there are active investigations into a broad range of foreign interference efforts in Canada, \"including matters which intersect with democratic institutions.\" What are the allegations? The report says the committee members have reviewed intelligence indicating that certain parliamentarians are or have been \"'semi-witting or witting' participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in Canadian politics.\" The report says those parliamentarians' alleged actions include: Communicating frequently with foreign missions before or during political campaigns to obtain support from community groups or businesses which the diplomatic missions promise to quietly mobilize in a candidate's favour. Accepting knowingly or through willful blindness funds or benefits from foreign missions or their proxies which have been layered or otherwise disguised to conceal their source. Providing foreign diplomatic officials with privileged information on the work or opinions of fellow parliamentarians, knowing that such information will be used by those officials to inappropriately pressure parliamentarians to change their positions. Responding to requests or direction from foreign officials to improperly influence parliamentary colleagues or parliamentary business to the advantage of a foreign state. Providing information learned in confidence from the government to a known intelligence officer of a foreign state. The report names China and India as two of the countries allegedly conspiring with Canadian parliamentarians. Is the alleged behaviour illegal? National security and intelligence expert Wesley Wark said he was nauseated by the alleged actions detailed in the report — actions he said \"absolutely\" rise to the level of treason in some instances. \"The treason offences in the Criminal Code, which have been around for a long time, involve for example the unlawful communication of information to a foreign state in peacetime,\" Wark told CBC's Power & Politics . \"You have a piece of the Criminal Code that is there, on the shelf, ready to be used.\" But while the NSICOP report itself says some of the activity detailed may be illegal, it also argues criminal charges are unlikely \"owing to Canada's failure to address the long-standing issue of protecting classified information and methods in judicial processes.\" Parliamentarians conspiring with foreign governments is 'treason': security expert 11 months ago Duration 8:36 Senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation Wesley Wark says the idea of parliamentarians conspiring with foreign governments is 'nausea-inducing' and would amount to 'treason.' In other words, Canada's security services struggle to turn intelligence into evidence. It's a \"huge issue,\" said Michelle Tessier, who served as deputy director of operations at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) from 2018 to 2023. \"Other countries are able to allow the protection of intelligence — to allow, for example, a judge to see that intelligence and be able to question it and make that decision based on classified intelligence,\" Tessier told Power & Politics . \"In Canada, in the criminal justice system, it's really full disclosure. \"The system is very cumbersome. There is a lot of intelligence that cannot be shared and frankly, in my opinion, its one of the most important things that should be looked at — the ability to use that information in the court of law while protecting national security interests.\" Should the accused parliamentarians be unmasked? The Conservatives are demanding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly reveal the names of the implicated parliamentarians. \"Criminal prosecution is not the only tool available to the government to counter foreign interference threats against Parliament,\" Michael Chong, Conservative foreign affairs critic, said this week on Power & Politics . \"Sunlight and transparency is another tool that our security agencies have long said the government should be using.\" The Liberal government maintains it would be inappropriate to reveal the names, citing the sensitive nature of the intelligence. Should names of MPs accused of working on behalf of foreign governments be released? 11 months ago Duration 15:48 A new national security report alleges some members of Parliament have conspired with foreign actors, but should their names be released? Parliamentary Secretary to the deputy prime minister Ryan Turnbull, Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong and NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson join Power & Politics to discuss. \"My colleague knows full well that no responsible government would disclose names involved in specific intelligence situations,\" LeBlanc said in response to Chong's demand in the House that the prime minister name the parliamentarians. \"It is not entirely accurate of him to claim that a responsible government, one that focuses on the security of Canada and our democratic institutions, would do such a thing.\" Wark said he thinks simply naming the parliamentarians is a bad idea. \"We have to be very careful about naming and shaming in the public square, which is something that probably authoritarian states who delight in foreign interference would be very pleased by — a way to kind of upend democracy,\" he said. \"The real route forward is prosecutions.\" Former CSIS director Richard Fadden said he thinks criminal prosecution is unlikely but he believes the House and the Senate should take it upon themselves to investigate the allegations further. \"There is a constitutional convention that says both houses of Parliament are the sole master of their procedures and the treatment of their members,\" said Fadden. \"I would refer it to the committee on ethics, to the board of internal economy, to the party leaderships, to somebody within the House to take a decision. Once that decision is taken — that there has been a serious violation of MPs oaths and of their responsibility to Canada — then I think we should come to the issue of whether or not ... their identity should be made public.\" Unnamed parliamentarians conspired with foreign governments, report alleges 11 months ago Duration 13:19 The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians alleged in a report published Monday that some unnamed parliamentarians conspired with foreign governments and consciously shared sensitive information with their agents. Power & Politics speaks to two former CSIS directors  —  Richard Fadden and Ward Elcock  —  about the stunning allegations. The government is offering to brief opposition party leaders who obtain the necessary security clearances on the classified intelligence. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party co-leader Elizabeth May have both said they will take the government up on this offer. Bloc Québécois Yves-François Blanchet said he is considering the offer. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has, to date, refused classified briefings on foreign interference, claiming it would restrict his ability to speak publicly on the issue.

The shooting prompted a lockdown of both the daycare facility and the Catholic all-boys elementary school, and parents rushed to the area to pick up their children. Detective Sgt. Al Bartlett said the man and woman who were killed worked together in what he described as financial transaction business. “It’s our belief at this point that the altercation that took place is in relation to that business,” Bartlett. “The person that we believe to be responsible is among the deceased,” he added. He withheld the identities of the victims and the shooter, saying officials first had to notify their families. Bartlett declined to comment on whether the suspect killed himself or died some other way, saying it was still under investigation. Bartlett said no child was injured. He said there was no access within the building between the daycare center and the business. Shahrokh Biniaz, a graphic designer and photographer who has a studio in the building where the shooting happened, said he heard a load bang and people arguing in the reception area.

        "text": "The firm of the late architect who designed the Ontario Science Centre says the province’s decision to immediately close its doors over a problem with the roof was “absurd” and motivated by politics rather than safety concerns. Brian Rudy, a partner with Moriyama Teshima Architects, said news of the science centre’s abrupt closure last week left them “dumbfounded.” “It’s absurd to think that the whole building needs to be immediately shut down,” Rudy told The Canadian Press. “It’s so obviously a political move.” Raymond Moriyama, who died last year, designed the science centre that opened in 1969 on a ravine near the west branch of the Don River in Toronto’s east end. At a hastily called news conference last Friday, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Infrastructure Ontario announced the science centre would close by 4 p.m. due to health and safety concerns over the roof. Story continues below advertisement 2:57 Government defends Ontario Science Centre shutdown The closure sparked outrage from local residents, science lovers and opposition politicians. Many have called on the government to reverse course. The province blamed failing roof panels made with a material called reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, a lightweight form of concrete that was popular in the 1960s and ’70s. The government said it acted fast after receiving an engineer’s report earlier in the week that laid out problems with the roof. The science centre’s board decided to close the institution. The report, written by the engineering firm Rimkus Consulting, did not recommend an immediate closure. Some roof panels are at risk of collapse and Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma said the engineers told government officials that the roof should be replaced in its entirety. That would take two to five years and cost upwards of $40 million. Story continues below advertisement Surma said it was a health-and-safety matter and that she was not “going to risk the safety of workers and children.” Get daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.

But Rudy said the roof panel problem should not have come as a surprise to the government. 1:41 Rally for Ontario Science Centre held as community voices displeasure with shutdown “It needn’t have been because it has been known for years,” Rudy said. “This has been an issue identified decades ago.” Several reports over the years painted a sad story of the science centre’s state of disrepair. Successive governments, from Progressive Conservatives to Liberals to New Democrats, deferred maintenance. Rudy said his firm analyzed the engineer’s report and he thinks there are a number of ways forward, and questioned the government’s actions. “It’s not as urgent as they would let on,” Rudy said. Story continues below advertisement “Most of the panels actually aren’t even above exhibition spaces. So the urgency to close exhibition spaces is unfounded. In fact, all of the permanent exhibit spaces are free of this type of roof panel entirely, so it’s not even a concern.” Rudy takes no issue with the thrust of the engineer’s report. “There’s no doubt that repairs need to be made and that’s no different than any building of this age,” he said. “Any building or museum of this size is going to have periodic maintenance at this age, so this is something that they know and that they do in phases, even if there are panels above public spaces. They’re easy to rope off and make secure from public while the repairs are done.” The firm wants the province to reverse its decision and has offered its services free of charge to help.

Playoff assists record McDavid broke Wayne Gretzky's playoff assists record of 31 and fell five points shy of the Great One's points mark of 47 in a single post-season. The six-foot-one 194-pound centre is the first player to have four different four-point games in a single Stanley Cup playoff run since the Oilers' glory days of the 1980s. Gretzky had six four-point games in the 1985 playoffs, while Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri had four apiece that same year. Mark Messier had four such games during the 1988 playoffs.

Gen. Jennie Carignan officially took over command of the Canadian Armed Forces in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Carignan is the first woman to lead the military of any Group of 20 or Group of Seven country. “That could create a model and a change in terms of what is possible for women,” Carignan said. “It’s a great step forward. It is a result of many, many years within the Canadian Forces.” Carignan was promoted to the rank of general during the change-of-command ceremony, after being chosen by Trudeau’s government to become Canada’s first female defense chief. Trudeau called it a historic day and praised Carignan as someone of the right caliber to take over. He named her to the role earlier this month. “You are the very first woman to ever become Chief of the Defense staff in Canada, the very first in the G7 and the G20. You are a role model for all Canadians and the world,” Trudeau said during the ceremony. In 2018, Trudeau appointed the first female head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and his Cabinet has been 50% female since he took office in 2015.

She was also the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. For the last three years, she has been the chief of professional conduct and culture, a job created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Carignan called the promotion a natural step and said that she is grateful. “I’m ready for this. I’ve worked all of this time,” she said. She said her top priorities include recruitment and retention. The appointment comes as Canada continues to face criticism from NATO allies for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. The Canadian government recently said that it would reach its NATO commitment by 2032, but specifics have yet to be provided.",

(David Richard/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing The federal government has named Lt.-Gen. Jennie Carignan as defence chief. As CBC News first reported last week , Carignan's appointment makes her the first woman to hold the Canadian Armed Forces' top job. She is currently the military's chief of professional conduct and culture, a position created following the sexual misconduct crisis. Several high-ranking leaders were forced to step down from their posts after they were accused of sexual misconduct in 2021. Lt.-Gen. Jennie Carignan chosen as next chief of the defence staff A military in crisis: Here are the senior leaders embroiled in sexual misconduct cases Woman testifies she froze, feared for her life during alleged sex assault by former head of military HR The resulting scandal prompted a damning external report by former Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour that made a series of recommendations to change the toxic culture within the Armed Forces. Carignan has been the face of the efforts to reform that culture, providing updates to the public about efforts to implement those recommendations. Carignan joined the military in 1986. She has commanded combat engineer regiments and led troops responding to floods in Quebec. In 2008, she became the first woman to lead a combat force in the Canadian military. She received the Meritorious Service Medal and the Governor General's Order of Military Merit, and her deployments included Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. She led a yearlong NATO mission in Iraq that ended in late 2020. Her official biography also notes that she has four children, including two who are members of the Armed Forces. Lieutenant-General Jennie Carignan arrives the the prime minister's office on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2024. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Montreal on Wednesday that naming the new defence chief was an \"extraordinarily important choice.\" \"Particularly in these moments of complicated geopolitics and increased threats, particularly to our Arctic,\" he said. \"Making sure that we have the right person to lead our Armed Forces in this pivotal time was something that I think Canadians appropriately felt that we needed to take seriously, which we did.\" Military struggling to recruit Carignan takes over a military in transition, amid the ongoing culture change efforts and the urgent task of trying to rebuild its ranks after years of declining recruitment and poor retention. The Armed Forces is short roughly 16,000 troops and for several years it has failed to recruit more members than it has lost to retirement or release, something that Defence Minister Bill Blair called a \"death spiral\" back in March. That has been a source of tension between the government and military leadership. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces face increased demands to respond to weather-related emergencies in Canada and boost the country's presence in eastern Europe as war rages in Ukraine. Military is being called on too often to deal with domestic emergencies, commander warns Canadian military needs dedicated climate disaster force, former army commander says In a recent interview, the outgoing defence chief said the military is \"starting to sense a turnaround\" in recruitment. Gen. Wayne Eyre said Canada's allies are facing similar challenges in recruitment and the problem is not fully understood. He cited the \"very tight labour market\" as one challenge, along with changing demographics. Eyre said there are also issues with Canadians' readiness to serve, with \"increased incidence of medical challenges, mental-health challenges.\" Gen.

Eyre was appointed in 2021 when Adm. Art McDonald stepped down weeks into his tenure as defence chief after being accused of sexual misconduct. Gen. Wayne Eyre named permanent chief of defence staff He said stabilizing the organization amid that scandal was the top priority. \"It's a work in progress, and so that's what I leave for my successor: unfinished work, but work that will never be finished because it continues to evolve,\" he said. Carignan is set to officially take over command of the Armed Forces in a ceremony on July 18. Lt.-Gen. Frances Allen, who was the first woman to be named vice-chief of the defence staff, also plans to retire this year and will be replaced in an early August change-of-command ceremony.

Justice Glenn Joyal ruled on Thursday that Jeremy Skibicki was guilty of first-degree murder in the killings of Rebecca Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman, who was named Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe (Buffalo Woman) by Indigenous leaders. Joyal rejected an argument from the defence that Skibicki’s mental health had prevented him from understanding his actions. Joyal said the “mercilessly graphic” nature of the case and Skibicki’s “purely expressed racist views” meant the killings had an “undeniable and profound impact” on the province of Manitoba, and laid bare the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada. The packed gallery in the Winnipeg courtroom erupted into cheers when the oral verdict was delivered. “I just felt super happy. I wanted to cry,” Jorden Myran, Marcedes’s sister, told reporters after the verdict was read. “We fought for this for so long. He got what he deserved.” On the eve of his trial, Skibicki admitted in May to killing the women. But his lawyers argued he should be found not criminally responsible for murders because he had schizophrenia at the time. Prosecutors argued that Skibicki’s murders were racially motivated and that he deliberately targeted vulnerable women in the city’s shelter system. The first-degree murder verdict means Skibicki will serve a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. The murders were first uncovered in 2022, when the remains of Rebecca Contois, a member of Crane River First Nation, were found in a dumpster near Skibicki’s home. Police later found more remains in a city landfill. During police interrogations, Skibicki admitted to killing Contois and the three other women, who were living in Winnipeg at the time. He cited white supremacist beliefs. Dr Sohom Das, a forensic psychiatrist from the United Kingdom, testified for the defence, suggesting Skibicki suffered schizophrenia and was motivated by delusions, including a belief he was on a mission from God. But justice Joyal rejected Das’s conclusion and questioned the psychiatrist’s credibility. Instead, he sided with Dr Gary Chaimowitz, the forensic psychiatrist who testified for the prosecution. In graphic testimony, Chaimowitz told the court he believed Skibicki made up the alleged delusions, and was probably motivated by homicidal necrophilia. Joyal told the court a full written decision, more than 150 pages long, would be released next week. The sentencing hearing for Skibicki will be held at a later date. For families of the victims , the case has also been a grim reminder of government inaction: the remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be buried in the Prairie Green landfill, and police initially said they lacked the resources to search the privately owned facility, much of which is buried under tonnes of clay. In March, Canada pledged tens of millions of dollars to search landfill for the remains of two Indigenous women, with work set to begin in the fall. Donna Bartlett, Marcedes Myran’s grandmother, told reporters outside the court she was “happy” that Skibicki would serve a prison sentence. “He got convicted of murder and I’m glad of that, I really am. Now the next step is to bring my girl home.” Explore more on these topics Canada Americas news Share Reuse this content",

        "text": "The firm of the late architect who designed the Ontario Science Centre says the province’s decision to immediately close its doors over a problem with the roof was “absurd” and motivated by politics rather than safety concerns. Brian Rudy, a partner with Moriyama Teshima Architects, said news of the science centre’s abrupt closure last week left them “dumbfounded.” “It’s absurd to think that the whole building needs to be immediately shut down,” Rudy told The Canadian Press. “It’s so obviously a political move.” Raymond Moriyama, who died last year, designed the science centre that opened in 1969 on a ravine near the west branch of the Don River in Toronto’s east end. At a hastily called news conference last Friday, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Infrastructure Ontario announced the science centre would close by 4 p.m. due to health and safety concerns over the roof. Story continues below advertisement 2:57 Government defends Ontario Science Centre shutdown The closure sparked outrage from local residents, science lovers and opposition politicians. Many have called on the government to reverse course. The province blamed failing roof panels made with a material called reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, a lightweight form of concrete that was popular in the 1960s and ’70s. The government said it acted fast after receiving an engineer’s report earlier in the week that laid out problems with the roof. The science centre’s board decided to close the institution. The report, written by the engineering firm Rimkus Consulting, did not recommend an immediate closure. Some roof panels are at risk of collapse and Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma said the engineers told government officials that the roof should be replaced in its entirety. That would take two to five years and cost upwards of $40 million. Story continues below advertisement Surma said it was a health-and-safety matter and that she was not “going to risk the safety of workers and children.” Get daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.

But Rudy said the roof panel problem should not have come as a surprise to the government. 1:41 Rally for Ontario Science Centre held as community voices displeasure with shutdown “It needn’t have been because it has been known for years,” Rudy said. “This has been an issue identified decades ago.” Several reports over the years painted a sad story of the science centre’s state of disrepair. Successive governments, from Progressive Conservatives to Liberals to New Democrats, deferred maintenance. Rudy said his firm analyzed the engineer’s report and he thinks there are a number of ways forward, and questioned the government’s actions. “It’s not as urgent as they would let on,” Rudy said. Story continues below advertisement “Most of the panels actually aren’t even above exhibition spaces. So the urgency to close exhibition spaces is unfounded. In fact, all of the permanent exhibit spaces are free of this type of roof panel entirely, so it’s not even a concern.” Rudy takes no issue with the thrust of the engineer’s report. “There’s no doubt that repairs need to be made and that’s no different than any building of this age,” he said. “Any building or museum of this size is going to have periodic maintenance at this age, so this is something that they know and that they do in phases, even if there are panels above public spaces. They’re easy to rope off and make secure from public while the repairs are done.” The firm wants the province to reverse its decision and has offered its services free of charge to help. Trending Now ANALYSIS: Pierre Poilievre would axe one of Parliament’s primary purposes Advance voting over last 4 days shatters records, Elections Canada says The province does not appear to be wavering. It is looking for an interim spot for the centre before a new one, half the size, opens at a redeveloped Ontario Place. 1:48 Ontario Science Centre: Community outraged over abrupt closure “The report proposes a single scope of work requiring both remediation and, in some areas, complete roof assembly and panel replacement,” said Ash Milton, a spokesperson for Surma. Story continues below advertisement “This work has a potential cost of at least $22-40 million and would require a closure of the facility for more than two years. It would still not be open for the summer.” Milton said the full cost to repair everything at the science centre “would be at least $478 million.” “Our government is delivering a new, world-class facility for the OSC at Ontario Place, including 15 per cent more exhibition space, with completion as early as 2028,” Milton said.

Supplied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals were hit with a stunning upset in a Monday night by-election, losing a midtown Toronto riding the party had held for three decades and raising even more questions about the minority government’s prospects in next year’s general election. The dramatic result in Toronto-St. Paul’s even surprised Conservatives , who for weeks have said they were not expecting to win the long-shot seat. Conservative candidate Don Stewart snatched the win from the Liberals with just 590 votes separating the two parties. Mr. Stewart, a marketing and finance professional, won with 42.1 per cent of the vote, with all of the polls reporting around 5 a.m. on Tuesday. Liberal Leslie Church was second with 40.5 per cent of the vote and NDP candidate Amrit Parhar won 10.9 per cent of the vote. Until last year, Toronto-St. Paul’s was represented by Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, who had held the seat since 1997 and in the last election won with a 24-percentage-point margin over the second-place Conservatives. The Conservatives managed to close that gap Monday and win with a 1.6-percentage-point margin. The NDP vote share also fell compared to 2021, when they won 16.8 per cent. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre congratulated Mr. Stewart in a social media post, calling the result a “shocking upset in Toronto-St. Paul’s, where people voted to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.” He said the result shows the Prime Minister needs to call a “carbon tax election now.” Open this photo in gallery: A Conservative supporter watches a split screen displaying voting results and the Stanley Cup final, at an federal by-election event for Toronto-St.Paul's candidate Don Stewart in Toronto on Monday, June 24, 2024. Chris Young/The Canadian Press The result stunned Liberals who went to sleep expecting a win and woke up to a loss that will be hard to overstate. Around 12:30 a.m., Ms. Church was welcomed into her party’s headquarters by Liberal Party President Sachit Mehra as the riding’s “next MP for Toronto-St. Paul’s.” Despite the fact that nearly half of the polls had not yet reported results, Ms. Church told supporters: “We are feeling great.” Conversely, just before midnight on Monday, Mr. Stewart thanked his supporters and told them “the night is still young.” In a brief scrum, Mr. Stewart told reporters his campaign’s performance showed “the country is waiting for change.” On Tuesday morning, Ms. Church released a statement conceding defeat but promising a rematch in next year’s federal election. “It is a beginning, not an end,” she said. Voters sent the Liberals a message that the party needs to “re-earn their trust,” she said. “We’ve got 16 months until the next election, and I plan to be the Liberal candidate in St. Paul’s. We start working to earn back the trust of voters in this riding today.” John Ibbitson: Regardless of leader, the Liberals are at risk of a worse fate after Toronto-St. Paul’s by-election The result in a single riding though spells much more trouble for the Liberals and will dramatically increase the pressure on Mr. Trudeau and his tenure as leader. For months now he has adamantly said he will stay and try for a fourth mandate in government. But if the Liberals can’t win Toronto-St. Paul’s, it’s unclear what seats could still be considered safe for them, say political watchers. Even during the party’s worst defeat in 2011, it still held on to that seat with an 8-percentage-point margin. It is a massive win, said Ginny Roth, a partner at Crestview Strategy and previously a senior adviser to Mr. Poilievre during his leadership campaign. “To me, that means the Liberals are under 15 seats in a general election,” she said. The party currently holds 155 seats and, in 2011, it held on to 34. For the Liberals, it is a “bolt of political lightning,” said Scott Reid, a Liberal strategist and principal at communications firm Feschuk.Reid. “There is no language too hyperbolic to describe the significance of this failure,” he said. “If you can lose in St. Paul’s, then the Liberal Party can lose anywhere, and that means it can lose everything.” Mr. Reid said the result is particularly stinging for the Prime Minister “because it tells him in indisputable, undeniable and implacable terms, that his leadership harms his own party.” “The message for Liberals – and for the Prime Minister in particular – is unmistakable: Change or leave. Because the status quo risks carrying the party to an historic humbling.” “The only political comparison that will now be moving through the minds of Liberals is 1993 for the Progressive Conservatives, and that is devastation at a near-extinction-level event.” In that election, the incumbent party was reduced to just two seats, from which it never recovered. As Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland ’s former chief of staff, Ms. Church has deep roots in the Liberal Party, but was relatively unknown in the riding. In the tough polling climate earlier this year, the Liberals delayed calling the vote as they searched for someone with better name recognition. Among those courted by the party was the area’s city councillor, Josh Matlow, who three sources said was heavily lobbied by top Liberals. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources because they were not permitted to disclose the internal party strategy. Despite the early nerves, Liberals had become much more confident in a win in the final week of the race; they poured immense resources into the riding, sending a steady stream of federal cabinet ministers, MPs and Parliament Hill staffers to help in the campaign. In a statement Tuesday, the Liberal Party sought to play down what it had expected from the results, despite its own president declaring victory just after midnight. “We knew this would be a tough race, with by-elections not often favouring the governing party,” said spokesperson Parker Lund. “We know that there’s lots of hard work ahead of us, and our Liberal team is ready to keep working to reach Canadians with our positive plan to deliver fairness for every generation.” Turnout in the by-election was higher than typical for such races with 44 per cent of voters casting a ballot. In the most recent Durham by-election, turnout was just 28 per cent.",

        "text": "Couple found dead after trying to cross Atlantic 21 July 2024 Share Save Tom McArthur BBC News Share Save sarahjustinepackwood.com Sarah Packwood and her husband Brett Clibbery were reported missing on 18 June The bodies of a couple who set off on a sailing trip across the Atlantic Ocean have been found on a washed-up life raft almost six weeks after they were last seen. Briton Sarah Packwood and her Canadian husband Brett Clibbery are thought to have abandoned their yacht and perished before washing up on Sable Island near Nova Scotia in Canada on 12 July. The couple were reported missing on 18 June after leaving Nova Scotia in their 13m (42ft) eco-friendly yacht, Theros, a week earlier. They were on the way to the Azores – 3,228 km away – with the trip planned to take 21 days. In a post on Facebook , Mr Clibbery's son James confirmed the pair had died, saying that the last few days had been “very hard”. He said the couple would be \"forever missed\", adding: \"There isn't anything that will fill the hole that has been left by their, so far unexplained passing.\" It is unclear how the couple’s dream transatlantic crossing ended in tragedy. An investigation is still under way, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told the BBC on Sunday. One theory investigators are exploring is that the yacht was struck by a passing cargo ship that did not notice the collision, according to Canadian news website Saltwire . “The sailboat crew were either unable to avoid collision” or they could have been down below with Theros on automatic pilot, an anonymous source told Saltwire. The Canadian coastguard and military aircraft have not spotted wreckage or any sign of the boat, Saltwire reports. YouTube/TherosAdventures Sarah Packwood Facebook/Theros Sailing Adventure Brett Clibbery In a video posted to their YouTube channel, Theros Adventures, the pair explained how their trip - dubbed the Green Odyssey - would rely on sails, solar panels, batteries and an electric engine repurposed from a car. “We’re doing everything we can to show that you can travel without burning fossil fuels,” Mr Clibbery said in the video, posted on 12 April. “It’s probably the biggest adventure of our lives so far,” Ms Packwood added. The pair met by chance in London in 2015, when Mr Clibbery, a retired engineer, was preparing to donate a kidney to his sister. They married in Canada on their yacht a year later, before affirming their vows in a traditional handfasting ceremony at Stonehenge in 2017, according to Ms Packwood’s personal blog. Their story was featured in a 2020 “How We Met” article in The Guardian . Ms Packwood, originally from Long Itchington, Warwickshire, had worked in Rwanda with the UN after the 1994 genocide and had extensive experience as a humanitarian. In what would be their final post on 11 June , the pair wrote on Facebook: “Captain Brett and First Mate Sarah set sail on the 2nd leg of The Green Odyssey on board Theros - GibSea 42 foot sailboat.

It was commuter chaos on Tuesday afternoon and evening as major public transit hubs and highways were closed due to flooding from excessive rain. All southbound lanes of the DVP remained closed at Bayview/Bloor due to flooding. Northbound DVP at Dundas Street East was also closed. At Union Station, security guards and TTC workers were preventing commuters from accessing the subway platform due to the flooding, advising them to walk to the nearest stations — St. Andrew or King — instead.

After 25 years as a transport driver, Jim McCauley thought he’d seen it all. Thunderstorms, snowstorms, bad drivers. You name it. But that all changed Tuesday after McCauley found himself stranded on the Don Valley Parkway for hours due to flooding from the Don River. His truck got stuck while heading northbound on the DVP from the Gardiner. He said police officers tried to get him to reverse, but he wasn’t taking any chances with a vehicle as big as his. “They wanted to get everybody off the highway, but with us being truck drivers, we can’t just do a U-turn on the Don Valley,” McCauley said. “There isn’t enough room, and if we’re loaded heavy, tires will pop off.” ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW McCauley said he got out of his vehicle and stood with other stranded drivers, watching as abandoned cars floated by in the water and collided. “The water, on some cars, was almost up to the roof,” he said. He estimated the levels rose about six inches above the tires on his truck. Eventually, McCauley was given the green light to return to his truck. But even then, he said he only managed to drive about 300 feet over within another two hours. “It was a little scary at times. My truck started spitting and sputtering when I was going through the deep, deep water.” When he pulled over later, he saw tree branches, twigs, grass, and plastic from the Don River lodged in the front of his truck.

As of 6:30 p.m., all of them had been brought back online and most people had their power restored. One station in west end Toronto, however, was still flooded. Crews were pumping water out of the station. There was no estimate for when service would be restored. “The focus is on getting the water out to determine the cause and make necessary repairs,” said Baccega Rosa. “In the meantime, we ask people to reduce strain on the electricity system,” she said, by turning down their A/C or turning off large appliances, like laundry machines. 3:55 p.m. Premier Doug Ford said he’s personally spoken to the CEO of Toronto Hydro and had put a call into the head of Hydro One. Flooded stations have been pumped out now “and I understand power is going back on,” Ford said from Halifax on Tuesday, where he is attending the annual meeting of Canada’s premiers. “We’ve put into flood management over $2 billion to help communities and we are pouring money into Toronto, too, for their old infrastructure, to support them,” he told reporters. Ford said even his own home in Etobicoke didn’t escape the heavy rainfall. “My house got flooded out — the basement is all flooded right now I was told,” said Ford. “It’s unfortunate when we have natural, little disasters — these are mini ones compared to what it could be. But we are pouring money into infrastructure — we’ll continue to upgrade all the pipes … We are making sure that we upgrade a lot of antiquated piping throughout the entire city.

Heavy rains hammered Toronto on Tuesday morning. Richard Lautens Toronto Star City of Toronto City manager Paul Johnson said he’d been receiving regular updates throughout the day, and Toronto’s office of emergency management was meeting early Tuesday afternoon to perform its latest assessment. He said projections of rainfall had increased significantly from when the city first started monitoring the storm Monday night. “We’ve got roads closed. We’ve got trains that are bypassing certain stations. We have a lot of calls for service. I think people just need to be very careful when they’re out there on the roads,” he said. Johnson said severe rain events were occurring more frequently and while the city has been taking steps to mitigate their impact, Toronto’s infrastructure “was not designed to handle this.” “Right now, we’re just trying to make sure everybody’s safe, respond to the calls and the emergencies that we have. And then we’ll deal with the aftermath, as soon as the rain stops,” he said. — Ben Spurr ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Why is it raining so much? If Tuesday’s rainfall reaches the upper range of what Environment has predicted — the forecast says up to 125 millimetres — it would put the downpour on par with the worst the city has ever seen. That record was notched on July 9, 2013, when gauges at Pearson International Airport recorded 126 millimetres in a single day, breaking a record that had stood since 1954 when Hurricane Hazel caused extensive and fatal flooding. The 2013 storm cost almost $1 billion in insured damages and remains Ontario’s most expensive weather disaster, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada; the city received more than 4,700 flooding complaints because of the storm. Just five years later, another significant rainfall event, in August 2018, resulted in a further $80 million in insured damages. Both storms, at times, registered rainfall that would classify them as “100 year storms” — ones so intense that they have a one per cent chance of occurring in any given year. Climate scientists have reported that global warming will increase rainfall extremes and intensify urban flooding, raising the chances of extreme events like this occurring. — Kate Allen A pedestrian struggles to navigate the floodwaters at Lake Shore Boulevard at Rees Street in downtown Toronto on Tuesday.

Residents of the towns of Labrador City and Wabush in Newfoundland and Labrador province were ordered to leave their homes, said provincial fire duty officer Jeff Motty. \"We are seeing extreme fire behaviour out there. The fire is moving about 50 meters per minute,\" Motty said. Images shared on social media showed lines of cars waiting to fill up at gas stations as the sky was obscured by enormous clouds of smoke. \"It was quite a shock to see that much smoke,\" Labrador City resident Stacy Hunt told public broadcaster CBC. \"And it's been in pretty much the same place for hours now.\" In this remote region residents must evacuate more than 500 kilometres (310 miles) east via the only road available. Motty said that the intensity of the fire made it impossible to use water bombers. On Saturday morning, Labrador City's mayor, Belinda Adams, again urged residents to evacuate. \"The fire is still active,\" she said in a video posted on social media. Federal authorities said Friday that the weather had been favourable for limiting fires since the start of summer, but that the country was entering the peak wildfire season. Last year, the country recorded the worst fire season in its history. Drier and hotter conditions in many parts of the country caused by climate change have increased the risk of major fires in recent years, according to experts. Canada is currently battling 575 active fires with more than 400 considered out of control. Many fires have broken out in recent days, particularly in the west of the country that has experienced a heat wave.

A wildfire of note is often considered to be of significant threat to public safety, communities and critical infrastructure. Sign up here. The evacuation orders have been issued across John D'Or, Fox Lake and Garden River communities in northern Albert, covering close to 62,000 hectares and comprising 5,000 inhabitants. No threat to oil sands production was mentioned. Alberta is in the grip of 158 wildfire events of which 55 are out of control, which means a fire is expected to continue growing and a perimeter has not yet been established. Not all out of control wildfires require evacuation of people. \"Fire activity is expected to remain intense throughout the weekend as the hot and dry weather continues,\" said the Alberta government's wildfire service in a statement. There are over 200 firefighters and support staff, 10 helicopters and 43 pieces of heavy equipment working on this complex, it said, adding the fire was caused by lightning. Meanwhile in neighboring British Columbia, where up to 319 active wildfires are burning, evacuation orders have been issued on Saturday due to an uncontrolled wildfire blazing between two lakes, BC Wildfire Service said on social media platform X. B.C. has had 58 new wildfire incidents in the last 24 hours with three 'wildfires of note' in the southern region - the Shetland Creek, Aylwin Creek and Komonko Creek. All three are on evacuation alert, the provincial government said. \"Fire activity is increasing today in southern B.C. due to the thunderstorms across the interior and into central parts of the province,\" it said, and added that close to a thousand BC Wildfire Service firefighters are on the ground.

Posted by Jasper National Park on Wednesday, July 24, 2024 An earlier post had said “10-20 mm of rain is forecasted to arrive in the next 24 hours, beginning later tonight. If the area receives rain it will help to reduce fire activity.” The south fire is nearly double the nearby Chetamon Mountain wildfire of 2022 which was estimated to be around 6,000 hectares in size. “This wildfire is significantly larger and more aggressive than the wildfires we’ve seen in the past few years,” said Katie Ellsworth, an incident commander with Parks Canada. “This one has much closer proximity to the community.” Ellsworth said the south wildfire moved four kilometres to the north overnight Tuesday, leaving it two-and-half kilometres from Valley of the Five Lakes, a popular hiking trail. A second fire, called the north wildfire, is significantly smaller at 270 hectares but is burning only five kilometres from the town. Critical infrastructure in the townsite is being protected with sprinkler systems and fire barriers are being set up with bulldozers. Crews are also going through neighbourhoods and removing potentially flammable materials including dried brush and propane tanks. Headline News Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

Article content “The priorities from this incident remain to keep people safe and keep the main wildfire away from the main town of Jasper,” said Ellsworth. “The town of Jasper has not been impinged by fire at this time. All of our efforts are focused on controlling further fire spread and protecting our community.” Late afternoon Wednesday, the Government of Alberta asked for assistance from the federal government in dealing with the province’s wildfire situation. “Supports requested include firefighting and wildfire mitigation resources to reduce the risk to homes, businesses, critical infrastructure and communities,” a news release from the province states. The wildfires in Jasper National Park are under Parks Canada jurisdiction. Alberta is providing personnel, helicopters, and air tankers. Evacuation alert issues The wildfires prompted an evacuation alert late Monday night that has led to an estimated 25,000 people, including residents and visitors, to flee the area.

Photo by Greg Southam / Postmedia The initial alert late Monday night stated a fire would reach the townsite in five hours, but was later corrected to clarify that residents had five hours to leave the area. Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said the town regrets the error and has since corrected the issue but couldn’t yet say what led to the mistake. “In the long run, it may have increased the level of anxiety, (but) it did not negatively impact the evacuation of the town.” He said a glitch around the emergency alert system that meant not everyone in the park got an emergency alert had also since been identified and fixed. “The evacuation plan that we have developed over a number of years, and … implemented yesterday, that was effective significantly because of the actions of the evacuees themselves.” ‘Rain doesn’t count until it’s on the ground’ Ellsworth said high wind is the norm in the area this time of year and was expected to continue much of Wednesday albeit amid temperatures cooling into the mid-20 C range. Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content “We expect today that we’re going to have strong winds continuing and we expect that this will increase our fire behaviour and fire growth.” Lightning is believed to be the cause of the fire, made easier by dry conditions in the days before the evacuation order where temperatures reached 37 C and humidity was as low as 11 per cent. “Our temperatures are higher than our relative humidity, this has resulted in a critical dryness,” she said. Rain is forecast for Wednesday evening into Thursday. “We are very grateful for that,” Ellsworth said. “We do anticipate that if we receive the precipitation, we will see a reduction in fire activity.” But, she cautioned, “the rain doesn’t count until it’s on the ground.” She said backcountry visitors continue to be taken from the park, some via helicopter, as more reach cellphone range and check in with Parks Canada which is cross-referencing with its visitor registration system. “We’re getting a sense and understanding of who is accessing what trails at what time period and who those individuals are,” she said.

Article content “Anyone who’s currently in an active reservation we’re checking up on.” Ellsworth added roughly 245 people had been rescued so far with an unspecified number still to be taken out. Infrastructure damaged Ellsworth said the fires have led to some infrastructure damage along the Icefields Parkway and Highway 16 although conditions have been too severe to allow closer inspections though it is hoped those will be completed by the end of Wednesday. “Once we are able to access the areas safely, either from the air or from the ground, we will provide further information on structure loss.” Infrastructure in the area also includes Parks Canada facilities, campgrounds, day-use areas, washrooms, and power lines. Parks Canada would not confirm any rumours or reports of specific structure damage, including to the ski resort at Marmot Basin , again citing the poor air quality and limited visibility. Ireland said a small group of locals from a variety of backgrounds were staying in the townsite to support those fighting the flames with food and shelter while others maintain essential services.

Article content He said some hotels have remained open to Parks Canada crews and staff. “It’s a small number and they are doing the work that needs to be done to support the first responders and others who remain in the community for essential work.” There is no timeline yet for when residents can return, either permanently or temporarily to get left behind belongings. “We do understand this is stressful,” Ellsworth said, adding a timeline will be provided when one is available. The two Jasper wildfires are among 176 active wildfires across the province as of mid-afternoon Wednesday, including 54 classified as out of control. mblack@postmedia.com Read More Thousands escape Jasper wildfire as officials worry situation could worsen 'Panic': Jasper evacuees U-turn from B.C. to find respite in Hinton Edson and Hinton return favour to help Jasper during wildfire evacuation Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add EdmontonJournal.com and EdmontonSun.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here .

(François Sauvé/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Torrential rains drenched southern Quebec on Friday, breaking the record for rainfall in Montreal. The rain came in the wake of tropical storm Debby and a low pressure system that had formed over the Great Lakes. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada figures, the city received 157 millimetres of rain on Friday, surpassing the previous all-time daily record for rainfall set back in November 1996. Montreal fire services said it received 614 calls for help over 18 hours between Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. It used a boat in three rescue operations to help people stuck in their cars on flooded roadways. Nearly 35 municipalities across Quebec were impacted by the rain, a total of 1,539 homes have been isolated, 344 people were evacuated from their homes and nearly 100 roads were affected, said Quebec Public Security Minister François Bonnardel on the social media platform X. Several landslides have also been reported in the Laurentians. Highway 40 is closed in both directions between Louiseville and Pointe-du-Lac near Trois-Rivières. The storm has also led to power outages across the province. As of 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, around 55,000 Hydro-Québec customers were without power, most of them in the Eastern Townships. At its peak, Hydro-Québec reported more than 550,000 clients without power. Hydro-Québec said around 300 workers were out in the field to solve the issue. In a statement, it said the vast majority of its customers would have their power restored by the end of Saturday evening. Spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty said a lot of the problems were due to the strong winds bringing down branches on lines and flooding in the Crown corporation's sub-stations. La Macaza, a municipality about 170 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the Laurentians region, declared a state of emergency on Friday. It has since opened a shelter for victims and an emergency co-ordination centre. On Saturday, the municipality of Chelsea, located in the province's Outaouais region, also announced it was in a state of emergency for 48 hours. Chelsea, Que., issues state of emergency after Friday flooding The Canadian Red Cross said its teams \"rushed to the scene immediately\" and helped relocate residents of a few long-term care facilities, retirement homes and campgrounds. The organization says it is still monitoring the situation. Recommendations to help Quebecers cope with the situation Several residents in the province have been trapped by floodwaters, according to Urgence Québec. The agency encourages people to check their municipality's social media pages and websites for crucial information about disaster relief. A boil water advisory is in effect for several areas including Boucherville, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, the Longueuil borough of Saint-Hubert and part of Vieux-Longueuil. Officials blame an electrical failure which led to technical issues and a drop in pressure. They recommend that residents boil their water for at least one minute before consumption until further notice.

Canadian women’s football coach Bev Priestman has removed herself from opening match duties at the Paris Olympics while an assistant coach and a team analyst were kicked out of the Games after a spying scandal engulfed the tournament. The sport’s governing body FIFA said on Wednesday that it had begun disciplinary proceedings after New Zealand’s women’s team said a training session this week had been disrupted by a drone flown by a Canadian team staff member. Canada and New Zealand will face each other in the opening match of Group A on Thursday. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) also said it had taken action to remove two staff members from the team’s Olympic squad , who were gold medallists at the Tokyo Games. “Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately,” COC said in a statement. “Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Mr Lombardi reports to, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately.” Lombardi, 43, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying the drone over the New Zealand training session on Monday in Saint-Etienne. In a statement, Priestman – the Canadian team’s head coach – said she had decided to “voluntarily withdraw” from the match against New Zealand on Thursday. “On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,” Priestman said. The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) reported the incident to the police and to the International Olympic Committee’s integrity unit. The NZOC said it and New Zealand Football “are committed to upholding the integrity and fairness of the Olympic Games”. “At this time the NZOC’s main priority is to support the New Zealand women’s football athletes and wider team as they start their campaign,” it added.

Publié le 13 sept. 2024 Lia Lévesque La Presse Canadienne Les dégâts ont ainsi coûté 2,5 milliards en dommages assurés. Et il ne s’agit que d’une estimation préliminaire, ajoute le BAC dans un communiqué. Les restes de l’ouragan Debby avaient frappé le sud du Québec les 9 et 10 août dernier, affectant des résidences, des entreprises et des véhicules. Le BAC souligne que « les pertes assurées liées aux phénomènes météorologiques violents au Canada dépassent désormais régulièrement les 2 milliards de dollars par an ». PHOTO JOSIE DESMARAIS, ARCHIVES LA PRESSE L’asphalte des voies en direction est sous le viaduc Salaberry, à Montréal, a été endommagé par les pluies diluviennes causées par Debby . Les assureurs ont reçu un nombre exceptionnel de réclamations et accusent en conséquence certains retards dans le traitement de celles-ci. Le Bureau demande aux différents ordres de gouvernement de faire leur part du travail pour limiter les pertes liées aux bouleversements climatiques et aux évènements climatiques extrêmes qui s’ensuivent. « Tous les [ordres] de gouvernement doivent également s’engager à empêcher une fois pour toutes de construire et de reconstruire dans les plaines inondables et les zones sujettes aux incendies de forêt, investir dans l’atténuation des catastrophes, notamment la mise à niveau des infrastructures de traitement des eaux pluviales, et mettre en œuvre des programmes pour des maisons à l’épreuve des incendies et des inondations. »",

        "text": "The Canadian women’s football team, who gold won at Tokyo 2020, have been stripped of six points by FIFA, while coach Bev Priestman is banned from all football for one year. FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each in a drone spying scandal . The stunning swath of punishments, announced late on Saturday, includes a 200,000-Swiss-franc ($226,000) fine for the Canadian football federation in a case that has spiralled at the Summer Games . Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game on Wednesday. Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national football federation and then removed from the Olympic tournament . She is now banned from all football by FIFA for one year. FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case. The judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behaviour and violation of the principles of fair play.” The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules. The coaches and the Canadian federation can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s (CAS) special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. The 38-year-old Priestman is from England and was hired in 2020 to coach Canada. She is under contract through the 2027 Women’s World Cup. Priestman had stepped aside from the defending champions’ Olympic opener against New Zealand on Wednesday after the scandal was revealed. Canadian officials suspect the spying has been systemic over the years. Her two staffers were sent home for allegedly using a drone to spy on New Zealand in training. Canada won the game 2-1 with interim coach Andy Spence in charge. The points deduction, if upheld by the CAS judges, does not eliminate Canada from the tournament. It could mean the team must win all three games in Group A and hope to advance with three points, likely as runner-up in the standings. Canada play group leaders France on Sunday in Saint-Etienne, then face Colombia on Thursday in Nice.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

The announcement came after encouragement by U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Cabinet ministers Sunday. By ROB GILLIES Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Monday it is launching a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles , matching U.S. tariffs imposed over what Western governments say are China’s subsidies that give its industry an unfair advantage. The announcement came after encouragement by U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Cabinet ministers Sunday. Sullivan is making his first visit to Beijing on Tuesday. Trudeau said Canada also will impose a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. “Actors like China have chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,” he said. One of the Chinese-made EVs imported into Canada is from Tesla, made at the company’s Shanghai factory, though the U.S. company could avoid the tariff by switching to supplying Canada from factories in the U.S. or Germany. Chinese brands are not yet a player in Canada. However, Chinese EV giant BYD established a Canadian corporate entity last spring and has indicated it intends to try and enter the Canadian market as early as next year. RELATED COVERAGE Rory McIlroy returns at Zurich Classic in New Orleans. LPGA holds year’s first major in Houston US and global economic outlook deteriorates in Trump trade war, IMF says World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab retires as chairman Chinese officials are likely to raise concerns about the American tariffs with Sullivan as Beijing continues to repair its economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. President Joe Biden in May slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment. “The U.S. does believe that a united front, a coordinated approach on these issues benefits all of us,” Sullivan told reporters on Sunday. Biden has said Chinese government subsidies for EVs and other consumer goods ensure that Chinese companies don’t have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade. Chinese firms can sell EVs for as little as $12,000 . China’s solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world’s demand. Chinese officials argue their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to the green economy. “We’re doing it in alignment, in parallel, with other economies around the world that recognize that this is a challenge that we are all facing,” Trudeau said of the new tariffs. “Unless we all want to get to a race to the bottom, we have to stand up.” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada also will launch a 30-day consultation about possible tariffs on Chinese batteries, battery parts, semiconductors, critical minerals, metals and solar panels. “China has an intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity and oversupply designed to cripple our own industry,” Freeland said. “We simply will not allow that to happen to our EV sector, which has shown such promise.” The Chinese Embassy said Ottawa disregarded Beijing’s repeated objections and said the move will damage trade and economic cooperation. “This move is typical trade protectionism and politically-motivated decision, which violates the World Trade Organization(WTO) rules and goes against Canada’s traditional image as a global champion for free trade and climate change mitigation,” the embassy said in an emailed statement. “China will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.” Canada “had to go with the U.S. position, when you think about the economic integration that we have with the U.S. More than 75% of our exports go to the U.S.,” said a former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques. Saint-Jacques said Canada can expect retaliation from China in other industries, adding that barley and pork are candidates because the Chinese can get it from other countries. “China will want to send a message,” he said. ___ This story has been corrected to say Tesla is one of the Chinese-made EVs imported into Canada, not the only one.",

Social Sharing Former Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who was found guilty last November of four counts of sexual assault after being accused of attacking five women in his downtown Toronto office, has been sentenced to 11 years in prison. With credit for time served, Nygard, 83, will serve just under seven years in prison. In his sentencing, Toronto Superior Court Justice Robert Goldstein described Nygard as a \"sexual predator\" and a \"Canadian success story gone very wrong\" who used his wealth and power to commit four sexual assaults. Outside the courthouse, Shannon Moroney, a therapist who worked with four of the five accusers, read a statement from one of the four victims, who said they finally have closure. \"We did this to ensure every victim of sexual assault will remember this trial and feel the strength and confidence to come forward and not be threatened by social status or money,\" Moroney quoted the woman as saying. Nygard sat in the courtroom wearing a black Canada Goose parka with a hood over his head. His bearded face was largely obscured by paper shields that court heard he wears around his glasses because of an eye condition that makes him sensitive to light. Before his sentencing, Goldstein asked Nygard if he had anything to say. \"No sir,\" he said, quietly. Crown attorneys who prosecuted Nygard had been seeking a 15-year sentence in a federal prison. Nygard's lawyer, Winnipeg-based Gerri Wiebe, said after the sentencing that her client would be appealing the conviction and sentence. FIFTH ESTATE How Peter Nygard kept allegations of sexual assault in the Bahamas secret for more than 2 decades FIFTH ESTATE Breaking their silence: 2 Canadian women say they were raped by Peter Nygard They had sought a sentence of six years, but that based on his age, declining health and credit for time already served, he would actually serve just under two years. Such a sentence would have allowed Nygard to serve his time in a provincial jail. WATCH | Nygard will appeal conviction and sentence, lawyer says: Peter Nygard will appeal after judge issues 11-year sentence, lawyer says 8 months ago Duration 2:53 Gerri Wiebe, Peter Nygard's defence lawyer, says her client will 'most certainly' be appealing after he was sentenced to 11 years in prison, minus time served, after a conviction last year on four counts of sexual assault. Crown attorney Neville Golwalla, who wouldn't comment on the length of the sentence imposed on Nygard, said that what jumped out was that Goldstein, in his first paragraph of his sentencing statement, referred to Nygard as a sexual predator. \"And that is the story, that was the finding of the jury,\" he said. \"The sentence that was passed today is reflecting that reality.\" WATCH | Crown speaks after Peter Nygard given 11-year sentence in Toronto: Crown speaks after Peter Nygard given 11-year sentence in Toronto 8 months ago Duration 0:52 Neville Golwalla, a Crown attorney in Toronto, said Monday that he's not surprised that Peter Nygard will try to appeal after being given an 11-year sentence in a sex assault case. 'We will cross that bridge when we get to it.' Graphic testimony During his six-week trial, court heard graphic and disturbing testimony from all five complainants, four of whom said they were in their 20s when they say they were assaulted. One complainant said she was 16 when she alleged the attack by Nygard occurred. The women testified that from a period of the late 1980s to around 2005, each ended up in Nygard's private bedroom suite in his downtown Toronto building, where they say he attacked, overpowered and sexually assaulted them. Law Society charges Jay Prober over public comments he made about Peter Nygard's alleged victims FIFTH ESTATE Peter Nygard won't be charged in Winnipeg cases involving 8 women, police say Nygard was acquitted of a fifth count of sexual assault as well as a charge of forcible confinement. Goldstein said that while he took Nygard's age and deteriorating health into account in his sentencing, there was a limit to those issues as mitigating factors. Goldstein said while Nygard's health had obviously deteriorated while he was in custody — his medical issues include suffering from Type 2 diabetes — he could not discount \"some exaggeration\" on Nygard's part. He said Nygard, to a significant degree, was the author of his own misfortune and committed these crimes when men felt they were immune from any consequence. Goldstein said if he were to punish Nygard less harshly because he is now elderly, it would validate that immunity. He said it would also send a message that if you're rich and powerful, and your victims are vulnerable, you can \"escape culpability if you hold off the day of judgment long enough.\" Nygard, wearing a black Canada Goose parka with a hood over his head, sits in a Toronto courtroom during his sentencing by Justice Robert Goldstein. (Alexandra Newbould/The Canadian Press) Goldstein said he also took into account aggravating factors, which included the violence involved in the attacks, as well as the deliberate degradation of the victims, and his manipulation of them. Another aggravating factor was the fact these assaults took place over years, meaning \"he didn't moderate or change his behaviour,\" Goldstein said. In custody since 2020 Goldstein said some of the letters submitted on Nygard's behalf provided limited mitigating value but were from business associates who benefitted financially from Nygard The judge said it was obvious Nygard had encouraged the letter writers to observe that they had never seen Nygard abuse a woman. Those were \"meaningless observations\", Goldstein said, as most sexual offences take place in private. As well, it's not a mitigating factor to point to the \"many women he did not rape,\" Goldstein said. LISTEN | Winnipeg woman who claims she was attacked by Nygard talks about the sentencing: As It Happens 6:01 Winnipegger at Peter Nygard sentencing: ‘He was such a coward. He wouldn't look at us’ When a Toronto judge sentenced Peter Nygard to 11 years in prison for sexual assault, he described the former Canadian fashion mogul as a “sexual predator.” Those words rang true for Serena Hickes, who alleges Nygard raped her more than 30 years ago in Winnipeg. Prosecutors declined to charge Nygard in that case, though he does still face several sexual assault charges in Manitoba and Quebec. Hickes was there to see him sentenced on Monday. She spoke to As It Happens host Nil Köksal about the experience. Nygard has been in custody since he was first arrested in Winnipeg in 2020 under the Extradition Act, after he was charged with nine counts in New York, including sex trafficking and racketeering charges. He still faces sexual assault charges in Manitoba and Quebec. None of the criminal charges against Nygard in Quebec, Manitoba or the U.S. have been tested in court, and he has denied all allegations against him.

Police have charged an Ontario man in connection with the heist. Social Sharing The \"Roaring Lion\" has been found. A 1941 portrait of British prime minister Sir Winston Churchill by famed Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh, which was reported stolen from the lobby of Ottawa's Fairmont Château Laurier hotel in August 2022, has been located in Italy, police sources have told CBC News. Ottawa police investigators, who tracked the photo down, say it is set to be returned to the hotel. A 43-year-old man from Powassan, Ont., was arrested April 25 and appeared in court in Ottawa the next day, charged with multiple offences, including theft, forgery and trafficking in stolen property. His name is under a publication ban. Ottawa Police Service's Acting Detective Sgt. Akiva Geller said he could not elaborate on why the publication ban was sought. He said details about the portrait's recovery have not been released until now due to the necessary diplomacy required in an international case. 1 year later, iconic Churchill photo stolen from Ottawa hotel still eludes police Crowd-sourced detective work narrows window for disappearance of Winston Churchill portrait The brazen heist, which made international headlines, occurred during a COVID-19-related lockdown in Ottawa some time between Christmas Day 2021 and Jan. 6, 2022, the hotel determined. No one was in the building during that period. The photo had been gifted to the hotel by Karsh himself and had been on public display at the Château for decades until it was removed from the wall and replaced by a fake, which then hung in its place, unnoticed, for eight months.

A complex, global investigation After learning of the theft, Ottawa police began a global hunt for the photo, ultimately tracking it down in Italy. Geller said it was the most complicated case he has ever dealt with. It was an \"extensive\" investigation, involving forensic analysis, tips from the public and support from international organizations, he said. There was particular help from the London Metropolitan Police, who, he said, were \"essentially [the Ottawa Police Service's] right hand.\" Two photos, submitted by guests of the Chateau Laurier. The photo on the left, with the group, is the original Karsh portrait. The one on the right is the fake. (Paul Hunter/CBC) Ottawa police told CBC News that they determined a buyer in Genoa, Italy, had purchased the photo from the London auction house Sotheby's.

Other audience members booed and festival CEO Cameron Bailey continued his introduction before security escorted the protesters out and the screening of the film, Stiller's first in seven years, proceeded. The brief protest provided a political jolt at the start of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), a 10-day extravaganza of Oscar bait movies and A-list glamour. This year marks a return to normal for the event, after twin strikes by actors and writers kept top talent from promoting their work here last year. Though the 2023 lineup of films was starry, the red carpets were not, in line with union protocols. This time around, Jennifer Lopez, Angelina Jolie, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Salma Hayek, Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman are just some of the boldfaced names expected in Canada's biggest city to unveil new projects. \"Toronto is known for its audience excitement, and that excitement reaches a fever pitch when the biggest stars in the world are here,\" Bailey told AFP. \"We're glad that we are having a festival without some of the constraints of last year, although I do think we were able to do the very best we could given the circumstances.\" Roy Thomson Hall is one of the main venues for the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) © VALERIE MACON / AFP Moviegoers warmly greeted Stiller, who introduced \"Nutcrackers\" alongside director David Gordon Green. The holiday-set comedy tells the story of a Chicago real estate developer who must care for his four orphaned nephews after the death of his sister and her husband. The boys, who are brothers in real life, prove to be quite a handful for the city slicker, who must navigate awkward home schooling sessions, wild animals in the house and other quirks of farm life as he finds his nephews a forever home. \"When I read the script, which was so heartfelt and not cynical... I was like, I'm identifying with this guy and this guy is on a journey where he gets in touch with stuff and connects with his family,\" Stiller said on the red carpet at the gala screening. \"I think that's an important message, especially right now.\" Stars and music galore Angelina Jolie, who debuted her Maria Callas biopic 'Maria' at the Venice film festival, will premiere her latest directorial effort, 'Without Blood,' in Toronto © Alberto PIZZOLI / AFP/File Also on the festival's packed schedule of world premieres is Ron Howard's super-secret \"Eden,\" a survival film set in the Galapagos islands, and \"The Wild Robot,\" the latest from DreamWorks Animation. Fresh off the Venice success of her portrayal of opera legend Maria Callas in \"Maria,\" Jolie comes to Toronto with her latest directorial effort -- \"Without Blood,\" a tale of early 20th-century family and revenge starring Hayek. In all, there are a whopping 278 films on the slate. John and Springsteen will be in town with new documentaries about their epic careers -- and they are just some of the recording industry royalty expected to hit the red carpet.

Lopez co-stars as the boy's mother. TIFF -- where screenings are open to ordinary moviegoers, not just media and industry insiders -- is part of a fall flurry of film festivals, along with Venice and Telluride, that preview some of the movies expected to vie for Oscars glory. The event runs from Thursday through September 15. On the final day, the People's Choice Award -- voted for by audiences -- is handed out.

Leftist NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh moved to distance himself from an increasingly unpopular Trudeau. “The deal is done,” Singh said on social media, bringing an abrupt halt to a pact that has kept the government running. Trudeau’s Liberals lack a majority of seats in Parliament and need the support of at least one other party to pass legislation and keep the government alive. Breaking the deal doesn’t mean Trudeau’s government automatically falls if a vote of non confidence is scheduled. Rather, the NDP will determine how to vote on Liberal legislation on a case-by-case basis, and will attempt to squeeze more measures out of them. The next election is at most a year away, and could happen earlier now depending on the NDP’s decisions on future votes. “I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics,” Trudeau said.

A statement from the festival Wednesday defended the film, Russians at War , a day after a large protest was held outside its debut screening calling for its removal. Ukrainian and Canadian officials and protesters have also raised concerns that the film, which they call “Russian propaganda,” was financed in part through Canadian public funding. “In our view, in no way should this film be considered Russian propaganda,” a statement from TIFF said. “While we understand the concerns expressed by many, we believe, like the Venice Film Festival and other international festivals who have programmed the film, that this Canadian documentary merits a place in our selection.” Story continues below advertisement The film’s Russian-Canadian director, Anastasia Trofimova, spent seven months embedded with a Russian army battalion in eastern Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow’s forces to make the film, which she says was done without the Russian government’s knowledge. She and her financial backers have said the film shows the soldiers losing faith in the fight and seeks to humanize the ordinary men caught up in Russia’s invasion. Ukrainian critics have argued the film attempts to whitewash Russia’s crimes in Ukraine and that Trofimova would not have been able to get such unfettered access to Russian troops without support from the Kremlin. 3:39 Ukraine strikes Moscow in biggest drone attack to date Festival organizers said Wednesday it’s their understanding that the documentary was made without the knowledge and participation of any Russian government agencies.

The board of directors said Tuesday it had “decided to respect the feedback we have received” and will be “reviewing the process by which this project was funded and our brand leveraged.” Nikolenko applauded TVO’s decision and urged TIFF to follow suit.

Story continues below advertisement A spokesperson for Canadian Heritage declined to say if it would investigate the funding, instead stressing the CMF’s independence. “The government does not make funding decisions for individual television or film projects,” spokesperson David Larose told Global News in an email Tuesday. In a statement Wednesday, the Documentary Organization of Canada said it was “profoundly alarmed” by TVO’s decision to pull its support and that it “raises serious concerns about political interference.” “This action by the Board of a public broadcaster to censor content poses a serious threat to independent media in Canada,” the statement sent to Global News said. “TVO’s decision risks setting a dangerous precedent and must be immediately reversed.” In a statement provided by TIFF on Monday, Trofimova said her documentary is “an anti-war film” and that she believes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is unjustified and illegal. She claimed she is at risk of criminal prosecution in Russia, making accusations of propaganda “ludicrous.” The director has said she did not witness any war crimes committed by the soldiers she was embedded with, and that it was important to show another side of the story of the war. “If we don’t see each other as people … this will only make the war continue,” Trofimova told reporters at the Venice Film Festival last week.

The skeletal remains of a senior officer of Sir John Franklin's 1845 Northwest Passage expedition have been identified by researchers from the University of Waterloo and Lakehead University using DNA and genealogical analyses. In April of 1848 James Fitzjames of HMS Erebus helped lead 105 survivors from their ice-trapped ships in an attempt to escape the Arctic. None would survive. Since the mid-19th century, remains of dozens of them have been found around King William Island, Nunavut. The identification was made possible by a DNA sample from a living descendant, which matched the DNA that was discovered at the archaeological site on King William Island where 451 bones from at least 13 Franklin sailors were found. “We worked with a good quality sample that allowed us to generate a Y-chromosome profile, and we were lucky enough to obtain a match,” said Stephen Fratpietro of Lakehead’s Paleo-DNA lab. Fitzjames is just the second of those 105 to be positively identified, joining John Gregory, engineer aboard HMS Erebus, whom the team identified in 2021. “The identification of Fitzjames’ remains provides new insights about the expedition's sad ending,” said Dr. Douglas Stenton, adjunct professor of anthropology at Waterloo. In the 1850s Inuit told searchers they had seen evidence that survivors had resorted to cannibalism, shocking some Europeans. Those accounts were fully corroborated in 1997 by the late Dr. Anne Keenleyside who found cut marks on nearly one-quarter of the human bones at NgLj-2, proving that the bodies of at least four of the men who died there had been subject to cannibalism. A 3D scan of James Fitzjames' mandible, showing impressions of cut marks consistent with cannibalism. Fitzjames’ mandible is one of the bones exhibiting multiple cut marks, demonstrating that after his death his body was subject to cannibalism. “This shows that he predeceased at least some of the other sailors who perished, and that neither rank nor status was the governing principle in the final desperate days of the expedition as they strove to save themselves,” said Stenton. 19th century Europeans believed that all cannibalism was morally reprehensible, but the researchers emphasize that we now understand much more about what is known as survival or starvation cannibalism and can empathize with those forced to resort to it. “It demonstrates the level of desperation that the Franklin sailors must have felt to do something they would have considered abhorrent,” said Dr. Robert Park, Waterloo anthropology professor. “Ever since the expedition disappeared into the Arctic 179 years ago there has been widespread interest in its ultimate fate, generating many speculative books and articles and, most recently, a popular television miniseries which turned it into a horror story with cannibalism as one of its themes. Meticulous archaeological research like this shows that the true story is just as interesting, and that there is still more to learn,” said Park. The remains of Fitzjames and the other sailors who perished with him now rest in a memorial cairn at the site with a commemorative plaque. Map showing where the skeletal remains of James Fitzjames were found. Descendants of members of the Franklin expedition are encouraged to contact Stenton. “We are extremely grateful to this family for sharing their history with us and for providing DNA samples, and welcome opportunities to work with other descendants of members of the Franklin expedition to see if their DNA can be used to identify other individuals.” “Identification of a Senior Officer from Sir John Franklin's Northwest Passage Expedition” by Stenton, Fratpietro and Park was published in the “Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.” The research was funded by the Government of Nunavut and the University of Waterloo.

Police said ”The Roaring Lion” was stolen from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa, sometime between Christmas Day 2021 and Jan. 6, 2022, and replaced with a forgery. The swap was only uncovered months later, in August, when a hotel worker noticed the frame wasn’t hung properly and looked different than the others. Genevieve Dumas, the hotel’s general manager, unveiled the portrait in a ceremony on Friday. “I can tell you that it is armed, locked, secured,” Dumas said. “It’s not moving,” she said, adding that staff accidentally triggered the alarm on Thursday, while they hung it up, “and I’m sure they heard it on Parliament Hill.” The most famous depiction of Churchill, known as “The Roaring Lion,” appears on the U.K.’s five-pound banknote and shows a glowering wartime prime minister staring into the camera. Renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh snapped the iconic portrait in 1941 in the Speaker’s office just after Churchill delivered a rousing wartime address to Canadian lawmakers.

Social Sharing UPDATE: For the latest on the deadly Old Montreal fire, click here. A major fire that broke out in a building in Old Montreal early Friday morning is being investigated by the Montreal police major crimes unit. Police confirmed Friday evening that at least two people had died in the fire. Radio-Canada sources say the victims were a mother and her seven-year-old daughter, who were French nationals. Police say the fire, which started around 2 a.m. in the building at the corner of Notre-Dame and Bonsecours streets, is suspicious in nature. Security camera footage obtained by Radio-Canada shows a person breaking into the building minutes before the fire broke out. The fire continued to smoulder into the afternoon, completely destroying the three-storey, 100-year-old building which housed a restaurant on the main floor and a hostel above. \"Some fatalities are unfortunately expected,\" said Montreal police Insp. David Shane, adding police could also not yet confirm the number of people inside the building at the time of the fire.

Flames quickly spread, triggering a five-alarm fire. At least two people are dead and one is in critical condition. The fire broke out on the main floor of the building and the flames quickly spread, triggering a five-alarm fire response. About 125 firefighters and 50 trucks worked to extinguish the flames. Police did not confirm its cause but said the force's major crimes unit is working closely with the arson squad on the case. The security camera footage shows a hooded person wearing all-black clothing and a mask approaching the building. The person can be seen kicking in the restaurant's side door and entering the building. Montreal police said they would not comment on the footage. They said the investigation was ongoing and encouraged people not to spread information that could interfere. Anyone with information about the fire should get in touch with police, Shane said. Firefighters were working to put out the large fire that destroyed the building on Notre-Dame Street Friday morning. (Submitted by the Association des Pompiers de Montréal) He said firefighters are working to secure the building so that searches can be conducted through the rubble \"in order to find any potential victims and evidence.\" Police have set up a victim support centre and are urging anyone who believes their loved one may have been in the building at the time of the fire to call 514-280-1294. Thomas Sawer, a tourist from Germany, was staying in the hostel for just one night when he was jolted awake by the sounds of the building's fire alarms. He said smoke was already circulating in the building as he made his way out. \"I thought, 'This can't be a drill, this has to be real so I went down, but I don't know if I felt safe, honestly,\" he told CBC News in an interview. The fire department has sent about 125 firefighters and 50 trucks to the scene. (Charles Contant/CBC) Sawer said his room was small, had no windows and barely any furniture. \"I felt like I'm in a shoebox, honestly.\" He said he feels lucky he made it out when he did, because once on the street, he describes seeing \"an explosion\" in the building, which is when the flames erupted. Cramped, no windows, say hostel reviewers Municipal tax records show the owner of the building is Émile-Haim Benamor, who also owned the building on Place D'Youville in Old Montreal where seven people died in a fire in March 2023 . Property records show that the building on Notre-Dame was constructed in 1923. Those records also show that in 2021, Benamor requested a $10,000 permit to build a \"20-room hotel\" there. The restaurant and hostel that were operating before the fire have different people listed as their owners. Photos of the hostel, Le 402, on booking websites show exposed brick walls, a shared lounge and rooms with a city view. Smoke blanketed much of downtown Montreal as a result of the fire. (Paula Dayan-Perez/CBC) Some comments, however, describe the accommodations as cramped and rundown. Multiple reviewers also report bedrooms without windows or windows that wouldn't open. Martin Guilbault, a division chief with the Montreal fire department, told reporters that fire inspectors had visited the building in the spring of 2023 and had found an absence of fire alarms and smoke detectors, but on a new visit in the spring of 2024, those issues had been fixed. \"The building was compliant, according to our information,\" he said. However, he specified that inspectors had visited the address of the restaurant inside the building, but did not say if the inspection also included the hostel upstairs.

Guilbault said the fire department had no information to suggest there were bedrooms without windows inside the building. CBC News reached out to Benamor's lawyer on Friday morning. He declined to comment. Approximately 40 people from an adjacent building were forced out and are being supported by the Red Cross. Montreal police said last year that the March 2023 fire at the building on Place D'Youville was intentionally set . Inspectors had flagged a number of fire safety violations at that building, including a lack of smoke detectors and problems with its fire escape. The building hosted Airbnbs, which were illegal in the area. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Matthew Lapierre Journalist Matthew Lapierre is a digital journalist at CBC Montreal.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Canadian figure skater Nikolaj Sorensen was suspended Wednesday for at least six years for sexual maltreatment, the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner announced. The suspension was listed on the office’s abuse-free sport registry and is subject to challenge or appeal. Skate Canada, the country’s governing body of figure skating, said in a statement it “has been made aware of the decision from Abuse-Free Sport in this matter and is taking the necessary action to comply with it.” “The ban will be issued by Skate Canada,” the statement reads. The ban is a result of an investigation into an allegation that Sorensen sexually assaulted an American figure skating coach and former skater in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2012. Sorensen has denied the allegation, which has not been tested in court. Sorensen and skating partner Laurence Fournier Beaudry were active last season despite the allegation and investigation. In January, the pair withdrew from the Canadian figure skating championships in Calgary. But in March they competed at the world championships in their home base of Montreal. The Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner opened in June 2022 to handle complaints and investigations for national-level athletes in sporting organizations that sign on to the program. Former sports minister Pascale St-Onge established it to be an independent body for abuse complaints following Hockey Canada’s scandal that year.

        "text": "Canada's Trudeau survives no-confidence vote in parliament 25 September 2024 Share Save Nadine Yousif BBC News, Toronto Share Save Reuters Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has survived a motion in parliament aimed at bringing down his government and triggering an election. Wednesday's no-confidence vote is the first in a series of similar votes expected to be put forward by the opposition Conservative Party amid Trudeau's plummeting approval ratings. The motion failed after opposition leader Pierre Poilievre fell short in his effort to shore up support from leaders of two other political parties in parliament, the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Bloc Québécois. Trudeau, who has been Canada’s prime minister for nine years, has been leading under a minority government. Voting was held on Wednesday afternoon, on the same day as Trudeau was set to host French President Emmanuel Macron. While this motion has failed, the Conservative party plans to bring at least two other similar no-confidence votes on Thursday in hopes of sending Canadians to the polls. Trudeau has been facing growing pressure to step down in recent months. His approval rating has plummeted from 63% when he was first elected to 28% in June of this year, according to one poll tracker, amid concerns about housing unaffordability and the rising costs of living. His Liberal party lost two consequential by-elections this summer in Toronto and Montreal. A deal between his party and the NDP has helped him stay in power since Canada’s last federal election in 2021. But the deal collapsed early in September after NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled out from the coalition, saying that the Liberals are “too weak” and “too selfish” to govern. Trudeau’s leadership has been under threat since, with Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stating that he would put forward a no-confidence vote. The vote would need the approval of the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass. The Liberal Party, which holds 153 seats, voted against it, while the Conservative Party, which holds 119 seats, voted in favour. The bulk of the other seats are held by the NDP and the Bloc Québécois - both of whose members voted to defeat the motion. In the end, the motion was defeated by 211 votes against it. Reuters Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has been leading in several national polls Pierre  Polievere, who has been leading in various national polls, had urged fellow MPs to vote in favour of the motion by outlining his vision for Canada under a Conservative government. His plan, he said on Tuesday in parliament, is “to bring home the promise of Canada, of a powerful paycheque that earns affordable food, gas and homes and safe neighbourhoods”. But Singh, the NDP leader, said he would vote against Poilievre’s motion because he believes the Conservative Party will cut social programmes like dental care and pharmacare if it comes to power. The Bloc Québécois - a party whose aim is to represent the interests of Quebec, Canada’s French-speaking province - has said it believes it could work with the Liberal government to secure assurances for Quebec-focused social programmes. Trudeau was at the UN General Assembly earlier this week in New York City, where on  Monday he appeared as a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In his interview with Colbert, Trudeau acknowledged that Canadians were going through “a really tough time” and struggling to afford gas, groceries and rent. But he defended his leadership, saying that his government had invested in Canadians and would continue to do so. “I’m going to keep fighting,” he said.

The motion, brought by the opposition Conservatives, was aimed at bringing down his minority Liberal government and triggering a federal election. The motion failed after Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre again fell short in his effort to gain the backing of other political parties in parliament. Poilievre tabled this second non-confidence motion the day after his last one failed. This motion accused the government of failing Canadians on affordable housing, the cost of living, and crime - key issues that the Conservatives have been using to hammer the Liberals for months. The vote needed the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass. After all the votes were counted, 121 voted for the motion while 207 voted against it. In a statement following the vote, Poilievre blamed the NDP and the Bloc Québécois for its failure, saying the former had \"sold out working Canadians\" while the latter is \"letting down Quebecers\". The Bloc Québécois, which represents the interests of Quebec, Canada’s French-speaking province, had issued an ultimatum to the Liberals for its continued support. The sovereigntist party gave the government a 29 October deadline to pass two bills, one increasing pensions for seniors and one to bolster protections on Canada's supply management system, which controls production quotas and imports on dairy and poultry products. On Tuesday, it tabled its own motion calling on the Trudeau government to support their seniors' bill. Meanwhile, the NDP leader Jagmeet Singh indicated last week that his party would not support the Conservative motion. Several other non-confidence motions are expected to be tabled in the coming weeks, including a third that has been put forward by the Conservatives. Trudeau has been Canada’s prime minister for nine years and has been facing growing pressure to resign over concerns he is a drag on his party's fortunes.

New Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but Ottawa said it had served them notices of expulsion. \"Subsequent to those notices, India announced it would withdraw its officials,\" a statement from the Canadian foreign ministry said. The 2023 murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar crashed the country's diplomatic relations with India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence services to the crime. The expulsion of the diplomats – including the most senior envoys on both sides – is a major escalation in the row. India \"decided to expel\" Ottawa's acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler, his deputy and four first secretaries, ordering they leave before midnight on Sunday. Ottawa announced similar measures in return, with Canadian police saying they had \"evidence pertaining to agents of the government of India's involvement in serious criminal activity\" in Canada. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that India had refused to cooperate in the investigation, or to lift diplomatic immunity for its envoys. \"The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case,\" she said in a statement, referring to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Read more Sikh leader's murder in Canada shines spotlight on shadowy Indian spy agency Nijjar – who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 – had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder, which took place in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023. New Delhi had earlier said it had \"received a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are persons of interest\" in the ongoing investigation. It said their envoy, Sanjay Kumar Verma, a former ambassador to Japan and Sudan, was a respected career diplomat and that the accusations were \"ludicrous\". New Delhi's foreign ministry said it had told Verma to return home and that it had \"no faith\" in the Canadian government's commitment to ensuring the six expelled diplomats' security. 'Murder' India on Monday called allegations it was connected to the killing \"preposterous\" and a \"strategy of smearing India for political gains\". Last year, the Indian government briefly curbed visas for Canadians and forced Ottawa to withdraw diplomats, and on Monday threatened further action. \"India reserves the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau Government's support for extremism, violence and separatism against India,\" the foreign ministry said. The foreign ministry also summoned Canadian envoy Wheeler, who said that Ottawa had given India the evidence it had demanded. \"Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil,\" Wheeler told reporters after leaving the ministry. \"Now, it is time for India to live up to what it said it would do and look into all those allegations. It is in the interest of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this. Canada stands ready to cooperate with India.\" India then announced his expulsion. Canada is home to around 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan. In November 2023, the US Justice Department also charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on US soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning of that attempt. The row comes as Trudeau is under political pressure at home, after surviving a second no-confidence vote earlier this month.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government responded after police began pursuing credible allegations that Indian agents were directly involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Canadian police accused Indian agents of involvement in \"homicides, extortion and violent acts\" and targeting supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement, which seeks a separate homeland for Sikhs in India. India has rejected the allegations as \"preposterous\", accusing Trudeau of pandering to Canada’s large Sikh community for political gain. Read more: Canada withdraws 41 diplomats from India Trudeau says Canada-India ties important despite row How India-Canada ties descended into a public feud Speaking on live television on Monday afternoon, Trudeau said India had made a \"fundamental error\" in supporting \"criminal\" acts in Canada and his government had to act on the latest findings. \"The evidence brought to light by the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada's national police service] cannot be ignored,\" the prime minister said. \"It leads to one conclusion, it is necessary to disrupt the criminal activities that continue to pose a threat to public safety in Canada. That is why we acted.\" India has vehemently denied all allegations and maintained that Canada has provided no evidence to support its claims. Relations between Delhi and Ottawa have been strained since Trudeau said Canada had credible evidence linking Indian agents to Nijjar's murder. The row led to a deterioration in ties , with India asking Canada to withdraw dozens of its diplomatic staff and suspending visa services . On Monday, a furious statement from India's foreign ministry said Canada's allegations were influenced by Sikh separatist campaigners. Later in the day, it announced six Canadian diplomats, including acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler, had been asked to leave India by 19 October. Mr Wheeler was also summoned by India's external affairs ministry to explain Canada's move. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Wheeler said Canada had given India the evidence it had demanded, it now needed to investigate the allegations. \"It is in the interests of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this,\" he said. Delhi has defended its High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, referring to his \"distinguished career spanning 36 years\". \"The aspersions cast on him by the government of Canada are ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt,\" it said. The Indian foreign ministry also said it was \"withdrawing\" its top envoy and other diplomats. \"We have no faith in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.\" Earlier on Monday, Canadian police said they had taken the unusual step of publicly disclosing information about ongoing investigation \"due to significant threat to public safety in our country\". RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme told reporters at a news conference on Monday that there had been \"over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life\" which he said \"specifically\" focussed on members of the pro-Khalistan movement. He added that the threats were sufficiently serious to warrant the RCMP's public intervention. \"We reached a point where we felt it was imperative to confront the government of India.\" Officials said a dozen Indian agents were involved in the alleged criminal activities, but did not confirm if they were directly linked to the June 2023 murder of Sikh separatist leader Nijjar . Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot and killed by two masked gunmen outside a Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia . He had been a vocal supporter of the Khalistan movement, which demands a separate Sikh homeland, and publicly campaigned for it. India has in the past described him as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters called unfounded. Canadian police called his killing a \"targeted attack\". In September 2023, Trudeau had told Canada's parliament that allegations of Indian involvement in the killing were based on Canadian intelligence. He called the act a violation of Canada's sovereignty. Frosty ties between the two countries seemed to have thawed slightly after India resumed processing visas in October 2023. But last week, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly called the country's relations with India \"tense\" and \"very difficult\". She also said there remained a threat of more killings like Nijjar's on Canadian soil.

        "text": "Canadian child dies from rabies after bat found in bedroom 4 October 2024 Share Save Nadine Yousif BBC News, Toronto Share Save Getty Images Nearly all domestically-acquired cases of rabies are from bats, according to Canadian health officials A child in the Canadian province of Ontario has died from rabies after being exposed to a bat in their bedroom, Canadian health officials have said. The death was made public by Dr Malcolm Lock of the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit, who told councillors at a board meeting on Wednesday that the unnamed child was exposed to the virus in an area north of Sudbury. “They woke up with a bat in their bedroom,” Dr Lock said, adding that the parents did not see signs of a bite or scratches and did not get the child a rabies vaccine as a result. It marks the first domestically-acquired case of human rabies in Ontario since 1967. The child, whose age was not shared by officials, was taken to hospital after the incident in early September and later died. Rabies is a rare but deadly viral disease that can be spread to humans from an infected animal - such as bats, coyotes, foxes or raccoons - most commonly through its saliva. The disease, which can cause severe damage to the brain and the spinal cord, nearly always causes death once symptoms have appeared, according to the World Health Organization. Dr Lock said the percentage of bats with rabies in the southern Ontario region he oversees has increased from less than 10% to 16% in recent years. “It's extremely important that anyone who has a form of exposure [to bats] seeks medical attention,” he said, adding that treatment and vaccination should be quickly sought, even if bite marks aren’t immediately visible. According to Health Canada, the Canadian government's health department, cases of rabies among humans in the country are rare. Since reporting began in 1924, there have been 28 cases of rabies across six provinces, all of which were fatal. The health agency said that nearly all human cases of rabies in Canada are a result of exposure to bats, or due to exposure to rabies while in another country. In the US, fewer than 10 people die from rabies each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is a “dramatic decline” from the 1960s, the healthy agency said, driven largely by prevention efforts. There were 25 cases of human rabies documented in the US from 2009 to 2018, the CDC said, seven of which were contracted outside of the country. Like Canada, humans in the US are more commonly exposed to rabies through rabid bats, which are found in all US states except Hawaii. In the UK, all rabies since 1902 were a result of an infection that occurred abroad, according to data by the British government. There have been 26 cases reported since 1946, all involving people who got infected outside of the UK. In 2002, a licensed bat handler in Scotland died from an infection with a rabies-like virus that is present in a small number of indigenous bats - though a subsequent study found they pose little threat to people. The latest documented case was in 2018 involving a traveller who was bitten by a cat in Morocco. Briton dies from rabies after cat bite Rabies jabs for girl, 8, bitten by bat Rabies Bats Canada",

Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022. They entered their pleas in British Columbia Supreme Court on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder. In a shocking development, a ferocious fist fight then broke out between Fox and Lopez in the courtroom in New Westminster. According to the Vancouver Sun, they \"punched and clawed at each other\" for a couple of minutes before sheriffs broke up the brawl, forcing them to the ground, applying handcuffs and leading them away. Other sheriffs cleared the public gallery. The case is due to return to court on 31 October for a sentencing hearing. The second-degree murder pleas mean they will automatically receive life sentences  with the only question being how long they have to serve before they can apply for parole, Canadian public broadcaster CBC reports. Malik was shot several times in his car outside his family business in Surrey, British Columbia, on the morning of 14 July 2022. Police found a burnt-out vehicle nearby. The businessman had been acquitted in 2005 of a devastating double bomb attack: On 23 June 1985, Air India flight 182 from Canada to India blew up off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens visiting relatives in India About the same time, a second bomb exploded prematurely in Japan, killing two baggage handlers The bombings - widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion - remain Canada's deadliest terror attack. Following a two-year trial, Malik and his co-accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings. According to the agreed statement of facts on Monday, Fox and Lopez were contracted to kill Malik but the evidence did not establish who had hired them. Police recovered two handguns used in the attack in residences linked to the two men as well as the sum of C$16,485 (US $11,943; £9,148) in cash in Lopez's New Westminster apartment, the Vancouver Sun reports. Malik’s family issued a statement urging them to co-operate with police to bring to justice whoever had directed the killing. “Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete,” the family said. When contacted by the BBC, Fox's lawyer declined to comment on the case. Lawyers for Lopez said he had a \"long road ahead of him\", adding: \"We are hopeful for his prospects of rehabilitation given his youth and his remorse, as shown by his decision to accept responsibility today.\" Air India 1985 bombing back in news after Canada row India Canada",

(Patrick Morrell/CBC) Social Sharing New Brunswickers have voted for change — and helped make some history too. Susan Holt led her Liberal team to a solid majority government Monday, bringing an end to six years of Progressive Conservative rule. Even Premier Blaine Higgs lost his seat in the red tide of change. The final tally is 31 seats for the Liberals, 16 for the Progressive Conservatives and two for the Greens, including Green Party Leader David Coon. Holt is the first woman to win the premier's job in New Brunswick history. \"We're going to watch the bottom line and deliver fiscal responsibility while we invest in the services that you need, like health care and education and an affordable place to call home,\" the premier-designate said after her victory.

When the results started to roll in within minutes of the polls closing, what was looking like a close race, according to opinion polls, soon became an obvious Liberal win. By 9:15 p.m., Higgs took to the podium at his headquarters in Quispamsis to concede defeat. He said it was \"not the night we hoped for.\" Blaine Higgs thanks his supporters at his Quispamsis headquarters on Monday night as he concedes defeat to Premier-designate Susan Holt. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC) Higgs said he had already called Holt to congratulate her and \"wish her every success.\" His message to successful PC candidates was to keep the party together while they rebuild. He said there were \"so many things left undone on our path to fix the province.\" Higgs later said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that he would stay on as party leader. New Brunswick election results in detail Among the PC losses were five cabinet ministers — Jill Green in Fredericton North, Greg Turner in Moncton South, Ted Flemming in Rothesay, Ernie Steeves in Moncton Northwest, and Réjean Savoie in Miramichi Bay-Neguac. Greens lose a seat In Coon's election-night speech in Fredericton, he acknowledged the loss of Kevin Arseneau to Liberal Pat Finnigan. He vowed to continue to build the party. \"And one thing's for sure. We know that Blaine Higgs is no longer the premier of this province,\" said Coon to great applause from the crowd. In her speech, Holt said her party will focus on education, health care and affordable housing. \"We are going to lead with balance,\" she said.

Holt, 47, a mother of three young girls, said she had a message for the public and the news media. \"My mama bear's going to come out,\" she said. \"Please treat my children with care because they are sacrificing for New Brunswick,\" she said. Given the sagging popularity of the federal Liberal leader, Holt seemed to try to distance herself from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the campaign. Trudeau sent her congratulations on Monday night. \"We've got work ahead to build more homes, protect our official languages, and improve healthcare for New Brunswickers. I'm looking forward to working with you and your Liberal team to make it happen,\" he wrote on social media. Big gains in big cities The Liberals made huge gains in the three big cities of southern New Brunswick. The largest gain was in Saint John, where votes increased by 27 per cent for the Liberals, followed by Fredericton, which saw an increase of 23 per cent. Moncton saw votes increase by 16 per cent. From blue to red, Liberals won nearly all Saint John-area ridings. Liberal candidate and former city councillor David Hickey won Saint John Harbour, while Dr. John Dornan, who won a wrongful dismissal case against the Higgs government, won Saint John Portland-Simonds. Kate Elman Wilcott took Saint John West-Lancaster, while federal PC-turned-Liberal John Herron won  against controversial candidate Faytene Grasseschi in Hampton-Fundy-St. Martins. Higgs-government cabinet minister Glen Savoie was the only PC in the region to hold onto his seat in Saint John East.

This election also saw a record number of female MLAs elected — 17 women won seats, compared to 14 in 2020, 11 in 2018, and only eight in 2014. The final vote tally was 376,026 a turnout of about 66 per cent. In 2020, by comparison, 378,169 people voted in total, about 66 per cent of registered voters. In 2020, the PCs won 27 seats, the Liberals 17, the Greens three and the People's Alliance two. Neither the People's Alliance nor the NDP got any seats this time around and both lost percentage points of the popular vote. The People's Alliance dropped from 9.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent. While still down from 2020, the NDP jumped ahead of the People's Alliance this time around with 1.3 per cent. In 2020, the NDP received 1.7 per cent of the popular vote. The Liberals received 48 per cent, the PCs 35 per cent, the Greens 14 per cent. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Mia Urquhart Mia Urquhart is a journalist with CBC New Brunswick, based in Saint John.

Conservatives Leader John Rustad, left, and B.C. NDP Leader David Eby. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing A tight race for political power in British Columbia still had no clear winner early Sunday after the vast majority of votes in the provincial election had been counted, with a weakened incumbent party barely holding off its top challenger late into the night. With a little more than 96 per cent of votes counted, the B.C. NDP and B.C. Conservatives were left locked in a near dead heat . The NDP were either elected or leading in 46 ridings, while the Conservatives had won or were leading in 45 — each just a seat or two shy of the 47 needed to win a majority government. The razor-thin result means the race will come down to the final polls, out-of-district votes and mail in ballots. The latter aren't expected to be fully counted until Oct. 26. See a riding-by-riding breakdown of the results here The delay in announcing the results came after an unusually antagonistic election campaign characterized by the growing popularity of the right-of-centre Conservatives, which had tried to convince a broad base of disillusioned voters to reject the status quo after seven years of NDP rule. Regardless of which party ultimately forms government, the close race will be considered a disappointing result for the once-dominant NDP and a once-unthinkable accomplishment for the up-and-coming Conservatives. \"This has been a very, very hard fought campaign and we knew that every vote would matter and that has certainly been the case,\" NDP Leader David Eby told supporters just before 11:30 p.m. PT. \"And it looks like we're going to have to wait just a little bit longer.\" WATCH | Eby asks supporters for patience after tight race: B.C. NDP Leader David Eby addresses supporters after party loses several seats 6 months ago Duration 8:11 Eby gave a speech for supporters after what was a disappointing night for his party. Addressing his own crowd minutes earlier, Conservatives Leader John Rustad said the election was a \"historic night.\" \"This has been a night where we have seen the political landscape in British Columbia change forever ... we have not given up this fight yet. We are going to keep pushing hard.\" A number of ridings are still too close to call with less than a few hundred votes between candidates. Both Eby and Rustad held onto their ridings: Rustad was re-elected in Nechako Lakes, which he has held since 2005, and Eby won a fourth term in Vancouver–Point Grey. WATCH | Rustad celebrates Conservative gains on close election night: John Rustad hails 'historic night' for B.C. Conservatives 6 months ago Duration 10:21 The winner of the B.C. election remained unclear late Saturday, but B.C. Conservatives Leader John Rustad said it was a great night for his party. In a major blow to her party, B.C. Green Party leader Sonia Furstenau lost her seat after leaving her riding of Cowichan Valley to run for the first time in Victoria–Beacon Hill. \"It has been such an honour to be an MLA,\" an emotional Furstenau later told supporters gathered in the capital, her voice hoarse after fighting a cold last weekend. \"It's not the outcome we hoped for in Victoria–Beacon Hill tonight, but I'm so proud of the campaign that we ran.\" The Greens otherwise led in two ridings. With the two top parties each straining to clinch a majority, Furstenau said the party could potentially play a \"pivotal role\" in the next government. WATCH | Furstenau thanks supporters, family after election loss: Greens will still play 'pivotal role,' leader Sonia Furstenau says despite losing seat 6 months ago Duration 6:26 B.C. Green Leader Sonia Furstenau addresses supporters after failing to win the Victoria-Beacon Hill riding in the provincial election. B.C. was left with similar uncertainty after the provincial election in 2017, when election night ended with another too-close-to-call race between the NDP and then-B.C. Liberals. Former Liberals leader Christy Clark promised to lead a minority government after the race, but resigned weeks later after losing a confidence vote. The NDP's John Horgan became premier after signing a confidence and supply agreement with the support of the three Green members of the Legislature. Together, the two parties had a total of 44 seats — the minimum required at that time for a majority. Remarkable Conservative rise The campaign was largely a story about whether or not the Conservatives could complete a stunning political rise to topple Eby's NDP, or whether the incumbent party could hold onto its commanding power in the Legislature. At dissolution this fall, the NDP held a powerful majority with 55 seats in the legislature. The B.C. United party served as the Official Opposition with 20 seats, but did not run any candidates in the election after it suspended its campaign to throw its support behind the surging B.C. Conservatives — who held just eight seats before the election. B.C. NDP Leader David Eby greets Vancouver-Yaletown NDP candidate Terry Yung, left, after addressing supporters on election night in Vancouver. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) The Greens had two seats, and two seats were held by Independents. A record 40 Independents ran in the election this year, but none of them won any of their races. The majority of NDP cabinet ministers retained their seats, including Health Minister Adrian Dix in Vancouver–Renfrew, Jobs Minister Brenda Bailey in Vancouver–South Granville and Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon in Delta North. If Rustad's party takes power, the province will have its first Conservative government in nearly a century. If Eby's party wins, the province will have its third consecutive NDP government. Regardless of the final outcome, Rustad's unlikely rise has been a remarkable story in B.C. politics. Rustad, 61, became party leader after he was kicked out of the Opposition, then known as the B.C. Liberals, over his views on climate change. In just two years, he steered the fledgling Conservatives to a level of popularity that sank his old party, which had disastrously rebranded as B.C. United. The Conservatives and NDP ran candidates in each of the province's 93 ridings, while Furstenau's Greens had 69 candidates. Six high-profile incumbent MLAs were among the 40 Independent candidates. B.C. Conservative supporters watch as results roll in on election night in Vancouver on Oct. 19, 2024. (Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press) Voting results were available quicker than usual because Elections B.C. is using a new electronic voting system to count ballots, though the process wasn't seamless: results were delayed in Surrey–Cloverdale, one of the province's closest battleground ridings, because of an issue with a password needed to tabulate votes. More than a million people voted ahead of a rainy election day, marking a record number for advance voting in the province. Automatic recounts will happen in electoral districts where the top two candidates are separated by 100 votes or less, with recounts scheduled for Oct. 26, 27 and 28.

Smith's speech was punctuated by resounding applause from the crowd. However, two groups mounted campaigns to vote against her. The 1905 Committee and Take Back Alberta believe Smith hasn't gone far enough in her campaign promises from the 2023 election. They say she hasn't done enough to seek accountability for vaccine mandates and COVID-related business closures during the pandemic. But David Parker of Take Back Alberta said he accepted the result, as it represented the will of party members.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press) As for the groups who opposed her leadership, Nixon asked them to heed what Smith said in her victory speech. \"It's time for us to go back to being a united party, focus on what unites us and stop focusing on what divides us,\" he said. \"Clearly that's where the majority of our membership is at.\" The party passed all 35 policy resolutions slated for debate this year by a wide margin — in many cases, with near-unanimous support.

Issued on: 20/10/2024 - 20:29 1 min Pope Francis (C) presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world © Filippo MONTEFORTE / AFP Francis presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world. \"We enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole Church,\" proclaimed Francis, after reciting each name. Canonisation is the final step towards sainthood in the Catholic Church, following beatification. Three conditions are required -- most crucially that the individual has performed at least two miracles. He or she must be deceased for at least five years and have led an exemplary Christian life. Among the group are 11 individuals known as the \"martyrs of Damascus\", who have become saints some 160 years after their death. The eight Franciscan friars and three lay Maronites -- all siblings -- from a monastery were assassinated by Druze militants in July 1860 in the Syrian capital, then under Ottoman rule. They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1926. Many citizens, Christian and otherwise, have left the city since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011. The martyrdom of the Damascus group canonised on Sunday \"is not very different from the situation of many Christians in the Middle East today\", wrote Vatican News, the official news portal of the Vatican. The other three individuals, who died early in the 20th century, founded religious communities. They are Italian missionary Giuseppe Allamano, Italian nun Elena Guerra and the Canadian Marie-Leonie Paradis. In May, Pope Francis announced he would canonise Italian teenager Carlos Acutis. The London-born adolescent spent his life spreading his faith online, earning the moniker \"God's Influencer\", before dying from leukaemia in 2006. The date of that canonisation has not yet been set but it could take place in 2025, the Church's Jubilee year, when more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to descend on Rome. © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The work stoppage will disrupt mail service ahead of the busy holiday season. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice earlier in the week, saying it’s been asking for fair wages, safer working conditions and other improvements over nearly a year of bargaining. “We still believe we can achieve negotiated collective agreements, but Canada Post must be willing to resolve our new and outstanding issues,” CUPW said in a statement. Canada Post served the union with the lockout notice not long after but had said it didn’t intend to lock workers out. The government corporation released a statement early Friday morning confirming that customers will experience delays. Mail and parcels will not be delivered for the duration of the strike, and some post offices will be closed. Canada Post says shutting down facilities will affect its national network, with processing and delivery of mail possibly needing time to return to normal once the strike is over.

Monday’s election saw the NDP see its biggest gains in the province in more than 15 years. The counting is still ongoing and the numbers could change, but so far 24 are elected with two leading in their ridings. “What an incredible journey this has been that we’ve been on together,” NDP Leader Carla Beck said when addressing supporters. “Friends, we came so close. You know, when we started this campaign many people didn’t give us much of a chance, but we believed. And because of the hard work and determination of all of you in this room and right across this province, we gave people a reason to hope again.” Story continues below advertisement Beck acknowledged the party didn’t win government, but told supporters they “changed the landscape” in the province.

The last time the party saw more than 20 MLAs was in 2007, before it lost power to the Saskatchewan Party and was reduced to just 20 seats. Since then, it’s lost seats, falling to nine in 2011 and only reaching 13 in the last election in 2020, though before dissolution this year it saw one additional MLA elected. 1:59 ‘Saskatchewan wants positive change’: Saskatchewan NDP Leader Beck concedes election Much of its groundswell of support came from the province’s big cities, with Regina and Saskatoon appearing to go almost completely orange, though at least two in Saskatoon may remain with the government when final counts are done. Trending Now ‘People have almost died’: Soaring N.S. lobster fishing tensions revealed Gunmen open fire on tourists, killing over 20 people at Kashmir resort Beck added that though it wasn’t the result they wanted, “tonight is not the end,” and said the election showed the public wanted change.

Several NDP MLAs who were re-elected said the results showed a desire for “change.” “The people have told us they’re ready for change and what we’re seeing in these results here tonight are showing us just exactly that,” Erika Ritchie, the re-elected MLA for Saskatoon Nutana, told Global News. Those city wins also led to some defeats for the Saskatchewan Party, with five cabinet ministers losing their seats. While there were celebrations among the NDP for making major breakthroughs in the big cities, political analyst Ken Coates cautioned it was a sign the party, as well as the Saskatchewan Party, still needs some work. “Neither party has been very successful in breaking out of their base, but the NDP has done a fabulous job of getting into Saskatoon and Regina,” Coates said.

Wednesday's 50-basis-point cut to 3.75 per cent is twice the size of previous one Jenna Benchetrit · CBC News · Posted: Oct 23, 2024 9:50 AM EDT | Last Updated: October 24, 2024 The Bank of Canada on Wednesday announced it has lowered its key interest rate to 3.75 per cent. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing The Bank of Canada has lowered its key interest rate to 3.75 per cent, making a 50-basis-point cut for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. Before Wednesday, the rate stood at 4.25 per cent. Economists were expecting the central bank to go with a larger than usual cut, compared to the 25-basis-point downgrades made in June, July and September. The last time the bank made a cut this size was on March 27, 2020. It was the third consecutive 50-basis-point cut made that month, after March 4 and 13. As concerns over inflation have subsided — out-of-control price growth, the catalyst for the central bank's initial rate-hike campaign, is now back within the target range — the bank has focused on cutting to keep inflation stable and support economic growth, which has been sluggish under the pressure of high rates. \"We need to stick the landing,\" Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem told a news conference Wednesday morning. \"With inflation back to two per cent, we want to see growth strengthen. Today's interest rate decision should contribute to a pickup in demand.\" WATCH | Bank of Canada governor says we're back to low inflation: Bank of Canada cuts interest rate to 3.75%, the lowest since the pandemic 6 months ago Duration 3:05 Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem announced a cut of 50 basis points to the key interest rate to 3.75 per cent, marking its lowest point since the pandemic.  Macklem says Canada’s dropping inflation rate prompted the move. Macklem outlined the economic conditions that informed the bank's rate cut decision. He noted that core inflation is within the bank's target. Housing inflation, which has been driving headline inflation up for much of the year, is gradually easing, though prices are still elevated. And global oil prices have fallen. He noted that the economy is seeing an excess of supply of goods and services. Canadians are still cutting back on discretionary spending as inflation and high interest rates have pummelled their purchasing power in the last few years. \"Job layoffs have remained modest but business hiring has been weak, which has particularly affected young people and newcomers to Canada. Simply put, the number of workers has increased faster than the number of jobs,\" he said. Just Asking wants to know: What questions do you have about saving for your future? In this financial climate, you might feel overwhelmed by the idea of retirement. Fill out the details on this form and send us your questions ahead of our show on Oct. 26. Macklem noted that, should the economy continue to evolve broadly in line with the bank's forecast, further cuts to the policy rate can be expected. But he cautioned that the timing and pace of cuts would depend on incoming economic data and its potential impact on the bank's inflation outlook. He repeated a now-familiar refrain, saying that the Bank of Canada will take decisions one meeting at a time. TD Bank, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, RBC and National Bank announced that they had lowered their prime rates by 50 basis points, from 6.45 per cent to 5.95 per cent, on Wednesday afternoon. WATCH | What the Bank of Canada's chunkier rate cut means for you: Bank of Canada cuts key rate to 3.75%: What does that mean for consumers? 6 months ago Duration 7:20 Earl Davis, head of fixed income and money markets at BMO, speaks with CBC business reporter Scott Peterson to break down the latest Bank of Canada news and explain what it might mean in the months ahead. Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert at RateHub.ca , said the lowered rate is immediate good news for variable-rate mortgage holders. She said fixed-rate mortgage holders won't see as much of an impact from the Bank of Canada's decision. Pricing for fixed mortgages is based on the bond market, which is \"quite reactionary to whatever the central banks are doing,\" she explained. Lowered yields might lead to lower fixed rates, \"but in the immediate aftermath of today's announcement, it's not likely that we'll see a plunge in terms of pricing.\" LISTEN What will the Bank of Canada's rate cut mean for you? Canada's inflation rate finally hit the Bank of Canada's target. What does that mean for prices? Why aren't Canadians feeling relief? During the news conference, Macklem responded to questions from reporters who asked what he would say to Canadians who aren't feeling the impact of lower inflation and interest rates in their everyday lives. \"It has been a long road back from the high inflation we experienced coming out of the pandemic,\" said Macklem. \"It's been a long fight, but it's worked … I think Canadians can breathe a sigh of relief.\" One reporter pushed back, saying that many Canadians aren't feeling relief. \"We're very aware of that,\" Macklem responded. \"You can see it in our own consumer survey. There is a lot of hesitancy. I think the message today is that, with inflation down, Canadians don't have to worry as much about big changes in their cost of living.\" WATCH | BOC official Carolyn Rogers explains why prices are still high as inflation cools: Prices have increased — and Canadians feel that even as inflation cools, BoC official says 6 months ago Duration 1:28 Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers says recent years saw many prices shift upward, something Canadians will feel even as inflation slows: 'Life's more expensive now than it was two years ago.' Canadians might not be feeling relief from lower inflation because it doesn't mean lower prices. A lower inflation rate indicates that prices are still increasing, but doing so at a slower pace. \"The reality is people are prudent, they're preparing for payment shock, they're saving a lot, they're not spending as much,\" said Stéfane Marion, chief economist with the National Bank. \"Please, let's give them a little bit more breathing room by cutting rates more aggressively. I don't think that's going to generate more inflation.\" Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note to clients that \"it would take a significant turn of events to stand in the way of another cut of that magnitude in December.\" \"That said, as has been its practice of late, the bank has kept its options open by not signalling anything specific about the size of individual rate cuts ahead,\" Shenfeld wrote. Meanwhile, economist Tu Nguyen of RSM Canada said the financial institution is forecasting that the bank will return to a smaller, 25-basis-point cut during its next meeting on Dec. 11 so as not to deviate too far from U.S. rates.

Trudeau said in a statement that Randy Boissonnault would step away from his Cabinet position immediately to “focus on clearing the allegations made against him.” Boissonnault came under scrutiny after the National Post newspaper raised questions about whether he had any Indigenous heritage. The newspaper reported that a company he co-owned had applied for government contracts while claiming to be Indigenous-owned. Boissonnault has been described as Indigenous multiple times in communications from the Liberal Party and in 2018 referred to himself as “non-status adopted Cree.” He has walked back those claims since the reports emerged, and opposition politicians from the Conservative and New Democratic Party this week called on him to resign. His departure means there is no Cabinet member from the Canadian province of Alberta. Trudeau has said he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election could come anytime between this fall and next October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, as they don’t hold an outright majority themselves.",

A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government.

A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government. Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest. The prosecution alleged King was a protest leader who was instrumental to the disruption in Ottawa. The prosecution alleged King coordinated the repeated bouts of honking, ordering the protesters to lay on the horn every 30 minutes for 10 minutes at a time, and told people to “hold the line” when he was aware that police and the city had asked the truckers to leave.

King’s lawyers argued that he was peacefully protesting and was not one of the demonstration’s leaders. King was found not guilty on three counts of intimidation and one count of obstructing police himself. The truckers’ convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant the honking of horns and music from parties. Trudeau’s government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada. The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger. The Freedom Convoy shook Canada’s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade.

The bills will prohibit minors from receiving certain types of gender-affirming care and also require that parents opt-in before their children are taught about sex in class. (Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing After a trio of bills affecting transgender people in Alberta passed the final stage of debate in the legislature, a pair of 2SLGBTQ+ advocacy groups have said they're moving ahead with legal action in response, calling the legislation discriminatory. The Education Amendment Act, 2024, the Health Statutes Amendment Act and the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act, first announced by Premier Danielle Smith in a provincewide video address in January, are set to become law. National advocacy group Egale Canada and the Alberta-based Skipping Stone Foundation confirmed Wednesday their intent to pursue legal action in response, arguing the legislation violates the constitutional rights of young 2SLGBTQ+ people. Danielle Smith unveils sweeping changes to Alberta's student gender identity, sports and surgery policies Alberta tables bills on transgender youth health care, students' pronouns, opt-in sex education The changes include requiring children under 16 to have parental consent if they want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students who are 16 or 17 won't need permission, but schools will need to let their parents know first. Students would not be able to learn about sex education, gender identity and sexual orientation in school unless their parents have opted in to them receiving that instruction. Any third-party instructional material would need approval from Alberta Education before it is used in the classroom. CBC Explains How gender-affirming health care for kids works in Canada If passed, the legislation would also prohibit doctors from treating those under 16 seeking gender-affirming treatment through puberty blockers or hormone therapy. Physicians would be prohibited from performing top and bottom gender surgeries on minors. Bottom surgery is already restricted to patients over the age of 18. All surgeries are currently performed in Quebec. WATCH | Schools would have to inform parents when kids ask to change pronouns: Alberta tables bills to change health care, restrict gender-affirming care, sex-ed 6 months ago Duration 2:42 The Alberta government has tabled a series of bills that would bring big changes to the health-care system, as well as limit who can get some gender-affirming treatments, and make parents opt in for sex education in schools. A third bill, the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act, would limit membership on female competitive sports teams to athletes who were female at birth. The bill will ban transgender athletes from competing in female amateur sports and require school and organizations to report eligibility complaints. Smith has said the government will work with leagues to set up coed or gender-neutral divisions for sports. According to the province, the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act is anticipated to take effect fall 2025, while the amendments to the Education Act will take effect on proclamation, which is anticipated in September 2025. The Health Statutes Amendment Act is expected to come into effect in the coming months. Constitutionality of new policies questioned Bennett Jensen, Egale Canada's director of legal, said on Wednesday he's deeply disappointed and concerned about the legislation's consequences, and the harm it's already caused for young people since being introduced. The policies have already led to increased bullying, as well as more young people feeling anxious, depressed and scared, Jensen said. He added the policies have also communicated to young people that there's something wrong with being transgender. \"It's hard to properly describe what it feels like to be talking to kids across the province who tell you that they wouldn't be here if they hadn't had access to [puberty] blockers, or who tell you that they won't be here [if they're] denied access to medical care,\" Jensen said. \"It's hard to capture how high the stakes are in this moment. And I don't think that we have a choice but to try to protect these kids as much as we can.\" Smith said the bills are necessary to protect children and female athletes. On Wednesday, Smith argued it isn't rare to put limitations on the kinds of decisions children can make for themselves. \"We don't allow them to smoke, we don't allow them to do drugs, we don't allow them to drive. So we think that making a permanent decision that will affect one's fertility is an adult decision,\" Smith said. Smith added the government will be prepared to argue in court that parents have the ability to make decisions for themselves, until the kids are old enough to make those decisions themselves. The Saskatchewan government used the notwithstanding clause to guard similar legislation. The clause allows a government to temporarily override certain sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Smith said she doesn't believe she'll need to invoke the notwithstanding clause to shield the policies from legal action, and that the legislation will be seen as reasonable and evidence-based. But she declined to say if she would use the clause to keep the laws on the books if the court challenges are successful. Jojo Ruba, an organizer for Parents and Kids Together, said he's thrilled about the legislation. He added that challenges to the bill will allow for further conversations on the topic. \"We need to be able to love and show compassion to [transgender kids]. But showing love and compassion doesn't mean we have to agree with everything they decide as what's good for them. And we believe it's parents who know best for these kids,\" Ruba said.

The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years — whose popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration — can stay on as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. “The Great State of Canada is stunned as the Finance Minister resigns, or was fired, from her position by Governor Justin Trudeau,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Her behavior was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!” Trump previously trolled Trudeau by calling Canada a state. And during his first term in his office — when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico — Trump said Freeland wasn’t liked. Trudeau swiftly named longtime ally and close friend Dominic LeBlanc, the public safety minister who recently joined him at dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, to replace Freeland. Freeland did not make that trip. RELATED COVERAGE Book publishers see surging interest in the US Constitution and print new editions Polish foreign minister denounces Russian aggression: ‘Don’t you have enough land?’ Marguerite Casey Foundation dips into endowment to grant out $130M this year After being sworn in, LeBlanc told reporters he and Trudeau are focused on the cost of living facing Canadians and on finding common ground with Trump on border security and economic issues. “It’s not been an easy day,” Trudeau later told a room of party supporters. He called it one of his party’s “toughest days” but he did not say what he planned to do. Trudeau faces calls to resign Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party which Trudeau’s ruling Liberals have relied upon to stay in power, called for him to resign earlier Monday. “He has to go,” NDP leader Singh said. The main opposition Conservatives have not called for Trudeau’s resignation but demand an election. But a no confidence vote in the government is not imminent with Parliament about to break for the holidays . Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said Trudeau had told her on Friday he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter that the only “honest and viable path” was to leave the Cabinet. “For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,” Freeland said. Freeland warns against ‘costly political gimmicks’ Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and 250 Canadian dollar ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said Canada is dealing with Trump’s threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew “costly political gimmicks” it can “ill afford.” “Our country is facing a grave challenge,” Freeland said in her letter. “That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.” A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn’t have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated the trade with the United States. Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, had been set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump’s tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless the neighbors stem the numbers of migrants and drugs. The statement shows a much larger deficit than expected for the fiscal year and more than a billion for border security. Can Trudeau survive? Trudeau has said he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but many party members have said they don’t want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland’s departure was a huge blow. Trudeau met with his lawmakers on Monday evening. Later, most of them brushed past reporters, declining to say what was said in the meeting. Liberal lawmaker Chad Collins said they were “not united.” “There’s still a number of our members that want a change in leadership. I’m one of them,” he said. “I think the only path forward for us is to choose a new leader.” No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one other major party in Parliament, because they don’t hold an outright majority themselves. If NDP pulls support, an election can be held at any time. Singh said all options are on the table. Trudeau channeled his father’s popularity Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, in 2015, when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But Canadians are now frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues, including immigration increases following the country’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Justin Trudeau’s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. Freeland also said in her letter that Canadians “know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.” Trudeau tries to bring in another Cabinet member Separately, Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney , the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, to join his government. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. LeBlanc’s appointment to finance suggests that won’t happen. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Freeland’s resignation a political earthquake. “This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it,” Béland said. “It’s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.”",

Police said a nearby Jewish office building was apparently also targeted Wednesday, though it was unclear if the two attacks were linked. Montreal police received a 911 call shortly before 3 a.m. about a fire at the Congregation Beth Tikvah on the island suburb of Dollard-des-Ormeaux, police spokesperson Véronique Dubuc said. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and found an incendiary device at the scene, she said. A window of the synagogue was smashed and a door was damaged. “Witnesses told us that they saw one suspect that was leaving rapidly shortly after the fire started,” she said, adding that the building was damaged by smoke but the overall consequences of the fire were minor. No injuries were reported and there have been no arrests in the case, Dubuc said, adding that police have not yet determined whether the fire was a hate crime. A few hours later, officers at the scene of the fire noticed a similarly smashed window and a damaged glass door at a nearby building belonging to the West Island office of the Federation CJA, a building frequented by the city’s Jewish community.

        "text": "Advertising Home Live news Major reshuffle as Trudeau faces party pressure, Trump taunts Ottawa (AFP) – Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday shook up his cabinet, changing one-third of his team as political turmoil threatens his leadership and tensions erupt with incoming US president Donald Trump. Issued on: 20/12/2024 - 18:11 Modified: 20/12/2024 - 21:07 4 min Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hopes a reshuffle could improve his political fortunes © Dave Chan / AFP The reshuffle came at the end of a chaotic week in Ottawa spurred by the surprise resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who clashed with her boss over Trump's threats to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Her exit, after nearly a decade at Trudeau's side, marked the first open dissent against the prime minister from within his cabinet and has emboldened critics. Since then, Trudeau has hunkered down with advisers while contemplating his own political future amid calls for him to step down ahead of elections set for October 2025 but expected much sooner. In Friday's reset, eight new ministers were appointed to replace those in the 35-member cabinet who have signaled they will not seek re-election, and to relieve others of their double or triple duties in government. Four current ministers were given new responsibilities. \"The new ministry will deliver on what matters most to Canadians: making life more affordable and growing the economy,\" Trudeau said in a statement. Behind in the polls The New Democratic Party  leader Jagmeet Singh, seen here in Vancouver in September, will seek to topple the Liberals and force snap elections as soon as possible when MPs return to work in 2025 © Don MacKinnon / AFP New ministers, after being sworn in, all declared their confidence in Trudeau. \"This is a moment where we need to stand united,\" new Transport Minister Anita Anand told reporters. But part of his caucus has urged Trudeau to resign, worried that voter fatigue with his leadership will hamstring the Liberals in the next election. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of a small leftist party in parliament, declared as the shuffle was underway that he would join with other opposition parties to topple the minority government early next year. \"This government's time is up,\" Singh said. \"We will put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons.\" MPs are scheduled to return to work at the end of January. But it's unclear how soon Singh's New Democrats -- along with Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, which also vowed to try to force snap elections -- could vote out the Liberals. Trudeau swept to power in 2015 and led the Liberals to two more ballot box victories in 2019 and 2021. But he now trails his main rival, Conservative Pierre Poilievre, by 20 points in public opinion polls, and his Liberals lost four by-elections this year. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre tells reporters he wants snap elections now © Dave Chan / AFP At a press conference, Poilievre demanded an election now. \"This cannot go on. With a US president coming in, threatening tariffs early next year, we cannot have a chaotic clown show running our government into the ground,\" he said. New Official Languages Minister Rachel Bendayan responded to questions about whether or not Trudeau will stay on after Christmas: \"He has a choice that he's reflecting on.\" Trump's taunts Compounding Trudeau's woes is the possibility that Trump in January will slap 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, accusing both of allowing the United States to be flooded with illicit drugs and undocumented migrants. More than 75 percent of Canadian exports go to the United States and nearly two million Canadian jobs depend on trade. In her resignation letter, Freeland warned this could lead to a \"tariff war\" with the United States and urged Ottawa to keep its \"fiscal powder dry\" while rebuking what she said were Trudeau's spendthrift policies. One by one, new ministers are sworn in, including here Elisabeth Briere as minister of national revenue during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa © Dave Chan / AFP Trudeau last month traveled to Florida to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in a bid to head off a trade war. Trump called the talks over dinner \"very productive.\" But since then the president-elect has also landed humiliating blows on social media, repeatedly calling Trudeau the \"governor\" of Canada and declaring that making the United States's northern neighbor the 51st US state would be a \"great idea.\" Political analysts and officials have said the taunts appeared aimed at putting Trudeau on the back foot in bilateral negotiations. © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Social Sharing Quebec provincial police now say only one of the two men arrested Sunday night following the deadly shooting at a Quebec City mosque is a suspect in the attack. Full coverage of the Quebec City mosque attack The suspect, Alexandre Bissonnette, 27 , appeared in court late Monday afternoon and was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder while using a restricted firearm. He is expected back in court Feb. 21. La SQ confirme qu’un seul des individus arrêté hier soir en lien avec l’<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/attentat?src=hash\">#attentat</a> de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qu%C3%A9bec?src=hash\">#Québec</a> est considéré comme suspect. &mdash; @sureteduquebec In a pair of tweets sent shortly after noon, the Sûreté du Québec confirmed one of the men arrested is now considered a witness. Six men died in the shooting, which began shortly before 8 p.m., during evening prayers at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec (Islamic cultural centre of Quebec). Nineteen people were also wounded. Police said it's too early to know the motive. Witness mistakenly arrested One of the men was arrested outside the mosque within minutes of the shooting. He was later released as a witness. He spoke to CBC's French-language network, Radio-Canada, under the condition of anonymity and said he was outside the mosque, shovelling its steps, when he heard shooting. After the shooting stopped, he went inside and called 911. \"I found [a victim] near the door. I didn't know if he was alive or dead,\" he said. \"When I gave him my jacket to keep warm, I saw the image of someone with a firearm, I didn't know it was police. I thought it was a shooter who'd returned.\" He fled the scene but was arrested. He wasn't released until Monday. At a police briefing Monday morning, Quebec City police Insp. Denis Turcotte said another man called 911 at 8:10 p.m. Sunday — 25 minutes after the shooting. That man told them he was armed and had been involved in the shooting. \"He seemed to want to co-operate,\" Turcotte said. The man told police he was parked near the bridge on Île d'Orléans, where he was arrested without incident. Who are the victims of the Quebec City mosque attack? Shooting sends shock wave through Muslim community Police Sgt. Christine Coulombe said the men who were killed ranged in age from 35 to 70. Five people are still in hospital. Two will need more surgery, while the other three are stable and may be discharged soon. Another 14 people have been released, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Thirty-nine people escaped the mosque without injuries. An act of terrorism, premier says Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the shooting an act of terrorism. \"It's a murderous act directed at a specific community,\" he said at a news conference. \"I think the majority of citizens — not just in Quebec, but elsewhere — would describe it that way.\" Couillard also shared a message of solidarity with Quebec's Muslim community. \"We are with you. You are at home. And you are welcome at home,\" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the shooting as a \"terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge.\" \"Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country,\" said Trudeau in a statement. Late Monday morning, Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume and Couillard held a news conference and invited several leaders from the Muslim community to speak. Many had trouble getting through their prepared remarks, breaking down at the thought of the lives lost and the show of support they say their community has received since Sunday night. Attack on the ground floor Police said prayers were underway at the mosque when shots were fired just before 8 p.m. Men were praying on the ground floor of the building, while women and children were upstairs. Quebec City police said they are working with the RCMP and the Quebec provincial police following the shooting at a Quebec City mosque that left six people dead and 19 wounded. (Mathieu Belanger/Reuters) Quebec City police deployed all available officers, Turcotte said. Some of the wounded were in critical condition. (Mathieu Belanger/Reuters) By 10:40 p.m., police said the situation was under control. \"The building is secure and the occupants evacuated. The investigation continues,\" tweeted Quebec City police, who are working with the RCMP and provincial police. Police patrolled the perimeter near the mosque after the shooting. (Mathieu Belanger/Reuters) Suspect a Laval student The suspected shooter, Bissonnette, studied anthropology and political science at Laval University, according to his Facebook page, which was taken down on Monday. Police stepped up patrols at the university, as well as at other mosques in Quebec City and elsewhere in Quebec. Police erected perimeters and road blocks in other areas of Quebec City as part of their investigation. A search was also underway at a home in Sainte-Foy. 'A Québécois accent' Last night, shortly after the shooting, a witness who asked to remain anonymous told Radio-Canada that two masked individuals entered the mosque. \"It seemed to me that they had a Québécois accent. They started to fire, and as they shot, they yelled, 'Allahu akbar!' The bullets hit people that were praying. People who were praying lost their lives. A bullet passed right over my head. \"There were even kids. There was even a three-year-old who was with his father,\" the witness said. The latest information from provincial police, however, is that there was only one shooter. A few dozen people were inside the Islamic cultural centre of Quebec in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood when the shooting began just after 8 p.m. (Canadian Press) Call for solidarity with Muslims Mayor Labeaume fought back tears during a news conference early Monday, saying the city is in mourning. \"To the Muslim community, our neighbours, our co-citizens, who count on our support and solidarity, I want to say, 'We love you,'\" he said. People outside the mosque paid their respects. Martin St. Louis holds a sign that reads, 'La paix non la guerre,' which means 'peace, not war.' (Francis Vachon/Canadian Press) Politicians around the world also denounced the attack . A message on the Facebook page of the mosque's administration said: \"Thank you for the hundreds of compassionate messages coming from everywhere.\" Politicians and community leaders will attend a vigil in Quebec City on Monday evening. Other ceremonies have been planned across the country . According to Quebec City police, the shooting began just before 8 p.m. ET. (Maxime Corneau/Radio-Canada) The mosque was previously the target of vandals. Last June, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a pig's head was left on its doorstep . Pig's head left on front steps of Quebec City mosque last year Quebec City police Chief Robert Pigeon said Monday that police had not established any link between the pig's head incident and Sunday night's shooting.

WARNING: story contains graphic descriptions of violence. WARNING: Graphic descriptions of violence CBC News · Posted: Apr 26, 2017 12:12 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 27, 2017 The body of Serena McKay, 19, was found Sunday evening in Sagkeeng First Nation. Two teenage girls have been arrested and charged in her death. (Del Daniels/Facebook) Social Sharing A second video showing a horrific attack on a young woman linked to a 19-year-old's death in Manitoba's Sagkeeng First Nation surfaced on a public Facebook post for hours Wednesday. CBC News has seen both a shorter video of the attack and a longer one. The latter clearly shows the victim's face, beaten and bloodied. The body of 19-year-old Serena McKay was found Sunday night near a home Sagkeeng, a community 100 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. She had been reported missing earlier that day. Classmates of McKay's alerted their high school principal, Claude Guimond, on Monday to the online video. After seeing the victim's face, Guimond said he believes it was McKay and that he had forwarded the evidence to the RCMP. Serena McKay homicide investigation 8 years ago Duration 2:19 The chief of Manitoba's Sagkeeng First Nation wants the video of a vicious attack on a young woman — some say the same woman later found dead in the community — pulled off Facebook. The body of the woman believed to be the victim in the video, 19-year-old Serena McKay, was found Sunday night near a home in the community 100 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. Sagkeeng Chief Derrick Henderson said the girl's mother is extremely disturbed by the existence of the video, and he is calling on Facebook to delete it. \"I've asked Facebook and I've asked the major crimes unit to get that video removed, whatever it takes,\" Henderson said. \"It's pretty hard once it gets out there, I guess. But there must be some mechanism there available.\" The social media company told CBC News it is looking into the matter. \"This was a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the family and friends of Ms. McKay. We have not been able to locate the video on Facebook, and are working with law enforcement as they investigate,\" said a spokesperson for Facebook. The longer video, which was available for at least four hours Wednesday, was removed from the site after CBC reported it to Facebook and the RCMP.​ Girls arrested in homicide of Serena McKay, 19, in Sagkeeng First Nation Manitoba RCMP are investigating whether the video is related to McKay's death. \"To me, the video is shocking, that someone can stand there and watch it and not assist,\" said Sgt. Paul Manaigre. Two teenage girls, aged 16 and 17, from Sagkeeng have been charged with second-degree murder in McKay's death and are in custody. As minors, neither can be named. All three teenagers attended the same Sagkeeng Anicinabe High School, although McKay lived in the neighbouring community of Powerview-Pine Falls. 'I'm so sorry,' victim says in graphic video The longer video of the assault, which was public briefly on Facebook Wednesday, shows a girl's head being stomped on by a heavy boot. It's unclear how many people are around her, but there are at least two females. A viewer could see the victim's blood and facial injuries and hear the sound of bones cracking during the assault and voices swearing at her. RCMP have taped off the Sagkeeng home in connection with McKay's killing. (CBC) During the assault the victim cries out, \"I'm so sorry.\" No context is available as to what she is sorry for or why she is being attacked. \"If you send anyone after me I will kill you. I will f--king kill you myself,\" a female voice says to the victim. While the recent video has been removed from Facebook, the graphic material can still be shared on the site through Facebook Messenger, according to RCMP. A disturbing trend online Daniel Tobok, chief executive officer of online security company, Cytelligence, said the video is the latest example of a growing, disturbing trend — Facebook users sharing videos of real assaults and killings of people thousands of times. \"It's really up to us as citizens, as subscribers, members you know, when we see something inappropriate it's our duty to report it,\" said Tobok. Recently a Thai man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter on Facebook, and last week a fatal shooting in Cleveland was visible for two hours on the site. Live streaming crime: How do we police the internet? While social media sites currently rely on users to report graphic content, they should design stronger filters to stop this type of content from being uploaded in the future, Tobok said. \"I would just urge them to up their game,\" he said. \"You will never be able to stop it, but you can minimize it.\" Posting videos of attacks online is not illegal, said RCMP Sgt. Manaigre, but people who film attacks and do not come to the aid of the victim can be charged with being an accessory. Manaigre said that because the video is being shared through personal messages police are skeptical about whether Facebook can control or stop the spread of the material. Sagkeeng Chief Derrick Henderson says Serena McKay's death has devastated the community. (CBC) 'We have to continue and move forward' Henderson believes the attack and death of McKay could be linked to economic and social problems in Sagkeeng. \"I'm not sure what the circumstances are of what happened, but I know a lot of it can be related to lots of factors like addictions. I know that's an issue in my community,\" he said. The chief said the homicide has been devastating to many in the community, but he hopes it sparks changes in Sagkeeng. ​\"Even me, as a leader, it's so hard to stomach, but we have to continue and move forward and try to make it a better place for our people.\"​ Sagkeeng First Nation has most unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women With files from Jillian Coubrough, Karen Pauls, Cameron MacIntosh and Reuters CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error Related Stories Girls arrested in homicide of Serena McKay, 19, in Sagkeeng First Nation Sagkeeng First Nation has most unsolved cases of missing or murdered indigenous women Live streaming crime: How do we police the internet?",

Kelsey School Division in northern Manitoba closed its five schools for the first time in 30 years due to blizzard conditions Tuesday. Located in The Pas about 625 kilometres north of Winnipeg, Kelsey School division serves 1,600 students. Northern folks can power through just about any weather and there have been plenty of winter storms over the years, but this one has distinguished itself with its duration and intensity, said superintendent Julia McKay. Colin Corneau / Brandon Sun\nA storm Monday and Tuesday closed highways throughout the province and led to the first closure of schools in The Pas in three decades. She said safety of students, staff and their families was behind the historic closure of École Opasquia School, Kelsey Community School, Margaret Barbour Collegiate Institute, Mary Duncan School and Scott Bateman Middle School. “We don’t normally close schools because we worry about students showing up and if the schools are locked, where do they go? So it’s always been a policy that we keep the schools open, but when the storm hit yesterday (Monday), we realized that just wasn’t going to work,” she said, noting its been about 30 years since the school division closed all of its schools due to inclement winter weather. McKay said the storm started Sunday night, but buses were still able to run Monday morning and schools operated normally. By Monday afternoon, it was a different story. “By lunch time, it was so bad that we sent the buses out to take the students home and made the decision, that yes, we weren’t going to be open today. Considering our highways are all closed, it was a good call,” she said in a telephone interview.

We thought that this was too risky.” Tuesday afternoon, McKay confirmed the schools would be closed again Wednesday. While inclement winter weather is part of living in Manitoba’s northern communities, McKay said The Pas seldom gets the weather definition of a blizzard. Environment Canada had continued its blizzard warning for The Pas and surrounding area Tuesday and into Wednesday. Overnight, a snowfall amount of about two centimetres was expected along with blowing snow and whiteout conditions with winds from the northwest at 50 km/h gusting to 70 km/h. ashley.prest@freepress.mb.ca Related Articles Winnipeg dodges storm that wallops much of Manitoba Advertisement Advertise With Us Advertisement Advertise With Us History Updated on Tuesday, March 7, 2017 4:15 PM CST: adds wednesday closure Tweet Share Print Email Read Later Report Error Submit a Tip",

Kelsey School Division in northern Manitoba closed its five schools for the first time in 30 years due to blizzard conditions Tuesday. Located in The Pas about 625 kilometres north of Winnipeg, Kelsey School division serves 1,600 students. Northern folks can power through just about any weather and there have been plenty of winter storms over the years, but this one has distinguished itself with its duration and intensity, said superintendent Julia McKay. Colin Corneau / Brandon Sun\nA storm Monday and Tuesday closed highways throughout the province and led to the first closure of schools in The Pas in three decades. She said safety of students, staff and their families was behind the historic closure of École Opasquia School, Kelsey Community School, Margaret Barbour Collegiate Institute, Mary Duncan School and Scott Bateman Middle School. “We don’t normally close schools because we worry about students showing up and if the schools are locked, where do they go? So it’s always been a policy that we keep the schools open, but when the storm hit yesterday (Monday), we realized that just wasn’t going to work,” she said, noting its been about 30 years since the school division closed all of its schools due to inclement winter weather. McKay said the storm started Sunday night, but buses were still able to run Monday morning and schools operated normally. By Monday afternoon, it was a different story. “By lunch time, it was so bad that we sent the buses out to take the students home and made the decision, that yes, we weren’t going to be open today. Considering our highways are all closed, it was a good call,” she said in a telephone interview.

We thought that this was too risky.” Tuesday afternoon, McKay confirmed the schools would be closed again Wednesday. While inclement winter weather is part of living in Manitoba’s northern communities, McKay said The Pas seldom gets the weather definition of a blizzard. Environment Canada had continued its blizzard warning for The Pas and surrounding area Tuesday and into Wednesday. Overnight, a snowfall amount of about two centimetres was expected along with blowing snow and whiteout conditions with winds from the northwest at 50 km/h gusting to 70 km/h. ashley.prest@freepress.mb.ca Related Articles Winnipeg dodges storm that wallops much of Manitoba Advertisement Advertise With Us Advertisement Advertise With Us History Updated on Tuesday, March 7, 2017 4:15 PM CST: adds wednesday closure Tweet Share Print Email Read Later Report Error Submit a Tip",

        "text": "Nova Scotia election: Liberals re-elected with slim majority Josh Dehaas , CTVNews.ca Writer @JoshDehaas Published Tuesday, May 30, 2017 5:40AM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, May 31, 2017 11:26AM EDT Stephen McNeil’s Liberals will form the next government in Nova Scotia -- but with a slim majority of seats. INTERACTIVE: Riding-by-riding election results map With approximately 99 per cent of votes counted, McNeil’s Liberals were leading or elected in 27 seats, while Jamie Baillie’s Progressive Conservatives were leading or elected in 17 seats and Gary Burrill’s New Democrats were leading or elected in 7 seats. A party needs 26 seats for a majority in the 51-seat legislature. McNeil managed the victory despite a campaign against him by public sector unions and accusations from both Burrill and Baillie that the province’s health care system is in crisis. In his victory speech -- offered before it was clear his majority would hold – McNeil said he will work with Burrill and Baillie to continue to move the province forward. McNeil said the campaign was about keeping the province “sustainable” for future generations. “We need to build a stronger economy so more of our daughters and sons can live and raise their families here in Nova Scotia,” he said. McNeil later told CTV News that his “goal is to reintroduce that budget exactly as it was.” PC Leader Jamie Baillie said in a speech shortly after midnight that the results showed Nova Scotians are not happy with the McNeil government. Baillie also said that “the people of Nova Scotia are saying they want their political parties to work together and we get that message.” NDP Leader Gary Burrill addressed the possibility of a minority government in his concession speech, delivered before 11 p.m., saying the NDP campaigned on “major investments in the lives of our people.” “A government that is prepared to move forward in such investments will find in us a diligent and strong ally,” Burrill said. “And a government that fails to move forward with such investments will find that it has to contend in a serious way with our opposition.” Burrill had campaigned on going into deficit in order to afford more services like more doctors, nurses and child care, while McNeil and Baillie had vowed to fix health care and balance the province’s budget without increasing a debt that already tops $15 billion. University of Toronto Political Science Lecturer Pauline Beange told CTV News Channel earlier Tuesday that the province’s high debt “is going to limit whatever party is going to be in power, unless they come up with some very creative ways to cut expenses.” Low turnout Voter turnout was at an all-time low in Nova Scotia, at 54 per cent, representing a drop from the 58 per cent turnout in 2013, 59 per cent in 2009, 62 per cent in 2006 and 69 per cent in 1998.

Former House Speaker edges out presumptive front-runner Maxime Bernier on final ballot Kathleen Harris · CBC News · Posted: May 27, 2017 4:17 PM EDT | Last Updated: May 28, 2017 Maxime Bernier, left, congratulates Andrew Scheer for winning the Conservative leadership. Scheer overtook Bernier on the 13th and final round of balloting Saturday. (David Donnelly/CBC) Social Sharing Saskatchewan MP Andrew Scheer has been elected the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, picking up enough down-ballot support to overcome strong early numbers by rival Maxime Bernier during a convention in Toronto. Scheer, the youngest MP to serve as House Speaker, promised to unite the party by bringing together the social and fiscal conservative wings to take on the Liberals in the 2019 election. He's now 38. Analysis Is Andrew Scheer the smart choice or the safe choice? Recap: Scheer vows to support free speech after Conservative leadership win The father of five edged out Bernier by less than one percentage point Saturday. Bernier was considered a strong front-runner throughout the year-long race. Andrew Scheer defeats Maxime Bernier on the 13th and final ballot and will lead the Conservative Party of Canada into the next election. (David Donnelly/CBC) In his victory speech, Scheer promised to keep the party true to its roots, working for average Canadian families and not \"Ottawa insiders.\" He said Canada can't afford four more years of Justin Trudeau and that the fight to return to power in 2019 starts now. \"There is renewed hope for Canada, starting today,\" he said. \"The pain and hardship the Trudeau Liberals are causing Canadians is just temporary.\" Scheer criticizes 'sunny ways' Scheer thanked his team of volunteers, his family and interim leader Rona Ambrose, and gave a special shoutout to Bernier, calling for a \"big round of applause.\" He also thanked former prime minister Stephen Harper, saying Harper will always stand tall in the Conservative movement after becoming the first leader of the \"united and dynamic\" party. He also paid tribute to his mother Mary, whose recent death forced him to temporarily suspend his campaign. Andrew Scheer’s victory speech to Conservatives 8 years ago Duration 17:10 Andrew Scheer addresses federal Conservatives after winning the leadership race. Scheer called the Liberal carbon pricing plan a \"cash grab,\" and accused the Liberals of being more consumed by photo-ops and selfies than creating prosperity for struggling Canadians. \"Sunny ways won't pay the bills,\" he said. Staggered round-by-round results were announced at the Toronto Congress Centre, site of the party's leadership convention. One of the surprises of the evening was the strong showing of Brad Trost, a self-described \"proud social conservative\" who brought an anti-abortion, anti-same sex marriage message to the campaign. Scheer, who voted against a bill to protect rights for transgender Canadians and M-103, a motion to condemn Islamophobia, was asked during a news conference later Saturday if he would allow caucus members to bring forward bills related to abortion. He would say only that he won't be put in a \"binary box\" and would focus on issues Conservatives feel passionate about, like free speech. All Conservatives will be welcomed, including libertarian conservatives, social conservatives, democratic reform conservatives and fiscal conservatives, he said. \"Each and every kind of conservative plays an important role,\" he said. \"The leader's role is to find common ground among all those types of conservatives.\" Liberal MP Adam Vaughan criticized Scheer's pledge to withdraw funding to universities that restrict free speech on campuses, calling it an attack on academic freedom. \"That is the antithesis of this country,\" he said in remarks following Scheer's news conference. Trudeau, who is in Italy for the G7 summit, called Scheer to congratulate him on his victory. The two discussed making Parliament work for Canadians and the importance of Canada's relationship with the United States. They agreed to meet in person in the coming weeks. Speaking earlier from Amatrice , a tiny town devastated by an earthquake last August, Trudeau said \"I want to congratulate Andrew for his success, congratulate everyone who was part of what was a strong, democratic process.\" Before the results for the leadership convention began, there was a short tribute to outgoing interim leader Rona Ambrose. Leading up to the weekend convention, about 132,000 party members mailed in ballots. Thousands more voted in person onsite or at a few polling stations across the country for a total of 141,000 voting members. Peter Mansbridge speaks with Andrew Scheer 8 years ago Duration 7:44 CBC's Peter Mansbridge speaks with newly elected Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. 16 candidates overall There were 16 candidates in the race, but three dropped out, including television reality show celebrity Kevin O'Leary, whose name was left on the ballot due to a late withdrawal. The 13 candidates who remained after O'Leary's withdrawal delivered final speeches Friday night, laying out their vision for the party and the country. Many of them urged unity after a long and at times rancorous campaign. Saturday's program included the farewell tribute to Ambrose, who served as interim leader after Stephen Harper stepped down following the last election. In a video tribute, former fellow cabinet minister Jason Kenney called Ambrose the \"first lady of Canadian conservatism.\" Ambrose bids goodbye Ambrose thanked the crowd and caucus for their support, and said the new leader will inherit a proud legacy and an energized party. Instead of wallowing after the last electoral defeat, she said, Conservatives picked up, recharged and prepared to fight. \"We hit the ground running and we became the best opposition to Liberal arrogance this country has ever seen,\" she said. Outgoing interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, left, and partner J.P. Veitch watch a video tribute to her at the federal Conservative leadership convention in Toronto Saturday. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press) She said no matter what differences of view are expressed during the heat of the campaign, the party is ready to fight in 2019. \"We are strong, focused and united, and we know Justin Trudeau can be beaten.\" Michelle Warkentin and Mike Vecchio, both spouses of MPs, also praised Ambrose's partner, J.P. Veitch, for his support during the last 569 days, calling him one of the party's \"unsung heroes.\" Andrew Scheer wins Conservative leadership race 8 years ago Duration 1:25 Conservatives have elected Andrew Scheer to head the party into the next federal election. Vecchio joked that Veitch may have had a better attendance record in the House of Commons than Trudeau, and they presented him with a cardboard cut-out, a reference to the much-mocked cut-outs of Trudeau that were installed in Canadian embassies abroad. Veitch called it an \"honour and an amazing privilege\" to have been by Ambrose's side. \"I can't wait for our next chapter.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error Related Stories Who is Andrew Scheer?

Federal public safety minister Ralph Goodale said the western Canadian province had made two requests to the federal government for military assistance to fight the fires, which he said were expected to worsen. Canada spy service workers sue agency over alleged racist, sexist bullying Read more The military has sent two planes and five helicopters to help with evacuations and transportation for first responders, according to the Department of National Defence. British Columbia chief fire information officer Kevin Skrepnek said in a conference call the Australians were due to arrive on Wednesday. There were 159 fires across the province in an area between 150km (95 miles) to 350km (217 miles) northeast of Vancouver, including 17 new ones, although the total numbers were down slightly from 162 on Sunday, Skrepnek said. No casualties have been reported. “In a few cases, it is because we had amalgamated some of these fires together,” he said. “But for the most part, that decrease in terms of the total fires burning is an indication of progress.” View image in fullscreen Kelsey Thorne holds her daughter Nevaeh Porter as they view the remains of their home near Ashcroft, British Columbia.

Jeffrey Williamson, 42, is facing charges of voyeurism and distributing voyeuristic material Robson Fletcher · CBC News · Posted: Jun 14, 2017 3:28 PM EDT | Last Updated: June 15, 2017 Staff Sgt. Cory Dayley, right, speaks to reporters about the arrest of a suspect in the 'CanadaCreep' Twitter case. At left, Alexandra Constantinidis is seen in one of the many videos posted on the Twitter account. She agreed to have this screenshot of the video published as part of this story. (Left: Screenshot, Right: Mark Matulis/CBC) Social Sharing A 42-year-old Calgary man has been arrested in connection with the now suspended \"CanadaCreep\" Twitter account, which over the past year posted secretly recorded images of women's bodies. Police say they've seized hundreds of thousands of images that date back as far as 2012 from the man's devices. \"This is definitely an extreme case … and quite disturbing and concerning,\" said Staff Sgt. Cory Dayley with the Calgary Police Service (CPS) cyber-forensics unit. Jeffrey Williamson is charged with voyeurism and distributing voyeuristic material in relation to three separate incidents. Hundreds of Calgary women secretly photographed, posted to 'CanadaCreep' Twitter account At a hearing held Wednesday evening, a publication ban was placed on naming the three victims. Dayley said police expect to lay further charges, as well, as they speak with more victims and could later lay \"global\" charges in relation to other images in which no victims are identified. Going through all of the evidence could take weeks, if not months. \"The investigation is definitely in its infancy, now that we have the magnitude of evidence and exhibits in our possession,\" Dayley said. 'Multiple electronic devices seized' Dayley said \"multiple electronic devices were seized\" when the man was taken into custody at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday on his way back to his home in the southeast community of Prestwick/McKenzie Towne. \"A search warrant was executed on a residence in the community of Prestwick that resulted in an additional seizure of computers, storage devices and other electronics,\" he said. Police said they seized \"multiple terabytes of data\" from the devices. A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes. All told, Dayley said there are hundreds of thousands of images to go through, the bulk of which were not posted to the \"CanadaCreep\" Twitter account. As CBC News reported Tuesday , the account had amassed 17,000 followers over the span of a year before being shut down by the social media service that day. 'Objectification of women' Hundreds of posts on the account included surreptitiously recorded photos and video of Calgary women's clothed breasts, buttocks and genital areas — including videos filmed up women's skirts while they walked. It's those videos that led to the voyeurism charges, but Dayley said the hundreds of other images on the account were also \"extremely disturbing,\" even if they don't cross the threshold required to lay criminal charges. \"It's still objectification of women ... which is wrong,\" he said. \"We don't agree with it here at CPS. It's disturbing social behaviour.\" Many of the images were captured on the streets of downtown Calgary, others in and around Prince's Island Park. Some were clearly recorded at a C-Train station or in the city's Plus-15 network of elevated walkways. 'I was pretty mad that this was happening to me' Alexandra Constantinidis, 22, learned on Monday evening she was among the women whose images were posted to the Twitter account. She told CBC News that numerous friends alerted her to a nearly minute-long video that appeared to be of her walking in downtown Calgary, filmed from behind and focused on her backside. When she watched it for herself, she recognized it as being recorded on Friday, as she was going to get lunch. She then looked through the previous \"CanadaCreep\" posts, which date back to June 2016, and said she was shocked the account had been so active for so long. \"I was pretty mad that this was happening to me and also to a bunch of younger girls,\" she said. \"It's a little violating having somebody film you when walking down the street.\" 'Upskirt' victim speaks out Another Calgary woman, who CBC News has agreed not to identify, said Tuesday that she felt \"extremely violated\" and unsafe when she learned on Monday night that she was among the \"upskirt\" victims on the Twitter account. She said friends alerted her to a series of videos in which the camera operator follows her from behind over a period of several minutes before finally moving in close. \"Eventually he takes the camera and puts it under my skirt from behind. It's crazy,\" the 25-year-old said. \"You can see my underwear and my butt.\" She said the account included so many videos that were apparently recorded over a period of a months, mostly in Calgary's downtown area, it made her worry for her safety and that of her friends and co-workers. \"I feel it's just so degrading. It's just disturbing,\" she said. \"And then I feel for all the other people that are in the videos.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error Related Stories Hundreds of Calgary women secretly photographed, posted to 'CanadaCreep' Twitter account",

'Hatred has no place in Alberta' says Alberta premier Rachel Notley Alexandra Zabjek · CBC News · Posted: Oct 01, 2017 3:49 AM EDT | Last Updated: October 2, 2017 A U-Haul lies on its side near 100th Avenue and 107th Street, after a high-speed chase with Edmonton police. (Zoe Todd/CBC) Social Sharing Politicians and Muslim community leaders are cautioning against potential community backlash after a suspected terrorism attack in Edmonton Saturday night. A 30-year-old man is in custody following a high-speed chase just before midnight through streets filled with bar patrons and football fans. A man stabbed a police officer with a knife and deliberately plowed into pedestrians on Edmonton's busiest downtown strip, police say. Abdulahi Hasan Sharif is the man accused in the attacks, multiple sources tell CBC News. The chase ended after a white U-Haul van the man was driving struck four pedestrians and flipped on its side. Cst. Mike Chernyk was the officer injured in the violent altercation, sources tell CBC News. Edmonton police Chief Rod Knecht confirmed that a black ISIS flag was seized from a car where the police officer was attacked. The officer was not critically injured. The condition of the four pedestrians is not known. \"Based on evidence at the scenes and the actions of the suspect ... it was determined that these incidents are being investigated as acts of terrorism,\" Knecht said. The incident triggered a torrent of hate messages on social media, much of it targeting Muslims. 'Hatred has no place in Alberta' Alberta Premier Rachel Notley thanked first responders for bravery during the chaotic night and urged the public to avoid lashing out. \"The horrific events last night in downtown Edmonton have left us shocked and angry,\" Notley said in a statement. \"It's left us shocked at the indiscriminate cruelty and angry that someone might target their hatred at places where we gather with our families and friends. 'Alberta we must stand together in defence of our loved ones, friends and neighbours' 8 years ago Duration 3:12 Premier Rachel Notley responded Sunday morning to the suspected terror attack in Edmonton, saying \"hatred has no place in Alberta.\" \"Hatred has no place in Alberta. It's not who we are. We are in this together and together we are stronger than any form of hate.\" Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson called for vigilance and urged the community to remain calm. \"To the best of our knowledge this was a lone wolf attack,\" Iveson told a news conference Sunday. \"Terrorism is about creating panic and sowing divide and disputing people's lives, so we can succumb to that or we can rise above it.\" Edmonton suspected terror attack likely a 'lone wolf' incident, says Mayor Don Iveson Members of Edmonton's Muslim community are strongly condemning the attacks and calling for solidarity within the community. Edmonton human rights activist Ahmed Abdikadir said he felt \"anger and frustration\" at news the violence may have been the work of a terrorist. He fears the attack may result in a backlash against the city's minority communities. \"To the Edmonton community at large, I would like to tell them that we stand together and unite against hate. And let's solve this problem collectively, rather than pointing fingers at each other. \"Pointing at one community or the other will not be the solution.\" Police believe the suspect acted alone, Knecht said early Sunday, adding that police are nonetheless investigating the possible involvement of others. The first attack happened at about 8:15 p.m. Saturday near Commonwealth Stadium, where an officer was working traffic control for a CFL game. Knecht said the officer was standing behind a barricade when a Chevrolet Malibu crashed into it, hit the officer and sent him flying 4.5 metres into the air. 'Was he under surveillance?': Questions surround Edmonton 'acts of terrorism,' security expert says \"A male believed to be 30 years old then jumped out of his vehicle and viciously attacked the Edmonton Police Service member with a knife,\" Knecht said. \"A struggle then ensued, during which the male suspect stabbed the officer several times before fleeing the scene on foot, northbound down 92nd Street.\" The officer was taken to hospital, but his injuries are not critical. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Police release video of suspect car ramming police officer 8 years ago Duration 1:06 Police say the officer was standing behind a barricade when a Chevrolet Malibu crashed into it, hit the officer and sent him flying 4.5 metres into the air, then the suspect jumped out to stab the officer. At around 10 p.m., police told a news conference that a manhunt was underway, but there was no threat to the public. Just before midnight, a white U-Haul van was pulled over at a checkstop on the north side of town. When a police officer checked the driver's name, he recognized it as being similar to the name of the registered owner of the car that had struck the officer at Commonwealth Stadium. 'The police cars just kept coming' The U-Haul immediately sped off toward downtown Edmonton, where streets were filled with Saturday night bar crowds and football fans. As bystanders watched, the van barrelled down Jasper Avenue with up to 20 police vehicles following. \"The police cars just kept coming. They just kept coming,\" said Jaylene Ellard, who was out with a friend on the crisp fall evening. Another witness said the vehicles were driving up to 80 km/h in the 50 km/h zone. \"That high-speed chase should have never, ever in a million years have happened downtown,\" said Brian McNeill, who was in a parking lot with a group of friends when the vehicles sped past. One witness said police cars began to block streets that connect to Jasper Avenue. The U-Haul eventually doubled back and drove the opposite way down Jasper Avenue. Near 107th Street the van struck at least two pedestrians. \"Throughout the chase, the U-Haul truck deliberately attempted to hit pedestrians in crosswalks and alleys in two areas along Jasper Avenue,\" Knecht said. The van continued until it flipped and landed on its side. Pat Hannigan was about a quarter-block away when he heard a loud bang. \"I saw the van on its side, it flipped over, U-Haul van,\" he said. \"And they had a guy handcuffed on the ground and obviously they smashed out the window. They had a pipe or something in their hand.\" Knecht said officers did not stop the chase along the busy downtown street \"due to the seriousness of the offence — or the believed offence.\" 'We are urging Edmontonians to be vigilant' 8 years ago Duration 3:11 Edmonton police are investigating two suspected terror attacks that left a police officer stabbed and four people run over by a U-Haul truck. Video released by police Police have since released surveillance footage of the suspect. The grainy video shows a car ramming into pedestrians, including a uniformed officer, at a police crowd control barricade near the stadium where the Edmonton Eskimos football game was being played. The footage shows the officer being thrown about five metres into the air as the car slams into the front of a parked police cruiser. Two people are shown walking toward the officer on the ground, but they run off when the driver gets out of the car and appears to start repeatedly stabbing the officer. The police officer appears to wrestle with the driver on the ground. After a struggle, both the suspect and officer get to their feet before the driver runs across the street, with the injured officer following. Reaction from Trudeau Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement of support on Sunday. \"The Government of Canada and Canadians stand with the people of Edmonton after the terrorist attack on Saturday,\" he said. \"I am deeply concerned and outraged by this tragedy. \"Our thoughts are with those injured, their family and friends, and all those affected by this senseless act of violence. While the investigation continues, early reports indicate that this is another example of the hate that we must remain ever vigilant against. The RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, through the Integrated National Enforcement Team, are working closely together to bring those involved to justice. \"We cannot – and will not – let violent extremism take root in our communities. We know that Canada's strength comes from our diversity, and we will not be cowed by those who seek to divide us or promote fear.\" During a news conference on Sunday, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the National Terrorism Threat Level for Canada \"remains at 'medium,' where it has stood since the fall of 2014. Goodale said  the suspect was on a \"police watch list,\" but declined to provide further details on the investigation or the suspect's criminal background. Police are scheduled to hold another news conference at 3 p.m. Sunday. Edmonton police are working with the RCMP's Integration National Security Enforcement Teams on the investigation. Witnesses say Uhaul swerved down Jasper with at least 15 police cars in pursuit, turned down 107 Street.

Elizabeth Wettlaufer, 49, pleaded guilty earlier this month to killing five women and three men in two nursing homes between 2007 and 2014. Wettlaufer was described by the judge on Monday as a \"shadow of death\" that passed over her victims, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported. She was told she may never be released. \"I caused tremendous pain and suffering and death,\" Wettlaufer said after receiving her sentence, adding: \"Sorry is much too small a word. I am extremely sorry.\" Ontario Superior Court Justice Bruce Thomas said Wettlaufer was a \"predator\" who took the lives of those she was supposed to protect and care for during her time as a nurse, CBC reports. Many of the victims' relatives were present in the courthouse for Wettlaufer's sentencing and were told by the judge to take their time when reading their victim impact statements. Friends of some of the victims also gathered outside the courthouse in Woodstock, Ontario, on Monday to express their hurt and anger. \"I think she should spend the rest of her life in a small box contemplating what she's done,\" said Laura Jackson, a friend of Maurice Granat, one of the victims. Arpad Horvath, whose father was also killed by Wettlauffer while in her care, said the former nurse's statement in court only made him angry. \"An apology like that is just a waste of time, paper and air,\" he said. Police launched an investigation into the nursing home deaths in September. Wettlaufer resigned from the College of Nurses of Ontario a day after that, and was arrested in October. In January, police brought six additional charges - four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault - against Wettlaufer for other incidents that took place in care homes between 2007-16. ​ The victims James Silcox, 84 (died 2007) Maurice Granat, 84 (died 2007) Gladys Millard, 87 (died 2011) Helen Matheson, 95 (died 2011) Mary Zurawinski, 96 (died 2011) Helen Young, 90 (died 2013) Maureen Pickering, 79 (died 2014) Arpad Horvath, 75 (died 2014) Canadian nurse charged with eight murders What we know about accused Canadian nurse",

Article content But he has encountered more difficulty in Quebec, where doubts have surfaced about the ability of a turban-wearing Sikh to gain traction in a province skeptical of overt religious symbols in public life. Article content On Sunday, Caron said he believes Quebecers will rally to Singh as they get to know him. “I will help him to get known as widely as possible, but I think people, by getting to know him, will adopt him very fast,” he said. “He’s very likable. He strikes the right chord with the population.” Article content The NDP now has roughly two years to build up its ranks ahead of the 2019 election. Singh maintains he’s comfortable without a seat in the House of Commons, though he will relinquish his seat in the Ontario legislature. He said he’s looking at a “dual-prong approach.” Article content Article content “We’re going to use the House as a place where we hold the government to account,” he said. “And I will use my position to go out into the community and hear people’s concerns, listen to what Canadians have to say.” Article content Singh said he will make an announcement about who will lead the party on his behalf in the House of Commons very soon. Article content Liberal MP Adam Vaughan, who attended the event, said he doesn’t believe Singh poses much of a threat to the governing party. Article content “I didn’t hear much today that makes me worried,” he said. “In fact, I heard almost nothing today about what he promises to do.” Article content Vaughan suggested Singh doesn’t have the same kind of broad appeal as the prime minister. “I’ve walked downtown Toronto streets with a guy called Justin Trudeau,” he said. “I’ve seen real charisma.” Article content But Olivia Chow, former NDP MP and former leader Jack Layton’s widow, said she believes the NDP will unite behind Singh. “We have a fearless and loving leader, a leader that gets it, a leader that will make sure that no one is left behind.” Article content • Email: mforrest@postmedia.com | Twitter: MauraForrest Article content Our website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

Bennett says this latest agreement is an important step and one that builds on the foundation of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, signed in 1975 and recognised as the first modern treaty signed in Canada. \"This agreement is a step forward in a renewed relationship with Indigenous peoples,\" said Bennett. \"(It) is a relationship based on recognition of laws, respect, collaboration and partnership.\" 'Laws like any other normal government' The agreement gives the Cree the power to write their own laws on a wide variety of local governance issues affecting their communities, which are established on what is known as Category 1A lands.

Briefly, there were rumours he would be named the new CFL commissioner, which also never happened.

He is 51 and could find work elsewhere if he chooses. Many expect he will be named to a board or to a senior position in the private sector, but it is realistic Wall disappears altogether into a private life after he exits politics. Wall said he and his wife had been talking about the end of his political life for some time and arrived at the decision to step away in late June.

Article content “This was such a difficult decision to make,” he said. “It is hard to lay this duty down, to retire from what has been and what will always be the honour of my working life.” MLAs were told of the premier’s plans during a caucus retreat on Wednesday. Wall said while the decision was difficult, he believes a new face will be good for the party . “You can’t underestimate the positive power of change,” he told reporters Thursday morning. “There’s going to be additional perspectives … I think that’s healthy.” He will carry on as premier until a new leader is chosen, which could happen as early as January when the party votes in a one-member, one-vote election. Wall became Saskatchewan’s 14th premier when he was elected on Nov. 21, 2007 and he became the leader of the Sask. Party in 2004. In the 2011 provincial election, the Sask. Party won the third-largest majority government in the province’s history. He is the first premier — perhaps in Canada — to announce a retirement on Facebook. In the live video, Wall pointed to the party’s economic record in the province, noting an increase in population and the number of people working. He also spoke about the reduction in surgical wait times and income tax reductions as highlights.

Article content Later, he told reporters increasing Saskatchewan’s exports as a result of trade missions was one of his proudest accomplishments. “I’m proud we were able to tell Saskatchewan’s story around the world the way it hadn’t been,” he said. He also said he and the party have made mistakes in his time as leader, and when asked to elaborate pointed to the cut to funding of regional libraries made in the 2017-18 budget that was eventually restored. He also said while some work has been done on improving graduation and unemployment rates among Indigenous people, there is more to do. “(There was) not enough progress that I could point to with enough satisfaction,” he said. Over the past few months, speculation has been brewing that Wall would step down from his role as leader of the Sask. Party. Polls have frequently shown Wall to be Canada’s most popular premier. However, that popularity did take a dip after the government announced its 2017-18 budget in March. In 2016, Wall led the Sask. Party to another landslide victory, with the party winning 62 per cent of the popular vote. dfraser@postmedia.com Twitter.com/dcfraser Article content Share this article in your social network Share this Story : Premier Brad Wall has announced he is stepping down and retiring from politics Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Comments You must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.

Craig Anderson made 28 saves; Jean-Gabriel Pageau , Bobby Ryan and Nate Thompson scored; and Erik Karlsson had eight blocked shots to help the Senators defeat the Montreal Canadiens 3-0 in the 2017 Scotiabank NHL100 Classic at Lansdowne Park on Saturday in front of a sellout crowd of 33,959. The temperature at puck drop was 12.5 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the second coldest NHL outdoor game behind the 2003 Heritage Classic in Edmonton, where it was zero degrees Fahrenheit at puck drop. WATCH: [All Canadiens vs. Senators highlights | RELATED: Complete NHL100 Classic Coverage ] \"It was cold,\" Ryan said. \"Every period it got colder, but it was worth every second. We had a blast.\" The Senators (11-13-7), who also beat the New York Rangers on Wednesday, have won two games in a row for the first time since beating the Colorado Avalanche twice in the 2017 SAP NHL Global Series in Stockholm on Nov. 10 and 11. Ottawa is 3-10-2 since returning from Stockholm. \"Hopefully it's going to give us some confidence,\" Senators center Derick Brassard said. \"We know we can put on a winning streak.\" Carey Price made 35 saves in his 10th consecutive start for Montreal since returning from a lower-body injury. The Canadiens (14-15-4) have lost four of their past five games (1-3-1). They were outshot 38-28 and won 29 percent of the face-offs (19-of-65). \"We need more,\" Montreal coach Claude Julien said. \"We need to create more and we need to create more from the inside. Some nights we have that and tonight we didn't. Until we figure that out and become more consistent, that's what you are going to see.\" Pageau, who grew up across the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Quebec, scored at 14:55 of the second period. Seconds after Senators forward Tom Pyatt got the puck back after a lost in-zone face-off, Pageau found space in the high slot and deflected Karlsson's low wrist shot from the right point past Price for his fourth goal of the season. His goal would eventually become the game-winner. \"To score that goal was pretty special,\" Pageau said. \"When your goalie doesn't give up one it makes it easier.\" Karlsson's assist added to his record-setting night. His ice time (32:55) and eight blocked shots are NHL regular-season outdoor game records. \"It was greater than we could have hoped for,\" Karlsson said. \"The atmosphere was amazing.\" The Canadiens never found a way to use the energy in Lansdowne Park to their advantage. Not only did Ottawa have a 1-0 lead, it had a 29-16 advantage in shots on goal after two periods. A turnover by Montreal center Jonathan Drouin in the defensive zone led to Ryan's breakaway goal at 17:02, giving Ottawa a 2-0 lead. Thompson scored into an empty net with 11 seconds remaining. \"A couple times we tried to make plays when they weren't there, and a couple times we tried to put it deep and forecheck when we could have made plays,\" Montreal forward Max Pacioretty said. \"It just seems like we're always on the wrong end of those decisions right now. It doesn't allow for any sustained pressure.\" Limiting Montreal's pressure was the Senators focus. \"We made it our game plan to not necessarily get in there and be physical, but be in front of them and make them uncomfortable,\" Ryan said. \"It paid off over the course of the game.\" That's two games in a row that style has paid off for the Senators. It's the same style that helped them get to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final last season. \"The old-fashioned way, the fashion that we're accustomed to, tight defense leads to offense,\" Ryan said. \"Sometimes people tend to think it's opportunistic hockey, but it worked for us last year. We identified it again this week that we have to get back to it, and it worked tonight.\" Goal of the game Pageau's goal at 14:55 of the second period. Save of the game Price's save on Matt Duchene at 17:17 of the second period. Highlight of the game Ryan's goal off a takeaway and a breakaway at 17:02 of the third period. They said it \"When the home team gets two points and the city can rally around for a great event makes it all the better. It was well done by the NHL, the city, and something that I'll look back on forever, absolutely.\" -- Senators forward Bobby Ryan \"Before the game a couple guys went outside and it was like there's no way people are going to be standing for three or three and a half hours, but they did. It shows a lot of passion. They really enjoyed it. For us players, we really appreciate that.\" -- Senators forward Derick Brassard \"Half a period in a game of sustaining pressure and creating offense, you're just never going to score enough goals to win.\" -- Canadiens forward Max Pacioretty Need to know Pageau has eight goals in 18 regular-season games against the Canadiens. He also had a hat trick against Montreal in the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs. â¦ This was the fourth shutout in 23 NHL outdoor regular-season games.

Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, who came second to Falcon, was appointed as energy critic. \"I can't think of anybody in our caucus that has more respect,\" said Falcon. He named Vancouver-Langara MLA Michael Lee critic for Indigenous relations and Kelowna-Mission MLA Renee Merrifield, the only female leadership candidate, critic for environment and climate change. 'The unanimity' Falcon said he was inspired by the cohesiveness of the party in his first caucus meeting. \"One of the things that makes me so happy today is is the unanimity that was shown as we had our first caucus meeting,\" he said.

His former portfolios included transportation, health, finance and deputy premier. Falcon said he would rebuild the party by highlighting the successes of the former Liberal governments. \"Bring it on,\" he said. \"I will put up our record in government up against the NDP any day of the week ...  They can talk about baggage, but I can tell you I'm quite happy to talk about our record.\" Former cabinet minister Kevin Falcon wins B.C. Liberal leadership race on 5th ballot B.C.'s next election is set for October 2024 and the NDP have already begun antagonizing the new Liberal leader. Economic Recovery Minister Ravi Kahlon said the government is looking forward to debates with Falcon. \"You know, I think it's important to remind British Columbians that he just left a little while ago, and he has a record, a history,'' said Kahlon. \"In fact, he was the architect of some very deep cuts to the province that we're still paying for today.''

Falcon said the NDP government stands in the way of building a strong economy. \"I don't want to have to clean up a big mess from the NDP again,'' Falcon said. \"That's why it's important to get in there and cut them off at the pass before they can do too much damage to the economy and the finances of the province of B.C.''

He has been working in the private sector with a Vancouver investment and property development firm. The leadership race was defined by the party's need to rebuild, become more diverse and find a way to win more seats in urban ridings. Falcon said he will be a strong advocate for a free-enterprise economy, but he also wants to ensure diversity and tolerance for people of all races, genders, faiths and backgrounds are hallmarks of a renewed B.C. Liberal party. \"I mean this sincerely,'' he said. \"I would rather not win unless the party is prepared to be rock solid behind me in the change of direction I want to take this party.''

Liberal Party, Kevin Falcon says former leader Andrew Wilkinson will give up his seat in Vancouver-Quilchena, so Falcon can run there in a byelection. Falcon appoints leadership rivals to key positions, says former leader Andrew Wilkinson will give up seat Chad Pawson · CBC News · Posted: Feb 07, 2022 3:36 PM EST | Last Updated: February 7, 2022 B.C. Liberal leader Kevin Falcon takes questions from media at a press conference in Victoria on Monday, the day of his first caucus meeting as leader. (CBC News) Social Sharing Two days after assuming the helm of the B.C. Liberal Party, Kevin Falcon says former leader Andrew Wilkinson will give up his seat in Vancouver-Quilchena, so Falcon can run there in a byelection. \"I'm excited about that opportunity,\" said the 59-year-old Monday in a virtual news conference from Victoria. On Saturday, Falcon won 52 per cent of the vote to become the the third leader of the party since 2017. The Liberals have lost two consecutive elections after holding power for 16 years. Kevin Falcon heads to Victoria pledging to rebuild B.C. Liberal Party Under Wilkinson, the B.C. Liberals were reduced to 28 seats. Falcon said it would be up to Premier John Horgan to decide when the byelection would be held. The NDP government has six months to announce a date. Newly elected B.C. Liberal leader Kevin Falcon waves from the stage with party members, MLAs and other leadership candidates on Feb. 5, 2022. (Meera Bains/CBC News) Also on Monday, Falcon appointed rivals from the leadership race to key critic positions. Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, who came second to Falcon, was appointed as energy critic. \"I can't think of anybody in our caucus that has more respect,\" said Falcon. He named Vancouver-Langara MLA Michael Lee critic for Indigenous relations and Kelowna-Mission MLA Renee Merrifield, the only female leadership candidate, critic for environment and climate change. 'The unanimity' Falcon said he was inspired by the cohesiveness of the party in his first caucus meeting. \"One of the things that makes me so happy today is is the unanimity that was shown as we had our first caucus meeting,\" he said. Falcon said Shirley Bond would continue as the Official Opposition leader in the legislature so he can focus on travelling the province to meet with voters and rebuild the party. Todd Stone will be the new house leader, while Peter Milobar takes over the role of finance critic from Mike Bernier.

His former portfolios included transportation, health, finance and deputy premier. Falcon said he would rebuild the party by highlighting the successes of the former Liberal governments. \"Bring it on,\" he said. \"I will put up our record in government up against the NDP any day of the week ...  They can talk about baggage, but I can tell you I'm quite happy to talk about our record.\" Former cabinet minister Kevin Falcon wins B.C. Liberal leadership race on 5th ballot B.C.'s next election is set for October 2024 and the NDP have already begun antagonizing the new Liberal leader. Economic Recovery Minister Ravi Kahlon said the government is looking forward to debates with Falcon. \"You know, I think it's important to remind British Columbians that he just left a little while ago, and he has a record, a history,'' said Kahlon. \"In fact, he was the architect of some very deep cuts to the province that we're still paying for today.'' By electing Kevin Falcon the BC Liberals have doubled down on old, failed ideas.<br><br>His record is clear.

Falcon said the NDP government stands in the way of building a strong economy. \"I don't want to have to clean up a big mess from the NDP again,'' Falcon said. \"That's why it's important to get in there and cut them off at the pass before they can do too much damage to the economy and the finances of the province of B.C.'' Diversity, tolerance Falcon held a seat in Surrey for three terms beginning in 2001 before deciding not to run in the 2013 election. He said he left politics to spend more time with his young family. He has been working in the private sector with a Vancouver investment and property development firm. The leadership race was defined by the party's need to rebuild, become more diverse and find a way to win more seats in urban ridings. Falcon said he will be a strong advocate for a free-enterprise economy, but he also wants to ensure diversity and tolerance for people of all races, genders, faiths and backgrounds are hallmarks of a renewed B.C. Liberal party. \"I mean this sincerely,'' he said. \"I would rather not win unless the party is prepared to be rock solid behind me in the change of direction I want to take this party.''

        "text": "The family that froze to death a world away from home 11 February 2022 Share Save Holly Honderich & Roxy Gagdekar BBC News, Manitoba & Gujarat Share Save BBC The night Vaishaliben Patel, her husband Jagdish and their two children set out for the US-Canadian border they dressed in new heavy winter coats and snow boots. Temperatures where they walked, in Emerson, Manitoba, had dropped more than 35 degrees Celsius below freezing. The young family had probably never experienced temperatures that low before. Even on its coldest day, the Patels' home village in western India would not have reached within 10 degrees of freezing. As they walked - maybe for a couple of hours, maybe for more - sharp winds carried snow and shards of ice across the plains, reducing visibility to nothing. Canadian police found the four of them - Vaishaliben, 37, Jagdish, 39, their daughter, Vihangi, 11 and son, Dharmik, 3 - lying together, frozen, in an empty field on 19 January. They had died 12 metres from the US border. The mysterious case of a young family that made its way from an unassuming village in Gujarat, India, to the bitter reaches of Manitoba, half a world away, has shocked Canadians and Indians alike, exposing the intense pressures and economic anxieties that may have led to tragedy. Officials have said they believe the family's deaths to be a case of human smuggling, and authorities in the US and Canada are still trying to determine how the Patels reached Emerson and who may have led them there, ultimately to their deaths. BBC Gujarati The Patel family's home BBC The Patels were found near Emerson, Manitoba (right), thousands of miles away from home in Dingucha (left) The village of Dingucha in western India is about as far as you can get - in distance and in feeling - from icy Manitoba. Some 12,000km away from Emerson, the town is home to about 3,500 residents, mostly middle-class agricultural workers and labourers in the province of Gujarat. There, the Patels lived in a neat two-storey home with a rooftop balcony and a large welcome sign painted over the door. Their home sits snug among a line of row houses - concrete buildings painted yellow, pink and white. Some residents apparently knew of the Patels' plans to travel, telling the BBC's Gujarati service that they went to Canada on visitor's visas. Relatives grew concerned when messages from the family stopped coming, about a week after they had left, they said. On or about 12 January, the Patel's arrived in Canada on a flight to Toronto before traveling 2,000km (1,200 miles) west to Manitoba. Police have not determined how they got to Emerson - by land or sky - though there is no record of them boarding a domestic flight. The drive would have been long - 22 hours on the Trans-Canada Highway. They would have snaked along the Canada-US border, weaving past the frozen lakes of southern Ontario before reaching the flat expanse of the prairies, where wind carries snow through the air like smoke. BBC By 18 January they arrived in Emerson, adding four to its population of 700. The town has one pharmacy, one grocery store, one school. The houses are modest single-storey homes with single-car garages and large yards. Residents call it a retirement town - a pleasant place to live, with not much to do. If the Patels had stayed at one of Emerson's two borderside motels, they would have looked straight out at the US - North Dakota to the right, Minnesota to the left. From here, at Manitoba's southern edge, it can be hard to distinguish the white plane of frozen fields from the snowy sky. Standing outside in Emerson's winter is almost unbearable, despite layers of fleece, down and wool. The air burns the lungs with every breath even when it is 15 degrees warmer than the day the Patels attempted to walk across the border. The cold feels \"like a dog biting your hand and not letting go\", said George Andrawess, who runs Emerson's lone pharmacy, five minute's walk from the border. \"Your tears will freeze in your eyes,\" he said. BBC In one photograph of the Patels, now circulating widely, the family looks happy, all four of them smiling straight down the camera's lens, as if for a holiday greeting card. Dharmik, the toddler, matches his father in a black and white floral vest. Vihangi, 11, wears the same red lipstick as her mother. Both Jagdish and Vaishaliben were educated, local media said, at one point working as teachers. Like many other Gujaratis, the Patels had a second home nearby, in the nearest middle-class town, Kalol. Residents told the BBC's Gujarati service that Jagdish, the father, had helped his brother in the garment business. Their parents were often nearby, also dividing their time between Kalol and Dingucha. Yet despite the appearances of a well-anchored life in India, something compelled the Patels to leave. In Dingucha, this is common, residents told the BBC. \"Every child here grows with the dream of moving to a foreign country,\" a Dingucha councilman said. Many locals spoke of an intense and pervasive social pressure to move abroad, with social status determined by connections in foreign countries. Those who stay are seen as incapable of raising the funds to leave, everyone else moves on, some said. \"There are instances, where boys of marriage age cannot find a suitable girl, because they don't have any close relatives in any foreign country,\" one person said. And there were perhaps idealised views of life abroad. \"There are many people earlier as well who had gone to US without proper documentation, and many of them are doing well,\" said another. BBC In Winnipeg, Indo-Canadians said they knew well the \"craze\" for moving abroad among middle and upper-middle class Indians. \"People think there are dollar trees here,\" said Mitesh Trivedi, a Gujarati-Canadian. \"I had that in my mind when I came, I was 26 years old.\" Mr Trivedi, now 59, settled in Canada three decades ago on a marriage visa and became a citizen in 2000. In many ways, his is the life that Indian economic migrants aspire to abroad: He owns a profitable restaurant, has raised a family, and his two daughters both hold graduate degrees in the medical field. Though he was highly educated in India - Mr Trivedi is an engineer by training - upward mobility would have been limited there. \"I was born lower-middle class. If I had stayed, I would have died lower-middle class,\" he said. BBC According to Mr Trivedi and other Gujaratis, the desperation to emigrate has spawned an underground industry of \"irregular migration\", referring to US-Canadian border crossings between official ports of entry. He and other expats in Winnipeg described clandestine travel networks, plans whispered between contacts in India, Canada and the US, that facilitate these crossings, with relatives or friends who were smuggled successfully becoming \"references\" for particular smugglers. \"It's word of mouth,\" Mr Trivedi said. \"Nothing on paper.\" He has heard of people who have done it, he said. Crossing on foot or hiding in trunks of cars \"is not new\". These networks can foster safe havens abroad, with documented Indian migrants providing a place to stay or off-the-books employment for the newly arrived. According to Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, the country is experiencing an influx of irregular migration. Most of these crossings are northbound - with migrants trying to cross into Canada from the US. Last year, about 4,000 people were found trying to enter Canada this way, compared to 900 crossing into the US, said Western University's Professor Victoria Esses, who studies immigration policy. Before Covid-19 travel restrictions, both numbers would likely be higher, she said. Emerson itself, with its wide stretch of unguarded border, is considered a hotspot for illegal crossings. US Border Patrol recently named this area as a high incident spot for human smuggling. In 2017, two migrants from Ghana were badly injured by frostbite, each losing several fingers, when they tried to make the trek into Canada from the US . At the time, Emerson locals told the BBC they were afraid someone would die trying to make it across. They lost fingers entering Canada. Then what happened? The Canada town taking refugees from the US It's unclear why Canada was not the Patels' final destination, but Gujaratis in both India and Canada say residents of Dingucha have a particular fixation with the US. Most of those who spoke to the BBC were familiar with the US immigration process, rattling off descriptions of different types of visas and which lead to citizenship. Or perhaps they simply had family there. A few days after their deaths, an online fundraiser for the family's funeral costs was set up by Dilip Patel, a doctor in Chicago, though it is uncertain if he was a relative. He did not respond to requests for comment. BBC The Patels were found not far from here Police on both sides of the border have said that the Patels' case is probably linked to human smuggling. The only named suspect so far is 47-year-old Steve Shand, a US citizen from Florida, arrested last month. Mr Shand is suspected of playing a part in a \"larger human smuggling operation\", connected to the deaths of the Patels, the US Homeland Security department has said. On 19 January, the same day the Patels were found, Mr Shand was arrested in Pembina, North Dakota, less than 8km from Emerson. He was driving a 15-seat van with two Indian nationals as passengers, and cases of food and water in his boot. Five additional Indian nationals were found that day, 400 metres south of the Canadian border, walking towards the location of Mr Shand's arrest. They told authorities they had been walking for more than 11 hours. The Indian nationals arrived illegally in the US, authorities said. All seven spoke Gujarati - the language of the Patels' home state - and all seven wore newly purchased matching winter clothing, similar to the Patels'. One man carried a backpack that did not belong to him, containing children's clothes, a nappy and toys. The group told authorities that a family of four had been left behind. One of the Indian nationals caught with Mr Shand told authorities he paid a \"significant\" amount of money to enter Canada under a falsified student visa. After crossing into the US on foot, he had expected to be driven to his uncle's home in Chicago. But for the Patels, the central questions are left unanswered: what was waiting for them across the plains, was it worth the risk, or did they even know the risk they were taking? Among the many painful details of the case, Canadians have been left bewildered as to why the Patels pushed forward, despite the frigid and dangerous conditions. \"Who told them to do this?\" asked Hemant Shah, an Indian expat and community leader in Winnipeg. \"Any Gujarati or Indo-Canadian would have told them not to go. It was minus 35, you cannot survive that.\" Perhaps the journey seemed simple - a straight shot across an invisible, unimpeded border - but on the night of their crossing, that path was blurred by snow, and the long stretch of the prairies would have offered little in the form of navigation. They didn't even make it to the border. In their final moments, they may not have known where they were at all.

Ottawa protesters who vowed never to give up are largely gone, chased away by police in riot gear in what was the biggest police operation in the nation's history. Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press/via AP TORONTO — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday he is removing emergency powers police can use after authorities ended the border blockades by those opposed to COVID-19 restrictions as well as the occupation of downtown Ottawa. Trudeau invoked the powers last week and lawmakers affirmed the powers late Monday. Trudeau said then the powers were still needed but noted they would not stay in place a day longer than necessary. \"The situation is no longer an emergency, therefore the federal government will be ending the use of the emergencies act,\" Trudeau said. \"We are confident that existing laws and bylaws are sufficient to keep people safe.\" Sponsor Message World Police clear protesters around Canada's Parliament building The emergencies act allows authorities to declare certain areas as no-go zones. It also allows police to freeze truckers' personal and corporate bank accounts and compel tow truck companies to haul away vehicles. The trucker protest grew until it closed a handful of Canada-U.S. border posts and shut down key parts of the capital for more than three weeks. But all border blockades have now ended and the streets around the Canadian Parliament are quiet. \"We were very clear that the use of the emergencies act would be limited in time,\" Trudeau said. \"We said we would lift it as soon as possible.\" Trudeau had warned earlier this week there were some truckers just outside Ottawa who might be planning further blockades or occupations. His public safety minister also said there was an attempt to block a border crossing in British Columbia over the weekend. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said those who had their bank accounts frozen were \"influencers in the illegal protest in Ottawa, and owners and/or drivers of vehicles who did not want to leave the area.\" World Canadian police arrest 2 leaders of protesting truckers The protests, which were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers but also encompassed fury over the range of COVID-19 restrictions and hatred of Trudeau, reflected the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger. The self-styled Freedom Convoy shook Canada's reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted trade, causing economic damage on both sides of the border. Hundreds of trucks eventually occupied the streets around Parliament, a display that was part protest and part carnival. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing, the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, was blocked. The crossing sees more than 25% of the trade between the two countries. Authorities moved to reopen the border posts, but police in Ottawa did little but issue warnings until Friday, even as hundreds and sometimes thousands of protesters clogged the streets of the city and besieged Parliament Hill. On Friday, authorities launched the largest police operation in Canadian history, arresting a string of Ottawa protesters and increasing that pressure on Saturday until the streets in front of Parliament were clear. Eventually, police arrested at least 191 people and towed away 79 vehicles. Many protesters retreated as the pressure increased. A small convoy of truckers demanding an end to coronavirus mandates began a cross-country drive from California to the Washington, D.C., area on Wednesday. Several hundred people rallied in a parking lot in the cold, windswept Mojave Desert town of Adelanto before about two dozen trucks and a number of other vehicles hit the road. It wasn't clear how many intended to go all the way. Canada trudeau COVID-19 emergencies act Facebook Flipboard Email",

Statistics Canada reported Friday that Canada added 337,000 new jobs in February, pushing the jobless rate down to 5.5 per cent. That's lower than the 5.7 per cent jobless rate seen in February 2020, before the advent of COVID-19. It's also just shy of the all-time record low of 5.4 per cent, reached in May 2019. ADVERTISEMENT A wave of lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the Omicron variant resulted in significant job losses in January, but February's surge was more than enough to offset that. WATCH | How many jobs did Omicron cost Canada's economy: Show more While Canada lost 200,000 jobs in January because of Omicron, economists say the future should be looking brighter as soon as the pandemic relents, Alison Northcott reports.  2:01 Sectors that have been hardest hit by COVID rebounded, with the food and accommodation sector adding 114,000 new jobs. \"As Canadians ventured out of their homes again in February, businesses in accommodation and food services and information, culture and recreation were scrambling to rehire workers,\" said economist Royce Mendes with Desjardins. There were signs of recovery throughout the numbers. The total number of hours worked surged by 3.6 per cent in February, enough to finally put that figure above where it was before the pandemic.

        "text": "The family that froze to death a world away from home 11 February 2022 Share Save Holly Honderich & Roxy Gagdekar BBC News, Manitoba & Gujarat Share Save BBC The night Vaishaliben Patel, her husband Jagdish and their two children set out for the US-Canadian border they dressed in new heavy winter coats and snow boots. Temperatures where they walked, in Emerson, Manitoba, had dropped more than 35 degrees Celsius below freezing. The young family had probably never experienced temperatures that low before. Even on its coldest day, the Patels' home village in western India would not have reached within 10 degrees of freezing. As they walked - maybe for a couple of hours, maybe for more - sharp winds carried snow and shards of ice across the plains, reducing visibility to nothing. Canadian police found the four of them - Vaishaliben, 37, Jagdish, 39, their daughter, Vihangi, 11 and son, Dharmik, 3 - lying together, frozen, in an empty field on 19 January. They had died 12 metres from the US border. The mysterious case of a young family that made its way from an unassuming village in Gujarat, India, to the bitter reaches of Manitoba, half a world away, has shocked Canadians and Indians alike, exposing the intense pressures and economic anxieties that may have led to tragedy. Officials have said they believe the family's deaths to be a case of human smuggling, and authorities in the US and Canada are still trying to determine how the Patels reached Emerson and who may have led them there, ultimately to their deaths. BBC Gujarati The Patel family's home BBC The Patels were found near Emerson, Manitoba (right), thousands of miles away from home in Dingucha (left) The village of Dingucha in western India is about as far as you can get - in distance and in feeling - from icy Manitoba. Some 12,000km away from Emerson, the town is home to about 3,500 residents, mostly middle-class agricultural workers and labourers in the province of Gujarat. There, the Patels lived in a neat two-storey home with a rooftop balcony and a large welcome sign painted over the door. Their home sits snug among a line of row houses - concrete buildings painted yellow, pink and white. Some residents apparently knew of the Patels' plans to travel, telling the BBC's Gujarati service that they went to Canada on visitor's visas. Relatives grew concerned when messages from the family stopped coming, about a week after they had left, they said. On or about 12 January, the Patel's arrived in Canada on a flight to Toronto before traveling 2,000km (1,200 miles) west to Manitoba. Police have not determined how they got to Emerson - by land or sky - though there is no record of them boarding a domestic flight. The drive would have been long - 22 hours on the Trans-Canada Highway. They would have snaked along the Canada-US border, weaving past the frozen lakes of southern Ontario before reaching the flat expanse of the prairies, where wind carries snow through the air like smoke. BBC By 18 January they arrived in Emerson, adding four to its population of 700. The town has one pharmacy, one grocery store, one school. The houses are modest single-storey homes with single-car garages and large yards. Residents call it a retirement town - a pleasant place to live, with not much to do. If the Patels had stayed at one of Emerson's two borderside motels, they would have looked straight out at the US - North Dakota to the right, Minnesota to the left. From here, at Manitoba's southern edge, it can be hard to distinguish the white plane of frozen fields from the snowy sky. Standing outside in Emerson's winter is almost unbearable, despite layers of fleece, down and wool. The air burns the lungs with every breath even when it is 15 degrees warmer than the day the Patels attempted to walk across the border. The cold feels \"like a dog biting your hand and not letting go\", said George Andrawess, who runs Emerson's lone pharmacy, five minute's walk from the border. \"Your tears will freeze in your eyes,\" he said. BBC In one photograph of the Patels, now circulating widely, the family looks happy, all four of them smiling straight down the camera's lens, as if for a holiday greeting card. Dharmik, the toddler, matches his father in a black and white floral vest. Vihangi, 11, wears the same red lipstick as her mother. Both Jagdish and Vaishaliben were educated, local media said, at one point working as teachers. Like many other Gujaratis, the Patels had a second home nearby, in the nearest middle-class town, Kalol. Residents told the BBC's Gujarati service that Jagdish, the father, had helped his brother in the garment business. Their parents were often nearby, also dividing their time between Kalol and Dingucha. Yet despite the appearances of a well-anchored life in India, something compelled the Patels to leave. In Dingucha, this is common, residents told the BBC. \"Every child here grows with the dream of moving to a foreign country,\" a Dingucha councilman said. Many locals spoke of an intense and pervasive social pressure to move abroad, with social status determined by connections in foreign countries. Those who stay are seen as incapable of raising the funds to leave, everyone else moves on, some said. \"There are instances, where boys of marriage age cannot find a suitable girl, because they don't have any close relatives in any foreign country,\" one person said. And there were perhaps idealised views of life abroad. \"There are many people earlier as well who had gone to US without proper documentation, and many of them are doing well,\" said another. BBC In Winnipeg, Indo-Canadians said they knew well the \"craze\" for moving abroad among middle and upper-middle class Indians. \"People think there are dollar trees here,\" said Mitesh Trivedi, a Gujarati-Canadian. \"I had that in my mind when I came, I was 26 years old.\" Mr Trivedi, now 59, settled in Canada three decades ago on a marriage visa and became a citizen in 2000. In many ways, his is the life that Indian economic migrants aspire to abroad: He owns a profitable restaurant, has raised a family, and his two daughters both hold graduate degrees in the medical field. Though he was highly educated in India - Mr Trivedi is an engineer by training - upward mobility would have been limited there. \"I was born lower-middle class. If I had stayed, I would have died lower-middle class,\" he said. BBC According to Mr Trivedi and other Gujaratis, the desperation to emigrate has spawned an underground industry of \"irregular migration\", referring to US-Canadian border crossings between official ports of entry. He and other expats in Winnipeg described clandestine travel networks, plans whispered between contacts in India, Canada and the US, that facilitate these crossings, with relatives or friends who were smuggled successfully becoming \"references\" for particular smugglers. \"It's word of mouth,\" Mr Trivedi said. \"Nothing on paper.\" He has heard of people who have done it, he said. Crossing on foot or hiding in trunks of cars \"is not new\". These networks can foster safe havens abroad, with documented Indian migrants providing a place to stay or off-the-books employment for the newly arrived. According to Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, the country is experiencing an influx of irregular migration. Most of these crossings are northbound - with migrants trying to cross into Canada from the US. Last year, about 4,000 people were found trying to enter Canada this way, compared to 900 crossing into the US, said Western University's Professor Victoria Esses, who studies immigration policy. Before Covid-19 travel restrictions, both numbers would likely be higher, she said. Emerson itself, with its wide stretch of unguarded border, is considered a hotspot for illegal crossings. US Border Patrol recently named this area as a high incident spot for human smuggling. In 2017, two migrants from Ghana were badly injured by frostbite, each losing several fingers, when they tried to make the trek into Canada from the US .

Only Jeopardy! legends Ken Jennings, Amy Schneider, Matt Amodio, and James Holzhauer won more games or money during their time on the show. “When I think of the caliber of those four players, I really don’t feel like I deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as them to be honest,” said Roach. “And there’s a noticeable financial gap between my money and theirs, but it’s an amazing accomplishment. Like, I can’t believe it. It’s such a huge honor that I am being spoken of in relation to people like Ken, James, Matt, Amy.  It’s, wow. There’s no words.” Roach will return to Jeopardy ! for the Tournament of Champions this fall.

'As bad as it gets': Why what hit Ottawa was worse than the ice storm or 2018 tornadoes Most residents to have electricity in 2-3 days, cleanup to take weeks Sills, who is the executive director of the Northern Tornadoes Project at Western University, was outside doing yardwork at his London, Ont., home when he heard a rumble in the distance; he couldn't believe the line of storms was still so active. \"I'm thinking, 'What? Why is this thing still going?'\" He went back inside to study the forecast, and that's when the storm arrived at his doorstep. \"All of a sudden it hits and it's just like a hurricane,\" Sills said. \"It's just getting stronger and stronger … I watched as a tree came down on my neighbour's roof across the street.\" That's when he knew it wasn't a normal thunderstorm. Powerful winds lift up dirt before the storm arrived in Saint-Bernard-de-Michaudville, Que. (Daniel Thomas/Radio-Canada) An ominous wall of wind and rain A derecho, pronounced deh-REY-cho , is a long-lived, fast-moving thunderstorm that causes widespread wind damage. This particular storm system was fed by a heat dome over the eastern United States. According to Sills, the system formed south of Chicago on Saturday morning, then crossed the border into the Windsor area, where it started to cause damage. By the time it arrived in Kitchener, Sills said the thunderstorm was producing gusts of up to 132 km/h. Farms, communities in rural Ottawa area particularly battered by derecho storm Unlike the rotating winds in a hurricane or a tornado, a derecho's winds are straight. That doesn't mean it's any less damaging; its winds can topple trees and lift up roofs. Another feature of a derecho is that unlike the slow building of a supercell thunderstorm, the business end of a derecho is at the front. That's why when you witness a derecho, Sills said, it often looks like an ominous wall of wind and rain. \"When it hits, usually the worst of it is within a couple minutes of it hitting,\" he said. Part of a utility pole lies on a driveway, along with the roof of a hardware store that was lifted off by extreme winds during Saturday's storm, in the community of Hammond in Clarence-Rockland, Ont. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Making that destructive wall of wind even worse, is that it can sometimes produce tornadoes as well. \"Really, it's just a spectrum of wind that affects a long area,\" Sills said. So far, field crews with the Northern Tornadoes Project have identified at least one EF2 tornado, which hit Uxbridge, Ont., with wind speeds of up to 195 km/h. Canada's building codes don't focus on tornadoes — even though we see 2nd most in the world The team is investigating at least four other possible tornadoes in southern Ottawa, London, Ont., and Rawdon, Que. Sills said he expects there could be even more. Even if that's the case, \"the overwhelming majority of the damage was caused by straight line derecho winds,\" said Environment Canada warning preparedness meteorologist Peter Kimbell. He said both Ottawa and Toronto airports reported 120 km/h winds. A rare event: Canada's 1st derecho since 1999 The last string of significant derechos that hit Canada were in the 1990s, including one in 1999. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , that storm cut a path through Thunder Bay and sparsely populated areas of northern Ontario before crossing into Quebec, where it killed one person, toppled trees, damaged buildings and overturned boats in the Montreal area. \"It is the widespread nature of a derecho that can really cause havoc in a city,\" Sills said. What made Saturday's storm especially unlucky was that several urban centres were directly in its path. \"This was an unusual event because it affected the most populated part of Canada,\" Kimbell said. The system formed south of Chicago on Saturday morning, and then it moved through Ontario, according to tornado expert David Sills. (Environment and Climate Change Canada/CBC News) Environment and Climate Change Canada issued a broadcast alert for a severe thunderstorm, setting off alarms on people's cellphones in Ontario and Quebec. It was the first time a new feature was tested, allowing the forecaster to trigger an alert for extreme thunderstorms with high winds. \"That's the first time they've done that, and it probably saved lives,\" Sills said. Still, the storm left a path of destruction in its wake, killing 10 people and leaving roughly 900,000 homes and businesses without power in Ontario and Quebec at its peak. It continued all the way to Maine, where there were also reports of damages. Climate change could bring more derechos Pinning down whether or not the rare event could be linked to climate change is difficult. Because derechos are so infrequent in Canada, Sills said it's impossible to say whether they're increasing or not. But, he said, the ingredients necessary to form a derecho \"may come together more often\" as a result of the effects of climate change. A derecho happens when there's a lot of heat and moisture available and they are often tied to heat domes. Sills said climate projections point to a warmer atmosphere that will creep northward, which means this is the kind of storm Canadians can expect to see more of in the future. Aerial images shot from a drone show the aftermath of Saturday's storm in Uxbridge, Ont. (Sue Reid/CBC News) There is always something to learn from extreme weather events, Sills said, and a key takeaway for him after this storm is that computer modelling needs to catch up. \"There wasn't much in the way of any indication in the models of this big derecho coming through,\" he said. \"The computer models we rely on to give us a heads up for these types of events, they've got a long way to go.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Jaela Bernstien Journalist Jaela Bernstien is a Quebec-based journalist who covers climate change and environmental issues for CBC online, radio and TV.

Dozens impacted by attack gave harrowing victim impact statements at sentencing hearing Adam Carter · CBC News · Posted: Jun 13, 2022 6:24 AM EDT | Last Updated: June 14, 2022 These are 10 of the 11 people killed in the van attack.

In addition,  Amaresh Tesfamariam died years later from injuries sustained in the attack. (CBC) Social Sharing The man responsible for Toronto's deadly van attack has been sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years. Justice Anne Molloy handed down her sentence in Superior Court in Toronto Monday in a room full of victims, family, friends and community members whose lives were forever changed on April 23, 2018. Alek Minassian has also been sentenced to 20 years for 15 counts of attempted murder, which are to be served concurrently. He was found guilty last year of 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. Eight women and two men died on April 23, 2018 when the 25-year-old man who was bent on infamy, angered by women who wouldn't sleep with him and radicalized in the depths of the internet deliberately drove a rented van down a busy sidewalk in the city's north end. Another woman died more than three years later from injuries suffered that day . Molloy stressed on Monday that this is a life sentence. \"It is not a 25-year-sentence,\" she said. What this means is 25 years after the crime, the offender can apply for parole — but that doesn't mean he will get it, she said, adding that the \"number and enormity\" of his crimes will be taken into account in any parole hearing. Justice Anne Molloy listens to Crown attorney John Rinaldi read a victim impact statement during Alek Minassian's sentencing hearing on Monday. (Pam Davies/CBC) An avalanche of harrowing victim impact statements, often presented through trembling voices and tears, was read into the record during the day-long sentencing hearing. Molloy thanked each person who spoke or submitted a written statement. \"You've reached into my heart, and touched me in a very profound way,\" she said, her voice shaking. Heartbreaking victim impact statements One such impassioned statement came from So Ra. She and her best friend, Sohe Chung, were walking on Yonge Street that day because they thought the weather was too nice to take the subway. In a victim impact statement that was read out in court, Ra said her last memory was waiting for a light to change — then she woke up on the ground, covered in blood and in unbearable pain, gasping for air. She found her friend on the ground a few metres away, not moving. Ra was rushed to Sunnybrook hospital where she was diagnosed with a concussion and a collar bone fracture. She said almost all of the bones in her face were broken, save for her forehead. The swelling was so severe from an orbital bone fracture that she couldn't even open one of her eyes. So Ra lost her best friend in the Toronto van attack. She herself sustained extensive facial injuries. (Albert Leung/CBC) Through that pain, Ra kept asking about her best friend, who she described in her victim impact statement as her \"soul mate.\" \"We connected on the soul level, and that is how well we got along,\" she said. \"I admired and loved her so much.\" That was why her physical pain was later dwarfed by the agony of finding out Chung hadn't survived. In that moment, she said, she truly understood heartbreak. \"When I heard about her death, my whole world crashed down around me,\" she said. \"I felt empty inside like I had a huge hole in my heart, which could not be filled.\" Betty Forsyth, Ji Hun Kim, Sohe Chung, Geraldine Brady, Chul Min Kang, Anne Marie D'Amico, Munir Najjar, Dorothy Sewell, Andrea Bradden, Beutis Renuka Amarasingha and Amaresh Tesfamariam died as a result of attack. Automatic life sentence For victims and their families, this hearing marked the first opportunity to face the killer in person as the judge-alone trial and verdict occurred over videoconference during the pandemic. On Monday, he remained quiet throughout his sentencing hearing, sitting in an ill-fitting grey suit, balding, and spending much of the time staring at the floor. The offender also chose not to speak when Molloy asked if he had anything to say. These are the victims of Toronto's deadly van attack 'Beloved' nurse hurt in 2018 Toronto van attack dies of injuries 3 years later In Canada, first-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence without the ability to apply for parole for 25 years. During the trial, held in 2020, the Crown indicated it was going to be seeking consecutive life sentences. However, back in May, the Supreme Court of Canada declared unconstitutional a 2011 Criminal Code provision that allowed judges to impose parole ineligibility periods of 25 years to be served consecutively for each murder, rather than concurrently. WATCH | Victims of van attack face killer at sentencing hearing: Toronto van attacker given maximum sentence following victim impact statements 3 years ago Duration 2:05 Alek Minassian was given the maximum possible sentence for the 2018 Toronto van attack shortly after survivors and family members delivered their victim impact statements. Molloy said sentencing for the case had been delayed while everyone involved waited for the Supreme Court's ruling. She said the \"profound\" and \"heartbreaking\" victim impact statements court heard Monday weren't for nothing. \"The fact that I cannot and am not imposing more than the 25-year parole eligibility does not mean that everything you said was not important,\" she said. \"What you said counts. It matters. It matters to me and it matters to other people who will have to make decisions in the future.\" The Crown and defence also put forth a joint submission Monday that recognized Tesfamariam, who died more than three years later from injuries suffered in the attack. They recommended a life sentence for her death, which initially went ahead as an attempted murder as she was still alive during the trial. The sentencing hearing for Alek Minassian heard from over two dozen people affected by the attack. (Chris Young/Canadian Press) Janice Kirby also spoke Monday of the immeasurable sorrow she has felt since the loss of her mother, Geraldine Brady. Kirby last spoke to her mother on the phone around 11 a.m. the morning of the attack. \"I'm grateful I had the chance to say I loved her,\" Kirby said. Brady had gone out that day to run some errands — among them, to take out some cash for birthday cards for family that were signed and ready to go. Kirby said she didn't get to celebrate her own birthday that year; instead, she spent it shopping for clothes to wear to her mother's funeral. \"My heart hurts every day,\" she said. \"I can never understand this horrific, cowardly act.\" Another victim impact statement came in the form of a drawing done by nine-year-old boy Diyon, who lost his mother, Renuka Amarasingha. He did not file any words as part of his victim impact statement — just the drawing. This drawing was made by nine-year-old Diyon, who lost his mother, Renuka Amarasingha, on April 23, 2018. (Court exhibit) A community shattered Multiple civilians who provided CPR at the scene also spoke during court's morning session, and tearfully relayed how they still see the aftermath of what happened when they close their eyes. Jiaxin Jiang told the court that the horror she saw that day has changed her life forever. Jiang performed CPR on a victim who died at the scene, leaving her with \"years of guilt and self doubt as a healthcare professional in training,\" she said. \"I replayed the sequence of events on that day thousands of times in my head, questioning if I could have done things differently and if she would still be here today.\" Tanya Kouzos, who helped victims during the 2018 Toronto van attack, speaks to media outside the Toronto courthouse where the killer's sentencing hearing was taking place on Monday. (Esteban Cuevas/CBC) Tanya Kouzos was another first responder, who told the court she still endures flashbacks, seeing the fear and confusion on victims' faces and hearing the panic in their voices. Her voice, Kouzos said, was the last one some people ever heard. \"I live with the thought, 'was there more I could have done to help?' It's guilt and remorse I still feel even though [this was] caused by another person's evil choices,\" she said. Molloy's voice cracked several times as she made sure to individually thank each person who spoke in court. \"I admire your courage. I am so sorry this happened to you,\" she told Jiang.

Since 1971, the countries have been \"fighting\" the \"Whisky Wars\" to settle competing claims over Hans Island. Successive expeditions from Ottawa and Copenhagen have braved icy conditions to plant bottles of alcohol on the tiny 1.2sq km (0.75sq-mile) rock. But now officials have agreed to divide the outpost roughly in half. The prank war began after the countries convened to settle boundary disputes in the Nares Strait, a channel 35km (22 miles) wide of cold water separating Canada and Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. In 1973 they struck a deal to create a border through the strait, but while they negotiated, competing claims emerged over the tiny island. Both Canada and Greenland sit 18km away from Hans Island, allowing them to claim the rock under international law, and in the end they decided to settle the dispute at a later date. But in 1984, Canada made a bold stake for ownership when it landed troops on the rock. They swiftly planted their maple leaf flag and buried a bottle of Canadian whisky, before returning home to a country now larger to the tune of almost one square mile. Denmark's minister of Greenland affairs couldn't let such a provocation stand. Weeks later he set off for Hans Island, where he replaced the offending Canadian symbolism with a Danish flag and a bottle of Copenhagen's finest schnapps. But he went one step further than the Canadians had, proudly leaving a note that read: \"Welcome to Danish Island.\" And so the \"Whisky Wars\" commenced. Over the following 49 years, dozens of Canadians and Danes took part in the ritual and visitors to the island describe a sea of slightly tattered flags and notices. Finally, in 2018, the countries decided to establish a joint working group to resolve the dispute, ending their decades-long \"agree to disagree\" policy. The deal will be signed once both countries grant parliamentary approval and will see the island split along a naturally occurring cleft on the rocky outcrop, according to a deal published by the Danish foreign ministry on Tuesday. Once signed off, Canada and Denmark will have established the world's longest maritime border at 3,882km.

Ontario voters gave Premier Doug Ford another four-year term Thursday in a resounding election victory for the Progressive Conservatives that reduced the size of the NDP opposition and left the Liberals banished to the political wilderness. Both NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca resigned their posts. With the landslide win, the Conservatives exceeded their 2018 seat count in the legislature despite two years of COVID-19 that left 13,311 Ontarians dead and soaring inflation as the economy rebounds from the pandemic. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The Tories, who held 67 ridings at dissolution on May 4, won 83 of the 124 seats in the house with a dismal voter turnout of just 43 per cent, down from 57 per cent in 2018. The New Democrats won 31 seats to eight for the Liberals, one Green and one Independent. “We’re reimagining our party ... and tonight, we have changed what it means to be a Progressive Conservative in Ontario,” Ford told cheering supporters at the Toronto Congress Centre in his Etobicoke North riding. “This is my proudest achievement as a leader of this party, building a new coalition, expanding our base, creating a more inclusive party where everyone matters, because never in our lifetime has it been more important for a party to represent all of Ontario,” he said. In appealing to so many unionized workers, Ford delivered a final setback to Horwath, who announced her resignation after leading the party for 13 years into four elections. “Tonight, it is time for me to pass the torch,” a tearful NDP chief told disappointed supporters in Hamilton. “We didn’t get there this time ... but we are once again going to be your official Opposition,” she said. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The New Democrats, reduced from 38 seats at dissolution, will continue to serve as the official Opposition though the Liberals tied their popular vote tally. Del Duca, who lost his own Vaughan-Woodbridge riding, only slightly improved his party’s fortunes and resigned after failing to win the dozen seats necessary for official party status in the legislature. “I am disappointed to have not been successful in my home constituency,” said the Liberal leader, who had said Wednesday he planned to stay at the helm “regardless of the result.” With a campaign slogan, “get it done,” Ford promised tens of billions in new infrastructure, including subways, hospitals, and freeways like the 60-kilometre Milton-to-Vaughan Highway 413 that the NDP, Liberals and Greens opposed over environmental concerns. The highway, which would raze 800 hectares of farmland, pave over 160 hectares of Greenbelt land and cut through 85 waterways, was a major point of contention in an otherwise uneventful campaign. While Green Leader Mike Schreiner — who won his Guelph seat but failed to make other gains — was widely seen as the winner of the provincewide televised debate moderated by the Star’s Althia Raj and Steve Paikin of TVO’s The Agenda , none of Ford’s rivals benefited politically from the 90-minute encounter. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Sticking to a carefully crafted campaign script, the Tory premier — who led in every public-opinion poll from start to finish — courted working-class voters, securing the endorsement of eight private-sector labour unions as part of a “ Big Blue Collar Machine ” push to win over traditional NDP supporters . Workplace reforms pushed by Labour Minister Monte McNaughton ensured the support of one-time PC foes like former union leader Patrick Dillon , a key architect of the Working Families coalition whose attack ads helped the Liberals win the 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2014 elections. Ford’s surprise decision last June to invoke the Constitution’s “notwithstanding clause” for the first time in Ontario history, overriding a judge’s order lifting limits on third-party campaign advertising spending, did not appear to be a factor in the election. He is now the first Conservative premier to be re-elected since Mike Harris in 1999. Three years ago, Ford’s chances of a second term seemed unlikely when he was still viewed as an accidental premier and the gaffe-prone older brother of the controversial late Toronto mayor Rob Ford . His first 20 months in office were plagued with problems, including a failed bid to make septuagenarian family friend, Toronto police Staff Supt. Ron Taverner , commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Gas pump stickers attacking federal carbon pricing measures — found to be unconstitutional after a legal challenge by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association — were another embarrassment when it emerged the decals lacked the proper adhesion . (Ford’s family owns a label company, but they didn’t manufacture the stickers.) Similarly, his bungled bid to switch Ontario licence plates from the traditional white to Tory-blue was abandoned after police warned they were illegible at night. Ford was loudly booed at the Toronto Raptors’ victory celebration at Nathan Phillips Square on June 17, 2019 while Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were cheered. Days later, after a massive cabinet shuffle that saw him dumping his finance minister 10 weeks after tabling an unpopular first PC budget , Ford parted ways with mercurial chief of staff, Dean French , in the wake of the “ French connections ” cronyism scandal. That led the premier to appoint as chief Jamie Wallace , a former Toronto Sun journalist and one-time Queen’s Park press gallery president, injecting much-needed professionalism and calmness into his office. But it was the COVID-19 pandemic that struck in March 2020 that focused the rookie premier and forced him to finally take governing — and government — seriously. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW After hearing former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne defend him on Newstalk 1010, a grateful Ford quietly phoned his one-time fierce rival to seek her advice on the public-health crisis. Wynne told him he needed “to be out at the microphone. With Christine Elliott your (health) minister there, and you need to be there every day. Because people need to understand what’s going on.” His aides gave Ford the same counsel and he did just that, convening live televised updates daily for the first months of the pandemic that became appointment viewing for a jittery province. It was, however, a tumultuous two years. A staggering 4,400 vulnerable seniors died of COVID-19 in nursing homes that the premier had promised to protect with an “iron ring”; there were crippling lockdowns for businesses; and Ontario schools were closed to in-class learning longer than anywhere else in North America. Still, Ontario fared better in the global pandemic than most jurisdictions , suffering far fewer deaths per capita than neighbouring Quebec, Manitoba, Michigan and New York. Voters on Thursday apparently forgave Ford his COVID-19 failings, including the disastrous decision in February 2021 to reopen the economy too quickly amid the Delta variant and his knee-jerk reaction to close things down two months later . ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW By the time the Omicron variant walloped Ontario last Christmas, millions had been vaccinated — more than 90 per cent of eligible Ontarians aged five and up have had at least one shot and Ford forced all Tory MPPs and candidates to get shots , parting ways with three of them who declined — so January’s lockdown seemed less panicked. In contrast to the bluster and bravado of 2018 when he boasted of cutting spending and finding efficiencies, Ford’s Tories have tabled a record $198.6-billion budget — 25 per cent more than Wynne spent in 2018 — with a $19.9 billion deficit. That spending plan will be reintroduced this summer. Where he once vowed to be a thorn in the side of Trudeau, the Tory premier has been arguably the federal Liberal government’s closest provincial ally throughout the COVID-19 crisis. His personal friendship with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland — the two conferred by phone nightly for the first months of the pandemic — was instrumental in ensuring Ontario finally signed on to Trudeau’s $10-a-day child care and to keeping federal dollars flowing to the province for COVID-19 relief and joint automotive investments. “Honestly, I think COVID — I had an opportunity to get out there. I think I’ve evolved. You evolve into your role,” Ford insisted to the Star’s Martin Regg Cohn on May 22, in his only major campaign interview. Ontario voters now have another four years to watch that evolution. Politics Headlines Newsletter Get the latest news and unmatched insights in your inbox every evening Error!

Susan Holt won with 51.67 per cent of the vote. She is the first woman to be elected to the position. Holt is 1st woman to win the N.B. Liberal leadership CBC News · Posted: Aug 06, 2022 2:06 PM EDT | Last Updated: August 6, 2022 Susan Holt is the first woman to win the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. (Jacques Poitras/CBC) Social Sharing In a historic victory Saturday, Susan Holt has been chosen as the new leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. She is the first woman to win the party's leadership in the province. She won on the third ballot with 51.67 per cent of the vote. Former Liberal MP T.J. Harvey was the runner-up. Holt will lead the party into the next election against the governing Progressive Conservatives now led by Premier Blaine Higgs. The former business leader and one-time adviser to former premier Brian Gallant pitched herself as someone who would bring a fresh approach to politics, a theme she repeated in her victory speech. \"The people of New Brunswick have told us they are tired of politics as usual. They are tired of the conflict and the fighting. They are tired of partisanship,\" she said. \"They want to see something different. We can be the party that leads a change for a new politics in New Brunswick that is transparent, authentic, empathetic and collaborative.\" Holt's 'fresh' message woos Liberals, but is it a winning pitch? New Brunswick Liberals set to choose new party leader In part, Holt's victory was based on being the second or third choice of two of the other candidates. The party used preferential balloting, meaning members voting over the past week ranked their first, second, third and fourth choices for leader. In order for a winner to be decided, a candidate needed 50 per cent of the vote. Holt is embraced by former deputy premier Aldéa Landry after winning the leadership. (Jacques Poitras/CBC) Former cabinet minister Donald Arseneault and current MLA Robert Gauvin were the others on the ballot. During the first round of balloting, Harvey had 33.9 per cent, Holt had 32.12 per cent, Gauvin had 19.76 per cent and Arseneault had 14.22 per cent of the points awarded in the party's weighted voting system. Arseneault was dropped off the ballot and the votes were redistributed. Harvey polled 39.58 per cent in the second vote while Holt had 36.76 per cent and Gauvin had 23.67 per cent. Gauvin fell off the ballot. Bold Change Starts Now!<br> <br>I’m humbled to have earned your trust to lead the Liberal Party of New Brunswick. I’ve been loud and clear that I want to change the way we do politics. And I’m so grateful that you do too. <a href=\"https://t.co/JM2jcwJl7g\">pic.twitter.com/JM2jcwJl7g</a> &mdash; @susanholt Holt said she had \"a lot of conversations\" with people who chose Gauvin or Arseneault first, but who were also interested in her as a potential leader. Harvey non-commital Harvey said despite his defeat, he was optimistic about Liberal prospects, though he wouldn't commit to being a candidate in the next election. \"Certainly it's not the outcome that we had hoped for,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we're all still a family and I think it's been really healthy for the party.\" Harvey said his support over the first two rounds was around where his team thought it would be, but with two candidates eliminated at that point \"it's really difficult to estimate where you think third-ballot support could go.\" University of Moncton political scientist Roger Ouellette said Holt's victory was a watershed moment for the Liberals. Saint John MLA Shirley Dysart briefly led the party as interim leader in 1985 but Saturday's result is the first time party members have elected a woman to the role. \"Maybe we'll see after the next general election that we'll have another first with a female as premier,\" Ouellette said.

He became the UK's monarch at the age of 73 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023. Who is Charles? Charles was born at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948. He was 4 years old when his mother was crowned as Queen Elizabeth II. Instead of being tutored at the palace, his education was in school. He attended Hill House in West London, Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire and Gordonstoun in Eastern Scotland. In 1969, at the age of 20, he was invested by the Queen as Prince of Wales at Caerfarnon Castle. Before the investiture, the then prince learnt Welsh at University College of Wales in Aberystwyth. Royal Family tree and the order of succesion Family life He married Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981 at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. They had two sons: Prince William, born on 21 June 1982; and Prince Harry, born on 15 September 1984. Their marriage was dissolved on 28 August 1996, although the Princess of Wales continued to live at Kensington Palace and to carry out her public work. Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. On 9 April 2005, he married Queen Camilla in a civil ceremony at the Guildhall, Windsor. Regnal Name He is known as King Charles III. That was the first decision of the new king's reign. He could have chosen from any of his four names - Charles Philip Arthur George. His former title of the Prince of Wales passed to his eldest son and heir, Prince William, when he became king. PA Media King Charles's wife, Camilla, became the Queen Consort - consort is the term used for the spouse of the monarch. What does the King do? Formal ceremonies Charles was officially proclaimed King on the Saturday following the Queen's death. This event took place at St James's Palace in London, in front of a ceremonial body known as the Accession Council. This was made up of members of the Privy Council - a group of senior MPs, past and present, and peers - as well as some senior civil servants, Commonwealth high commissioners, and the Lord Mayor of London. It included a series of prayers and pledges, commending the previous monarch and pledging support for the new one. The proclamation was then signed by a number of senior figures including the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord Chancellor. It was read aloud from a balcony above Friary Court in St James's Palace and for the first time since 1952, the national anthem was played with the words \"God Save the King\". The grand ceremony that announced Charles as new king The King's first declaration King Charles attended the second meeting of the Accession Council, along with the Privy Council. This was not a \"swearing in\" at the start of a British monarch's reign, in the style of some other heads of state, such as the president of the US. Instead, the King made a declaration to uphold the constitutional government and - in line with a tradition dating from the early 18th Century - he made an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland. Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II crowned her son Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 The proclamation announcing Charles as the King was later read out in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The Coronation The symbolic high point of the accession was the Coronation, when Charles was formally crowned. Because of the preparation needed, the Coronation was almost eight months after the King's Proclamation. It was held in Westminster Abbey where coronations have been held for the last 900 years - William the Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles was the 40th. It is an Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the ceremony, the St Edward's Crown was placed on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661. This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg - almost 5lbs). Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and ultimately decides the guest list. PA Media King Charles III wearing St Edward’s crown at his Coronation in 2023 The new King took the Coronation oath in front of the watching world in a ceremony that was followed by millions. During this elaborate ceremony he was anointed using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. He received the orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the solid gold crown on his head. Queen Camilla was also crowned at the ceremony. What it was really like inside the Abbey Head of the Commonwealth Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries and 2.5 billion people. For 14 of these countries, as well as the UK, the King is head of state. These countries, known as the Commonwealth realms, are: Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu. What is the purpose of the Commonwealth? The early days of his reign Even though he has not been head of state for long, King Charles III has already seen two prime ministers during his reign. He has visited France, Romania and Germany - where he was the first British monarch to address its federal parliament, the Bundestag. In February 2024 the King was diagnosed with a form of cancer and paused his public appearances. Getty Images ©All photographs are copyright Coronation of King Charles III King Charles III",

The suspect, a 28-year-old man identified by police later Monday, is among the dead after being shot by RCMP, ending a series of attacks officers initially said were targeted at homeless people in the community. The suspect's alleged motive remains unknown. At a news conference Monday afternoon, police said the shootings unfolded in the City of Langley and the neighbouring Township of Langley over the course of six hours, starting around midnight PT. Police said the first shooting is believed to have occurred around 12:01 a.m. at the Cascades Casino, at Fraser Highway and 203A Street. A woman who is homeless was critically injured and remains in hospital. Around 3:40 a.m., a man was shot dead at Creek Stone Place, a supportive housing project on 201 Street. A second man was killed at the Logan Avenue city bus loop at 5:03 a.m., police said. Soon after, around 5:45 a.m., police found a fourth man suffering from a gunshot to his leg near the Willowbrook Mall, at 200 Street and the Langley Bypass. It was at roughly that time police found and shot the suspect in the same area following an \"interaction.\" Police did not provide the exact time he was shot. Just before 6:20 a.m., RCMP issued a blaring direct-to-cellphone emergency alert to the public with a description of a suspect and possible suspect vehicle ⁠— the second time in the past year the Alert Ready system has been used for an active shooter scenario in B.C. Police said the alert wasn't sent earlier because investigators did not immediately realize the shootings were connected. \"Our first responders were handling each case, one on one, and as the scene unfolded and as we were able to piece [it] together ... The alert was done at the appropriate time as the information became known to us and a proper risk assessment was done,\" said Sgt.

The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team said Monday he was \"known to police\" and lived in Surrey. \"IHIT is looking to speak with anyone who may have had contact with Jordan Daniel Goggin or know of his activities,\" Lee said in a statement Monday evening. The suspect previously \"had non-criminal contact\" with police, the statement added. Earlier Monday, Langley RCMP Sgt. Rebecca Parslow said in an interview the victims were homeless and that police believed the attacks were targeted. At a news conference in the afternoon, RCMP said the two victims who died had been identified but their names would not be released until their families had been notified. \"At this time we don't know the motive behind this deadly incident, nor if there was any relationship between the deceased suspect and the victims,\" said Chief Supt. Ghalib Bhayani, assistant district commander with the Lower Mainland RCMP.

RCMP send 1st active shooter emergency alert after updating policy following Nova Scotia shooting Multiple crime scenes The city and township of Langley are located around 40 kilometres southeast of Vancouver. The crime scenes at the mall, casino, housing complex and bus loop were just a few kilometres apart. In the parking lot of Willowbrook Mall, the area where police say the suspect was killed, an unmarked black police vehicle was seen riddled with at least nine bullet holes in the windshield and driver's side window. RCMP said they could not say whether the suspect shot at police or whether an officer fired through their window. On the sidewalk, a bicycle lay toppled with a blue sleeping bag and other personal belongings tied to a crate on the back. Outside the casino, a shopping cart and other items sat behind yellow police tape. The initial emergency alert described the suspect as a white man with dark hair who was wearing brown Carhartt coveralls and a blue and green camouflage T-shirt with a red logo on the right sleeve. The notice said he was connected to a white vehicle. Later Monday, a white four-door sedan with its licence plates covered by police sat in the same area where the suspect was shot dead. An emergency alert for multiple shootings in Langley, B.C., was sent to residents at 6:19 a.m. PT. (CBC) Officials sent a second emergency alert just after 7:20 a.m. PT. It said the suspect was \"no longer a threat\" but reiterated the need to stay away from the downtown core as officers ruled out the possibility of multiple suspects.

Anyone with information is asked to contact investigators, Bhayani said. RCMP closed 200 Street, a major route through the centre of the city, between Willowbrook Mall and the Langley Bypass as officers investigated Monday.

Introducing opening-night entry “The Swimmers” at the Princess of Wales Theatre, TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey addressed the two pandemic years that disrupted everything. “It was artists, storytellers, filmmakers, who were finding ways to move us, inspire us, to remind us what we’re living for,” he said. “I want to thank you, the best movie audience in the world, for being part of this experience again.” That experience takes many forms. The festival is a beacon for awards-season titles as well as red-carpet galas, documentaries, genre films, and international cinema. It’s also a snapshot of how the industry views commercial movies at a most fragile moment. Related Stories ‘Wednesday’ Season 2 Teaser: Jenna Ortega Returns to Nevermore Academy ‘Bet’ Trailer: Netflix Gambles on a Live-Action Manga Adaptation This Spring Netflix launched “The Swimmers,” the rousing-but-familiar true story of sisters Yusra and Sara Mardini (Nathalie and Manal Issa) who fled Syria for Europe while retaining their dreams of becoming Olympic athletes. Popular on IndieWire Directed by Sally El Hosaini, the movie works as a wholesome crowdpleaser unlikely to crack the awards conversation. The streamer’s awards team can sit back and let “The Swimmers” perform well on Netflix, where audiences looking for easy viewing will likely embrace it worldwide. It falls in line with TIFF openers like Magnolia’s “Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band,” or Netflix’s “Outlaw King” and “Borg McEnroe” — audience-friendly movies with moderate commercial potential. Netflix, which brings eight films to TIFF this year ranging from “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” to animated “Wendell and Wild” and the Eddie Redmayne and Jessica Chastain thriller “The Good Nurse,” arrives at the festival with a slate more attuned to general audiences than Academy members. “The Swimmers” Laura Radford/Netflix Meanwhile, A24 launched its gay military drama “The Inspection” in a late-evening slot designed to designate the movie as a hidden gem, but it has big plans. The touching and personable first feature of writer-director Elegance Bratton follows the experience of a 25-year-old Black man named Ellis (Jeremy Pope) who decides to enlist in the Marines after his mother (Gabrielle Union) kicks him out for being gay. The bulk of the movie takes place at a Mississippi boot camp overseen by a crude unit commander (Bokeem Woodbine) as Ellis develops an ill-fated attraction to his drill instructor (Raúl Castillo, in top form). Bratton, who previously directed the documentary “Pier Kids,” about homeless youth in New York City, based his first narrative feature on his own experiences as an active-duty soldier from 2005-2010; the movie is dedicated to his estranged mother and unfolds in the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” era of the U.S. military. Nevertheless, “The Inspection” is less a coming-out than a coming-in story: Ellis never wavers from expressing his sexuality as the men in his unit make peace with it to varying degrees. “Moonlight” meets “Full Metal Jacket,” Bratton’s script is sometimes disarmingly funny. Pope, best known for his Broadway roles, could be a dark horse in the Best Actor race, but the biggest opportunity lies with Union, whose own father was a drill sergeant. The actress delivers a passionate and conflicted turn as Ellis’ mother in a handful of scenes. While the Best Supporting Actress race has gotten competitive (mostly thanks to “Women Talking”), enthusiasm for the “Bring It On” star could help propel a campaign for her to finally be recognized. To even consider that possibility, A24 needs this small-scale movie to build a much bigger profile. Behind the scenes, it boasts Gamechanger Films’ Effie T. Brown (“Real Women Have Curves”), who brought the project to A24 last year, and the company appears to be betting on an underexploited market. Sources tell me the recent trailer tested equally well in red and blue states, while some early screenings for gay members of the military showed promising results. The company is betting on an expansive demographic of veterans eager to revisit an aspect of the armed services that has never been shown, while also serving the same Black audiences that got excited by the representational strides of “Moonlight.” “The Inspection” A24 Bratton is an excellent steward of the cause. The director teared up during the Q&A, dedicating his movie to “all the people that feel forgotten, to remember that you matter.” That’s a powerful message likely to get an even louder platform when the movie closes NYFF next month. And then there was Apple , which premiered its documentary “Louis Armstrong’s Black & Blue,” an absorbing collage-like overview of the musician’s personal audio diaries where he recorded the personal viewpoints he hid from public life. Director Sacha Jenkins pairs this material with an array of archival footage and talking heads to interrogate Armstrong’s conflicting identities as a socially conscious man and apolitical performer. At a time when few documentaries have shown commercial potential at the box office, Apple is well positioned to take advantage of the festival platform to draw attention to the streaming launch. The movie could have some awards momentum in the documentary race, as high-profile music documentaries often do, but that field is already competitive. For “Louis Armstrong’s Black & Blue” to succeed, it just has to make a little noise at TIFF, then snake its way to AppleTV+.

Pierre Poilievre is the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, securing victory on the first ballot after a record-setting and divisive leadership campaign. After a seven-month campaign, the long-time MP and former cabinet minister from Ontario won the election decisively, securing 22,993 of the just under 33,800 electoral points up for grabs. Poilievre secured support across the country, coming in as members' first choice in almost every riding. “Tonight begins the journey to replace an old government that costs you more and delivers you less, with a new government that puts you first, your paycheck, your retirement, your home, your country,” Poilievre said in his first speech as leader on Saturday evening from the Ottawa convention centre floor where the leadership announcement was held. Receiving 68.15 per cent of the vote, Poilievre far outpaced his progressive Conservative rival and runner up Jean Charest's 16.07 per cent of the vote. Social conservative and MP Leslyn Lewis placed third, with 9.69 per cent of the vote. Former Ontario MPP Roman Baber placed fourth, with 5.03 per cent of the vote, and mayor-turned-MP Scott Aitchison finished last with 1.06 per cent of the vote. The unveiling of results of the mail-in ballot election was done in a more pared-down way than initially planned, on account for the country being in an official mourning period given the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A moment of silence and tribute was held before Poilievre was named the winner. While the party aimed to hold a subdued event, pulling the plug on confetti cannons, the crowd of approximately 1,000 erupted into cheers and some chants of \"freedom,\" when the results were announced. After Poilievre was cheered up onto the stage, he started his remarks with a message of condolence. \"I feel a small catch in my throat when I utter the words that no leader has stated in this country for over seven decades, God Save the King,\" he said. One of the main questions heading into this evening was whether Poilievre was able to take it on the first ballot, a feat last achieved by former prime minister Stephen Harper in 2004. Ahead of the results, Charest’s camp indicated they still felt they had a path to victory, though touting the Poilievre's campaign’s statistics, top adviser Jenni Byrne said they were feeling \"pretty good.” The results were calculated in points , with up to 100 points allocated to each of the 338 ridings. Ultimately there were 33,737 points up for grabs after the verification process was complete, making the threshold needed to win 50 per cent plus one: 16,869, a metric Poilievre considerably exceeded. In an attempt to avoid the considerable delays seen in the party's 2020 race due to a mechanical issue that resulted in thousands of ballots being damaged upon opening, result tabulations began on Saturday. Still, the results were delayed approximately half an hour from what the party had initially planned. In his speech—his first opportunity to signal the direction the party is heading and set the tone for his tenure— Poilievre took the opportunity to outline some of his main commitments, and made a point of thanking each one of his opponents' for their contributions to the party, and the country. \"To supporters of all of these fine candidates I open up my arms to you. Now, today, we are one party serving one country,\" he said. Reacting to the results, Charest thanked his supporters and said he was proud of the campaign they ran, but signalled that Poilievre should be granted a \"clean slate\" opportunity to unite the party. \"We still have a critical role to play in shaping our forward-looking policy agenda and attracting new voters to the Conservative Party. I will have more to say tomorrow,\" he tweeted. Despite his efforts to extend an olive branch to the progressives in the party, don't expect Poilievre to take a more moderate approach post-campaign. “What you see is what you get,” said Byrne. \"What you should expect to hear from Pierre is exactly what he's talking about. But it's going to be predominantly on the issues that Canadians care about, and right now the economy is the number one issue.\" Poilievre made the pitch Saturday night for a government that offers Canadians hope. \"There are people in this country who are just hanging on by a thread... They don't need a government to run their lives, they need a government that can run a passport office,\" Poilievre said to cheers. \"They need a prime minister who hears them, and offers them hope that they can again afford to buy a home, a car, pay their bills, afford food, have a secure retirement, and god forbid even achieve their dreams if they work hard. They need a prime minister who will restore that hope, and I will be that prime minister.\" After opting out of running in the 2020 race citing his family life, Poilievre came into this campaign at full force, framing his race as a run for prime minister, and one that would champion \"personal freedom.\" His introductory campaign video promising to \"give you back control of your life\" has amassed 4.9 million views since it was posted in February. With a strong team of experienced Conservatives behind him, Poilievre outpaced the other leadership candidates when it came to membership sign-ups and fundraising, raking in millions more dollars, and from a larger donor pool than any of his opponents. The long-time Ottawa-area MP—he was first elected federally in 2004— has been connected to conservative politics from a young age. At 43 now, Poilievre has built a reputation on Parliament Hill as a bit of a firebrand, not hesitant to say what he thinks. While he was given the nickname \"skippy,\" a descriptor that may better fit now is \"scrappy\" as he's not one to back away from a policy debate or pull punches when it comes to calling out his opponents. Poilievre met his wife Anaida working in politics and the pair eloped in Portugal in late 2017, together they have two children, Valentina and Cruz. Anaida Poilievre, wife of Conservative Party leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre, touches his chin as they listen to speeches at the Conservative Party of Canada leadership vote, in Ottawa, on Saturday, Sept. 10, 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang During the leadership campaign it was not uncommon to see Anaida by his side, and Saturday evening was no different. Introducing her husband as Canada's next prime minister, she also took the opportunity to introduce herself, sharing some personal family history, in both official languages. Poilievre and his family currently live in Greely, a suburban-rural neighbourhood 30 minutes from Parliament Hill. Poilievre, who was born to a teenage mother in Calgary, was adopted by schoolteachers from Saskatchewan, went on to graduate from the University of Calgary with a degree in international relations, and a keen interest in conservative activism. Once Stephen Harper's Conservative government came to power in 2006, Poilievre held a series of parliamentary secretary and junior minister roles. He then became a key critic of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, from his seat in the Official Opposition benches. In this race, Poilievre attracted large crowds across the country, with supporters appearing to resonate with his affordability-focused and unapologetic, populist message of \"taking back control\" from \"gatekeepers.\" According to his campaign, Poilievre held 80 events across the country that 93,000 people RSVP'd to, ultimately signing up more than 300,000 members. A key messaging tool used by Poilievre—who rarely participated in interviews or answered journalists' questions throughout the race—were social media videos featuring him speaking directly into the camera in various scenarios. In the videos he'd fixate on one issue, offering his perspective on housing, or the price of food, for example, making a case for why the current government is failing and what he'd do differently. His platform included promises to get rid of the carbon tax, lift COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and fire the governor of the Bank of Canada. He said he would phase out “inflationary deficits” by culling spending and reversing Liberal policies and programs. Poilievre has also championed cryptocurrency, and supported the “Freedom Convoy,\" a pair of positions that were condemned by some of his opponents as well as members from other parties. A key moment for Poilievre's campaign was when Harper endorsed Poilievre. In a video released on Twitter, the former prime minister said Poilievre has made the “strongest case” for being able to bring in new party members and win the next general election. Harper didn't offer candidate endorsements in the preceding two leadership races that saw Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole take on the party's top job. While he took part in the first two official party debates, Poilievre came under fire when he decided to skip a third event organized by the party in the aftermath of Patrick Brown's disqualification. When Brown was removed from the race, his campaign quickly accused the Conservative Party of acting in Poilievre's favour. Brown claimed Poilievre's supporters were behind his ouster, something the party has ardently denied. The campaign began after O’Toole resigned in February following considerable infighting in the aftermath of his unsuccessful 2021 federal election campaign. Appearing via video message on Saturday, O'Toole said the party has to put Canadian unity first, because pandemic-exacerbated frustrations are eroding trust, and damaging democratic institutions. \"The Conservative Party needs to be compassionate, because Canadians need to be heard and need to be understood more than ever before. And the Conservative Party needs to be strong— not with the strength to overpower our rivals—but with the strength of character needed to carry those in need or those who are losing faith in our country,\" he said. The race—the party's third in the last six years— was largely seen as a 'battle for the soul of the party' and a result, the campaign has had no shortage of attacks as candidates pitched themselves—through rallies and on debate stages—as the best placed person to lead. The attacks throughout the race were largely exchanged between Charest and Poilievre. Charest suggested that his convoy-supporting opponent was unfit to lead , while Poilievre accused his rival of being a Liberal in blue clothing. As the race rolled to a close, prominent Conservatives have emphasized the need for the membership to come together once the winner is named, and focus on defeating the Liberals rather than post-leadership unity questions. \"This is Canadian political history. No other political party has had this many members and no other political party has had more than 400,000 Canadians vote in a leadership election. What it tells me as president is that the Conservative Party is growing. It tells me that there is a desire among Canadians for a change in government, and that changing government, in many ways starts tonight,\" said Conservative Party President Rob Batherson on Saturday night. Ahead of the results, Charest campaign co-chair Tasha Kheiriddin said that the most important thing regardless of who won, \"the most important thing\" is whoever the party elects, has to take the party forward in a united way. \"The biggest challenge is to make people feel welcome and to make them understand that they have a place at the table... It's going to be a case of also I think, letting go of some of the things that people are turned off by,\" she said. \"I'm watching for a sign that we're going to look for what unites us and what is in common as opposed to some of the things that have divided. Whoever becomes leader that's what they have to build on because otherwise we will never beat Justin Trudeau,\" said Kheiriddin. On this, Byrne and Kheiriddin agree. Byrne said she's confident members—new and old—will unite behind the new leader, and dismissed suggestions this campaign was any more divisive than previous races. \"The modern Conservative party is a party of coalition. It's a party of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, democratic reformers. And that coalition has changed,\" she said. Poilievre will be talking the helm of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition 10 days before the fall sitting of Parliament will begin. In an early indication of the fight ahead, long-time Liberal MP and cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc— attending Saturday's event, he said, to congratulate the winner—questioned Poilievre's sincerity. \"What we've seen in his leadership campaign is a series of reckless and irresponsible ideas that we don't think will improve the Canadian economy,” LeBlanc said. “Somebody who's telling people to buy Bitcoin, somebody who's calling childcare agreements 'slush funds,' doesn't feel like somebody who's serious about big issues around affordability, around the economy.” It's possible one of Poilievre's first acts as Opposition leader could be attending Queen Elizabeth II's funeral as part of the Canadian delegation. Once the political season does get underway, CTV Political Commentator Tom Mulcair is predicting some eventful question periods. \"This guy is not going to hold back. But at the same time, he knows that he's got to present a very straight face to Canadian voters… And I think that that's what Poilievre is going to have to work on,\" Mulcair said. \"We've been told nonstop that the party had big fractures in it. Now Poilievre gets to really play a good strong hand.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says federal health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos was right in saying there is 'still lots of work to do' before reaching a deal with the provinces for increased health-care funding, but that he's 'confident' that the two levels of government will get there. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sat down with CTV National News Chief News Anchor and Senior Editor Omar Sachedina for a year-end interview to reflect on the political shifts experienced in 2022, and to contemplate the challenges ahead in 2023. Here is a full transcript of the interview.

        "text": "While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday, Sept. 19 will be a federal holiday and a national day of mourning as Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral takes place in the U.K., Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan later clarified the designation only applies to federal government employees. The prime minister’s comments at a news conference Tuesday morning have prompted many to wonder whether they’ll have the day off next week, while the provinces are taking a piecemeal approach to whether schools and workplaces will be closed in their jurisdictions. Trudeau said Monday would be a “federal holiday.” It will apply to federal government employees, but not automatically to those working in federally-regulated industries — such as banks, airlines, post offices, and Crown corporations, Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan subsequently tweeted. “Federally regulated employers are welcome to follow suit, but they are not required to do so,” O’Regan wrote. A news release clarified that statutory holidays can only be granted through legislation, and that provinces and territories will determine how the Day of Mourning will be observed in their regions. Quebec Premier Francois Legault told reporters Tuesday the day of the Queen’s funeral will be one of commemoration, but not a holiday in the province. He added he’ll continue campaigning before Quebecers head to the polls Oct. 3. Ontario Premier Doug Ford also said there’ll be no holiday in his province, opting instead for a provincial “Day of Mourning,” with a moment of silence at 1 p.m. “This will give all Ontarians an opportunity to reflect on the remarkable life of Queen Elizabeth II and her unrelenting commitment to service and duty,” he wrote in a statement. “It also allows students to be in school learning about the many contributions the Queen made to the people of Ontario, Canada, and the entire Commonwealth, as well as the accession of King Charles III.” On the East Coast , Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick will have a one-time holiday on Monday. B.C. Premier John Horgan stated that the province will be closing public schools , post-secondary institutions and most Crown corporations on Monday to honour Queen Elizabeth II. “Our government will follow the lead of the federal government and join with other provinces in observing the national day of mourning to mark the Queen’s funeral,” he stated in a press release. “We encourage private-sector employers to find a way to recognize or reflect on the day in a way that is appropriate for their employees.” Saskatchewan has confirmed that although its government proclaiming Sept. 19 a day in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, it will not be designating Monday a public statutory holiday for the province. Manitoba will be closing non-essential government services and offices for the day on Monday, but schools and child-care facilities will remain open and function as usual. “I encourage all Manitobans to take a moment to reflect on Her late Majesty’s special relationship with our province and her countless contributions to our country and the entire Commonwealth,” Premier Heather Stefanson said in a press release Tuesday. “Queen Elizabeth II had a remarkable reign and an unwavering commitment to service and duty. May she rest in peace.” The release added that schools are encouraged to observe a moment of silence on Monday, and that a 21-gun salute will occur on the south grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building at the same time as the memorial service in Ottawa. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney's office said Monday will be a day of mourning in the province, but will not be a holiday. Businesses and schools will stay open on Sept. 19. Yukon says it will join the federal government and other provinces observing a national day of mourning on the day of the Queen's funeral with a one-time holiday for public-sector employees. Public schools and other public-facing services will be closed. The Northwest Territories is not marking the day with a holiday, while the government of Nunavut has not yet said whether the day will be a holiday for its residents. “We will be working with the provinces and the territories to try and see that we’re aligned on this,” Trudeau said at a news conference in New Brunswick Tuesday. “There are still a few details to be worked out, but declaring an opportunity for Canadians to mourn on Monday is going to be important.” “So for our part, we will be letting federal employees know that Monday will be a day of mourning,” he added. Meanwhile the Canadian Federation of Independent Business is asking the provinces not to make Monday a statutory holiday, because it would be “deeply unfair for small businesses” under such short notice. “Small businesses are already struggling with labour shortages and requiring them to close or pay time and a half to their employees with no notice would be extremely costly or result in a day’s lost productivity,” wrote CFIB president Dan Kelly in a release issued Tuesday. CTVNews.ca has asked the Privy Council Office whether Sept. 19 will be a recurring federal holiday, or whether it’ll be a one-off for the Queen’s state funeral and other commemorative events, and has not yet received a response. Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon are both set to travel to the U.K. for the funeral, but the prime minister said details of who will be joining them are still being sorted. He said the federal government has been in discussions with the government of the United Kingdom and Opposition leaders’ offices to decide who will make up the delegation of Canadian officials. Other Commonwealth countries have already announced holidays to commemorate the Queen’s passing: the United Kingdom will have a bank holiday Monday for the funeral, marking the final day of the 10 days of mourning, and Australia and New Zealand will have public holidays on Sept. 22 and 26 respectively. Canada is still in the midst of its official mourning period for the country’s longest-reigning monarch, with several commemorative events planned in Ottawa following the funeral on Monday. There will be an invite-only commemorative service at Christ Church Cathedral, with government officials, dignitaries and other guests, as well as a parade with the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP, a 96-gun salute, and a CF-18 fighter jet fly-by. Members of Parliament will return to Ottawa ahead of schedule for a \"special session\" to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, on Thursday, Sept. 15. This special House of Commons recall comes ahead of the opening of the fall sitting, which has been delayed by one day, to Sept. 20 to accommodate the funeral and Canadian commemorations taking place. With files from CTVNews.ca’s Tom Yun and Rachel Aiello and The Canadian Press The federal government's fall economic update makes it clear that while the deficit is declining, the risk that Canada enters into a recession is rising.

Pierre Poilievre is the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, securing victory on the first ballot after a record-setting and divisive leadership campaign. After a seven-month campaign, the long-time MP and former cabinet minister from Ontario won the election decisively, securing 22,993 of the just under 33,800 electoral points up for grabs. Poilievre secured support across the country, coming in as members' first choice in almost every riding. “Tonight begins the journey to replace an old government that costs you more and delivers you less, with a new government that puts you first, your paycheck, your retirement, your home, your country,” Poilievre said in his first speech as leader on Saturday evening from the Ottawa convention centre floor where the leadership announcement was held. Receiving 68.15 per cent of the vote, Poilievre far outpaced his progressive Conservative rival and runner up Jean Charest's 16.07 per cent of the vote. Social conservative and MP Leslyn Lewis placed third, with 9.69 per cent of the vote. Former Ontario MPP Roman Baber placed fourth, with 5.03 per cent of the vote, and mayor-turned-MP Scott Aitchison finished last with 1.06 per cent of the vote. The unveiling of results of the mail-in ballot election was done in a more pared-down way than initially planned, on account for the country being in an official mourning period given the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A moment of silence and tribute was held before Poilievre was named the winner. While the party aimed to hold a subdued event, pulling the plug on confetti cannons, the crowd of approximately 1,000 erupted into cheers and some chants of \"freedom,\" when the results were announced. After Poilievre was cheered up onto the stage, he started his remarks with a message of condolence. \"I feel a small catch in my throat when I utter the words that no leader has stated in this country for over seven decades, God Save the King,\" he said. One of the main questions heading into this evening was whether Poilievre was able to take it on the first ballot, a feat last achieved by former prime minister Stephen Harper in 2004. Ahead of the results, Charest’s camp indicated they still felt they had a path to victory, though touting the Poilievre's campaign’s statistics, top adviser Jenni Byrne said they were feeling \"pretty good.” The results were calculated in points , with up to 100 points allocated to each of the 338 ridings. Ultimately there were 33,737 points up for grabs after the verification process was complete, making the threshold needed to win 50 per cent plus one: 16,869, a metric Poilievre considerably exceeded. In an attempt to avoid the considerable delays seen in the party's 2020 race due to a mechanical issue that resulted in thousands of ballots being damaged upon opening, result tabulations began on Saturday. Still, the results were delayed approximately half an hour from what the party had initially planned. In his speech—his first opportunity to signal the direction the party is heading and set the tone for his tenure— Poilievre took the opportunity to outline some of his main commitments, and made a point of thanking each one of his opponents' for their contributions to the party, and the country. \"To supporters of all of these fine candidates I open up my arms to you. Now, today, we are one party serving one country,\" he said. Reacting to the results, Charest thanked his supporters and said he was proud of the campaign they ran, but signalled that Poilievre should be granted a \"clean slate\" opportunity to unite the party. \"We still have a critical role to play in shaping our forward-looking policy agenda and attracting new voters to the Conservative Party. I will have more to say tomorrow,\" he tweeted. Despite his efforts to extend an olive branch to the progressives in the party, don't expect Poilievre to take a more moderate approach post-campaign. “What you see is what you get,” said Byrne. \"What you should expect to hear from Pierre is exactly what he's talking about. But it's going to be predominantly on the issues that Canadians care about, and right now the economy is the number one issue.\" Poilievre made the pitch Saturday night for a government that offers Canadians hope. \"There are people in this country who are just hanging on by a thread... They don't need a government to run their lives, they need a government that can run a passport office,\" Poilievre said to cheers. \"They need a prime minister who hears them, and offers them hope that they can again afford to buy a home, a car, pay their bills, afford food, have a secure retirement, and god forbid even achieve their dreams if they work hard. They need a prime minister who will restore that hope, and I will be that prime minister.\" After opting out of running in the 2020 race citing his family life, Poilievre came into this campaign at full force, framing his race as a run for prime minister, and one that would champion \"personal freedom.\" His introductory campaign video promising to \"give you back control of your life\" has amassed 4.9 million views since it was posted in February. With a strong team of experienced Conservatives behind him, Poilievre outpaced the other leadership candidates when it came to membership sign-ups and fundraising, raking in millions more dollars, and from a larger donor pool than any of his opponents. The long-time Ottawa-area MP—he was first elected federally in 2004— has been connected to conservative politics from a young age. At 43 now, Poilievre has built a reputation on Parliament Hill as a bit of a firebrand, not hesitant to say what he thinks. While he was given the nickname \"skippy,\" a descriptor that may better fit now is \"scrappy\" as he's not one to back away from a policy debate or pull punches when it comes to calling out his opponents. Poilievre met his wife Anaida working in politics and the pair eloped in Portugal in late 2017, together they have two children, Valentina and Cruz. Anaida Poilievre, wife of Conservative Party leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre, touches his chin as they listen to speeches at the Conservative Party of Canada leadership vote, in Ottawa, on Saturday, Sept. 10, 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang During the leadership campaign it was not uncommon to see Anaida by his side, and Saturday evening was no different. Introducing her husband as Canada's next prime minister, she also took the opportunity to introduce herself, sharing some personal family history, in both official languages. Poilievre and his family currently live in Greely, a suburban-rural neighbourhood 30 minutes from Parliament Hill. Poilievre, who was born to a teenage mother in Calgary, was adopted by schoolteachers from Saskatchewan, went on to graduate from the University of Calgary with a degree in international relations, and a keen interest in conservative activism. Once Stephen Harper's Conservative government came to power in 2006, Poilievre held a series of parliamentary secretary and junior minister roles. He then became a key critic of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, from his seat in the Official Opposition benches. In this race, Poilievre attracted large crowds across the country, with supporters appearing to resonate with his affordability-focused and unapologetic, populist message of \"taking back control\" from \"gatekeepers.\" According to his campaign, Poilievre held 80 events across the country that 93,000 people RSVP'd to, ultimately signing up more than 300,000 members. A key messaging tool used by Poilievre—who rarely participated in interviews or answered journalists' questions throughout the race—were social media videos featuring him speaking directly into the camera in various scenarios. In the videos he'd fixate on one issue, offering his perspective on housing, or the price of food, for example, making a case for why the current government is failing and what he'd do differently. His platform included promises to get rid of the carbon tax, lift COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and fire the governor of the Bank of Canada. He said he would phase out “inflationary deficits” by culling spending and reversing Liberal policies and programs. Poilievre has also championed cryptocurrency, and supported the “Freedom Convoy,\" a pair of positions that were condemned by some of his opponents as well as members from other parties. A key moment for Poilievre's campaign was when Harper endorsed Poilievre. In a video released on Twitter, the former prime minister said Poilievre has made the “strongest case” for being able to bring in new party members and win the next general election. Harper didn't offer candidate endorsements in the preceding two leadership races that saw Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole take on the party's top job. While he took part in the first two official party debates, Poilievre came under fire when he decided to skip a third event organized by the party in the aftermath of Patrick Brown's disqualification. When Brown was removed from the race, his campaign quickly accused the Conservative Party of acting in Poilievre's favour. Brown claimed Poilievre's supporters were behind his ouster, something the party has ardently denied. The campaign began after O’Toole resigned in February following considerable infighting in the aftermath of his unsuccessful 2021 federal election campaign. Appearing via video message on Saturday, O'Toole said the party has to put Canadian unity first, because pandemic-exacerbated frustrations are eroding trust, and damaging democratic institutions. \"The Conservative Party needs to be compassionate, because Canadians need to be heard and need to be understood more than ever before. And the Conservative Party needs to be strong— not with the strength to overpower our rivals—but with the strength of character needed to carry those in need or those who are losing faith in our country,\" he said. The race—the party's third in the last six years— was largely seen as a 'battle for the soul of the party' and a result, the campaign has had no shortage of attacks as candidates pitched themselves—through rallies and on debate stages—as the best placed person to lead. The attacks throughout the race were largely exchanged between Charest and Poilievre. Charest suggested that his convoy-supporting opponent was unfit to lead , while Poilievre accused his rival of being a Liberal in blue clothing. As the race rolled to a close, prominent Conservatives have emphasized the need for the membership to come together once the winner is named, and focus on defeating the Liberals rather than post-leadership unity questions. \"This is Canadian political history. No other political party has had this many members and no other political party has had more than 400,000 Canadians vote in a leadership election. What it tells me as president is that the Conservative Party is growing. It tells me that there is a desire among Canadians for a change in government, and that changing government, in many ways starts tonight,\" said Conservative Party President Rob Batherson on Saturday night. Ahead of the results, Charest campaign co-chair Tasha Kheiriddin said that the most important thing regardless of who won, \"the most important thing\" is whoever the party elects, has to take the party forward in a united way. \"The biggest challenge is to make people feel welcome and to make them understand that they have a place at the table... It's going to be a case of also I think, letting go of some of the things that people are turned off by,\" she said. \"I'm watching for a sign that we're going to look for what unites us and what is in common as opposed to some of the things that have divided. Whoever becomes leader that's what they have to build on because otherwise we will never beat Justin Trudeau,\" said Kheiriddin. On this, Byrne and Kheiriddin agree. Byrne said she's confident members—new and old—will unite behind the new leader, and dismissed suggestions this campaign was any more divisive than previous races. \"The modern Conservative party is a party of coalition. It's a party of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, democratic reformers. And that coalition has changed,\" she said. Poilievre will be talking the helm of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition 10 days before the fall sitting of Parliament will begin. In an early indication of the fight ahead, long-time Liberal MP and cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc— attending Saturday's event, he said, to congratulate the winner—questioned Poilievre's sincerity. \"What we've seen in his leadership campaign is a series of reckless and irresponsible ideas that we don't think will improve the Canadian economy,” LeBlanc said. “Somebody who's telling people to buy Bitcoin, somebody who's calling childcare agreements 'slush funds,' doesn't feel like somebody who's serious about big issues around affordability, around the economy.” It's possible one of Poilievre's first acts as Opposition leader could be attending Queen Elizabeth II's funeral as part of the Canadian delegation. Once the political season does get underway, CTV Political Commentator Tom Mulcair is predicting some eventful question periods. \"This guy is not going to hold back. But at the same time, he knows that he's got to present a very straight face to Canadian voters… And I think that that's what Poilievre is going to have to work on,\" Mulcair said. \"We've been told nonstop that the party had big fractures in it. Now Poilievre gets to really play a good strong hand.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says federal health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos was right in saying there is 'still lots of work to do' before reaching a deal with the provinces for increased health-care funding, but that he's 'confident' that the two levels of government will get there.

Social Sharing Patron also ordered by Sask. judge not to post about Jewish people for 1 year after sentence Dan Zakreski · CBC News · Posted: Oct 20, 2022 5:54 PM EDT | Last Updated: October 20, 2022 A still from a video featuring Travis Patron, leader of the Canadian Nationalist Party, which became the subject of an RCMP investigation in 2019. (Nationalist.ca) Warning: This story contains offensive language. A Court of King's Bench judge in Estevan, Sask., has sentenced former Canadian Nationalist Party leader Travis Patron to one year in jail for willfully promoting hatred against Jewish people. He must also refrain from posting about Jewish people for a year after his sentence ends, Justice Neil Robertson's Thursday sentencing decision said. Patron, who founded the now-defunct federal party that promoted anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ views in 2019, was found guilty at trial earlier this month after a jury deliberated for about an hour. Thursday's sentencing ends a saga that began when RCMP began an investigation into an online video featuring Patron in 2019. Sask. former leader of Canadian Nationalist Party found guilty of hate speech against Jewish people The video shows Patron, who is from Redvers, Sask., denouncing what he described as \"the parasitic tribe\" who he claimed control the media and Canada's central bank. \"What we need to do, perhaps more than anything, is remove these people once and for all from our country,\" Patron said in the video, speaking directly to the camera. He was charged with wilfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group in February 2021. Jaime Kirzner-Roberts, policy director at the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said it's troubling that it took three years from the start of the investigation to resolve the case. \"What is really concerning about this case is how long it took, from that first moment when I saw Patron's material several years ago and first reached out to RCMP in Saskatchewan with our concerns, until today,\" she said Thursday. Kirzner-Roberts said the Canadian Jewish human rights organization is pleased with the judge's sentence. Outside court on Thursday, Crown prosecutor Ryan Snyder said it's important to take individuals to task for online postings like Patron's. \"We're only dealing with words but it does have an impact on people,\" he said. Patron will get credit for time served in custody. He has a little more than five months remaining on his sentence. He has been in custody since March 2021, after an unrelated disturbance at the legion hall in Redvers, Sask. Earlier this year, another jury found Patron guilty of assaulting two women in Regina in November 2019. In August, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, because he received 1.5 days of time served credit for each of the 390 days he spent in custody, the sentence was considered served.

Justin Tang/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account Voters in Ontario went to the polls Monday to elect new municipal governments and school boards for the next four years. There were open races for the mayor’s chair in several of Ontario’s largest cities, including the nation’s capital, with long-time incumbents not standing for re-election. Two of these races featured former leaders of Ontario political parties who resigned from their posts in June after their parties were defeated by Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives in the provincial election. Here is a look at early results of some of the major mayoral races across the province. John Tory wins third term as mayor in Toronto municipal election Ottawa The mayor’s chair in Canada’s capital was left open with the departure of Jim Watson, who chose not to run for re-election after serving in the role since 2010. (The last municipal election without an incumbent in Ontario’s second-largest city was 2000.) After a hard-fought campaign, entrepreneur and former journalist Mark Sutcliffe, who talked up fiscal restraint and criticized bike lanes, handily defeated two-term councillor Catherine McKenney, who had won endorsements from a long list of progressives. In early returns, Mr. Sutcliffe had won 51 per cent of the vote, with Mx. McKenney at 38 per cent. The two front-runners were close in the polls throughout the race, which focused on housing issues and city spending plans. The campaign played out at the same time as a public inquiry into the use of the Emergencies Act amid the convoy protests in Ottawa last winter. Bob Chiarelli, past mayor and former Ottawa MPP, was a distant third. Brampton Incumbent Patrick Brown secured a second term as mayor of the Peel city with a large victory, despite a turbulent first term riddled with controversies, including allegations of misappropriating funds and an audit that found an “unfair advantage” was given to select companies during a study to bring a university to Brampton. It was a high-profile race with challenger Nikki Kaur, a city planning director, who gained the support of former mayor Linda Jeffrey and former councillors. She was also supported by conservative strategist Nick Kouvalis, who has served as an adviser to Premier Doug Ford. Ms. Kaur finished in second place with about 25 per cent of the vote. Mr. Brown had intended to run for the leadership of the federal Conservative Party but was disqualified from the race as the party found a worker was being paid for by a corporation, which is illegal under federal election laws. Two weeks after his removal from the race, Mr. Brown said he would run for re-election in Brampton. In the neighbouring Peel city of Mississauga, Bonnie Crombie handily won a third term as mayor. Hamilton Long-time provincial NDP leader Andrea Horwath will succeed outgoing mayor Fred Eisenberger and become the first woman elected as mayor of the southern Ontario city. Ms. Horwath, who resigned her provincial post in August to run for mayor of her hometown, defeated former Hamilton Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Keanin Loomis in a tight race, separated by roughly one per cent of the vote. Bob Bratina, mayor of Hamilton from 2010 to 2014 and a Liberal MP representing Hamilton East-Stoney Creek from 2015 until 2021 finished a distant third. Ms. Horwath resigned as leader of the Ontario NDP, which she steered since 2009, after her party maintained Official Opposition status in the June election, but lost nine seats. Before entering provincial politics, Ms. Horwath served on Hamilton City Council for seven years. Vaughan Past Ontario Liberal leader Steven Del Duca will make the jump to municipal politics, eking out a victory over five-term councillor Sandra Yeung Racco by less than 1,000 votes in Vaughan’s open mayoral race. After serving as transportation minister in Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government, Mr. Del Duca lost races in the riding of Vaughan-Woodbridge in two consecutive provincial elections, including as leader this June, prompting him to resign from his post. Outgoing mayor and former Liberal MP Maurizio Bevilacqua, who had led the city north of Toronto since 2010, had endorsed Mr. Del Duca in the race. Thunder Bay Ken Boshcoff, who previously served as mayor from 1997 to 2003 and subsequently served two terms as MP for the region, won the election in the northern Ontario community. Mr. Boshcoff will need to navigate the challenges plaguing Thunder Bay’s police service, which has faced many human-rights complaints, misconduct allegations and external investigations, some pertaining to its treatment of the city’s large Indigenous community. Thunder Bay Police Chief Sylvie Hauth was suspended in June and the board is currently being overseen by a provincial administrator. There were five candidates in the race, including Gary Mack, who placed second, and Peng You, who just completed a term as an at-large city councillor and placed third. Outgoing mayor Bill Mauro held the job for one term after representing the city as a Liberal MPP from 2003 to 2018.",

        "text": "Read full article CBC Cardy resigns as N.B. education minister, sends scorching letter to premier CBC October 13, 2022 at 11:41 a.m. · 5 min read Link Copied Dominic Cardy will stay on as an MLA after resigning from Premier Blaine Higgs's cabinet. (CBC - image credit) Dominic Cardy has resigned as New Brunswick's minister of education and early childhood development. Cardy announced in a tweet that he was quitting the cabinet of Premier Blaine Higgs but would stay on as a Progressive Conservative MLA for Fredericton West-Hanwell. In a scorching resignation letter to Higgs, Cardy slammed the premier's leadership style, saying \"change requires care, not a wrecking ball\" and some reforms to French second-language education \"will stall because of your micromanagement.\" \"You cannot change deadlines on large systems based on your emotional state, without undermining the quality of the work, or the morale of your team,\" the letter said. ADVERTISEMENT \"Government is not the same as building oil tankers,\" Cardy wrote, apparently referring to the premier's previous career with Irving Oil. He also accuses Higgs of \"choosing to yell 'data my ass' at a senior civil servant\" because he didn't like what the department's numbers showed. Shane Fowler/CBC \"That was the end of your political project in my eyes: If you reject evidence because you dislike it then you don't believe in evidence,\" he wrote. Cardy also said Higgs's abolition of partly elected regional health authority boards represented \"a steady consolidation of power in your hands\" and that he was trying to delay or undermine reconciliation between language communities and with Indigenous people. Higgs told reporters he was \"disappointed\" with the letter and what he calls its \"hurtful\" comments. But he confirmed he did say \"data my ass\" when Cardy and his department presented him with what he considered \"irrelevant\" numbers on French second-language education. ADVERTISEMENT \"Yes, I did,\" he said. \"The numbers did not reflect any real value in information we were trying to understand: 'are we getting better?'\" He disputed that he made decisions based on emotion. The premier said he met with Cardy Thursday morning and told him he was going to be shuffled out of cabinet because of a lack of progress in improving the education system. Jacques Poitras/CBC At that point, Cardy produced the resignation letter. The fact it was already drafted suggested it was \"part of an orchestrated plan,\" Higgs said. Cardy did not respond to a request for an interview. The resignation letter said Higgs has a plan to \"abolish\" French immersion by September 2023, something that was recommended by an independent review of the program earlier this year. Cardy said getting rid of the program was not in the government's election platform or throne speech and has not been approved by the PC cabinet or caucus. ADVERTISEMENT Eliminating it \"would place huge stress on the education system and damage the education of our province's anglophone young people,\" he wrote. Higgs confirmed he intends to go ahead with that next fall. He said given Cardy's letter, which he called \"quite a laundry list\" of criticisms, he will likely ask the PC caucus to expel him, which would leave him sitting as an independent MLA. The next caucus meeting will happen soon, Higgs said. Shane Fowler/CBC \"I won't be dragging this out. I feel like there's only one decision to make and my recommendation will be to kick him out of caucus.\" Higgs made the comments after shuffling his cabinet Thursday afternoon. He appointed Carleton MLA Bill Hogan to replace Cardy as education minister. Former People's Alliance leader Kris Austin, who moved to the PCs in March, takes over Hogan's role as public safety minister. ADVERTISEMENT Jill Green becomes minister of Service New Brunswick and Housing, replacing Mary Wilson, who was dropped from cabinet. Jeff Carr replaced Green as transportation and infrastructure minister, while Réjean Savoie, elected in a June byelection, becomes minister for the Regional Development Corporation. Liberal Leader Susan Holt said the critique in Cardy's letter \"seems to reflect what we've been hearing from others and reflects some of the concerns we've had about this government and their approach to leadership.\" Cardy, the former leader of the New Brunswick NDP, joined the PCs in 2017 as an adviser to Higgs and ran for the Tories in the 2018 election. At the time Cardy switched parties, Higgs said they were \"directly aligned on so many issues\" but acknowledged they would not see eye-to-eye on everything. Jacques Poitras/CBC \"I want people who are going to bring ideas, and are going to bring action, into the group,\" Higgs said. \"We can work through any minor issues that come up, because I do it every day with everyone.\" In 2020, Cardy failed to win enough support from the PC caucus to get a bill passed that would have eliminated philosophical and religious exemptions from the mandatory vaccination policy for school children. And last year, he criticised the government's ban on provincial officials delivering Indigenous land acknowledgements at public events, saying it \"added an unnecessary conflict that is creating confusion and justifiable anger toward our government.\" Cardy has also been a vocal supporter of Centre Ice Canadians, a group of moderate conservatives who have criticized federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. The six chiefs of the Wolastoqey Nation in New Brunswick issued a statement Thursday calling on other PC ministers to join Cardy in resigning. \"It is more evident than ever that your leader is not operating within the fundamental principles of good governance, nor the aims and principles of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick,\" the statement said. \"Stop standing by and allowing a single person to conduct such harmful practices. Indigenous people, and New Brunswickers, are watching closely and applauding the winds of change.\" DOCUMENT | Read the full text of Dominic Cardy's resignation letter:",

May, the party's first elected MP, led the party between 2006 and 2019 Christian Paas-Lang · CBC News · Posted: Nov 19, 2022 11:15 AM EST | Last Updated: November 21, 2022 Elizabeth May and co-leadership candidate Jonathan Pedneault arrive on stage as May is elected the new leader of the Green Party in Ottawa on Saturday, November 19, 2022. (Patrick Doyle/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Elizabeth May will once more lead the Green Party of Canada, along with Jonathan Pedneault, after her victory in the party's leadership race on Saturday. May and Pedneault have promised to helm the party under a co-leadership model, which will require an amendment to the party's constitution. For now, Pedneault will serve as deputy leader, according to the joint ticket's platform. \"It's difficult to put into words what it means to take the stage as the next leader of the Green Party of Canada,\" May said. She said it was a bit of \"déjà vu,\" but Pedneault's presence was a major difference. May acknowledged that there was a desire in the party for change, and she hoped that the co-leadership with Pedneault, 32, would combine experience and youth. Pedneault, who has not held elected office, has worked as a journalist and an activist, including with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Just over 8,000 people voted in the leadership election, representing a turnout of about 36 per cent of the 22,000 eligible to cast ballots. From a 4-day work week to immigration control, Green leadership candidates make their final policy pitches Green leadership candidates tout plans to revitalize party in debate That represents a substantial decline from the 2020 race won by Annamie Paul, in which almost 24,000 people voted, with a turnout of 69 per cent. May defeated another joint ticket, made up of Anna Keenan and Chad Walcott, and two individual candidates, Sarah Gabrielle Baron and Simon Gnocchini-Messier. May, 68, led the party from 2006 to 2019, breaking through as its first elected MP in 2011, and expanding the party's holdings to three seats in 2019 and more than one million votes. But the Greens suffered in the 2021 election, earning just under 400,000 votes. Pedneault and May hold a press conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Sept. 29. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) May struck a positive tone in the leadership race, inviting the other candidates up to the stage for her speech. \"We're a team,\" she said. May also made the case for the co-leader model, but noted that members would have the final say. Interim leader Amita Kuttner, meanwhile, expressed some uncertainty about how a potential shift to the co-leader model would actually be implemented. Unofficial co-leader acknowledges party difficulties The Green Party has been embroiled in internal disputes and fought the 2021 election facing severe fundraising challenges. The party continues to face financial struggles and has had to scramble after the resignation of the former party president, Lorraine Rekmans. It has been reeling since acrimonious divisions over former leader Annamie Paul, who described her time as leader as \"the worst period in my life\" in many respects. Some party members had been critical of Paul's leadership style and blamed her for MP Jenica Atwin's defection to the Liberals earlier that year. At the time, Paul said accusations against her were driven by racism and sexism. Exclusive Green Party leadership hopeful's expulsion was flawed, says internal party report Co-leader Pedneault also spoke after the announcement was made. He acknowledged the difficulties the party faces but argued that the Greens had a path to growth. \"The odds do appear to be against us,\" Pedneault said. But \"Canada is a place where small can mean mighty, where small can be smart and overtake the powerful interests,\" he said. WATCH | May ran as part of a 2-person team: Elizabeth May back at helm of Green Party 2 years ago Duration 2:01 Elizabeth May will once again be at the helm of the Green Party of Canada under a co-leadership model with Jonathan Pedneault. But her return to the leadership role comes as the party searches for relevance and a path forward. \"We're the party for the families that want to spend more time with their loved ones. We're the party for those that think billionaires should not exist. We're the party for those that believe strongly that this planet needs protecting.\" May also sketched out a portrait of the Greens as \"the only relevant party\" in a world fighting climate change — and as one that could offer a positive message to Canadians. \"We are going to be a party that earns the trust and faith of Canadians and before the next election gives Canadians an option that they can vote for with enthusiasm, instead of once again going to the polls and holding their nose and voting for someone they don't particularly like in hopes of keeping someone else out,\" May said. Green MP Mike Morrice 'disappointed by party infighting' but has no plans to walk She urged those who may have left the party, or simply let memberships lapse, to rejoin the Greens and help stabilize it. \"We're rebuilding the party and it is a team effort — everybody on board.\" May said one of her first actions would be to bring the various parts of the party together at a retreat to help build trust and cohesion within the party.

Neighbours say Villi had a history of erratic behaviour and conflict with the building’s condo board. Social Sharing A 73-year-old man who fatally shot five people at an upscale condo tower north of Toronto in Vaughan, Ont., used a semi-automatic handgun and victims were found on several different floors of the building, the province's police watchdog said Monday. At a news conference Monday afternoon at York Regional Police headquarters in Aurora, Ont., Chief Jim MacSween identified the shooter as Francesco Villi . Villi was shot and killed on the third floor, MacSween said. He said the officer who shot Villi is a 24-year-veteran of York Regional Police and \"he very likely saved lives by his actions last night.\" Meanwhile, MacSween said police could not yet identify the victims of the shooting. He said three men and two women — all residents in the condo building — were killed, and that three of those people were members of the condo board. A 66-year-old woman was also shot and remained in hospital Monday. Board members John Di Nino, who is also the president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Canada, and Tony Cutrone were not injured. Di Nino's wife, Doreen, was injured in the shooting but is expected to live. Di Nino was inside his residence when his wife was shot, according to his spokesperson. He issued a statement saying it's a \"very difficult time for my family\" and said he won't comment further. Cutrone, who does not live in the building, said the shooting is \"unreal\" and hard to fathom. \"On the one hand, I'm literally lucky to be alive. On the other hand, I was just communicating with these people 24 hours ago, and now not. It's hard to hear the words that they were killed,\" he said. \"I'm still in shock.

Three of them were on the condominium board. MacSween said the motive for the shooting remains under investigation. The 73-year-old suspect was killed during an interaction with police. Officers found a 'horrific scene' Officers were initially called to the building at 7:20 p.m. ET Sunday in response to a shooting in progress. The chief said officers arrived at the scene within three minutes and 21 seconds of the initial call. They arrived to find a \"horrific scene\" with five victims shot in three separate units, MacSween said, adding that detectives are working diligently to find answers \"in this horrible incident.\" \"We are truly shocked and sorry that such an incident took place in our region,\" he said. \"We will do anything we can to support the loved ones and anyone else impacted by this heartbreaking incident.\" \"The motive for the shooting remains part of this very complicated and very fluid investigation, which is still ongoing at this time,\" he said. Vaughan condo shooting: What we know about alleged gunman Francesco Villi A spokesperson for the Special Investigations Unit, which looks into any incident during which someone is killed or badly injured when police are present, said the alleged shooter lived in the building. SIU spokesperson Kristy Denette told reporters the man was killed during an interaction with police in a hallway and that a gun was recovered. Denette could not say whether the firearm was obtained legally. According to Denette, the alleged gunman was pronounced dead at the scene around 8 p.m. ET. A post-mortem exam is scheduled for Tuesday. MacSween said Sunday that it will take some time to determine the motive for the shooting and it wasn't immediately clear if there was any relation between the suspect and the victims. It's still unclear what drove the violence, but MacSween described it as a \"horrendous scene.\" Still processing what happened, resident says Building resident John Santoro said he opened the door of his unit Sunday night to see a pair of officers armed with rifles by the elevators. \"I did hear a commotion in the corridor,\" he said, adding that police were going floor to floor as they responded to the shooting. Santoro said the building was soon surrounded by police and emergency vehicles. \"The ambulances started rolling in ... I saw body bags coming out, being loaded into ambulances,\" he said. \"We knew it was something very big.\" Another building resident said he was still processing what happened. \"It's just shocking to be honest,\" said Jordan Bennett, who went out to get food Sunday night and returned to find a heavy police presence at the building. \"I feel pretty safe here so I'm pretty shocked to hear something like this happened.\" WATCH | Police chief says it will take time to determine a motive: Six dead after Vaughan, Ont., shooting, says police chief 2 years ago Duration 1:10 York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween says it will 'take us some time' to determine the motive for the shootings.

The main entrance to the building was taped off. Residents who were evacuated from the condo were able to return to the building early Monday morning. Speaking outside the building Monday, Vaughan Mayor Steven Del Duca offered condolences to the victims and their families and said flags at city hall would fly at half-mast in their memory. He said the entire community is reeling from the shooting. \"My heart goes out to the victims, their families, to the people that knew them.

(Ben Nelms/CBC) Social Sharing British Columbians have voted for change as new mayors and council members were elected across the province on Saturday. Housing, affordability, public safety and climate change all influenced the way voters cast their ballots this year, with B.C. facing inflation costs, a housing crisis and increasing rates of crime. In some large municipalities, such as Kamloops, Victoria, Prince George and Abbotsford, incumbents chose not to run. But in other cities, including the province's two biggest, incumbents running for re-election lost their jobs to candidates making big claims and running on campaigns of change. From housing to transit, here's what mayors and councils in B.C. can actually do Whether or not they can make good on those promises will be determined over the next four years — and it's safe to say residents will be watching closely to ensure the people they supported are keeping their word. Vancouver CBC's decision desk has projected Ken Sim as the next  mayor of Vancouver —  with about 50 per cent of the vote — with the other half of votes cast divided up among 14 other candidates. Ken Sim has been elected mayor of Vancouver, B.C., on Oct. 15, 2022. (Ben Nelms/CBC) Sim has promised to hire 100 police officers and 100 mental health nurses to tackle crime in B.C.'s largest city. He's also said those new hires — which would cost more than $20 million a year — would not result in an increase in property taxes. Ken Sim will be next mayor of Vancouver, CBC News projects Sim has also promised to accelerate permitting , in order to address a lack of housing. He also promises to double the number of co-op housing units and has been supportive of the sometimes-controversial Vancouver and Broadway plans, which aim to increase density, particularly around transit stations.

Incumbent Kennedy Stewart and Sim also faced off in 2018, when the former won by a mere 957 votes. In his concession speech, Stewart said it had been the \"honour of my life\" to serve as mayor of Vancouver.

WATCH | Brenda Locke delivers victory speech: Brenda Locke is the new mayor of Surrey, B.C., CBC News projects 3 years ago Duration 9:06 The former city councillor delivers a victory speech to her supporters. The mayoral race in Surrey was dominated by promises on transit and public infrastructure, as well as the city's ongoing transition from RCMP to a municipal police force, which Locke promised to reverse if elected. The city began its transition to the Surrey Police Service in 2018, when council, including Locke, unanimously approved a motion to replace the RCMP. Brenda Locke elected mayor of Surrey, CBC News projects The Surrey Police Union has raised concerns about cost estimates for halting the transition, and say Surrey police officers might not interested in working for the RCMP. Former B.C. attorney general Wally Oppal, who was chair of the Surrey police transition task force, says going back would be a complicated process; before the transition could be reversed, approval would be needed from the solicitor general. \"We have our work cut out for us,\" Locke told supporters on Saturday night.

Alto, a businesswoman with a background in law and science, won, with 56 per cent of the votes cast. A key issue in the race was how candidates would vote on a controversial plan to rezone all single-family properties to allow for multi-family add-ons, something the next set of city leaders will decide early in their term. In her election platform, Alto said she'd \"reconsider\" the plan as it currently exists and might revise it. B.C. Votes 2022: Election results for Victoria and Vancouver Island Interior A new mayor has been elected in Kelowna , where former Chamber of Commerce president Tom Dyas defeated incumbent Colin Basran, who was seeking a third term. Dyas ran a campaign focused on safety, pointing to the fact the city had one of the highest crime rates in Canada in 2021, at almost 12,000 cases per 100,000 people. Rather than hiring more police like other candidates in B.C. have suggested, he says his goal is to partner more existing officers with nurses, establish a community policing office at UBCO and create a citizens' patrol. B.C. Votes 2022: Election results for Kelowna, Kamloops and the B.C. Interior Kamloops also has a new mayor: nearly one-third of voters in Kamloops elected businessman Reid Hamer-Jackson, the only candidate with no prior municipal government experience. The race opened up earlier this year when incumbent Ken Christian announced he would not be seeking office again. Five people announced plans to replace him, including four former councillors: Ray Dhaliwal, Dieter Dudy, Sadie Hunter and Arjun Singh. Like most candidates, Hamer-Jackson made safety the top priority in his campaign, aiming to reduce harm reduction sites, citing people using drugs as the main reason for the city's safety concerns. Instead, his campaign promised more rehab and recovery facilities  — something he'd have to work with the provincial government to achieve. Further north, Simon Yu has been elected mayor of Prince George , making him the first person of colour to hold the position. Yu, an engineer, has promised to build emergency shelters to address the city's housing crisis. B.C.

Last month, Lahti told CBC that the underutilized piece of land near Moody Centre Station was an opportunity to consider both the climate crisis and the housing crisis in the community. \"What I'd like to have is affordable housing, seniors housing, family housing, jobs … so that people can live, work and play here, in Moody Centre,\" she said, adding that she wants infrastructure for alternative modes of transportation — such as ride-sharing, cycling, e-bikes and e-scooters — to make Port Moody less dependent on cars. TransLink, which operates Metro Vancouver's transit system, has said it supports any development that is transit-focused. B.C.

The purpose of the bill is to abolish the requirement for elected officials to swear an oath to the King before they can take their seats in the legislature. Right now, the oath to the monarch and to the Quebec people are both required.The three Parti Québécois (PQ) members who were elected in October have sworn only the oath to the people. Last Thursday, they were barred from taking their seats in the legislature. Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, centre, speaks to National Assembly sergeant-at-arms Véronique Michel who prevented the three Parti Québécois elected MNAs to enter the Salon Bleu to sit at the legislature in Quebec City, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022. (Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press) Jean-François Roberge, the minister responsible for democratic institutions, received a standing ovation from his colleagues as he introduced the bill. The bill tabled on Tuesday adds a section to the Constitution Act of 1867 exempting Quebec from the application of the section that requires the oath, Roberge said. Constitutional scholars are divided over whether Quebec has the power to unilaterally eliminate the oath requirement for its legislature or if changing that element of the Constitution requires the consent of all provinces and both houses of Parliament. PQ denied entry to Quebec's National Assembly after refusing to swear oath to King Québec Solidaire MNAs skip oath to King when sworn in, PQ to follow suit The MNAs for Québec Solidaire (QS), another sovereignist party, also refused to swear an oath to the King following October's election. Unlike the PQ, they changed their minds once the Speaker of the National Assembly ruled that there was no way to skip the oath and exercise their roles. Last week, QS tabled its own bill to make the oath to King Charles III optional. MNAs with QS and the PQ have dismissed the oath to the King as an archaic and colonial practice.

(Jason Franson/The Canadian Press) comments The Alberta Legislature has passed Premier Danielle Smith's controversial Sovereignty Act but not before first stripping out the provision that granted Smith's cabinet the power to bypass the legislature and rewrite laws as it saw fit. Smith's United Conservative caucus used its majority Wednesday night to pass an amendment to affirm that the Alberta Legislature still has the last word on lawmaking. It then moved directly to third and final reading on the bill and was approved around 1 a.m. MT Thursday, with government members standing to applaud after it cleared the final legislative hurdle.

Analysis The Alberta Sovereignty Act plays a dangerous game — for no rational reason Analysis Danielle Smith and the War Against Ottawa Measures Act Smith, speaking to the bill in third reading, said it is time to reset the relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government. \"It's not like Ottawa is a national government,\" said Smith. \"The way our country works is that we are a federation of sovereign, independent jurisdictions. They are one of those signatories to the Constitution and the rest of us, as signatories to the Constitution, have a right to exercise our sovereign powers in our own areas of jurisdiction.\" And, yes, for the record, if we form government, we will move to repeal this horrible, anti-democratic legislation.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ableg</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/yyc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#yyc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yeg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Yeg</a> &mdash; @RachelNotley The next election is set for May 29. The NDP voted against the amendment and the bill at all three readings, calling the legislation \"a hot mess express\" of unconstitutional presumptions and capricious provincial powers that offend the democratic process and put a chill on business investment. 'People don't like it' NDP deputy leader Sarah Hoffman said the UCP had to use its majority to choke off debate at three stages of debate on the bill in order to pass it just over a week after Smith introduced it to blunt growing opposition. \"People don't like it. That's why you're trying to ram it through here in the middle of the night,\" said Hoffman. \"This [bill] erodes democracy, it hurts our economy, and it is damaging to our national and our international reputation.\" Immediately after the vote, NDP Leader Rachel Notley tweeted that an NDP government would repeal the legislation, calling it 'anti-democratic.' (Chris Wattie/Reuters) The bill was introduced by Smith as centrepiece legislation to pursue a more confrontational approach with Trudeau's government on a range of issues deemed to be overreach in provincial areas of responsibility. The bill faced widespread criticism from the start for provisions granting Smith and her cabinet sweeping powers to rewrite legislation. Smith initially denied the bill had such authority, but as outrage mounted she announced over the weekend there would be changes. The amendment vote also passed along party lines. Before that vote, Notley told the house that while the bill effectively rolls back the power of cabinet to rewrite laws, an accompanying change narrowing the definition of federal harm was still worded too ambiguously to be effective. Debate cut off Notley also said egregious flaws remain in the bill given it says the legislature, not the courts, gets to decide what is and is not constitutional. And she said the bill still gives broad, undefined power to cabinet to direct municipalities, health regions, schools and city police forces to resist implementing federal laws. Notley said on top of that, Smith failed to consult treaty chiefs before introducing the bill, and said this will \"absolutely torch the critically important nation-to-nation relationship that should exist between this premier and the leaders of the treaties.\" The UCP passed motions at the final three stages of the bill to limit debate. Such measures are allowed to balance discussion with keeping the business of the house moving. Government House Leader Joseph Schow said Bill 1 received about 18 hours of debate, which he called a healthy total, particularly given the NDP said it wouldn't work to make the bill better. \"There comes a point when the same message gets repeated over and over,\" said Schow. First Nations chiefs call for Alberta, Sask., to scrap provincial rights bills Earlier Wednesday in Ottawa, First Nations chiefs from Alberta and Saskatchewan called for both provinces to scrap their respective provincial rights bills, calling them inherently undemocratic, unconstitutional and an infringement on Indigenous rights. Treaty 6 Chief Tony Alexis of Alberta's Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation said there has been no consultation or dialogue with First Nations around the Alberta bill and said it could set a harmful precedent. On Wednesday afternoon, Rick Wilson, Alberta's Indigenous relations minister, told reporters that while Bill 1 specifies that treaty rights are respected, he has heard the leaders' concerns and will work to address them. Wilson said the title of the bill itself — the Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act — is problematic. \"I've been on the phone, of course, with First Nations leaders across the province and a lot of the concerns are around just calling it the Sovereignty Act.

Police fatally shot Francesco Villi, 73, at scene, York Regional Police say CBC News · Posted: Dec 18, 2022 9:28 PM EST | Last Updated: December 20, 2022 Suspected gunman in Ont. condo shooting had history of conflict 2 years ago Duration 2:29 Police have identified 73-year-old Francesco Villi as the suspected gunman in the mass shooting at a condo building in Vaughan, Ont., that left five people dead. Neighbours say Villi had a history of erratic behaviour and conflict with the building’s condo board. Social Sharing A 73-year-old man who fatally shot five people at an upscale condo tower north of Toronto in Vaughan, Ont., used a semi-automatic handgun and victims were found on several different floors of the building, the province's police watchdog said Monday. At a news conference Monday afternoon at York Regional Police headquarters in Aurora, Ont., Chief Jim MacSween identified the shooter as Francesco Villi . Villi was shot and killed on the third floor, MacSween said. He said the officer who shot Villi is a 24-year-veteran of York Regional Police and \"he very likely saved lives by his actions last night.\" Meanwhile, MacSween said police could not yet identify the victims of the shooting. He said three men and two women — all residents in the condo building — were killed, and that three of those people were members of the condo board. A 66-year-old woman was also shot and remained in hospital Monday. Board members John Di Nino, who is also the president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Canada, and Tony Cutrone were not injured. Di Nino's wife, Doreen, was injured in the shooting but is expected to live. Di Nino was inside his residence when his wife was shot, according to his spokesperson. He issued a statement saying it's a \"very difficult time for my family\" and said he won't comment further. Cutrone, who does not live in the building, said the shooting is \"unreal\" and hard to fathom. \"On the one hand, I'm literally lucky to be alive. On the other hand, I was just communicating with these people 24 hours ago, and now not. It's hard to hear the words that they were killed,\" he said. \"I'm still in shock. I can't believe that's the way he decided to go out and I hate that he took people with him.\" WATCH: York police chief gives update on mass shooting at condo building: Three men, two women killed in Vaughan, Ont. mass shooting: YRP 2 years ago Duration 1:31 York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween told reporters Thursday that all five victims of the shooting lived in the condo building. Three of them were on the condominium board. MacSween said the motive for the shooting remains under investigation. The 73-year-old suspect was killed during an interaction with police. Officers found a 'horrific scene' Officers were initially called to the building at 7:20 p.m. ET Sunday in response to a shooting in progress. The chief said officers arrived at the scene within three minutes and 21 seconds of the initial call. They arrived to find a \"horrific scene\" with five victims shot in three separate units, MacSween said, adding that detectives are working diligently to find answers \"in this horrible incident.\" \"We are truly shocked and sorry that such an incident took place in our region,\" he said. \"We will do anything we can to support the loved ones and anyone else impacted by this heartbreaking incident.\" \"The motive for the shooting remains part of this very complicated and very fluid investigation, which is still ongoing at this time,\" he said. Vaughan condo shooting: What we know about alleged gunman Francesco Villi A spokesperson for the Special Investigations Unit, which looks into any incident during which someone is killed or badly injured when police are present, said the alleged shooter lived in the building. SIU spokesperson Kristy Denette told reporters the man was killed during an interaction with police in a hallway and that a gun was recovered. Denette could not say whether the firearm was obtained legally. According to Denette, the alleged gunman was pronounced dead at the scene around 8 p.m. ET. A post-mortem exam is scheduled for Tuesday. MacSween said Sunday that it will take some time to determine the motive for the shooting and it wasn't immediately clear if there was any relation between the suspect and the victims. It's still unclear what drove the violence, but MacSween described it as a \"horrendous scene.\" Still processing what happened, resident says Building resident John Santoro said he opened the door of his unit Sunday night to see a pair of officers armed with rifles by the elevators. \"I did hear a commotion in the corridor,\" he said, adding that police were going floor to floor as they responded to the shooting. Santoro said the building was soon surrounded by police and emergency vehicles. \"The ambulances started rolling in ... I saw body bags coming out, being loaded into ambulances,\" he said. \"We knew it was something very big.\" Another building resident said he was still processing what happened. \"It's just shocking to be honest,\" said Jordan Bennett, who went out to get food Sunday night and returned to find a heavy police presence at the building. \"I feel pretty safe here so I'm pretty shocked to hear something like this happened.\" WATCH | Police chief says it will take time to determine a motive: Six dead after Vaughan, Ont., shooting, says police chief 2 years ago Duration 1:10 York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween says it will 'take us some time' to determine the motive for the shootings. 'My heart goes out to the victims,' mayor says As day broke over the condo on Jane Street north of Rutherford Road, about 15 police cars and a large forensic identification truck remained outside the highrise. The main entrance to the building was taped off. Residents who were evacuated from the condo were able to return to the building early Monday morning. Speaking outside the building Monday, Vaughan Mayor Steven Del Duca offered condolences to the victims and their families and said flags at city hall would fly at half-mast in their memory. He said the entire community is reeling from the shooting. \"My heart goes out to the victims, their families, to the people that knew them. It's just unspeakable to imagine that has taken place here in our community,\" he said. Officers were called to the building at 7:20 p.m. ET on Sunday in response to a shooting in progress. (Arlyn McAdorey/The Canadian Press) Del Duca commended York police and other first responders for their efforts. \"And I want to thank all of our brave first responders for the work that they did yesterday to secure what I know must have been a very difficult situation.\" A 'terrible attack,' prime minister says Speaking with CBC's chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton on Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his \"thoughts go out to all the families, all the residents, people who are extraordinarily shook up, people who've lost loved ones in this terrible attack.\" In a statement posted to Twitter, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the shooting. \"All of Ontario is thinking of the victims of this senseless violence and the family and friends grieving their loss,\" he said. On Monday, Toronto Mayor John Tory called the shooting \"horrific.\" \"On behalf of all Toronto residents, I extend condolences to our neighbours in the City of Vaughan in the wake of last night's horrific shootings. We pray that the loved ones of those who have lost their lives are supported through this tragedy,\" he said on Twitter. \"We also send a message of gratitude and support to the first responders who arrived at the scene last night and who are continuing to investigate today.\" With files from The Canadian Press CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error",

Since the beginning of 2022, Canada has provided more than $5 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, including $1 billion in military aid. Anand's visit to Ukraine came as officials there said the country's interior minister had died in a helicopter crash near the capital that killed at least 14 other people, including other officials and three children. Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi oversaw Ukraine's police and emergency services. He is the most senior official to die since Russia invaded nearly 11 months ago. His death was the second calamity in four days to clobber Ukraine, after a Russian missile strike on an apartment building in Dnipro killed dozens of civilians.

There was no immediate word on whether Wednesday's crash was an accident or related to the war. No fighting has been reported recently in the Kyiv area. The apartment building strike and other attacks on civilians have helped stiffen international support for Ukraine as it battles to fend off the Kremlin's invasion. The winter has brought a slowdown in fighting, but military analysts say a new push by both sides is likely once the weather improves. Canada's latest contribution follows Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's announcement on Tuesday that his country plans to \"join\" the U.S. and Germany's efforts to train and arm Ukraine with advanced Patriot defence systems.

Government-funded compulsory boarding schools were part of a policy meant to assimilate children and destroy indigenous cultures and languages. The money will be paid to a non-profit trust independent of the government. But the settlement must still be finalised and approved by a court. The lawsuit was brought by 325 First Nations in 2012, and sought reparations for the abuse indigenous Canadians faced at the government boarding schools. Some 150,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit children were taken from their families and placed in these schools from the 19th Century into the 1970s. Many then suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Survivors testified about children who died at the schools, where students were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated, and unsanitary facilities. In recent years, Indigenous communities have found evidence of hundreds of unmarked graves on the grounds of former residential schools. These discoveries have reignited debate about the system. Announcing the settlement at an event on Saturday, Marc Miller, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, said it would not \"erase or make up for the past\" but \"what it can do is address the collective harm caused by Canada's past\". Shane Gottfriedson, the former chief of the Tk'emlups Nation and British Columbia regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, said during the event that it had \"always been a fight with government\" to settle Native Canadian human rights and land claims. \"This is the beginning of a new era in Canada for our people,\" he said. \"No reconciliation without truth\": A survivor recounts abuse in Canadian residential school The settlement will be placed in a not-for-profit trust to support \"healing, wellness, education, heritage, language and commemoration activities\" for indigenous Canadians over the course of 20 years, according to the government. More than 130 residential schools were operated in Canada between 1874 and 1996. The landmark Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report, released in 2015, concluded Canada's residential school system amounted to \"cultural genocide\". At least 3,200 children died while attending a residential school, though advocates have said this number is likely much higher.

A new Canadian law took effect January 1 that essentially bans foreign buyers from buying residential properties as investments for two years. The law was passed because of a spike in Canadian home prices since the start of the pandemic – and some politicians’ beliefs that foreign buyers were responsible by snapping up supply of homes as investments. “The desirability of Canadian homes is attracting profiteers, wealthy corporations, and foreign investors,” said the campaign website of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party this past year. “This is leading to a real problem of underused and vacant housing, rampant speculation, and skyrocketing prices. Homes are for people, not investors.” The law provides exceptions for home purchases by immigrants and permanent residents of Canada who are not citizens. But the steep rise in home prices in 2020 and 2021 was already reversed in 2022, well before the law took effect. Average home prices in Canada peaked just above $800,000 Canadian in February and have fallen steadily since then, dropping about 13% from that peak, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association . The Bank of Canada has been raising interest rates, resulting in higher mortgage rates in the country – just like in the United States and other countries that have been hiking rates. CREA’s price index is still up 38% from the end of 2019, before the pandemic, but the group said that inventory of homes for sales has returned to pre-pandemic levels. The real estate association voiced concern about the law, even with the exemptions for people who intend to move to Canada. “Canada has built a reputation as a multicultural nation that welcomes people from around the world. As currently proposed, the prohibition on the purchase of residential property by non-Canadians can impact our reputation as a welcoming nation,” said the group’s statement. “The potential benefits of the ban are likely to be modest.” CREA also expressed concern that the ban could prompt retaliation by the United States and Mexico to prohibit purchases in those countries by Canadians, especially retirees looking for winter homes away from the Canadian winter. “Canadians purchase vacation and residential properties in many countries, but particularly in the United States,” said the group. CREA said Canadians are the largest foreign purchasers of American properties, with more than half of the properties purchased by Canadians in Florida and Arizona. “These provide Canadians with a place to spend the winter months and are a form of savings for Canadian retirees,” said the group. “If Canada places a ban on Americans owning property in Canada, we should expect them to respond in kind.”",

Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand announced today (Thursday Jan 26) that Canada was donating four of its 80 Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine—a force equivalent to a platoon. Reportedly , the Royal Canadian Air Force fleet of five CC-171 Globemaster cargo planes (also known as C-17A ERs) in the Ontario-based 429 th Transport Squadron will “probably” deliver the tanks, one per flight. Canadian military personnel will also be assigned to train Ukrainian soldiers somewhere outside of Canadian or Ukrainian soil.

AFP PHOTO / ALEXANDER KLEIN        (Photo credit should read ALEXANDER KLEIN/AFP/GettyImages) Less AFP via Getty Images A single tank platoon, equivalent to 5% of Canada’s tank fleet, is but a droplet in the ocean in a conflict on the scale of Ukraine’s, in which nearly a thousand Russian and 200 Ukrainian tanks have been visually confirmed destroyed (and over 500 more captured by Ukraine) in the first eleven months of combat. But M1s and Leopard 2s—given adequate logistics and using proper tactics—could achieve a combat value equivalent to several of the lighter Soviet-style tanks used by both Russia and Ukraine thanks to their superior armor and sights. And if all of Ukraine’s allies operating Leopard 2s continue contributing a platoon and company here, or a battalion there, it could add up to a few hundred Western tanks Kyiv could use to more aggressively spearhead offensives to liberate territory occupied by Russia. The new Canadians tanks reportedly are already “combat ready” and will arrive “over the coming weeks” complete with spare parts and ammunition. Already, it’s suggested Canada might eventually donate additional tanks, much as Washington staggered deliveries of HIMARS and Bradley fighting vehicles on a month-to-month basis. As detailed in this earlier article , Leopard 2s are heavy but highly capable main battle tanks comparableto the U.S. M1 Abrams , but using a more fuel efficient diesel engine and (in later models) different methods to enhance armor and firepower. Unleashing Canada’s Leopards At present, international donors to Ukraine are looking to form a battalion each of Leopard 2A4 and 2A6 tanks, the latter post-Cold War model benefitting from much improved frontal armor and longer-barreled 125-millimeter gun with higher armor penetration. Thus the four donated tanks could help ‘fill out’ the 2A4 battalion, to which Poland, Finland and other countries will contribute, as you can see in this chart by fellow Forbes contributor H.I. Sutton. Canada first purchased 80 Leopard 2A4s and 20 Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands in 2007, concerned with the vulnerability of its old Leopard C2s (an entirely different, earlier design) to insurgent rockets and mines in Afghanistan. While waiting for its 2A6s to be upgraded with better protection, Canada also temporarily borrowed 20 2A6Ms from Germany to deploy to Afghanistan. It also subsequently acquired twelve 2A4s from Switzerland, converting them into armored engineering and recovery vehicles, as well as 15 more from Germany to be used for spare parts.

Less Canadian MCG Photo (CCA-SA 4.0) Canada actually has two kinds of 2A4s: the basic unmodified model, now mostly used for training, and custom-upgraded Leopard 2A4M CANs, modified to be especially resistant to anti-tank mines and rocket-propelled grenades. This nearly 69-ton variant includes an additional plate of belly armor to protect against mines, modular applique armor on the turret and hull, and slat/cage armor helping harden the vulnerable rear hull and turret armor against portable anti-tank weapons. Other changes include an electric instead of hydraulically powered turret, improved brakes and suspensions, air conditioning, and digital command-and-control systems. In theory, if Canada does give away some of the better-protected 2A4Ms, it could then move to refurbish some of the older 2A4s to the 2A4M standard. Just two battalion-sized units in Canada’s military operate tanks: the Lord Strathcona’s Horse Regiment, with two tank squadrons, and the Royal Canadian Dragoons, with one squadron. Lord Strathcona’s Horse notably deployed Leopard 2A6Ms to Afghanistan starting 2007; and between 2010-2011 five Leopard 2A4Ms. The first arrivals were a squadron of 14 Leopard 2A6Ms delivered to Kandahar by a huge Ukrainian An-124 transport plane. The Leopard 2s were regularly used for patrol, base defense of Forward Operating Base Ma’Sum Ghar, and as a quick reaction force to aid units finding themselves in a tight spot. That included escorting several fiercely opposed convoys attempting to relieve heavily besieged forces at Strongpoint Musham, in what was known as Operations Room Service 1 through 3. The Canadian tankers reportedly made frequent use of shotgun-like cannister shells against Taliban insurgents in cover. Their biggest shortcoming initially proved to a lack of air conditioning, forcing crews to wear special cooling vests during the summer until modified 2A6Ms and 2A4Ms were introduced to service with built-in air conditioning and heat-absorbing mats.

As catalogued in greater detail by the Oryx blog here , Canadian military aid to Ukraine since 2022 notably includes: One NASAMs short-to-medium range air defense battery (purchased for Ukraine, not donated) 50 Wescam MX15D cameras for use on Bayraktar TB2 drones at least four M777 155-millimeter howitzers bundled with expensive high-precision GPS-guided Excalibur shells, spare gun barrels and over 20,000 155-millimeter rounds 39 ASCV (LAV 6) ‘Super-Bison’ eight-wheeled armored vehicles used for logistics, medical evacuation and troop 208 mine-protected Roshel Sentinel vehicles comparable to armored Humvees (208) 4,500 M72A5 and M72A7 light anti-tank weapons (LAWs) $7 million worth of satellite reconnaissance services Large quantities of rations, winter protective gear, body armor, and small arms Ukrainian troops operating Canadian-donated More armored Roshel Senator infantry mobility vehicles.

Less Basedosaurus photo via CCA-SA 4.0 The donations of NASAMS, MX15D cameras and M777 howitzers piggy-back on equipment supplied by other foreign assistance to Ukraine, making them more efficient. The same will be true for Canada’s Leopard 2s, as they will join a growing pool of Leopard 2 tanks likely to see much action starting in Spring 2023. ‘ Depending on how willing Canada’s military is to relinquish more of its small active tank fleet—or Ottawa to fund purchase or refurbishing of replacement tanks—more Canadian Leopards may follow.

Canadian and U.S. aircraft were scrambled, and a U.S. F-22 successfully fired at the object,” Trudeau said on Twitter . The object was “cylindrical” and smaller than the suspected Chinese balloon shot down last weekend, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said on Saturday evening. Later on Saturday, the White House confirmed that Trudeau and US President Joe Biden authorized the shoot-down and the Pentagon said the object was first spotted over Alaska on Friday evening. Trudeau said that he spoke with Biden on Saturday and that Canadian forces will lead the object recovery operation. The object shot down Saturday marks the third time in one week that US aircraft have shot down an object in North American airspace. Saturday’s incident follows the downing of another unidentified object on Friday over Alaska, and the shoot-down of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4 by a US F-22 fighter jet. ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - FEBRUARY 10: Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder speaks during a press briefing at the Pentagon on February 10, 2023 in Arlington, Virginia. The Pentagon announced today that the U.S. military shot down an unidentified object that was flying over frozen waters of Alaska. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Drew Angerer/Getty Images Related article What we know about the unidentified object shot down over Alaska It is not clear what the object shot down over Canada is or whether it is related to the spy balloon shot down last week or the unidentified object shot down over Alaska on Friday. Both Biden and Trudeau authorized the take-down of the object, a White House readout of a call between the two leaders said on Saturday. And according to the statement regarding the call, the leaders “discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.” A statement from Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said the object shot down on Saturday was first noticed over Alaska on Friday evening. Two F-22 fighter jets “monitored the object” with the help of the Alaska Air National Guard, Ryder’s statement said, “tracking it closely and taking time to characterize the nature of the object.” “Monitoring continued today as the object crossed into Canadian airspace, with Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joining the formation to further assess the object. A U.S. F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory using an AIM 9X missile,” his statement added. “As Canadian authorities conduct recovery operations to help our countries learn more about the object, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,” Ryder said in his Saturday statement. Anand tweeted Saturday that she had discussed the incident with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “and reaffirmed that we’ll always defend our sovereignty together.” “The object was flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, had unlawfully entered Canadian airspace and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. The object was shot down approximately 100 miles from the Canada-United States border over Canadian territory in central Yukon,” Anand said in a news conference on Saturday evening. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said earlier Saturday it was monitoring “a high altitude airborne object” over northern Canada, and military aircraft were operating in the area from Alaska and Canada, according to a news release from the agency. Global News reported on NORAD’s detection of the object earlier Saturday. Airspace over Montana briefly closed before being reopened Airspace over Montana was also closed on Saturday evening “to support Defense Department activities,” according to a FAA spokesperson, but it was quickly reopened. A statement from NORAD later on Saturday night said they “detected a radar anomaly and sent fighter aircraft to investigate,” but the aircraft “did not identify any object to correlate to the radar hits.” On Friday, the US military shot down a “high-altitude object” over Alaska after US officials determined that it posed a “reasonable threat to civilian air traffic” as it was flying at 40,000 feet. The object was brought down by fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command, and Biden referred to the operation as a “success.” Recovery teams are now attempting to retrieve the debris that is sitting on top of ice in US territorial waters. While officials have given no indication so far that the object shot down over Alaska is at all related to the Chinese spy balloon, details have been scarce. A week earlier, US military fighter jets shot down the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean, ending a remarkable public drama that prompted a diplomatic fallout between Washington and Beijing as the American public tracked the balloon from Montana all the way to the Carolinas. The Biden administration has been subjected to a slew of questions this week about the timing of the president’s decision to shoot the spy balloon. The balloon was spotted after entering the US Air Defense Identification Zone over Alaska on January 28 before flying over Canada, a Department of Defense official told lawmakers last week. It then reentered continental US airspace three days later. Officials said that the risk of intelligence collection against the US was low, while the risk to people and property on the ground, if the balloon were to be shot down over the US, was high given the balloon’s size and weight. Instead, the military ultimately shot it down over water after it crossed over the East Coast of the US. The second object was first spotted on Thursday , officials said, and F-35 fighter jets were sent up to examine the object further. The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which posed a “reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight,” John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said on Friday. Biden was first briefed on this object on Thursday evening, Kirby said. A statement Saturday from US Northern Command said search and recovery operations for the object shot down over Alaska were ongoing. “Recovery activities are occurring on sea ice,” the statement said. “We have no further details at this time about the object, including its capabilities, purpose, or origin.” This story and headline have been updated.",

ISU Member nations select their entries according to their own criteria. Currently, skaters must be at least 13 years old, but not yet 19, before the previous 1 July, except for men competing in pair skating and ice dancing, where the age maximum is 21. Skaters/couples participating in the 2022 ISU World Figure Skating Championships must have reached the required Minimum Total Elements Scores during the ongoing season (2022/23) or the immediately preceding seasons (2021/22) The Minimum Technical Elements Score (not including Component Scores) is a Technical Score and must have been reached in an ISU recognized International Competition (as per Article 39, paragraph 7 of the ISU Constitution and Rule 107, paragraphs 1 to 10 of the ISU General Regulations) during the ongoing or immediately preceding season in both segments, Short Program/Rhythm Dance and Free Skating/Free Dance (See ISU Special Regulations Single & Pair Skating Ice Dance, Rule 378, paragraph 3). The required Minimum Total Elements Score for the Short Program/Rhythm Dance and the Free Skating/Free Dance segment to participate in the ISU World Junior Figure Skating Championships can only be obtained in International Junior Competitions. While the Minimum Technical Elements Score must be reached separately in each segment (not a total of the two segments), the Minimum Technical Elements Score for each segment may be reached at different competitions. The Minimum Technical Elements Score must be reached 21 (twenty-one) days before the first day (first official practice day) of the Championships concerned (same as entry deadline).  The backward outside death spiral was invented in 1928 by Germany’s Charlotte Oelschlägel (August 14, 1898 – November 14, 1984) and Curt Neumann (although it was first performed with the skaters holding both hands and the woman not fully lowered toward the ice). They performed the first one-arm death spiral in Budapest in 1928. Canadian pair Suzanne Morrow and Wallace Diestelmeyer are credited with being the first pair to perform the element in competition at the 1948 Olympics. Ludmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov (USSR) are credited for creating three versions of the death spiral: Cosmic spiral (backward inside), Life spiral (forward inside), and Love spiral (forward outside).

        "text": "Canada bans TikTok on government devices 28 February 2023 Share Save Mike Wendling BBC News Share Save Getty Images Canada will ban video app TikTok from all government-issued devices starting on Tuesday. The decision follows a review by Canada's chief information officer, and the app \"presents an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\", a government spokesperson said in a statement. A TikTok spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the decision. It comes just days after the European Commission announced a similar ban. Security concerns Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change. \"This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,\" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto. TikTok has been criticised for its use of personal information and ties to the Chinese government. The short-form video app is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance Ltd. US federal employees were banned from using TikTok late last year, and on Monday the White House gave government agencies 30 days to scrub the app from their systems. A number of American universities have banned the app from being used on their networks. Broader public bans have been implemented in India and several other Asian countries. The company insists that Chinese government officials don't have access to user data and that a Chinese version of the app is separate from the one used in the rest of the world. But last year, the company admitted some staff in China can access the data of European users. The ban for European Commission employees is set to come into force on 15 March. Canadian privacy regulators are also investigating TikTok over concerns about user data, in particular whether the company obtains \"valid and meaningful\" consent from users when collecting personal information. About a quarter of Canadian adults use the app, according to a recent survey by researchers at the Social Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University. In a statement, Mona Fortier, the president of Canada's Treasury Board, said the government \"is committed to keeping government information secure\". The app will be removed from government-issued phones this week and other devices and blocked from downloads in the future. \"On a mobile device, TikTok's data collection methods provide considerable access to the contents of the phone,\" Ms Fortier said. \"While the risks of using this application are clear, we have no evidence at this point that government information has been compromised.\" The Treasury Board, which oversees the operations of the federal government, includes the country's chief information officer. TikTok responds In a statement, a company spokesperson said the ban on government-issued devices happened \"without citing any specific security concerns about TikTok or contacting us to discuss any concern prior to making this decision\". \"We are always available to meet with our government officials to discuss how we protect the privacy and security of Canadians, but singling out TikTok in this way does nothing to achieve that shared goal,\" the spokesperson said. \"All it does is prevent officials from reaching the public on a platform loved by millions of Canadians.\" European Commission bans TikTok on staff devices TikTok under investigation by Canadian privacy authorities TikTok Canada",

Steinbach-area farmer and agricultural consultant Janine Gibson is the winner of an online party leadership vote, the Greens announced on Sunday. She takes over from James Beddome, a Winnipeg lawyer who had led the party since 2008. Voting took place online from March 13 to 26 using a ranked-pairs ballot. The party said Gibson won a majority of votes in head-to-head matchups with each of the other candidates: Nicolas Geddert, Dennis Bayomi and Donovan McIntosh. A total of 89 people voted overall, which represents 54 per cent of the party membership, the party said. Manitoba Green Party reveals 4 potential candidates for next leader After more than a decade, leader of Manitoba Green party to step down in the fall The Greens have never won a seat in Manitoba. The closest the party came to getting a representative into the Manitoba Legislature was in 2016, when Green candidate Dave Nickarz finished second to the NDP's Rob Altemeyer by 392 votes in the Winnipeg constituency of Wolseley. University of Manitoba political studies professor Royce Koop said Gibson faces daunting odds of leading the Greens to win a seat. \"If a leader can contribute to a breakthrough for the party then that would be that would be fantastic, but the level of difficulty in doing so is extremely high,\" Koop said Sunday in an interview, noting the party has a limited organization and a small membership. \"Winning even a single seat in the legislature is extremely difficult and in order to do that, you have to be pretty charismatic. You have to have particular talent and experience as the leader.\" Prior to winning the Green Party leadership, Gibson ran unsuccessfully in seven federal and three provincial elections.

Just under a million people did not have power in Quebec and about 110,000 in Ontario as of 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), according to Poweroutage.com. Outages combined for both provinces had crossed at least 1.3 million earlier in the day. Sign up here. The two provinces account for more than half of Canada's total population of about 39 million. Electricity providers in both provinces were working to restore power, but repairs were expected continue for days, meaning many Canadians could spend Easter weekend in the dark. One man was killed in Quebec when a tree fell on him, Premier Francois Legault said at a briefing, cautioning people to watch out for live wires and weakened trees. Another man died in eastern Ontario when he was struck by a falling branch, broadcaster CTV News reported. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was elected to parliament in a Montreal constituency, offered to provide federal assistance if required.

Montreal is among the worst hit areas in Quebec, accounting for about half of the total outages in the largely French-speaking province. \"Seeing all these beautiful trees down, seeing lives disrupted, seeing similar challenges ... (it) will be a difficult Easter weekend for a number of families,\" Trudeau said. Hydro-Quebec was hoping to restore power for about 70% of customers by Friday midnight, an executive at the utility said in a televised briefing. \"Unfortunately, it is the start of a long weekend and certain areas are more complex that we will not be able to reconnect immediately,\" said Regis Tellier, Hydro-Quebec's vice president of operations and maintenance. In the city of Ottawa, crews were expected to restore power for a large portion of some 65,000 affected customers by noon, Mayor Mark Sutcliffe said. Some areas in the national capital \"remain hazardous due to fallen debris and power outages affecting traffic signals,\" Sutcliffe said.

Article content The lawsuit paints the clearest picture yet of how April’s airport gold heist was allegedly pulled off after months of institutional silence from police, the airline, and others involved in the theft that made headlines around the world. Article content In a statement of claim filed in Federal Court and first reported by Glen McGregor on Substack , Brink’s says the shipment of gold and cash was delivered to Air Canada in Zurich, a Swiss financial centre, and loaded aboard Air Canada Flight AC881, a daily passenger and cargo flight to Toronto, on April 17. Article content Brink’s claims Air Canada provided woeful security despite knowing the high-value contents of the load. Article content None of the allegations have been proven in court. Article content Air Canada would not comment on the lawsuit, the heist, or the allegations. Article content Article content “As this matter is now before the courts, we are unable to provide a comment,” said Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada. Before it was a matter in the courts, the airline also declined to comment.

Article content In April, a Swiss bank called Raiffeisen Schweiz, hired Brink’s to transport cash — banknotes with a value of US$1,945,843, weighing 53.18 kilos — from Zurich to Toronto, according to Brink’s statement of claim. Article content The money, declared as “BANKNOTES”, was being shipped to the Vancouver Bullion and Currency Exchange, according to the lawsuit. Article content Around the same time, Valcambi SA, a precious metals refining company in Switzerland, hired Brink’s to transport 400.19 kilos of gold — valued at more than $20.4 million — to Toronto. Article content The gold, declared as “GOLDBARS”, was being sent to the Toronto Dominion Bank in Toronto, the suit says. Article content The two shipments were combined into one air cargo container about the size of a large office desk. Article content The plane landed at Toronto’s Pearson airport around 4:20 p.m. The shipping container was unloaded and moved to an Air Canada bonded warehouse at the edge of the airport at about 5:50 p.m., the lawsuit claims.

Article content “At approximately (6:32 p.m.), an unidentified individual gained access to AC’s cargo storage facilities. No security protocols or features were in place to monitor, restrict or otherwise regulate the unidentified individual’s access to the facilities,” the lawsuit claims. Article content “Once inside, the unidentified individual presented to AC personnel the copy of an airway bill respecting an unrelated shipment. Article content “Upon receipt of the Fraudulent Waybill, AC personnel released the Shipments to the unidentified individual, following which the unidentified individual absconded with the cargo,” the lawsuit claims. Article content “AC accepted the Fraudulent Waybill from the unidentified individual without verifying its authenticity in any way. Article content “Had AC made the necessary and appropriate inquiries in the circumstances, the unidentified individual’s ability to steal the cargo entrusted to its care would have been entirely avoided,” according to the Brink’s claim. Article content Air Canada Cargo at Toronto Pearson International Airport, where a number of high-value items were stolen. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Article content Brink’s sent the nature of the cargo contents, their declared values, and flight information to Air Canada by email when booking the cargo shipment, on or about April 14. The emails were confirmed by Air Canada the same day, according to the lawsuit. Article content Article content The gold and cash had separate air waybills, marked: “BRINK’S SECURED AIRFREIGHT SPECIAL SUPERVISION IS REQUESTED VALUABLE CARGO,” according to the lawsuit. Article content Brink’s says it engaged the airline’s AC Secure program to ship the container. AC Secure advertises itself as providing “special handling for high-value cargo, with security as the highest priority.” Article content “AC Secure ensures the safe and secure transportation of specific commodities including goods with a declared value of CAD/USD $1,000 per kilogram or more, or when a shipper purchases insurance in the same amount per kilogram, regardless of the commodity,” its website says. Article content Commodities using AC Secure often include gold, silver, gems, money, watches, jewelry, stocks and bonds. Article content AC Secure costs more than regular air shipments. Article content Brink’s transportation contract with the company means Brink’s took on responsibility for the value of the load if lost in transit. Article content Brink’s now seeks to redeem that loss from Air Canada. Article content The lawsuit accuses Air Canada of being “reckless in its operation of the AC Secure program” by failing to adequately secure the cargo. Article content Article content The lawsuit claims Air Canada failed to offer “storing facilities equipped with effective vaults and cages, constant CCTV surveillance and active human surveillance patrols.” Article content The suit also claims Air Canada failed to: sufficiently secure software/hardware systems to prevent unauthorized transactions; ensure employee credentials are not susceptible to fraud or misuse; verify the trustworthiness and proper training of personnel with access to high-value shipments. Article content Brink’s claims damages of 13.6 million Swiss Francs, representing the declared value of the missing gold, and US$1,945,843, the value of the missing money. Article content Brink’s also seeks special damages of an unspecified amount and costs of the legal action. Article content The lawsuit says that the company was notified in March of ongoing upgrades by Air Canada designed to “build an improved process” for AC Secure, including “better technology enhancements, handovers and (an) improved tracing method.” Article content But, the suit claims, the airline failed to implement improvements “properly or at all.” Article content The lawsuit was filed in Federal Court because international shipments are regulated by the Montreal Convention, an international treaty that is incorporated into Canadian law. Article content The investigation by Peel Regional Police continues. No arrests have been announced. Article content “We understand the interest in this case,” said Peel Const. Donna Carlson. Article content “This is still a very active ongoing investigation, and information will be released when investigators believe it will not interfere with the investigation’s integrity. At this time, we have no further information to release.” Article content Brink’s declined to comment beyond their statement of claim. TD Bank, Valcambi SA, and the Vancouver Bullion and Currency Exchange did not respond to requests for comment prior to deadline.

Dennis King calls election 6 months earlier than fixed election date of Oct. 2 Cody MacKay · CBC News · Posted: Mar 06, 2023 6:57 PM EST | Last Updated: March 7, 2023 Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King kicks off a provincial election campaign in Winsloe South on Monday evening. (Shane Hennessey/CBC) Social Sharing Prince Edward Islanders are heading to the polls for a provincial election this spring, with voting day set for Monday, April 3. Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King made the official announcement Monday evening at his nomination meeting, as he became the final candidate to be nominated to run in the 2023 provincial election for the party. \"This election is going to be about a lot of things. But primarily it's about leadership,\" King told about 200 candidates and supporters gathered at Winsloe United Church in his district of Brackley-Hunter River, surrounded by signs reading: \"PC: With you, for you.\" \"It's about who's best positioned to lead our province forward during the next four years.\" Premier hints at spring election as P.E.I. PCs kick off nomination season YEAR END INTERVIEW P.E.I. Premier Dennis King on Fiona, health care, and his thoughts — if any — on an election in 2023 In a high-energy speech, he listed how his party had tackled the key issues of health care, the rising cost of living, and access to housing. I'm confident in our team, I'm confident in our plan, I'm confident in our track record. — Dennis King \"Today is the beginning of a new journey,\" King said as he wrapped up, saying: \"I'm confident in our team, I'm confident in our plan, I'm confident in our track record. \"And I say to you, and I say to the 26 of you [candidates] behind me: Let's get to work, let's go get the job done one more time.\" The election call came after months of speculation about a possible spring election, at kitchen tables and coffee shops as well as in the halls of the legislature. King all but guaranteed it this winter, dropping hints here and there that the PCs were getting ready — most recently in an interview after the party nominated its first candidate in the city of Summerside. PC Leader Dennis King announces the election for April 3 2 years ago Duration 1:05 'It may not come as a surprise to many of you, but earlier today I visited her honour, the lieutenant-governor, and I asked her to sign the writ of election,' says PC Leader Dennis King. Prince Edward Island does have fixed election legislation setting the next voting date as Oct. 2, 2023, but King exercised his right as premier to trigger it early. King later defended that decision when talking to reporters. \"It's four years; it's time to have an election,\" he said. \"There's uncertainty in the future and Islanders should have a say in that.\" King added that there is a chance of a federal election later in the year, given that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is leading a minority government. \"There's uncertainty in Ottawa,\" he said. \"There could be a fall election. Part of the reason our election was moved [is] because the election dates in Ottawa.\" \"It's four years; it's time to have an election,\" PC Leader Dennis King says. \"There's uncertainty in the future and Islanders should have a say in that.\" (Cody MacKay/CBC) The P.C. leader, who had held the premier's job since 2019, said he went to see Lt.-Gov Antoinette Perry on Monday morning to kickstart the election. Who is running so far? Shortly after King spoke, Elections P.E.I. issued a news release about the provincial vote to be held in four weeks' time, saying advance polls would take place on March 25, 27 and 31 from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. As of Monday evening, the Progressive Conservatives were the only party to have a full slate of 27 candidates nominated and ready to run. PEI Votes Here is the official list of candidates running in the 2023 P.E.I. provincial election Opinion No snap! A case for the fixed election date The other parties are planning more nomination meetings in the coming days. Here is the breakdown so far of how many people have declared their intention to run for each of the other major parties (nominated or soon-to-be-nominated): The Greens under Peter Bevan-Baker have 14 of 27. The Liberals led by Sharon Cameron have 19 of 27. The NDP under Michelle Neill have 13 of 27. Greens 'feeling really excited' Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, whose party has formed the Official Opposition since 2019, said he would have preferred that King stick to the fixed election date of Oct. 2. \"It's not the right time for Islanders, and I also think it's not the right time for democracy,\" he said. \"When you call a snap election like this, it creates such an imbalance between the ruling party … and the rest of us.\" P.E.I. Green Party Leader Peter Bevan-Baker says his party is confirming a candidate slate that's 'second to none' for this campaign. (Rick Gibbs/CBC) Given that, he's excited about his party's possibilities going into the April 3 election. \"We have a platform we've been working on for a very long time. We just nominated this evening two more candidates, so we continue to build a slate of candidates across this province,\" he said. \"The quality of the folks who are coming forward is second to none and I'm just feeling really excited and really optimistic about the next month.\" Liberals, NDP criticize snap call A spring election has been \"the worst kept secret on P.E.I.,\" said Liberal Leader Sharon Cameron. \"The announcement is as heartbreaking as it is discouraging,\" she said. \"We've always been very vocal about the snap election date.\" Sharon Cameron, leader of the Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island, said her primary goal going into this campaign is addressing health care. (Brian Higgins/CBC) Cameron said her primary goal going into this election is addressing health care, adding that the party has a strong, diverse set of candidates with more being announced by the day. NDP candidate Herb Dickieson spoke on behalf of his party, saying not following the fixed election date amounts to \"broken promise\" for the PC campaign as it starts off. \"When governments attempt to deceive the people, they sometimes regret it,\" Dickieson said. As for the party's priorities going into the election, he said the party has health care top of mind and they plans on running a full slate of 27 candidates. The NDP under leader Michelle Neill had about half of their candidates confirmed as of Monday night, including former MLA Herb Dickieson. (CBC) \"Michelle Neill has a better deal for Islanders and that's our slogan and we have a very good platform to back it up with,\" he said. \"We're looking with great anticipation for much better results [than 2019] and what we're going to see … is that New Democrats will be elected in the Island legislature.\" The Island Party has also announced it plans to field candidates in the race, and has registered with Elections P.E.I. A recent news release said it will call for \"responsible and transparent government.\" The issues heading in There will likely be more focused debate on hot-button issues this time around. Back in 2019, the province had a full slate of topics of concern, of course, but there was also a referendum on proportional representation tied to the vote. This time, expect to see some of the same issues debated in 2019 return in an even more pressing manner, including: Health care and doctor shortages. Housing and homelessness. Inflation, poverty, wages and the economy. Environment, climate change and shoreline protection. Health care and doctor shortages are issues that affect most Islanders , with more than 28,000 people and counting on the P.E.I. patient registry . Combine that with a shortage of doctors in many parts of the province, leading to hospital closures in rural parts of P.E.I. and extremely crunched ERs at both Summerside's Prince County Hospital and Charlottetown's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Also in the health care file is the COVID-19 pandemic that has dominated global attention since the winter of 2020 and is still claiming lives on P.E.I. Shortly after the election was triggered on Monday night, Elections P.E.I. released this photo of CEO Tim Garrity signing the writ of election for a provincial vote to be held on April 3. The agency said advance polls will take place on March 25, 27 and 31 from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. (Submitted by Elections P.E.I.) Housing and homelessness are an all-party priority heading into this election. On housing, increasing rents and a desperately short supply of units have squeezed the tenant population, with rising house prices pushing ownership out of reach for many Islanders. At the same time, more people have been living in tents, on couches, in cars, or at outreach centres and emergency shelters — like the one that opened in Charlottetown last December . Inflation has drained the resources of Islanders on nearly every bill, particularly when it comes to grocery shopping and buying gas and home heating fuel. Rent and mortgage rates are also way up, squeezing the budgets and putting more people on the poverty line. Use of food banks is at a historic high, with more and more rural populations installing community fridges to help their neighbours. In some ways, major storms bookended the last four years of governance, with post-tropical storm Dorian in 2019 and post-tropical storm Fiona in 2022 mercilessly pummelling Prince Edward Island. The unprecedented became precedented as all levels of government raced to rework and reinforce their climate change policies. Elections P.E.I. has sent out voter information cards across the province ahead of the spring election, and is encouraging Islanders to make sure their information is up to date.

Upon ratification, this agreement will apply to approximately 39,000 PSAC-UTE employees working at the CRA. PSAC-UTE employees will return to work this morning. May 4, 2023 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Last night, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) reached a 4-year tentative agreement with the Public Service Alliance of Canada – Union of Taxation Employees (PSAC-UTE). Upon ratification, this agreement will apply to approximately 39,000 PSAC - UTE employees working at the CRA . Employees represented by PSAC - UTE will return to work this morning. The tentative agreement includes wage increases of 11.5% over four years, retroactive to 2021, that will cover periods until 2025. The third year also includes an allowance of 0.5%. Employees would also see a number of improvements over the life of the agreement, as well as a one-time payment of $2,500. The CRA continues to be committed to a modern, hybrid workplace that provides employees, where applicable, with the flexibility to continue to work up to three days from home a week. Outside of the collective agreement, the CRA and PSAC - UTE reached a tentative settlement on telework to the satisfaction of both parties. Both parties agreed to undertake a review of the Directive on virtual work arrangements, and to create a panel to advise the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner regarding employee concerns. This agreement addresses all key priorities put forward by the PSAC - UTE . In addition, it includes improved provisions, around leave with pay for family-related responsibilities, for example. It also includes measures to further support employment equity, diversity, and inclusion, such as a new benefit for Indigenous employees who will now have access to paid leave to participate in traditional practices. This new provision represents another important step in our reconciliation journey and supports our ongoing efforts to create healthy workplaces. The tentative agreement is subject to ratification by PSAC - UTE membership. The PSAC - UTE will present details of the tentative agreement to its members and organize ratification vote sessions in the coming weeks. Once the agreement is approved and ratified, employees will see wage enhancements within agreed to timelines. The CRA wants to thank members of both bargaining teams for their dedication and hard work during this round of negotiations, and especially these past few weeks. Through long hours of negotiations, the CRA and the PSAC - UTE found ways to compromise and, in doing so, succeeded in reaching a tentative agreement, which is both fair to employees and reasonable for taxpayers. The CRA has already taken measures to resume its normal operations and to fully restore services that were affected during the labour disruption. Canadians can consult the Contact the Canada Revenue Agency for more information. The CRA values the important role its employees play from across the country in delivering services to Canadians.

Article content The lawsuit paints the clearest picture yet of how April’s airport gold heist was allegedly pulled off after months of institutional silence from police, the airline, and others involved in the theft that made headlines around the world. Article content In a statement of claim filed in Federal Court and first reported by Glen McGregor on Substack , Brink’s says the shipment of gold and cash was delivered to Air Canada in Zurich, a Swiss financial centre, and loaded aboard Air Canada Flight AC881, a daily passenger and cargo flight to Toronto, on April 17. Article content Brink’s claims Air Canada provided woeful security despite knowing the high-value contents of the load. Article content None of the allegations have been proven in court. Article content Air Canada would not comment on the lawsuit, the heist, or the allegations. Article content Article content “As this matter is now before the courts, we are unable to provide a comment,” said Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada. Before it was a matter in the courts, the airline also declined to comment.

Article content In April, a Swiss bank called Raiffeisen Schweiz, hired Brink’s to transport cash — banknotes with a value of US$1,945,843, weighing 53.18 kilos — from Zurich to Toronto, according to Brink’s statement of claim. Article content The money, declared as “BANKNOTES”, was being shipped to the Vancouver Bullion and Currency Exchange, according to the lawsuit.

Article content “At approximately (6:32 p.m.), an unidentified individual gained access to AC’s cargo storage facilities.

Article content “Once inside, the unidentified individual presented to AC personnel the copy of an airway bill respecting an unrelated shipment.

Article content “AC accepted the Fraudulent Waybill from the unidentified individual without verifying its authenticity in any way. Article content “Had AC made the necessary and appropriate inquiries in the circumstances, the unidentified individual’s ability to steal the cargo entrusted to its care would have been entirely avoided,” according to the Brink’s claim. Article content Air Canada Cargo at Toronto Pearson International Airport, where a number of high-value items were stolen. Photo by Peter J. Thompson/National Post Article content Brink’s sent the nature of the cargo contents, their declared values, and flight information to Air Canada by email when booking the cargo shipment, on or about April 14. The emails were confirmed by Air Canada the same day, according to the lawsuit. Article content Article content The gold and cash had separate air waybills, marked: “BRINK’S SECURED AIRFREIGHT SPECIAL SUPERVISION IS REQUESTED VALUABLE CARGO,” according to the lawsuit. Article content Brink’s says it engaged the airline’s AC Secure program to ship the container. AC Secure advertises itself as providing “special handling for high-value cargo, with security as the highest priority.” Article content “AC Secure ensures the safe and secure transportation of specific commodities including goods with a declared value of CAD/USD $1,000 per kilogram or more, or when a shipper purchases insurance in the same amount per kilogram, regardless of the commodity,” its website says. Article content Commodities using AC Secure often include gold, silver, gems, money, watches, jewelry, stocks and bonds. Article content AC Secure costs more than regular air shipments. Article content Brink’s transportation contract with the company means Brink’s took on responsibility for the value of the load if lost in transit. Article content Brink’s now seeks to redeem that loss from Air Canada. Article content The lawsuit accuses Air Canada of being “reckless in its operation of the AC Secure program” by failing to adequately secure the cargo. Article content Article content The lawsuit claims Air Canada failed to offer “storing facilities equipped with effective vaults and cages, constant CCTV surveillance and active human surveillance patrols.” Article content The suit also claims Air Canada failed to: sufficiently secure software/hardware systems to prevent unauthorized transactions; ensure employee credentials are not susceptible to fraud or misuse; verify the trustworthiness and proper training of personnel with access to high-value shipments. Article content Brink’s claims damages of 13.6 million Swiss Francs, representing the declared value of the missing gold, and US$1,945,843, the value of the missing money. Article content Brink’s also seeks special damages of an unspecified amount and costs of the legal action. Article content The lawsuit says that the company was notified in March of ongoing upgrades by Air Canada designed to “build an improved process” for AC Secure, including “better technology enhancements, handovers and (an) improved tracing method.” Article content But, the suit claims, the airline failed to implement improvements “properly or at all.” Article content The lawsuit was filed in Federal Court because international shipments are regulated by the Montreal Convention, an international treaty that is incorporated into Canadian law. Article content The investigation by Peel Regional Police continues. No arrests have been announced. Article content “We understand the interest in this case,” said Peel Const. Donna Carlson. Article content “This is still a very active ongoing investigation, and information will be released when investigators believe it will not interfere with the investigation’s integrity. At this time, we have no further information to release.” Article content Brink’s declined to comment beyond their statement of claim.

Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA... Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more April 29 (Reuters) - The Toronto Maple Leafs finally exorcised the postseason demons that have haunted the storied franchise for nearly two decades with a 2-1 overtime win over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday to reach the second round of the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs. John Tavares scored the series winner when he took the puck from behind the Lightning net, skated in front before making a quick turnaround and unleashed a shot that went in off Tampa Bay defender Darren Raddysh's skate. Sign up here. Perhaps no team began the postseason with more pressure than Toronto, a talented but long-underachieving club that needed to win a playoff series for the first time since 2004 to avoid loud calls for major organizational changes. \"Obviously it's a bit of a monkey off our back and we still got plenty of work to do but this one obviously feels really great,\" said Maple Leafs forward Auston Matthews. Toronto's last postseason series win came long before the arrival of gifted goal scorer Matthews (2016), explosive winger Mitch Marner (2016) and durable captain Tavares (2018). That core trio has endured their share of playoff heartache, most recently in 2022 when Tampa Bay beat Toronto in a decisive seventh game as the Maple Leafs lost their opening postseason series for a sixth consecutive year. And while ousting a Lightning team that reached the Stanley Cup Final in each of the previous three seasons has brought this group to unchartered territory, it is also just the first step for a Maple Leafs team with lofty ambitions. \"It's a little bit of a relief for sure just to be able to get that done,\" Marner said. \"But got to make sure we're ready because it just gets harder and harder.\" As the best-of-seven series returned to Tampa with the Maple Leafs ahead 3-2, the visitors were desperate to close things out rather than take their chances in a do-or-die seventh game. And for once the Maple Leafs, who had gone 0-11 in series-clinching games since they last advanced, gave their eternally optimistic fan base a reason to celebrate. Toronto opened the scoring with about six minutes left in the second period when Matthews unleashed a slapshot from the right faceoff circle that beat Andrei Vasilevskiy. The Lightning drew level when captain Steven Stamkos, alone in front of the net, fired home a rebound with just under 16 minutes left in regulation. The Tavares goal less than five minutes into overtime allowed the entire Maple Leafs organization and their fan base to breathe a collective sigh of relief. The Maple Leafs will next face the winner of Sunday's game between the top-seeded Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers.

        "text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office says staff were alerted in March to the “possibility” that notorious serial killer Paul Bernardo would be transferred to a medium security prison. But the PMO says that Trudeau himself was only briefed on the day it took place, May 29. That briefing was one day before Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino says he was told about the transfer, despite his office also knowing for nearly three months that Bernardo was being moved out of maximum-security. 3:08 Poilievre accuses Mendicino of knowing about Bernardo prison transfer 3 months prior The ever-evolving timeline comes as the Conservatives call for Mendicino’s resignation over how his office handled the information. News that both the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Public Safety Minister’s Office knew about the impending transfer for weeks has conflicted with the shock and condemnation both Trudeau and Mendicino expressed when the move became public early this month. Story continues below advertisement According to a spokesperson for the PMO, the information about the transfer was referred to Mendicino’s office when it was received in March. “When a staff member in the Prime Minister’s Office was alerted in March by the Privy Council Office about the possibility of the transfer, inquiries and requests for information were immediately made to the Public Safety Minister’s Office,” spokesperson Alison Murphy said in a statement to Global News. “That was the right step to take given the Public Safety Minister’s responsibility for the Correctional Service of Canada.” Murphy added Trudeau was briefed about the transfer on May 29, the day Bernardo was transferred. 1:00 Singh demands answers from Mendicino on Paul Bernardo prison move She did not say if the PMO was later alerted when Correctional Services Canada had formalized the transfer, or if Trudeau had any private discussions with Mendicino before news of transfer made headlines on June 2. Story continues below advertisement “Instead of acting, the Prime Minister did nothing and left it in the hands of his most useless minister,” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said a tweet in response to the PMO’s statement. “This is a failure of leadership at the very top.” Get daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.

The CSC told Global News Wednesday it contacted Mendicino’s office by email on March 2 to inform them that Bernardo would be transferred from Millhaven Institution , a maximum-security penitentiary near Kingston, Ont. A transfer date hadn’t been determined at that time. CSC then followed up with the minister’s office on May 25, telling them Bernardo would be transferred on May 29. Mendicino said during question period Wednesday he was informed on May 30 and that “corrective steps” have been taken within his office. He also said he issued new directives to the CSC for families and the public safety minister to be notified directly before transfers like Bernardo’s happen. “I have also made it clear to my staff that this should have been briefed immediately. Corrective steps have been taken,” Mendicino said. “I have dealt with it and we will now always defend the rights of victims.” 0:51 Bernardo prison transfer ‘extraordinarily difficult’ for families, many Canadians dealing with news in ‘shock and real anguish’ Trending Now ANALYSIS: Pierre Poilievre would axe one of Parliament’s primary purposes Gunmen open fire on tourists, killing over 20 people at Kashmir resort Poilievre claimed earlier Wednesday that Mendicino has “lied” to Canadians too many times. Story continues below advertisement “These are too many lies,” he said. “It’s one lie too many. It is time for Marco Mendicino to resign.” Poilievre also called for Trudeau to fire Mendicino if the public safety minister didn’t step down himself. A government official previously told Global News the CSC provided Mendicino with a heads-up of the transfer, but the decision was independent and since transfers are not typically public information, they were not in a position to comment before June 2. Bernardo, 58, has been serving a life sentence for the kidnappings, tortures and murders of teenagers Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s. He and his then-wife Karla Homolka also killed her younger sister, Tammy Homolka. Mendicino said on June 5 the CSC would review the transfer . That review should be completed “within a few weeks,” the CSC told Global News on Tuesday. 2:02 Poilievre demands Trudeau transfer Paul Bernardo back to maximum security, puts forward new bill NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters Wednesday that firing or demoting the minister is not the answer, saying he believes this was an example of the Liberal government being lousy when it comes to information-sharing. Story continues below advertisement He instead laid the blame at the feet of Trudeau and said there are legitimate concerns about how the minister has handled his portfolio, which includes the Liberals’ controversial gun legislation. “It doesn’t look like he’s got his house in order,” Singh said. “I just don’t want to let the prime minister off the hook.

        "text": "Politique 100 millions d’habitants en 2100 L’Initiative du siècle est une menace pour le Québec, dit Legault Désolé, votre navigateur ne supporte pas les videos (Québec) Le Québec dit non à l’Initiative du siècle, ce plan d’un influent groupe de pression qui veut augmenter la population du Canada à 100 millions d’habitants d’ici à 2100. Mis à jour le 9 mai 2023 Patrice Bergeron La Presse Canadienne Le premier ministre François Legault a en effet fait savoir mardi qu’il s’opposait à ce projet, qui semble avoir l’oreille du gouvernement fédéral. Une motion a également été adoptée à l’unanimité en ce sens. Le gouvernement caquiste a ainsi profité de cet enjeu pour prendre une posture ferme en matière d’immigration, le jour où l’opposition l’accusait d’un « grand mensonge caquiste » et de tricher avec les chiffres et les seuils d’immigration. « C’est au Québec qu’on décide du nombre d’immigrants au Québec, et pour être très clair, il n’est pas question de suivre l’approche [de l’Initiative du siècle] concernant la croissance de l’immigration », a-t-il tranché à la période de questions. Il répondait à une question du chef péquiste Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, qui juge que le Québec doit devenir indépendant s’il veut échapper à son effacement dans le Canada. « Soit on choisit de hausser nos seuils d’immigration entre 120 000 et 150 000 par année pour essayer de maintenir la proportion du Québec [de l’immigration au Canada], ce qui veut dire le déclin du français et une crise du logement aiguë, […] ou soit on choisit des seuils en fonction de notre capacité d’accueil, ce qui signifie une baisse importante du poids politique du Québec dans le Canada, possiblement sous la barre des 15 % », a dit le chef péquiste. En mêlée de presse, M. Legault a laissé entendre qu’il s’inquiétait de l’Initiative du siècle en raison de la menace qu’elle fait peser au fait français et au poids démographique du Québec dans la fédération. En outre, cela poserait d’« énormes défis » dans le reste du pays en matière de logement et aussi en ce qui concerne les services de santé et d’éducation. Une motion du PQ a été adoptée à l’unanimité à l’Assemblée nationale pour dire non à l’Initiative du siècle, pour demander au gouvernement du Québec d’exprimer son opposition et réclamer un véritable débat démocratique sur l’enjeu. M. Legault a indiqué que son gouvernement ferait bientôt une annonce sur les seuils annuels d’immigration – le seuil d’immigration permanente est actuellement fixé à 50 000 par an. Or il en est autrement de l’immigration temporaire, ce que dénoncent les partis d’opposition. Au 1 er janvier, le Québec accueillait déjà 346 000 personnes non résidentes permanentes, selon les données de Statistique Canada. L’opposition officielle libérale a même parlé du « grand mensonge caquiste » mardi concernant les engagements du gouvernement Legault en immigration. Le gouvernement amorcera par ailleurs dans les prochaines semaines ses consultations sur la planification pluriannuelle de l’immigration 2024-2027. Le premier ministre a fait savoir que son gouvernement allait exiger la connaissance du français pour la catégorie de l’immigration économique. La CAQ a déjà évoqué la tenue d’un sommet sur l’immigration et préconisé un référendum sectoriel pour rapatrier tous les pouvoirs en matière d’immigration, mais cela ne figure plus à l’ordre du jour. Une proposition soumise au Conseil général de la CAQ qui a lieu la fin de semaine prochaine réclame le rapatriement du Programme de travailleurs étrangers temporaires géré par Ottawa. M. Legault a affirmé mardi qu’il veut « toujours avoir tous les pouvoirs à Ottawa », mais qu’il « faut agir graduellement ». PLQ Toujours en matière d’immigration, le Parti libéral du Québec (PLQ) va réviser sa cible de 70 000 immigrants permanents par an qu’il avait défendue en campagne électorale, mais refuse de dire si ce sera à la hausse ou à la baisse. Le chef intérimaire libéral Marc Tanguay a laissé entendre mardi en mêlée de presse au parlement que cette cible ne tient plus. Désolé, votre navigateur ne supporte pas les videos « Il est clair que les chiffres [sur le seuil d’immigration permanente] doivent être révisés à la lumière de la nouvelle réalité, a déclaré M. Tanguay. Est-ce que c’est 70 000 ? Est-ce que c’est plus ? Est-ce que c’est moins ? » C’est d’abord son collègue à ses côtés, le député Monsef Derraji, qui avait ouvert la porte pour ravoir cette discussion avec les membres du parti. « Oui, avec nos membres, on va avoir cette discussion », avait-il suggéré, en assurant que pendant la campagne électorale, son parti ne savait pas que l’immigration temporaire représentait un bassin aussi élevé, « pas autant ». Dès lors, le débat sur le seuil annuel d’immigration permanente n’est « plus pertinent », à ses yeux. C’est « un grand mensonge caquiste » que de faire une fixation sur un seuil d’immigration permanente à 50 000 – comme le prône le gouvernement Legault – sans tenir compte de l’immigration temporaire qui explose bien au-delà de la capacité d’accueil du Québec, a fait valoir M. Derraji.",

In a statement on Monday, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said the Canadian government has designated Zhao, a diplomat based in Toronto, “persona non grata”. “I have been clear: we will not tolerate any form of foreign interference in our internal affairs. Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they engage in this type of behaviour, they will be sent home,” Joly said. The Chinese government has rejected the allegations that it interfered in Canada’s internal affairs, saying last week that it has “no interest whatsoever in doing so”. On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Ottawa released a statement on its website, condemning the expulsion and reiterating its position that Beijing has never meddled in Canada’s domestic affairs. The statement also added that the embassy had lodged a formal complaint with the Chinese government. “China will resolutely take countermeasures,” the statement warned. “If the Canadian side acts recklessly, China will definitely fight back resolutely and forcefully.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been under pressure to take action after the Globe and Mail newspaper reported earlier this month that China had sought information about any relatives of a Canadian legislator “who may be located” within its borders. The move was likely part of an effort to “make an example of this MP and deter others” from taking anti-China positions, the newspaper said, citing Canada’s spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). While the CSIS report did not name the lawmaker, the Globe said a national security source identified the targeted politician as Michael Chong, a member of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada. China sanctioned Chong in 2021 after he spearheaded a Canadian parliamentary motion condemning Beijing’s treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority as a “genocide” – a charge rejected by the Chinese government for years. “It shouldn’t have taken this long,” Chong said during a news conference on Monday afternoon, responding to Canada’s announcement that it was blacklisting Zhao, the Chinese diplomat. “We have known for years that the PRC [People’s Republic of China] is using its accredited diplomats here in Canada to target Canadians and their families,” Chong said. “I hope that this makes it clear to not just the PRC but other authoritarian states that have representation here in Canada that this crossing the line of diplomacy into foreign interference threat activities is utterly unacceptable here on Canadian soil.” The accusations this month have led to renewed tensions between Ottawa and Beijing . The two countries have had frosty relations for several years over a range of issues, including human rights, trade, and the arrests of Canadian and Chinese citizens. Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador to the country on Friday over the allegations of intimidation against Chong, stressing that it was mulling all necessary measures to defend its sovereignty. Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, hit back by accusing the Canadian government of advancing a “groundless smear” against China’s diplomatic and consular mission in Canada. Canada has decided to declare persona non grata, Mr. Zhao Wei. pic.twitter.com/rZXeNTtdV4 — Mélanie Joly (@melaniejoly) May 8, 2023  “A handful of Canadian politicians and media have hyped up a fabricated story of ‘China targeting a Canadian lawmaker’, which is nothing but a political stunt that grew out of ideological bias,” Mao said during a news conference last week. “I want to stress that the Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel in Canada always abide by relevant international conventions and perform their duties in accordance with the law. The Chinese side will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard its own interests.” Joly, Canada’s foreign minister, said on Monday that decision to blacklist Zhao came “after careful consideration of all factors at play”. “We remain firm in our resolve that defending our democracy is one of the utmost importance,” she said. But Heather McPherson, a member of the left-wing New Democratic Party, said on Monday that it was “appalling” and “unacceptable” that it took the government as long as it did to declare Zhao “persona non grata”. “We don’t know if there are other examples” of intimidation, McPherson told reporters. “There are members of the Chinese-Canadian community who have been warning about interference, [who] have been warning about intimidation, for decades.” Ottawa continues to face calls to investigate other alleged instances of Chinese interference, including attempts to meddle in Canadian elections and the use of covert “police stations” in Canada . Beijing has rejected those allegations, as well.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Flooded out: Québec’s Record Wet July 10. Canada Day tornado in Alberta Introduction The degree of devastation across Canada in 2023 was difficult to comprehend. It was not a pretty picture given countless scenes of charred landscapes, scorched shells of former homes, and debris piles as evidence of powerful tempests, dried out riverbeds, and fields underwater as far as you could see. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets belied the hazy yellow-orange sky that you often could smell and taste - not the pristine, fresh air that is so much part of the Canadian environment. It was hard for the world to believe that such smoky skies could emanate from Canada. Across the country, more than ¼ million Canadians had their lives upended by fires and floods and some on two or three occasions. Even worse, lives were taken and many more lost their livelihoods, homes and possessions. Nearly 90% of the Alert Ready warnings issued in 2023 came from wildfire and weather hazards. The extremes we saw in 2023 were devastating in many ways, but this is what climate change looks and feels like. What we saw this year only serves as a preview of what the future could bring if emissions of greenhouse gases are not rapidly curtailed. As the climate continues to warm, one can expect increasing wildfires, more intense droughts and hurricanes, and more intense heat waves. Not in 28 years of Top Ten Weather Events has there been a more obvious number one story than Record wildfires in 2023. In fact, it could have represented four stories in one this year: record area burned, continuation of multi-year drought, torrid heat and foul smoky skies for months on end. At times, out-of-control fires burned in nearly every province and territory. It was a story that captured international attention for much of the year. Fighting wildfires across Canada was a national preoccupation over three seasons, not the usual summer-long activity. In the end, 2023 was the worst wildfire year on record - at least twice the previous worst year and seven times the 10-year average of forests consumed by fires. Entire cities and several Indigenous communities were emptied by the threat of wildfires. Unbelievably, the area burned by wildfires stretched over 18 million hectares. One expert said that more than half the countries in the world could fit their geography into the total area burned this year in Canada. The Earth’s average temperature this summer was one for the record books. Moreover, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year in possibly 125,000 years. For Canada, it was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. Even more noteworthy, if you include May and September, each province and territory recorded their warmest five months on record, with the exception of Atlantic Canada. Warm coastal waters resulted in the hottest ever marine heat wave in Canadian waters. Parts of the Prairie Provinces went from slush in late April to sweat in early May practically making spring a no-show. In Eastern Canada, it was the longest “hot season” on record with days above 30°C for the first time in April and October. In late January and February, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing from the North to West to East. Across the West, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal for some of the lowest temperature departures in a generation. With biting winds, temperatures felt as low as -59 with wind chill in northern Québec. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. Even ski resorts reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. It was a year when Western Canada had too little precipitation – unable to get a drop of rain to squelch wildfires or relieve drought, and the East had too much precipitation – just too wet for too long and too often. Before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Power outages affected over a million customers in Québec and Ontario. Flooding was another big story this year, including the new age flood of an urban kind in Prairie cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, and two- or three-times in Eastern cities like Québec City, Ottawa and Montréal. Outside of Halifax six weeks after fast-moving wildfires burned through the western half of the province, the region was hit by torrential downpours resulting in the devastating loss of four people, including two young children. Floods also caused unimaginable damage to personal property and infrastructure. Initial forecasts predicted a quieter start to the Atlantic hurricane season compared to the past six years but unseasonably warm Atlantic Ocean waters led to another very active tropical storm season. Canada was touched by the remains of two major hurricanes: Franklin and Lee. Lee was the most powerful hurricane to affect Canada, but it was no Fiona. On September 16, post-tropical Lee lashed the region with strong winds and heavy rains. Power outages from wind gusts topping 117 km/h in Nova Scotia and around the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick grew storm surges with a peak wave of 16 m that destroyed precious beach and park properties along exposed shorelines. In total, the Atlantic basin had 19 named storms, including seven hurricanes of which three were major. It is very challenging to obtain an accurate count of tornadoes, as they are difficult to confirm and may go undetected in rural areas. The estimate in 2023 is around 82 tornadoes in Canada. Of significance, a Canada Day tornado in Alberta ranked EF4 with strongest estimated wind speed of 275 km/h. It was said to be the most powerful Alberta twister since Edmonton’s major tornado in 1987. Based on preliminary estimates compiled by Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. (CatIQ), there were 27 major weather events from December 2022 to November 2023, each with insured cost losses of at least $30 million and with an aggregate loss approaching $3.5 billion. It will be months before the insurance industry tallies final figures, and it will be only a fraction of the actual cost to properties, businesses and infrastructure, and emotional costs to affected Canadians. Top 10 Weather Events in 2023 1. Record wildfires A thick layer of smoke emanates from forest fires on the west side of Okanagan Lake. Image credit: Gabor Fricska The wildfire season across Canada was one for the record books on so many fronts. It began early, ended late, burned faster and was extremely active from British Columbia and the Territories to the Atlantic coast. Fighting wildfires in Canada often occurs on one side of the country at a time; this year massive wildfires were everywhere at once and lasted many months. On June 6, there were out-of-control fires burning in every single province and territory except in Prince Edward Island and Nunavut. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in Winnipeg reported that the number of wildfires was above average, but there was an unbelievable record high total of woodland consumed - seven times the 10-year average. As cloud-to-ground lightning activity was recorded at the third lowest level in 22 years between January and September inclusive, lightning was clearly not the only cause of the wildland fires. Among the wildfire records shattered and statistics of 2023 were: 184,493 square kilometres of woodland up in smoke across Canada - the equivalent of nearly 1.5 times the size of the Maritime Provinces. By June 27, Canada had already surpassed its historic record for total area burned but the country continued to burn. The amount burned was more than double the previous high of 70,000 square km consumed in 1995 and dwarfed the 10-year average of 27,538 square km. According to provincial/territorial forestry officials in British Columbia, Alberta, Québec, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories, their jurisdictions burned a record total area, dating back to 1980. The area burned in Canada was more than the total area burned in the United States in the last five years --- that is 150,000 square km. Two fires exceeded one million hectares in Québec and British Columbia. In 2023 the average size of forest fires was 2,693 ha, compared to the historic average of 350 to 500 ha. Fortunately, no civilians died from wildfires, but tragically, at least four firefighters died while on duty in Canada. According to the Canadian Wildfire Evacuation Database, by the middle of September, 297 evacuation orders had been issued nationally. Evacuations numbered 235,458 people or as large as the population of Saskatoon, Burnaby or Vaughan. It included 20,000 residents from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories’ capital city and several other communities in southern areas of the territory. Citizens in West Kelowna, British Columbia and Sept Iles, Québec also left home including countless First Nations communities across the country. Even residents in Bathurst Inlet in Nunavut were forced to evacuate on August 11 – the first time a Nunavut community was evacuated for a wildfire. Some residents had to flee two or three times and travel 2,700 km away from home. Over 10,800 forest firefighters, nearly half of those from international crews, started fighting fires in May and were still there five months later. Property losses from six large fires numbered 17,000 claims for a total of over $1.1 billion not counting wildfires in Québec. Alberta This year’s fire season was unprecedented being both exceptionally early and widespread. In early May, a strong high-pressure ridge, said to be the strongest ever seen in four decades, created an early heat wave across the West. In Alberta, May temperatures averaged about 5 degrees warmer than normal – the warmest in 76 years of records. Spring in Alberta was also drier than in recent years and humidity was very low, pushing the start of the fire season much earlier than usual. Among the hot spots, Edmonton broke records for May close to 6 degrees above normal. Calgary had their second hottest May on record, some 4.5 degrees above normal. Once ignited, strong winds fanned dozens of fires in central and northern Alberta forcing 38,000 Albertans to evacuate by May 8. By May 12, nearly the entire province was under a fire ban and 19 local states of emergencies were in effect. In Edson, Alberta residents were evacuated on June 9 for the second time this spring. Flames closed several transportation routes shutting down access to dozens of parks and recreational areas. Fires also halted oil and gas activity representing nearly 5% of the nation’s petroleum production. By the end of May, wildfires had charred nearly 1.2 million ha, almost 100 times more than last year at that time. Around late May and June with rain falling, forest-fire crews began moving East to combat huge fires across the Maritimes and Québec. Nova Scotia The Maritimes went through one of their driest springs in several years. At the same time, meagre winter snow cover disappeared quickly leaving the moisture deficit on forest floors scanty and more typical of July than May. From February to May inclusive, total precipitation in Halifax was less than half of normal. Conditions were especially dry in April when several stations in Nova Scotia experienced their driest month on record. In May and early June, temperatures soared to 33°C and, as it turned out were the warmest few days of the entire summer, some 12 degrees above normal. As a consequence, when wildfires started up in May they were intense and fast-moving across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Further, significant amounts of fuel were left drying out after Hurricane Fiona raked the region eight months earlier. Out-of-control fires in late May forced 18,000 people from their homes in Halifax where the Tantallon fire was raging, and in a largely forested area of Shelburne County southeast of Yarmouth - the largest wildfires ever in Nova Scotia. Fires spread rapidly driven by hot, steady, gusty winds. Out-of-control fires prompted officials to impose widespread bans for hiking, camping, fishing and for forestry and mining operations. In total, more than 200 homes and other structures were fire-damaged or destroyed, mostly in northwest Halifax. Property insurance costs were estimated at $250 million. In early June, multi-day rainfalls between 100 and 175 mm helped to extinguish the flames. Québec Record-breaking heat around June 1 across western Québec, added to record dry weather through much of winter and spring, created tinder dry conditions across the province. Too many fires ignited at once and spread quickly. June wildfires in Québec burned nine times as much land as in any previous decade combined. Major hot spots occurred in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and along the North Shore region of eastern Québec. A state of emergency was declared in Sept-Iles on June 2 forcing 5,000 people out of their homes. Some residents in Lebel-sur-Quévillon had to flee their properties on two occasions. Several mines in the province suspended operations because of the fire risk. Hydro-Québec airlifted close to 200 workers from hydro stations in northern Québec. Foreign fire fighters joined provincial-manned crews to extinguish flames. Hundreds of Canadian Forces personnel assisted with evacuations and firefighting. Northerly winds pushed smoke from Québec and northeastern Ontario fires into Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto and major cities in the eastern United States. Rains at the beginning of July helped extinguish some fires, although large blazes still burned out-of-control near James Bay. British Columbia Three years of unusually warm temperatures and scanty precipitation left conditions in much of British Columbia tinder dry at the end of April 2023. May ranked the warmest in 76 years, more than half a degree warmer than the second warmest May in 1998 (also a frightfully bad forest fire year). Much of the winter’s snowpack disappeared quickly denying rivers a steady flow through spring and early summer. By mid-May, special air quality statements and smoky sky bulletins had already been issued for several communities in Northeastern British Columbia. With hot flames and suffocating smoke threatening the region, 40,000 people were under an evacuation order or alert before the long weekend in May. The Donnie Creek fire between Fort St. John and Fort Nelson was well underway. This lightning-ignited fire began on May 12th and was still burning strongly and out-of-control at the end of September to become the longest burning wildfire in the province’s history, and the largest (5,800 square km). Dryness grew worse in summer and consequently fires grew aggressively across the entire province. Often 350 to 400 fires were burning at once with two thirds of them designated as out-of-control. There was rarely a respite for thousands of firefighters or the military. Evacuations from towns, rural areas, resorts, and vacation spots and First Nations communities continued all summer. In central British Columbia, following months of persistent dryness there was a meagre rainfall of 3.8 mm from July 13 and August 21. The erratic gusty winds, heat-dome temperatures, and thousands of lightning strikes in July ignited hundreds of wildfires in and around the Okanagan. In July, almost 170,000 lightning strikes hit the ground, or 55% more than normal, for the third most active July in 22 years of records. From the Okanagan Valley to the Fraser Canyon and east of Kamloops in the Shuswap-Adams Lake region, fires ignited in July but took off in mid-August forcing thousands of residents to stand on evacuation alert. Temperatures soared between 37°C and 42°C in parts of the Okanagan. The McDougall fire just 10 km from West Kelowna exploded 100 times its original size in less than one week and stayed ablaze for more than a month. Nearly 200 structures in parts of beleaguered West Kelowna, Westbank First Nations and in Kelowna were partially or entirely destroyed including the Lake Okanagan Resort. On August 5, northeast of Kamloops the Bush Creek-Adams Lakes fire doubled in size in two days scorching properties in Shuswap and on both sides of Adams Lake. On August 20, there was hope when Tropical Storm Hilary spun up from Mexico and started wetting eastern British Columbia but not further west where the rain was mostly needed. The airspace above Kelowna Airport closed to support aerial firefighters. In the Shuswap region, 170 homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged by fires. Across the West Kelowna and Bush Creek fires more than 22,000 residents were on evacuation orders or alerts. Even in Osoyoos, wildfires burned properties and forced evacuations but, in this case, it was fires from Washington State that came northward. Fire behaviour in British Columbia received a late-summer boost from higher-than-normal temperatures and lower than normal rainfall, especially in the north. The wildfire season remained in full swing for months. In the first week of October, 317 active fires were still burning across the province. Northwest Territories All spring and summer, the Northwest Territories experienced record high temperatures and negligible rainfall accelerating the wildfire threat. But the seeds of the unprecedented fire season were sown at least four years ago. In Yellowknife, almost every month since the end of 2020 was drier than normal for a combined moisture deficit of 340 mm in 36 months. Further evidence of the drought, historic low water levels along the Mackenzie River forced lengthy detours for goods in transit. Around mid-August, a ridge of high pressure settled over the territory sending temperatures soaring further, desiccating forests even more, and worsening conditions because of strong winds and frequent strikes from dry lightning. Forests had enough heat and dry stress and over 200 wild and unpredictable fires ignited with the majority out of control. The fire front was 60 km away from Hay River, Northwest Territories on August 13 pushed by strong wind gusts up to 70 km/h. The hamlet of nearby Enterprise was engulfed by the blaze and 80% of the town was burned down. By mid-August, fires grew dangerously close to several communities: 2 km from Hay River and 1 km from the airport; 4 km away from Fort Smith; 7 km from K’atl’odeeche First Nation and 15 km from the capital of Yellowknife. On August 18, out of control wildfires around Great Slave Lake forced officials to invoke mass evacuations involving thousands of people (nearly two thirds of the Northwest Territories’ residents), and also forced postponement of territorial elections until November 14. With fires so close and heavy smoke and falling ash choking the city of Yellowknife, an historic evacuation order was issued at 12 pm on August 18 and incredibly, 95% of the city heeded the order and stayed away for almost three weeks. Some travelled as far away as 3,000 km away, returning home after the second week of September. At the end, not all fires were extinguished. On October 16, 303 fires had consumed 4.2 million ha – ten times the 25-year average and with 91 fires still active as of November 21. 2. Canada cloaked in smoke Smoke clouds rise over Dartmouth Nova Scotia and partially block out the sun. Image credit: Sansom Marchand With choking smoke filling the air across Canada, nobody was untouched by the devastating wildfires in 2023, and it was not just in Canada. Although Canada usually gets a bad reputation south of border for sending cold air, during the summer of 2023 plumes of acrid smoke travelled to the United States from Canada, making headlines in New York City and in many other parts of the country. More than 100 million Americans faced restricted breathing under poor air quality owing to smoke from Eastern Canada in June and May and later in the summer and fall from western and territorial wildfires. Further, smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic Ocean and fouled the air over Greenland, Iceland and other parts of Europe. Smoke brought hazy skies beginning in April to northeastern British Columbia when lightning ignited the Donnie Creek fire. Skies were still foul in October with over 753 fires still burning across Canada, nearly half described as “out of control”. In hot fire zones across Canada, poor visibility from smoke was a daily occurrence and so awful that at times fire crews could not even see what they were battling. Before the long weekend in May, wildfires in Alberta had already burned three times the annual burn in an average year. May wildfires in the west had cloaked most of Alberta and Saskatchewan and much of British Columbia with smoke such that air quality health indices were 10+ or very high risk. The risk was so high in Edmonton that the city launched its first extreme weather response to poor air quality: schools began holding recess indoors and cancelling outdoor excursions. Canadians in cities suffered with some of the worst air quality on Earth. At times, smoke shielded fires from the sun keeping temperatures below forecasted highs. Smoke was bad for crops too, hiding the sun and slowing plant growth. Late summer-early fall fires in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Alberta tainted the skies from western North America to the Great Lakes. In September, Yellowknife again found itself menaced by nearby fires, this time by thick smoke that turned skies an apocalyptic dark orange. On September 23, the city-hosted celebrations for returning home from three weeks of wildfire-forced evacuations had to be cancelled due to poor air quality. In Eastern North America, special air quality statements are not frequently issued due to smoke from Canadian wildfires, especially fires in eastern Canada. Smoky skies this June came largely from fires raging across Nova Scotia, northern and central Québec and northeastern Ontario. A low-pressure system over Maine and off Nova Scotia provided a counter-clockwise flow to funnel Canadian smoke southward. Occasional rainfall was not enough to extinguish wildfires until winds also had shifted. For much of June, thick smoke covered southern Ontario and Québec in concentrations well past the unhealthy threshold. The smell of smoke was inescapable as yellowish smog blurred city skylines. Montréal had the worst air quality in the world on the morning of June 25. Its fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration was 243, reaching 38 times the World Health Organization's air quality guideline. On June 7, air quality in Ottawa was rated high risk at 10+. The amount of fine particulate matter in Ottawa's air hit 511 when PM2.5 normally ranges from 4 to 11. Another blast of smoke at 243 on June 25 forced Dragon Boat Festival and the Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival to be cancelled. The City also cancelled all outdoor recreational programs, closed outdoor pools, and issued no-swim advisories at city beaches. Yellow-tinted smoke settled over Toronto on several days in June. Under smoky haze, the smoke plume was so dense that airports had to pause or slow air traffic operations due to poor visibility. City hospitals saw a surge in the number of people visiting emergency departments with respiratory issues. At times winds would dissipate the smoke and rain scrub the air only for foul air to return within a day or two, often going from bad to worse. The number of smoke hours from May to early September, as defined when visibility is less than 9.7 km, revealed record-breaking smoke conditions across much of western, central and northern Canada. The city with the highest number of smoke hours was Fort Nelson with 1054 hours, followed by Fort St. John (867), La Ronge (802) and Peace River/Grand Prairie (625-644). Several major cities, including Kamloops, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Yellowknife, experience more than 200 hours of smoke. 3. Hottest Summer – on Earth and in Canada The sun is rising above the silhouette of residential buildings. On Earth Blistering, baking, broiling, and “hell on Earth” were just some of the descriptors used to describe the record hot summer across the Northern Hemisphere in 2023. There is no question it was the warmest summer since 1940, and likely back to 1850 (the start of the pre-industrial averaging period) and, if reconstructing past climates using geological and biological evidence, likely the warmest in history dating back to when human beings began appearing 120,000 years ago. June 2023 was the hottest June ever, some 1.5°C above the 20th century average. July 2023 was the warmest month ever recorded globally, beating the previous warmest July in 2019 and some 1.5°C above the 1850 to 1900 average. The United States’ National Oceanic Atmospheric Association declared July 7, 2023 the hottest day on Earth at 17.42°C, beating the previous warmest just days earlier. August 2023 was the hottest August on record. For the three summer months, the Northern Hemisphere averaged 16.77°C - that is 0.66°C warmer than the current 1991-2020 average. September kept the record warmth going when the World Meteorological Organization announced it to be the warmest September on record. In the Southern Hemisphere, well-above average temperatures especially in August also occurred across Australia and New Zealand, several South American countries and around much of Antarctica where sea ice was at its lowest extent since satellite records began in 1979. Thus, with both hemispheres abnormally warm, Earth easily had its warmest June-to-August on record. Coming out of the warmest summer and September on record, 2023 featured the Earth’s warmest first nine months on record. Several factors contributed to the unprecedented heat. Record marine heat waves across several ocean basins stoked the heat throughout the summer and compounded the effects of ongoing anthropogenic climate change. With super-heated El Nino waters only expanding and strengthening in the tropical eastern Pacific, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year on record in more than 150 years. In Canada Canada contributed more than its share to the Earth’s record hot summer. It was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. The average temperature anomaly was +2.0°C, beating the previous warmest in 2012. The warmest summers on record (with positive anomalies) also occurred in British Columbia (2.1°C), Yukon Territory (2.9°C) and Northwest Territories (3.1°C). Even more noteworthy, if we add May and September to the traditional three summer months, each province and territory, with the exception of Atlantic Canada, recorded their warmest five months on record. Atlantic Canada was left out of the top because it was too busy being too wet. Ocean temperatures bathing Canadian coastal waters were shockingly hot and with peaks occurring much earlier than ever before. At summer’s peak (July 17 to August 7), the Canadian Atlantic surface waters were 3 to 5 degrees above normal and as hot as it ever has been in the North Atlantic. Unofficially, a hot day in Canada is defined when the day’s maximum temperature exceeds 30°C. In the British Columbia Interior hot days were far above historic averages. Kamloops recorded 62 hot days in 2023, compared to a historic average of 33. And Lytton, which in 2021 set a new record for the hottest day ever in Canada, topped 30°C for 71 days - 38 days above the average. Canada’s hottest temperatures in 2023 occurred during a sweltering and protracted heat wave in mid-August when the day’s maximum exceeded 40°C in five locations. Lytton was Canada’s hot spot in 2023 at 42.2°C on August 15. Temperature soared above 37°C in the Northwest Territories in early July. Fort Good Hope, Nunavut reached a record high of 37.4°C on July 8, more than two degrees above the previous record. Within sight of the Arctic Circle, the small town of Norman Wells hit 37.9°C also on July 8. It was easily the farthest north in Canada with a reading of 37°C or higher in the Canadian climate record, and just 0.1°C shy of the hottest temperature ever observed that far north in the world. In Yukon, Carmacks set an all-time daily maximum temperature record on July 7 at 35.5°C the third-hottest daytime temperature ever recorded in Yukon. In Winnipeg, winter ended and summer began on May 1 when the coldest March and April ended and the warmest May and June ever on record began. Both July and August were cooler than normal followed by a very warm September making for a relatively long summer and one of the longest growing seasons on record. Across the Great Lakes and Atlantic Canada summer temperatures were hardly hot. Some of Canada’s largest cities in the East did not experience a hot day from the second week of July to the first week of September. All that Toronto could muster this summer was 33°C. By mid-summer, Easterners had written summer off. But summer came back when Ottawa registered four days above 30°C in September and two in October. Never before in 141 years of weather records has Ottawa ever seen a temperature above 30°C after September 22. Montréal went 58 days in mid to late summer without registering a 30°C day. Neither Montréal nor Toronto had a 30°C temperature in September in the previous four years. This year’s September sizzle made up for that when consecutive hot days numbered four or five around Labour Day. Even more spectacular, the dog days of summer showed up in early October with at least two days above 30°C. Even after snow and cold arrived in the West at the end of October, parts of the East were still breaking warm temperature records. 4. Deadly deluge in Nova Scotia A road in Belmont, Nova Scotia, damaged by this summer’s floods. Image credit: Lexie Barkhouse Following a record dry spring and several 30+°C days at the end of May, fast-moving and devastating wildfires burned through parts of western Nova Scotia and suburban Halifax. While fires burned in early June, incessant rains started squelching flames and lessening the threat of wildfires as the month progressed. By the end of June, 214 mm of rain had fallen in Halifax, nearly 2 ¼ times the average monthly total. July was also wet with 187 mm - nearly double the normal. But in July almost all the rain fell in less than two days on July 21-22 when a slow-moving trough of low pressure moved into the Maritimes. A sizable plume of tropical moisture also streamed into the region from the south and positioned over some of the warmest ocean waters ever seen in the North Atlantic, surface waters two or four degrees warmer than usual. A high-pressure system to the east enabled embedded thunderstorms to tap into the tropical air, efficiently wringing out copious amounts of water. Torrential downpours started in the afternoon of July 21 and by the end of the next day between 200 and 250 mm of rain fell across the province's southwestern shore, in parts of Halifax and in the central and western parts of the province. It was a summer’s total in one day - the most significant rainfall event in the Halifax area since Hurricane Beth on August 16, 1971. Because rains had been falling for most of the previous six weeks, the ground was already saturated with little ability to absorb further rainwater. The consistent nature of the thunderstorms was frightening. At Halifax International Airport, the heavy downpours started just before 4 pm on July 21 following several hours of fog. Over the next 28 hours, rain fell continuously during 10 thunderstorm hours in a process known as “training”. Like freight cars on a railroad spur, new thunderstorms developed as old ones dissipated. It finally stopped raining at 4 pm on July 22. Rainfall intensities were torrential – 100 mm in one hour and 173 mm in six hours in Bedford – a new national record and shattering the once in 100-year rainfall return period. The Bedford-Sackville area, Hammonds Plains, and the Annapolis Valley experienced some of the heaviest rains in more than half a century. Tragedy unfolded as families fled their homes; four lives were lost, including two young children. The damage and heartache that followed was unimaginable. Rivers formed where there had been roads, with as many as 50 roads remained impassable and 50 more washed out. At least seven bridges had to be replaced or rebuilt and 19 others repaired. About 1000 people were forced to flee their homes overnight. Nova Scotia Power had to deal with outages in the Halifax and Liverpool areas caused by non-stop lightning leaving 80,000 homes and businesses across the province without power. Nova Scotia saw the most July lightning ever recorded in the province in over 22 years, and almost all of it came from the single storm on July 21: 26,194 lightning strikes in July of which 23,008 struck on July 21 and 22. There was a province-wide state of emergency declared on July 21 for 2 ½ weeks. This is the same area where wildfires destroyed 150 homes two months earlier. Agriculture losses were also extensive owing to flooded fields, road washouts and crops of hay, soybeans and vegetables left submerged for several days. Following momentous rains on July 21-22, other big storms occurred in July and August leading to more flash flooding and water pooling. Halifax summer rains amounted to twice the normal at 619 mm. Elsewhere in the province at some private weather stations between 700 and 900 mm of rain fell including a whopping 981 mm at Mahone Bay. Total summer rainfall in New Brunswick ranged between 500 and 600+ mm or about 60 to 80% above normal. Rains from Hurricane Lee in September and Tropical Storm Philippe in October only added to the wettest five months in Maritime history. 5. Canada dry in the West and wet in the East Cattle grazing in dry pasture in Steveville, Alberta. Image credit: Kyle Brittain At the beginning of June, most of Canada was abnormally dry with large areas in the West in a state of moderate to extreme drought, because the first five months of 2023 lacked precipitation in the region. Drought stretched from coast to coast, in every province or territory. Even farmers in Eastern Canada were concerned about an alarmingly dry spring and maximum temperatures that soared above 30°C in mid-April - never had it been so warm so early in the year. Potato growers in Prince Edward Island were applying more irrigation water in May than in an average July. In Lethbridge, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba, the amount of precipitation from February through May was among the lowest on record in over 100 years, while in Québec’s Cote-Nord region, the moisture shortfall of 150 to 200 mm was the lowest in more than 100 years. Dry in the West Across Western and Northwest Canada, a persistent large high-pressure area stationed over British Columbia and Alberta kept rains away and temperatures elevated by as much as 10 degrees above normal for much of the year. The massive blockage prevented an influx of cooler northern air or any moist Pacific air. Also adding to the dryness was the dearth of a winter snowpack at higher altitudes. In some river basins, glacier-fed waters were the lowest in a century. Further, the snow had melted about six weeks earlier than usual. This meant waterways through parts of the Prairies peaked earlier, denying water for irrigation, fighting wildfires, domestic water supplies, and power generation. In Alberta, the flow of the Bow River was the lowest since 1911. More dry and hot weather in the summer further depleted groundwater, leading to river flows in July looking more like those in September or October. Across British Columbia, 10 months of winter, spring and summer precipitation totals were consistently less than half of normal. Penticton and Vernon experienced their driest summer since records have been kept. Penticton received just 8 mm of rain compared with the normal 105 mm, and Vernon 22 mm instead of its normal 122 mm. And in Kelowna, it was the second-driest summer on record with just 20 mm of rain coming down when 110 mm is the norm. Record drought across the province was a major reason for British Columbia's worst wildfire season ever. By mid-August, more than 80 per cent of the province had reached high to extreme levels of drought - the two highest and worst, possible drought rankings. It was also dry across the southern Prairies and in the Peace River/Grand Prairie region of Alberta. The Northwest Territories was also exceptionally dry extending across Western Nunavut. Across the West, the enduring drought prompted several communities to declare states of local emergency and impose strict water restrictions. Millions of residents and commercial customers were asked to conserve precious drinking water, even cautioning farmers to be frugal with their water usage, as some water reservoirs were nearing empty. It left some ranchers with no choice but to sell their cattle prematurely. Some locations such as McBride, British Columbia had to endure six or more months of water restrictions. The weather was a challenge to the province’s power-generating sector with production the lowest in 15 years. With low water levels, it became too hot for fish to survive and oxygen was depleted, leading to a massive die-off of steelhead trout and salmon. In Alberta, authorities with the St. Mary’s River Irrigation District declared it one of the six driest in the past 99 years. Along the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories, transport companies had to truck - rather than float on barges - goods and commodities at much higher costs. On June 1, two separate thunderstorms featuring intense rain dumped more than 40 mm of rain in Regina. The flash flooding led to basements filling and cars floating. Underpasses filled and cars ploughed through flooded streets creating a wake from rising waters. With all the talk of drought and wildfires in the West, an exception was an area between Red Deer and Edmonton, which was hammered by several days of heavy rains on June 17-20. Rains between 70 and 140 mm fell and in mountainous areas such as Jasper, 20 to 30 cm of snow fell. Edmonton was a real anomaly this summer recording almost 60% more rain than normal. Some residents of the town of Edson, twice forced from their homes by earlier forest fires, were now leaving home due to flooding. On August 24, strong super-cell thunderstorms brought large hail and torrential rainfall to several communities from Manitoba’s Interlake Region through the northern parts of Winnipeg. Selkirk got 110 mm in 30 minutes and Winnipeg got between 20 mm and 30 mm. It stayed dry in British Columbia right up to October 17-19 when an atmospheric river dumped 100 to 200 mm across coastal and central parts of the province. Wet in the East Summer in Southeastern Canada was as moisture-laden as the West and Northwest were dry. Stagnant low-pressure systems were repeatedly positioned between James Bay through the Great Lakes to the Maritimes favouring lengthy bouts of rain, overcast and coolness. Frequent weather systems brought in loads of moisture from tropical sources keeping surfaces wet from days of heavy rain or continuous drizzle. Lows moved in slowly, stalled or retrograded for weeks at a time. Further, there was an absence of the customary Bermuda High and its sunny and dry weather. The Maritimes experienced its wettest summer in history, more than double the normal amount of rainfall. Among the many stations in the Maritimes breaking summer rainfall records were Yarmouth, Greenwood, Kentville, Sydney, Saint John, Fredericton, and Charlottetown. Private weather stations along Nova Scotia’s south shore recorded 843 mm in Liverpool; 981 at Mahone Bay; and 500 to 600+ mm in southern New Brunswick. Saint John received a total of 763 mm of rain in June, July and August, which is almost three times the normal of 271 mm. It rained hard and often. There were 52 days in the summer with some rain when normally there would be 35. There were 24 days with rainfall amounts of 10 mm or more, when normally you would see 11 through summer. Normally, there would be three heavy rainfall events with more than 25 mm of rain, but Saint John had 11 events. Around July 10 to 12, record rains led to dramatic rises in Québec waterways leading to flooding and evacuations from Saguenay to Sherbrooke. More than 135 mm in less than 48 hours sent rivers surging, including the St-Francois River which rose from 2 to 6 m in less than four hours. By the end of July, Sherbrooke recorded three times its normal monthly total. Early on July 12 and into the next day, severe thunderstorms moved through southern Ontario and Québec causing flash flooding and wind damages from tornadoes. Rainfall totals ranged from 50 to 80 mm from Sarnia to Orillia and 50 to 90 mm of rain through the St. Lawrence Valley in Québec, including another 90 mm dump in Montréal. On July 20-21, another classic undercutting cold front of warm humid air triggered a series of supercell thunderstorms travelling from near Windsor to southern Québec. The weather featured microbursts, tornadoes, hailers with baseball-size hail and torrential flash floods. Joliette, Québec received the most rainfall, between 100 to 120 mm, with most of it within two hours. Barely a week later, a series of severe thunderstorms dropped more heavy rains resulting in flash flooding from Southwestern Ontario to Québec City. Storms led to widespread street flooding and left 55,000 without power. On August 3, more storms moved through southern Ontario and Québec, packing billiard ball-size hailstones, violent wind gusts in excess of 110 km/h and torrential downpours. On August 10, between 80 to 120 mm of rain in about an hour and a half fell across Montréal. Roads and underpasses were submerged along with warehouses, schools and lower levels of shopping malls. In Ottawa, with 100 mm of rain in six hours, roads became canals. To avoid flooding, motorists drove on sidewalks or abandoned their cars. Two weeks later a steady stream of showers and thunderstorms pushed through southwestern Ontario on August 23 and 24 bringing storm rainfalls as much as 185 mm to several locations. Flooding led to road washouts and the tragic death of a trucker who perished in a 3-m deep sinkhole. Greatest rainfall totals exceeded 200 mm in Pelee Island and Harrow, Ontario. Some of the moisture came from the remnants of Tropical Storm Hilary from Mexico via British Columbia and the prairies. Insurance costs to property losses from some of the more impactful storms this summer in Ontario and Québec totalled more than three quarters of a billion dollars. 6. Hurricane Lee… no Fiona but more than a windy day A man in a yellow rain suit is looking out to Indian Harbour in Nova Scotia in the first hours of Hurricane Lee. Image credit: Doug Mercer In early spring, forecasters predicted a below normal to average number of tropical storms for the Atlantic Ocean basin in 2023. That would be a change from six years of active storm seasons. An El Nino established and strengthened in the tropical Pacific Ocean, stronger atmospheric wind shear would most likely suppress the development and growth of Atlantic tropical storms by blowing the storms apart. However, by early August, forecasters revised their numbers upward calling for up to 21 named storms. El Nino was still present, if not stronger. However, record hot tropical seawaters would potentially counterbalance the shearing effects of El Nino. Around mid-August, the Atlantic hurricane season came alive after several weeks of little to no tropical activity. Tropical Storm Franklin, the season’s first major storm, remained offshore as it passed south of Atlantic Canada at the end of August. St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador received about 36 mm of rain over 19 hours on August 30 and 31, with wind gusts peaking at 76 km/h. On September 23, Ophelia was the 15th storm of the season. Only six storms were hurricane strength, of which three were major (Franklin, Idalia and Lee). In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Hilary was an odd storm of sorts. She formed over the Mexican State of Baja dropping a record 330 mm of rain in 24 hours on the Baja state before barreling up the hot Gulf of California and bringing record rains to Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. After soaking the desert southwest, she headed northward bringing badly needed rains to the eastern parts of British Columbia in the Kootenays and the Columbia Valley on August 20, but not to the rain-starved and fire-swept Okanagan Valley. The remains of Hilary moved across Saskatchewan and Manitoba on August 22. Two days later Hilary’s leftovers merged with another storm over southern Ontario. Several rounds of rain brought two months of rain in two days - above 200 mm - to communities there, causing extensive road flooding, filled basements and garages, and backed-up sewers. Major highways were closed for up to 12 hours due to flowing water. Near Glencoe, a life was lost after a transport truck fell through a sinkhole on a district road. In early September, another weather disturbance emerged from the west coast of Africa. In the next days, a tropical cyclone formed and quickly intensified into a powerful hurricane over the central tropical Atlantic. Storm Lee grew from a Category 1 to 5 hurricane in less than 24 hours with winds at 269 km/h - the third most rapidly intensifying storm in history and one of the 40 most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. As quickly as Lee grew, it weakened to a Category 3, but still a major hurricane. Hurricane Lee passed north of the Caribbean Sea on the 11th and started traveling toward the Gulf Stream. It stayed out over the ocean, and on the 14th, headed straight north for New England and the Canadian Maritimes. As Lee began to lose its strength, across the cooler Northern waters, some churned up by the blustery motion of storms Franklin and Idalia, it also widened its wind field as it transitioned to a Post-Tropical Cyclone. At one time, Lee’s size extended out to 145 km with hurricane-force winds and 500 km with tropical storm winds. Few Maritimers would not feel the effects of Lee’s wrath no matter where it made landfall during the weekend. Even while diminishing, Lee packed tree-felling wind speeds, flooding rains, and high surf to parts of coastal New England and into southwest Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy on the weekend of September 15 to 17, almost a year after Hurricane Fiona hammered the Maritimes, Québec and Newfoundland. Lee was compared to Fiona but, as it turned out, it was not the same intensity and magnitude storm. Lee became a post-tropical storm around 6 am Saturday, September 16 but retained its Category-1 force winds. Lee first made landfall on Long Island, Nova Scotia in the Digby Neck late afternoon and in a second landfall in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island after crossing the Bay of Fundy. Winds blew over 100 km/h at landfall in the west and northeastern area of Nova Scotia but peak winds were clocked at 117 km/h at Halifax International Airport. Large waves topped 5 to 7 metres with a peak wave at the Halifax harbour buoy of 16 metres. Storm rainfalls ranged from 50 to 150 mm. Days before Lee’s arrival as a post-tropical storm, store shelves started emptying from a wary citizenry still remembering the impacts of Hurricane Fiona. Residents stocked up on propane, bottled water, canned goods, batteries and flashlights and “storm chips”. Boaters pulled their vessels from the water and lashed down their gear along the coast. Many flights and ferry crossings were cancelled. At the height of the storm, 350,000 customers were without power and internet connection. Of major concern in the Maritimes was the sodden ground from weeks of heavy rain in a full summer of torrential record rains. Leafed trees made it easier for Lee’s winds to bring down trees and power lines. The storm surge pushed large waves and rocks onto coasts, destroying beaches and parks and washing out trails. Some beaches and parks, like Rissers Beach Provincial Park in Nova Scotia, were completely ruined; coastal roads were made impassable, bridges closed, trees downed, basements flooded, signage was scattered and traffic lights were left dangling. Three weeks later, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, tropical storm Philippe tracked very close to where Lee had made landfall in the Maritimes. Not as powerful as Lee, Philippe also transitioned into a post-tropical storm after merging with a non-tropical system and brought between 50 and 80 mm of rain and strong winds between 70 and 90 km/h across the Maritimes and parts of eastern Québec but leaving Newfoundland and Labrador alone. Significant wave heights south of Nova Scotia reached above 5 metres but were not a problem in the Bay of Fundy. 7. April glaze storm in Montréal-Ottawa – more beast than beauty A residential street in Ottawa is covered in snow and ice after an ice storm in April. Image credit: Brittaney Pilon On April 5, 2023 before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Ahead of the storm, mild air flooded the region and a cold front undercut the mildness, destabilizing the atmosphere. The unsettled weather prompted tornado watches in southwestern Ontario and heavy rain warnings across the province. Persistent winds through the low-lying valleys of the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence rivers kept surface temperatures hovering just below freezing for most of the day. The bad mix led to several hours of freezing rain and rain with a few early season “thundersnows”. Hearing thunder and the ping of freezing ice balls bouncing off surfaces created a real buzz across eastern Ontario and southern Québec. The ugly weather then featured up to twelve continuous hours of freezing rain in Montréal and nine in Ottawa. Ice accretion amounts totalled 30 to 37 mm in Montréal, 25 to 30 mm in Ottawa-Gatineau, and 15 to 25 mm in central Québec. Accompanying wind gusts of 60 to 70 km/h for two days added enormous stress to ice-encased utility lines and trees. Where heavy rain fell on still-frozen ground, localized flooding swamped backyards and fields and filled basements. Ice build-up on trees and power lines caused extensive damage, including the loss of 300 trees in Montréal. Power outages topped one million customers in Québec including half a million in Montréal and 200,000 in Ontario. Thousands were still without power two days later. There were numerous vehicle accidents and traffic was slowed or stopped on several routes. Sidewalks were also coated with treacherous ice. Ottawa’s light-rail transit went down leaving dozens of commuters waiting hours to be evacuated. Fallen branches and limbs littered streets and properties, damaging cars and smashing windshields. Sadly this ice storm took two lives in Québec. Rising temperatures the next day created the ominous sight and sound of ice falling from trees, power lines and balconies. Numerous businesses were closed including clinics and schools, although libraries remained opened to assist as electricity recharging stations. Property losses from floods, winds and icing topped $335 million from Sarnia to Saguenay. 8. Cold spells in a warm year A door opens on about two feet of snow after a snowstorm in Chippawa, Ontario. Image credit: Lauren Eldridge Days before Christmas 2022, and between Christmas and New Year’s Day, Canada was over-run by cold air, dangerous wind chills and all kinds of precipitation from heavy rains, freezing rain and ice pellets to heavy snows in blowing conditions. Travel was treacherous and several flights and trains were cancelled or delayed to the point of ruining holiday plans for thousands of Canadians. In addition, power outages were widespread and lengthy making for uncomfortable and disappointing end-of-the-year celebrations. On December 30th and 31st, the weather changed dramatically with the arrival of mild and dry weather. A new year saw a pronounced January thaw from coast to coast. Monthly January temperatures averaged between three to six degrees above normal from Alberta to Newfoundland-Labrador. In parts of Ontario, January was the fourth warmest month in more than 100 years of record-keeping. The four-week balmy spell only added to the severity of the cold at the end of January with a swing to numbing cold. Extreme cold warnings were issued for eight provinces and three territories, shattering several temperature records. The cold snap stood out for its severity but not duration – one of the most intense in recent years. Fortunately, the lack of a blocking high over Greenland allowed less cold air to rebound in the second week of February. Before that, the stratospheric polar vortex sat over Nunavut and the northern part of Hudson Bay in mid-January. On January 14, the deep polar low led to a record -62.4°C in Tongulakh, Siberia - the coldest day recorded anywhere in Russia in the past 20 years. A stationary and circular jet stream kept the polar vortex tightly tied up over the North Pole. Two weeks later an amplified jet stream dislodged the frigid air and the cold pool started to wobble. Eventually, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing through Western Canada. Across most of British Columbia in January, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal. Eventually, the wavering jet stream took the cold across southeastern Canada creating temperatures up to 20 degrees colder than normal. The cold low also came with blustery winds creating biting wind chills as low as -55. South of the border at Mount Washington in New Hampshire the same wind and cold produced a record low wind chill of -77. For eastern Canada, the first week of February featured the coldest air of the entire winter including punishingly cold wind chills. On February 4, 2023, Fredericton recorded -28.9°C; Saint John dipped to -29°C including a wind chill of -47 – an all-time lowest; Ottawa registered -33.1°C on the morning. The dangerous cold elevated risks of frostbite and hypothermia across the country. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. At the peak of the outages, more than 34,000 Maritimers were without power. Frozen and burst gas and water pipes led to flooding and broken infrastructure inside residences, and commercial and municipal structures. Property insurers across eastern Canada reported losses to the tune of $152 million. Travel was also impacted with flight cancellations and delays in public transit. Road assistance services were backlogged several hours. Thousands crowded into shelters and food banks. Even ski resorts reported lower weekend turnouts and reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. The cold finally started growing ice on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa but not enough to create safe skating conditions for Winterlude; for the first time its 53-year history, it was impossible to skate on the Canal in 2023. More cold warnings came into effect during the last week of February, especially in the West. On February 22, extreme cold warnings were issued in Alberta with temperatures feeling like -40 with the wind chill. Adding to the cold were bouts of messy precipitation; 30 cm of snow fell in Calgary, resulting in multiple crashes. In parts of the Prairies, the cold lingered well into March. Winter-weary Winnipeggers broke a record that stood since 1899 with no day in March above 0°C for the first time in 124 years. Farmers and ranchers began struggling financially with having to keep lambs warm and dry and calves and mother cows needing extra shelter and bedding. For some Prairie locations, their coldest moments of the winter occurred in the last 10 days of March. At the end of February, a Pacific frontal system brought around 5 to 15 cm of snow along the Pacific coast. The cold and icy rain and deep snow left a widespread mess to clean up with spun out vehicles, tree-blocked roads and slushy streets and sidewalks. The late-season snowfall caused flight and ferry cancellations, traffic delays and school closures. More snow fell in Vancouver on April 2, which meant that Vancouver got snow six months in a row from November to April, for the first time in 100 years of recorded history. 9. Flooded out: Québec’s Record Wet July A park is submerged by flooding in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Québec Several major weather systems loaded with tropical-sourced moisture brought frequent, intense and flooding rains to central and southern Québec through July. Slow-moving, soppy storm systems were trapped between areas of strong high pressure over Greenland and Western Canada bringing repeated rounds of rain, many embedded with thunderstorms, across the province leading to one of the wettest months ever. By month’s end, Montréal and Québec exceeded 200 mm of rain, more than double their normal monthly accumulation. Sherbrooke was the rainiest with 311 mm over 21 days, including six days with over 28 mm of rain per day, and a monthly total 2.5 times the normal. Besides summer thunderstorms there were occasional tornadoes and downbursts too. The first significant soaking occurred on July 1 when severe thunderstorms dumped torrential rains in the Rivière-Éternité area of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. The resulting flash floods caused roads to collapse, killing two people. Most rain and storm damage occurred during the second week of July. On July 10-11, a slow-moving storm moved up from the American Seaboard dumping huge amounts of rain across an area from Montréal-Sherbrooke-Québec City-Saguenay. Hard to imagine any city handling as much rain as these Québec cities when nearly 80 mm fell in two hours on the 10th, made worse by heavy rains of 40 mm or more days before, and an additional 125 mm in days after. Near Québec City, the town of Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval declared a state of emergency when more than 300 people were forced from their homes. More people were threatened with evacuations when the Saint-François River, which cuts through Sherbrooke, rose six metres in four hours. Sherbrooke had never seen the Saint-Francois River so swollen. Diluvian rains forced the closing of several highways and city streets across the province. In central Montréal, rising waters filled underground parking lots and basements, flushed intersections, swept away culverts, and destroyed key infrastructure. The intense rains and strong wind gusts up to 111 km/h forced delays in dozens of flights out of Montréal Trudeau International Airport. The summer of widespread power outages continued across the province arising from fires in the north and floods in the south. Hydro-Québec reported 500,000 customers without power at the storm’s peak. Repeated storms just days later added more water to waterlogged soil and swelled rivers and overloaded municipal sewers. Outside cities, heavy soaking rains left farm fields saturated and led to erosion, ground subsidence and minor landslides. The soggy scene was repeated on July 20 to 21 and a week later on the 28th and 29th as storms developed and redeveloped between Montréal and Québec. On July 20-21, street flooding in southern Québec forced numerous road closures between Gatineau and the Eastern Townships. Joliette measured 100 to 120 mm of rain (90 mm in less than two hours). By the end of the month, many large municipalities in Québec had come through their wettest July on record. For Montréal it was the wettest July measured at the Airport on record since 1941. In Québec City, it was a record in 150 years, and a similar situation in Sherbrooke. Insurance losses to personal and commercial property from five significant July storms totalled $330 million. 10. Canada Day tornado in Alberta A man stands beside an orange Jeep and watches the Canada Day tornado in Didsbury, Alberta. Image credit: Ricky Forbes On the last days of June and into July, the western Prairies saw days with high temperatures, elevated humidity and unsettled weather. Heat and storm warnings were in effect for much of Alberta. On June 29, Calgary was drenched with heavy rain from a severe thunderstorm causing flash flooding. On July 1, atmospheric conditions really started to boil up along the foothills of the Rockies. Around noon, a severe thunderstorm near Sundrie intensified into a supercell. Shortly before 2 pm, a tornado came twisting out of the supercell on farmland about 70 km north of Calgary. Rain and hailstones the size of golf and tennis balls and strong winds above 100 km/h accompanied the tornado. The twister ripped through 15 to 20 km of rural land about 670 metres at its widest. Estimated wind speeds topped 275 km/h between Didsbury and Carstairs. Based on the damage observed, the tornado received an EF4 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The debris field was unbelievable with toppled and debarked trees, downed power lines, and wrecked buildings. Wind tossed and rolled weighty farm equipment - such as a 10,000-kg combine - like toys, and snapped trees like matchsticks. The tornado damaged a dozen homes. No major injuries or fatalities were reported, however, 40 farm animals lost their lives to the storm. As the severe storms moved across Alberta and into Saskatchewan, they continued to take out trees and rows of fences, and sever gas lines. Debris landed on vehicles and campers adding to the cost of the insured property loss which totalled $100 million from 5,000 claims. Among those Saskatchewan communities inflicted with major losses were Nipawin and Hafford, Tisdale, Tobin Lake and Carrot River. There were 20,000 SaskPower customers without power. It was a busy summer for tornadoes in Ottawa with five tornadoes including an EF1 storm on July 13 that struck Barrhaven, 20 km south of the Ottawa city centre. A research project from Northern Tornado Project out of Western University (NTP) found about 20 tornadoes occurred across the Ottawa Valley over the past six years. It included seven tornadoes on September 21, 2018, one of which was an EF3 in the Dunrobin region with winds up to 265 km/h. Alberta’s Canada Day tornado was the most highly rated twister nationally in 2023. Moreover, it was one of the strongest top 20 tornadoes in Canada’s history to be classified as violent or catastrophic (EF ratings of 4 or more). It is one of only three F4 tornadoes in Alberta and the strongest since the F4 tornado that struck Edmonton 35 years ago. The country's only documented F5 tornado occurred in Elie, Manitoba in June 2007. About 82 tornadoes occurred in 2023. Ontario led with 39 twisters, while 16 occurred in Alberta. While Saskatchewan has an average of 14 tornadoes per year (with highs of 25 in 2022 and 33 in 2012), only one tornado was reported in the province this year. Page details Date modified: 2024-06-10",

See highlights from the ceremony — and the moment the newly crowned King greeted the public from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Social Sharing King Charles III, a man who waited almost 74 years to become King, was crowned Saturday at Westminster Abbey with all the pomp and pageantry Britain could muster. Outside the abbey, thousands of troops, tens of thousands of spectators and a smattering of protesters converged in the rain along the The Mall, the grand avenue to Buckingham Palace in central London, to see Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, as they made the two-kilometre journey to the church in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach. Charles took an oath during the coronation service to govern the people of the United Kingdom with \"justice and mercy.\" WATCH  | The moment King Charles is crowned : See the moment King Charles is crowned 2 years ago Duration 0:42 King Charles was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Saturday in the first coronation ceremony seen live by audiences in North America. Shouts of \"God save the King\" rang out and trumpet blasts echoed after Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St. Edward's Crown on Charles's head, while Camilla received Queen Mary's Crown for her coronation.

(Jane Barlow/Getty Images) As the day began, the abbey buzzed with excitement and was abloom with fragrant flowers and colourful hats as the congregation of international dignitaries, nobles and other notables arrived. Those in attendance included actors Judi Dench and Emma Thompson and musicians Lionel Richie and Nick Cave, who sat alongside politicians, judges in wigs, soldiers with gleaming medals attached to red tunics and members of the House of Lords in their red robes. Dignitaries and world leaders in attendance included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Gov. Gen. Mary Simon and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and eight current and former British prime ministers.

Gov. Gen. Mary Simon was also in attendance, along with Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Heir to the throne Prince William, his wife, Catherine, and their three children were all in attendance. The couple's eldest son, Prince George, was one of four honour pages carrying the train of his grandfather's robe. During the service, William knelt before his father to pledge his loyalty to the monarch. \"I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God,\" William said.

As Charles and other royals joined a military procession afterward, Harry stood waiting outside the abbey until a car arrived to drive him away. Harry's wife Meghan and their children remained at home in California, where the couple has lived since quitting as working royals in 2020.

Once at the palace, they appeared alongside younger generations of royals on the balcony to wave at the crowd below and watch a flypast of military aircraft. Protesters arrested Earlier, the anti-monarchy group Republic said six of its members, including chief executive Graham Smith, were arrested near Trafalgar Square in central London as they prepared to protest the coronation. On the south side of the square, thousands swelled behind metal fencing along the procession route. In the middle of the crowd, dozens of anti-monarchy protesters, held tall yellow banners that read \"not my king\" which they frequently chanted. Police confront anti-monarchy protesters in central London. (Briar Stewart/CBC) Some of those in the crowd shouted back, \"Yes, he is,\" or \"My king, and I am proud of him.\" Thousands decked out in their finest Union Jack attire, along with rain coats and ponchos, easily drowned out the noise from the protest, but they were irritated that demonstrators were taking up prime space and blocking some onlookers with their flags. \"They can protest, but they can't hold their flag,\" shouted Karen from Devon in southwest England. 'People will stop and stare' \"Even in a world where people are sated with on-demand entertainment, people will stop and stare,\" said Michael Cole, a former BBC royal correspondent. He called the coronation \"a spectacular procession and a ritual\" and \"a ceremony, unlike anything that occurs anywhere in the world.\" Royal Fascinator King Charles will vow 'to serve' in coronation service that remains rooted in deep tradition As It Happens Scottish stone shouldn't be in coronation, says son of man who stole it back from England But like the best dramas, it was a show with a message. For 1,000 years and more, British monarchs have been crowned in grandiose ceremonies that confirm their right to rule. Although the King no longer has executive or political power, he remains the U.K.'s head of state and a symbol of national identity.

(Andrew Matthew/Getty Images) At a time when double-digit inflation is making everyone in the U.K. poorer, Charles was keen to show that he can still be a unifying force in a multicultural nation that is very different from the one that greeted his mother. So this was a shorter, less formal affair than the three-hour coronation for Queen Elizabeth II. In 1953, Westminster Abbey was fitted with temporary stands to boost the seating capacity to more than 8,000. Aristocrats wore crimson robes and coronets, and the coronation procession meandered eight kilometres through central London so an estimated three million people could cheer for the glamorous 27-year-old Queen. Queen Elizabeth II died last September at age 96, after a seven-decade reign. Pared-down ceremony Organizers cut Charles's service to less than two hours and sent out 2,300 invitations. Aristocrats were told to avoid ceremonial dress and the procession travelled a shorter, direct route back to Buckingham Palace from the abbey. This followed Charles's instructions for a pared-down ceremony as he has been seeking to create a smaller, less expensive royal machine for the 21st century.

Charles scrapped the traditional moment at the end of the service when nobles were asked to kneel and pledge their loyalty to the king. Instead, the Archbishop of Canterbury invited everyone in the abbey and people watching on television to swear \"true allegiance\" to the monarch. During the Anglican service, Charles, clad in crimson and cream robes, swore on a Bible that he is a \"true Protestant.\" But a preface was added to the coronation oath to say the Church of England \"will seek to foster an environment where people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely.\" WATCH | King Charles waves from Buckingham Palace balcony : King Charles waves from Buckingham Palace balcony 2 years ago Duration 0:58 King Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla — alongside senior working members of the Royal Family — were greeted by cheering crowds as they appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace.

(Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images) Social Sharing Canadians waited 69 years for this moment. So what's another four holes? Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., won the RBC Canadian Open on Sunday at Toronto's Oakdale Golf and Country Club, becoming the first Canadian man to win at home since Pat Fletcher in 1954. \"To kind of break that curse, if [that's] you want to call — I'm pretty speechless. I don't think it's going to sink in for quite some time what happened today,\" Taylor said. What happened was 22 holes of golf filled with highs and lows — and a career-defining putt at the end of it all. WATCH | Taylor makes 72-foot eagle putt to win RBC Canadian Open: Nick Taylor makes 72-foot eagle putt to win RBC Canadian Open 2 years ago Duration 2:26 Taylor nailed the longest putt of his career to clinch the tournament on the fourth playoff hole. Tied at 17-under, Taylor, 35, duelled with England's Tommy Fleetwood over four playoff holes — they matched each other with birdies and pars playing the 18th hole twice before each making a par on the ninth. And so off they went back to the 18th. Fleetwood's tee shot landed in a bunker, but Taylor's settled on the first cut. It allowed the Canadian to attack the green, and he did, leaving himself a long eagle putt. Fleetwood, meanwhile, laid up and was standing over a putt for birdie. Taylor didn't let him hit it — he nailed his own putt from 72 feet, the longest of his career. The crowd around the 18th green leapt with joy. \"For that to drop was a huge surprise, but an amazing one,\" Taylor said. Adam Hadwin, the Abbotsford, B.C., native who tied for 12th in the tournament, couldn't contain his excitement, rushing the green with a bottle of champagne in hand — only to be tackled by an unknowing security guard. Following Nick Taylor’s winning putt, security tackled Adam Hadwin while he was trying to celebrate with Taylor, mistaking him for a fan. <a href=\"https://t.co/G2ZaQhEhIK\">pic.twitter.com/G2ZaQhEhIK</a> &mdash; @TSN_Sports Elsewhere, tears flew and cheers streamed to the Toronto skies, which had been sending down rain throughout most of the playoff. Along with Hadwin, there was Canadian golf royalty: 2003 Masters champion Mike Weir, who lost a playoff of his own at this tournament in 2004, was there, celebrating on the green. \"It means everything. I feel like we all support each other so much, for them to stick around. I think all of us said it this week, if us individually weren't the people to win, we really want another Canadian to do it and break this long drought.\" Corey Conners, the 18-hole leader who struggled Sunday to wind up tied for 20th, was there to embrace Taylor as well. \"It's obviously a thrilling moment for Canadian golf,\" Conners told CBC Sports amid the celebration. \"It's been far too long and I'm so thrilled for Nick.

Fleetwood was greeted by applause as he left the green to sign his scorecard. The crowd, meanwhile, was decidedly on Taylor's side — they booed Fleetwood's bad shots and politely clapped for his good ones. \"Nice moment for Nick and the fans here,\" Fleetwood said. \"So it's great to be a part of that Sunday and that playoff.

'Incredible moment' For Taylor, it was unbridled support, mixed in with nerves. As Taylor kept his place atop the leaderboard through the final regulation holes, the crowds around him gradually swelled. The Canadian was serenaded with the national anthem, as well as many chants with variations of his name. And the release when that shocking putt rattled the cup was reminiscent of a hockey crowd watching its team win a playoff game in the fourth overtime. \"I knew just how pumped they were and they were trying to put every ounce of energy into it to help me pull it through,\" Taylor said. \"To have that moment — I blacked out when that ball went with [caddie] Dave [Markle].

Congrats @ntaylorgolf59! 20 years ago @mweirsy inspired a bunch of Canadians like Nick to pursue their dream, and now Nick has done the same. What a moment for Canadian golf,\" Hughes tweeted.

Playing alongside Fleetwood and Conners on Thursday, Taylor struggled to a 3-over 75, leaving an uphill climb just to make the cut. \"I was on the seventh hole, I remember, first day, my 16th hole, 10 feet for par and made that and birdied 8 and parred the last to somewhat be in the cut sight. So to be standing there and then sitting here today is pretty remarkable,\" Taylor said. On Friday, he lowered his score by eight strokes — more than enough to make the cut, but still leaving him with an early tee time on Saturday. Taylor credited a \"talking-to\" from wife Andie, who was at home for the turnaround.

There were no delays, and golfers said it didn't affect them. By Sunday, Taylor made sure the full focus was on golf.

        "text": "World Canada and Saudi Arabia normalize diplomatic relations after 2018 split By Steve Scherer May 25, 2023 12:32 AM UTC Updated  ago [1/2] Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Arab League summit, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, May 19, 2023. Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout OTTAWA, May 24 (Reuters) - Canada and Saudi Arabia have agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and appoint new ambassadors, both countries said on Wednesday, bringing to a close a 2018 dispute that damaged relations and trade. The decision follows discussions held between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in Bangkok in November last year, according to statements from Canada and Saudi Arabia. The decision stems from \"the desire for both sides to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect and common interests,\" the statements said. The 2018 row pre-dated the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi later that year, which Canada and all Western countries condemned. It started when Canada's embassy in Riyadh published a tweet in Arabic urging the immediate release of women's rights activists held by Saudi Arabia. That prompted Riyadh to recall its ambassador and bar the envoy from returning, and to institute a ban on new trade. \"Punitive trade measures will be lifted,\" said a Canadian government source familiar with the agreement who was not authorized to speak on the record. It is unclear what effect the dispute had on trade. Saudi Arabia was the biggest export market for Canada in the region in 2021, according to official data, when they totaled C$2.2 billion ($1.65 billion). Imports were $2.4 billion. Almost all Canada's imports were oil and petrochemicals. More than 80% of exports to Saudi Arabia were transportation equipment. \"Empty chairs at the end of the day don't push our interests forward, and they don't push things like human rights forward,\" the source added. The normalization comes as the Saudi prince, known as MbS, seeks to reassert Saudi Arabia as a regional power by using his place atop an energy giant in an oil-dependent world consumed by the war in Ukraine. \"Saudi Arabia is pivotal within its region. It's an important player,\" said Roland Paris, Trudeau's former foreign policy adviser and professor of international affairs at University of Ottawa. \"It only makes sense to have ambassadors back in place in order to keep channels of communication open.\" Canada will appoint Jean-Philippe Linteau as its new ambassador in Riyadh. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly has said \"we need to have conversations with people we don't always agree with on everything in order to find global solutions to global problems,\" the source added.

He has selected these stories based on factors including the degree to which Canada was impacted, the extent of the area affected, economic and environmental effects and the event’s longevity as a top news story in Canada and around the world. Watch David Phillips' discussion about the top 10 weather stories of 2023 on Facebook On this page Introduction Top 10 Weather Events in 2023 1. Record wildfires 2. Canada cloaked in smoke 3. Hottest Summer – on Earth and in Canada 4. Deadly deluge in Nova Scotia 5. Canada dry in the West and wet in the East 6. Hurricane Lee… no Fiona but more than a windy day 7. April glaze storm in Montréal-Ottawa – more beast than beauty 8. Cold spells in a warm year 9. Flooded out: Québec’s Record Wet July 10. Canada Day tornado in Alberta Introduction The degree of devastation across Canada in 2023 was difficult to comprehend. It was not a pretty picture given countless scenes of charred landscapes, scorched shells of former homes, and debris piles as evidence of powerful tempests, dried out riverbeds, and fields underwater as far as you could see. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets belied the hazy yellow-orange sky that you often could smell and taste - not the pristine, fresh air that is so much part of the Canadian environment. It was hard for the world to believe that such smoky skies could emanate from Canada. Across the country, more than ¼ million Canadians had their lives upended by fires and floods and some on two or three occasions. Even worse, lives were taken and many more lost their livelihoods, homes and possessions. Nearly 90% of the Alert Ready warnings issued in 2023 came from wildfire and weather hazards. The extremes we saw in 2023 were devastating in many ways, but this is what climate change looks and feels like. What we saw this year only serves as a preview of what the future could bring if emissions of greenhouse gases are not rapidly curtailed. As the climate continues to warm, one can expect increasing wildfires, more intense droughts and hurricanes, and more intense heat waves. Not in 28 years of Top Ten Weather Events has there been a more obvious number one story than Record wildfires in 2023. In fact, it could have represented four stories in one this year: record area burned, continuation of multi-year drought, torrid heat and foul smoky skies for months on end. At times, out-of-control fires burned in nearly every province and territory. It was a story that captured international attention for much of the year. Fighting wildfires across Canada was a national preoccupation over three seasons, not the usual summer-long activity. In the end, 2023 was the worst wildfire year on record - at least twice the previous worst year and seven times the 10-year average of forests consumed by fires. Entire cities and several Indigenous communities were emptied by the threat of wildfires. Unbelievably, the area burned by wildfires stretched over 18 million hectares. One expert said that more than half the countries in the world could fit their geography into the total area burned this year in Canada. The Earth’s average temperature this summer was one for the record books. Moreover, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year in possibly 125,000 years. For Canada, it was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. Even more noteworthy, if you include May and September, each province and territory recorded their warmest five months on record, with the exception of Atlantic Canada. Warm coastal waters resulted in the hottest ever marine heat wave in Canadian waters. Parts of the Prairie Provinces went from slush in late April to sweat in early May practically making spring a no-show. In Eastern Canada, it was the longest “hot season” on record with days above 30°C for the first time in April and October. In late January and February, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing from the North to West to East. Across the West, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal for some of the lowest temperature departures in a generation. With biting winds, temperatures felt as low as -59 with wind chill in northern Québec. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. Even ski resorts reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. It was a year when Western Canada had too little precipitation – unable to get a drop of rain to squelch wildfires or relieve drought, and the East had too much precipitation – just too wet for too long and too often. Before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Power outages affected over a million customers in Québec and Ontario. Flooding was another big story this year, including the new age flood of an urban kind in Prairie cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, and two- or three-times in Eastern cities like Québec City, Ottawa and Montréal. Outside of Halifax six weeks after fast-moving wildfires burned through the western half of the province, the region was hit by torrential downpours resulting in the devastating loss of four people, including two young children. Floods also caused unimaginable damage to personal property and infrastructure. Initial forecasts predicted a quieter start to the Atlantic hurricane season compared to the past six years but unseasonably warm Atlantic Ocean waters led to another very active tropical storm season. Canada was touched by the remains of two major hurricanes: Franklin and Lee. Lee was the most powerful hurricane to affect Canada, but it was no Fiona. On September 16, post-tropical Lee lashed the region with strong winds and heavy rains. Power outages from wind gusts topping 117 km/h in Nova Scotia and around the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick grew storm surges with a peak wave of 16 m that destroyed precious beach and park properties along exposed shorelines. In total, the Atlantic basin had 19 named storms, including seven hurricanes of which three were major. It is very challenging to obtain an accurate count of tornadoes, as they are difficult to confirm and may go undetected in rural areas. The estimate in 2023 is around 82 tornadoes in Canada. Of significance, a Canada Day tornado in Alberta ranked EF4 with strongest estimated wind speed of 275 km/h. It was said to be the most powerful Alberta twister since Edmonton’s major tornado in 1987. Based on preliminary estimates compiled by Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. (CatIQ), there were 27 major weather events from December 2022 to November 2023, each with insured cost losses of at least $30 million and with an aggregate loss approaching $3.5 billion. It will be months before the insurance industry tallies final figures, and it will be only a fraction of the actual cost to properties, businesses and infrastructure, and emotional costs to affected Canadians. Top 10 Weather Events in 2023 1. Record wildfires A thick layer of smoke emanates from forest fires on the west side of Okanagan Lake. Image credit: Gabor Fricska The wildfire season across Canada was one for the record books on so many fronts. It began early, ended late, burned faster and was extremely active from British Columbia and the Territories to the Atlantic coast. Fighting wildfires in Canada often occurs on one side of the country at a time; this year massive wildfires were everywhere at once and lasted many months. On June 6, there were out-of-control fires burning in every single province and territory except in Prince Edward Island and Nunavut. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in Winnipeg reported that the number of wildfires was above average, but there was an unbelievable record high total of woodland consumed - seven times the 10-year average. As cloud-to-ground lightning activity was recorded at the third lowest level in 22 years between January and September inclusive, lightning was clearly not the only cause of the wildland fires. Among the wildfire records shattered and statistics of 2023 were: 184,493 square kilometres of woodland up in smoke across Canada - the equivalent of nearly 1.5 times the size of the Maritime Provinces. By June 27, Canada had already surpassed its historic record for total area burned but the country continued to burn. The amount burned was more than double the previous high of 70,000 square km consumed in 1995 and dwarfed the 10-year average of 27,538 square km. According to provincial/territorial forestry officials in British Columbia, Alberta, Québec, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories, their jurisdictions burned a record total area, dating back to 1980. The area burned in Canada was more than the total area burned in the United States in the last five years --- that is 150,000 square km. Two fires exceeded one million hectares in Québec and British Columbia. In 2023 the average size of forest fires was 2,693 ha, compared to the historic average of 350 to 500 ha. Fortunately, no civilians died from wildfires, but tragically, at least four firefighters died while on duty in Canada. According to the Canadian Wildfire Evacuation Database, by the middle of September, 297 evacuation orders had been issued nationally. Evacuations numbered 235,458 people or as large as the population of Saskatoon, Burnaby or Vaughan. It included 20,000 residents from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories’ capital city and several other communities in southern areas of the territory. Citizens in West Kelowna, British Columbia and Sept Iles, Québec also left home including countless First Nations communities across the country. Even residents in Bathurst Inlet in Nunavut were forced to evacuate on August 11 – the first time a Nunavut community was evacuated for a wildfire. Some residents had to flee two or three times and travel 2,700 km away from home. Over 10,800 forest firefighters, nearly half of those from international crews, started fighting fires in May and were still there five months later. Property losses from six large fires numbered 17,000 claims for a total of over $1.1 billion not counting wildfires in Québec. Alberta This year’s fire season was unprecedented being both exceptionally early and widespread. In early May, a strong high-pressure ridge, said to be the strongest ever seen in four decades, created an early heat wave across the West. In Alberta, May temperatures averaged about 5 degrees warmer than normal – the warmest in 76 years of records. Spring in Alberta was also drier than in recent years and humidity was very low, pushing the start of the fire season much earlier than usual. Among the hot spots, Edmonton broke records for May close to 6 degrees above normal. Calgary had their second hottest May on record, some 4.5 degrees above normal. Once ignited, strong winds fanned dozens of fires in central and northern Alberta forcing 38,000 Albertans to evacuate by May 8. By May 12, nearly the entire province was under a fire ban and 19 local states of emergencies were in effect. In Edson, Alberta residents were evacuated on June 9 for the second time this spring. Flames closed several transportation routes shutting down access to dozens of parks and recreational areas. Fires also halted oil and gas activity representing nearly 5% of the nation’s petroleum production. By the end of May, wildfires had charred nearly 1.2 million ha, almost 100 times more than last year at that time. Around late May and June with rain falling, forest-fire crews began moving East to combat huge fires across the Maritimes and Québec. Nova Scotia The Maritimes went through one of their driest springs in several years. At the same time, meagre winter snow cover disappeared quickly leaving the moisture deficit on forest floors scanty and more typical of July than May. From February to May inclusive, total precipitation in Halifax was less than half of normal. Conditions were especially dry in April when several stations in Nova Scotia experienced their driest month on record. In May and early June, temperatures soared to 33°C and, as it turned out were the warmest few days of the entire summer, some 12 degrees above normal. As a consequence, when wildfires started up in May they were intense and fast-moving across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Further, significant amounts of fuel were left drying out after Hurricane Fiona raked the region eight months earlier. Out-of-control fires in late May forced 18,000 people from their homes in Halifax where the Tantallon fire was raging, and in a largely forested area of Shelburne County southeast of Yarmouth - the largest wildfires ever in Nova Scotia. Fires spread rapidly driven by hot, steady, gusty winds. Out-of-control fires prompted officials to impose widespread bans for hiking, camping, fishing and for forestry and mining operations. In total, more than 200 homes and other structures were fire-damaged or destroyed, mostly in northwest Halifax. Property insurance costs were estimated at $250 million. In early June, multi-day rainfalls between 100 and 175 mm helped to extinguish the flames. Québec Record-breaking heat around June 1 across western Québec, added to record dry weather through much of winter and spring, created tinder dry conditions across the province. Too many fires ignited at once and spread quickly. June wildfires in Québec burned nine times as much land as in any previous decade combined. Major hot spots occurred in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and along the North Shore region of eastern Québec. A state of emergency was declared in Sept-Iles on June 2 forcing 5,000 people out of their homes. Some residents in Lebel-sur-Quévillon had to flee their properties on two occasions. Several mines in the province suspended operations because of the fire risk. Hydro-Québec airlifted close to 200 workers from hydro stations in northern Québec. Foreign fire fighters joined provincial-manned crews to extinguish flames. Hundreds of Canadian Forces personnel assisted with evacuations and firefighting. Northerly winds pushed smoke from Québec and northeastern Ontario fires into Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto and major cities in the eastern United States. Rains at the beginning of July helped extinguish some fires, although large blazes still burned out-of-control near James Bay. British Columbia Three years of unusually warm temperatures and scanty precipitation left conditions in much of British Columbia tinder dry at the end of April 2023. May ranked the warmest in 76 years, more than half a degree warmer than the second warmest May in 1998 (also a frightfully bad forest fire year). Much of the winter’s snowpack disappeared quickly denying rivers a steady flow through spring and early summer. By mid-May, special air quality statements and smoky sky bulletins had already been issued for several communities in Northeastern British Columbia. With hot flames and suffocating smoke threatening the region, 40,000 people were under an evacuation order or alert before the long weekend in May. The Donnie Creek fire between Fort St. John and Fort Nelson was well underway. This lightning-ignited fire began on May 12th and was still burning strongly and out-of-control at the end of September to become the longest burning wildfire in the province’s history, and the largest (5,800 square km). Dryness grew worse in summer and consequently fires grew aggressively across the entire province. Often 350 to 400 fires were burning at once with two thirds of them designated as out-of-control. There was rarely a respite for thousands of firefighters or the military. Evacuations from towns, rural areas, resorts, and vacation spots and First Nations communities continued all summer. In central British Columbia, following months of persistent dryness there was a meagre rainfall of 3.8 mm from July 13 and August 21. The erratic gusty winds, heat-dome temperatures, and thousands of lightning strikes in July ignited hundreds of wildfires in and around the Okanagan. In July, almost 170,000 lightning strikes hit the ground, or 55% more than normal, for the third most active July in 22 years of records. From the Okanagan Valley to the Fraser Canyon and east of Kamloops in the Shuswap-Adams Lake region, fires ignited in July but took off in mid-August forcing thousands of residents to stand on evacuation alert. Temperatures soared between 37°C and 42°C in parts of the Okanagan. The McDougall fire just 10 km from West Kelowna exploded 100 times its original size in less than one week and stayed ablaze for more than a month. Nearly 200 structures in parts of beleaguered West Kelowna, Westbank First Nations and in Kelowna were partially or entirely destroyed including the Lake Okanagan Resort. On August 5, northeast of Kamloops the Bush Creek-Adams Lakes fire doubled in size in two days scorching properties in Shuswap and on both sides of Adams Lake. On August 20, there was hope when Tropical Storm Hilary spun up from Mexico and started wetting eastern British Columbia but not further west where the rain was mostly needed. The airspace above Kelowna Airport closed to support aerial firefighters. In the Shuswap region, 170 homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged by fires. Across the West Kelowna and Bush Creek fires more than 22,000 residents were on evacuation orders or alerts. Even in Osoyoos, wildfires burned properties and forced evacuations but, in this case, it was fires from Washington State that came northward. Fire behaviour in British Columbia received a late-summer boost from higher-than-normal temperatures and lower than normal rainfall, especially in the north. The wildfire season remained in full swing for months. In the first week of October, 317 active fires were still burning across the province. Northwest Territories All spring and summer, the Northwest Territories experienced record high temperatures and negligible rainfall accelerating the wildfire threat. But the seeds of the unprecedented fire season were sown at least four years ago. In Yellowknife, almost every month since the end of 2020 was drier than normal for a combined moisture deficit of 340 mm in 36 months. Further evidence of the drought, historic low water levels along the Mackenzie River forced lengthy detours for goods in transit. Around mid-August, a ridge of high pressure settled over the territory sending temperatures soaring further, desiccating forests even more, and worsening conditions because of strong winds and frequent strikes from dry lightning. Forests had enough heat and dry stress and over 200 wild and unpredictable fires ignited with the majority out of control. The fire front was 60 km away from Hay River, Northwest Territories on August 13 pushed by strong wind gusts up to 70 km/h. The hamlet of nearby Enterprise was engulfed by the blaze and 80% of the town was burned down. By mid-August, fires grew dangerously close to several communities: 2 km from Hay River and 1 km from the airport; 4 km away from Fort Smith; 7 km from K’atl’odeeche First Nation and 15 km from the capital of Yellowknife. On August 18, out of control wildfires around Great Slave Lake forced officials to invoke mass evacuations involving thousands of people (nearly two thirds of the Northwest Territories’ residents), and also forced postponement of territorial elections until November 14. With fires so close and heavy smoke and falling ash choking the city of Yellowknife, an historic evacuation order was issued at 12 pm on August 18 and incredibly, 95% of the city heeded the order and stayed away for almost three weeks. Some travelled as far away as 3,000 km away, returning home after the second week of September. At the end, not all fires were extinguished. On October 16, 303 fires had consumed 4.2 million ha – ten times the 25-year average and with 91 fires still active as of November 21. 2. Canada cloaked in smoke Smoke clouds rise over Dartmouth Nova Scotia and partially block out the sun. Image credit: Sansom Marchand With choking smoke filling the air across Canada, nobody was untouched by the devastating wildfires in 2023, and it was not just in Canada. Although Canada usually gets a bad reputation south of border for sending cold air, during the summer of 2023 plumes of acrid smoke travelled to the United States from Canada, making headlines in New York City and in many other parts of the country. More than 100 million Americans faced restricted breathing under poor air quality owing to smoke from Eastern Canada in June and May and later in the summer and fall from western and territorial wildfires. Further, smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic Ocean and fouled the air over Greenland, Iceland and other parts of Europe. Smoke brought hazy skies beginning in April to northeastern British Columbia when lightning ignited the Donnie Creek fire. Skies were still foul in October with over 753 fires still burning across Canada, nearly half described as “out of control”. In hot fire zones across Canada, poor visibility from smoke was a daily occurrence and so awful that at times fire crews could not even see what they were battling. Before the long weekend in May, wildfires in Alberta had already burned three times the annual burn in an average year. May wildfires in the west had cloaked most of Alberta and Saskatchewan and much of British Columbia with smoke such that air quality health indices were 10+ or very high risk. The risk was so high in Edmonton that the city launched its first extreme weather response to poor air quality: schools began holding recess indoors and cancelling outdoor excursions. Canadians in cities suffered with some of the worst air quality on Earth. At times, smoke shielded fires from the sun keeping temperatures below forecasted highs. Smoke was bad for crops too, hiding the sun and slowing plant growth. Late summer-early fall fires in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Alberta tainted the skies from western North America to the Great Lakes. In September, Yellowknife again found itself menaced by nearby fires, this time by thick smoke that turned skies an apocalyptic dark orange. On September 23, the city-hosted celebrations for returning home from three weeks of wildfire-forced evacuations had to be cancelled due to poor air quality. In Eastern North America, special air quality statements are not frequently issued due to smoke from Canadian wildfires, especially fires in eastern Canada. Smoky skies this June came largely from fires raging across Nova Scotia, northern and central Québec and northeastern Ontario. A low-pressure system over Maine and off Nova Scotia provided a counter-clockwise flow to funnel Canadian smoke southward. Occasional rainfall was not enough to extinguish wildfires until winds also had shifted. For much of June, thick smoke covered southern Ontario and Québec in concentrations well past the unhealthy threshold. The smell of smoke was inescapable as yellowish smog blurred city skylines. Montréal had the worst air quality in the world on the morning of June 25. Its fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration was 243, reaching 38 times the World Health Organization's air quality guideline. On June 7, air quality in Ottawa was rated high risk at 10+. The amount of fine particulate matter in Ottawa's air hit 511 when PM2.5 normally ranges from 4 to 11. Another blast of smoke at 243 on June 25 forced Dragon Boat Festival and the Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival to be cancelled. The City also cancelled all outdoor recreational programs, closed outdoor pools, and issued no-swim advisories at city beaches. Yellow-tinted smoke settled over Toronto on several days in June. Under smoky haze, the smoke plume was so dense that airports had to pause or slow air traffic operations due to poor visibility. City hospitals saw a surge in the number of people visiting emergency departments with respiratory issues. At times winds would dissipate the smoke and rain scrub the air only for foul air to return within a day or two, often going from bad to worse. The number of smoke hours from May to early September, as defined when visibility is less than 9.7 km, revealed record-breaking smoke conditions across much of western, central and northern Canada. The city with the highest number of smoke hours was Fort Nelson with 1054 hours, followed by Fort St. John (867), La Ronge (802) and Peace River/Grand Prairie (625-644). Several major cities, including Kamloops, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Yellowknife, experience more than 200 hours of smoke. 3. Hottest Summer – on Earth and in Canada The sun is rising above the silhouette of residential buildings. On Earth Blistering, baking, broiling, and “hell on Earth” were just some of the descriptors used to describe the record hot summer across the Northern Hemisphere in 2023. There is no question it was the warmest summer since 1940, and likely back to 1850 (the start of the pre-industrial averaging period) and, if reconstructing past climates using geological and biological evidence, likely the warmest in history dating back to when human beings began appearing 120,000 years ago. June 2023 was the hottest June ever, some 1.5°C above the 20th century average. July 2023 was the warmest month ever recorded globally, beating the previous warmest July in 2019 and some 1.5°C above the 1850 to 1900 average. The United States’ National Oceanic Atmospheric Association declared July 7, 2023 the hottest day on Earth at 17.42°C, beating the previous warmest just days earlier. August 2023 was the hottest August on record. For the three summer months, the Northern Hemisphere averaged 16.77°C - that is 0.66°C warmer than the current 1991-2020 average. September kept the record warmth going when the World Meteorological Organization announced it to be the warmest September on record. In the Southern Hemisphere, well-above average temperatures especially in August also occurred across Australia and New Zealand, several South American countries and around much of Antarctica where sea ice was at its lowest extent since satellite records began in 1979. Thus, with both hemispheres abnormally warm, Earth easily had its warmest June-to-August on record. Coming out of the warmest summer and September on record, 2023 featured the Earth’s warmest first nine months on record. Several factors contributed to the unprecedented heat. Record marine heat waves across several ocean basins stoked the heat throughout the summer and compounded the effects of ongoing anthropogenic climate change. With super-heated El Nino waters only expanding and strengthening in the tropical eastern Pacific, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year on record in more than 150 years. In Canada Canada contributed more than its share to the Earth’s record hot summer. It was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. The average temperature anomaly was +2.0°C, beating the previous warmest in 2012. The warmest summers on record (with positive anomalies) also occurred in British Columbia (2.1°C), Yukon Territory (2.9°C) and Northwest Territories (3.1°C). Even more noteworthy, if we add May and September to the traditional three summer months, each province and territory, with the exception of Atlantic Canada, recorded their warmest five months on record. Atlantic Canada was left out of the top because it was too busy being too wet. Ocean temperatures bathing Canadian coastal waters were shockingly hot and with peaks occurring much earlier than ever before. At summer’s peak (July 17 to August 7), the Canadian Atlantic surface waters were 3 to 5 degrees above normal and as hot as it ever has been in the North Atlantic. Unofficially, a hot day in Canada is defined when the day’s maximum temperature exceeds 30°C. In the British Columbia Interior hot days were far above historic averages. Kamloops recorded 62 hot days in 2023, compared to a historic average of 33. And Lytton, which in 2021 set a new record for the hottest day ever in Canada, topped 30°C for 71 days - 38 days above the average. Canada’s hottest temperatures in 2023 occurred during a sweltering and protracted heat wave in mid-August when the day’s maximum exceeded 40°C in five locations. Lytton was Canada’s hot spot in 2023 at 42.2°C on August 15. Temperature soared above 37°C in the Northwest Territories in early July. Fort Good Hope, Nunavut reached a record high of 37.4°C on July 8, more than two degrees above the previous record. Within sight of the Arctic Circle, the small town of Norman Wells hit 37.9°C also on July 8. It was easily the farthest north in Canada with a reading of 37°C or higher in the Canadian climate record, and just 0.1°C shy of the hottest temperature ever observed that far north in the world. In Yukon, Carmacks set an all-time daily maximum temperature record on July 7 at 35.5°C the third-hottest daytime temperature ever recorded in Yukon. In Winnipeg, winter ended and summer began on May 1 when the coldest March and April ended and the warmest May and June ever on record began. Both July and August were cooler than normal followed by a very warm September making for a relatively long summer and one of the longest growing seasons on record. Across the Great Lakes and Atlantic Canada summer temperatures were hardly hot. Some of Canada’s largest cities in the East did not experience a hot day from the second week of July to the first week of September. All that Toronto could muster this summer was 33°C. By mid-summer, Easterners had written summer off. But summer came back when Ottawa registered four days above 30°C in September and two in October. Never before in 141 years of weather records has Ottawa ever seen a temperature above 30°C after September 22. Montréal went 58 days in mid to late summer without registering a 30°C day. Neither Montréal nor Toronto had a 30°C temperature in September in the previous four years. This year’s September sizzle made up for that when consecutive hot days numbered four or five around Labour Day. Even more spectacular, the dog days of summer showed up in early October with at least two days above 30°C. Even after snow and cold arrived in the West at the end of October, parts of the East were still breaking warm temperature records. 4. Deadly deluge in Nova Scotia A road in Belmont, Nova Scotia, damaged by this summer’s floods. Image credit: Lexie Barkhouse Following a record dry spring and several 30+°C days at the end of May, fast-moving and devastating wildfires burned through parts of western Nova Scotia and suburban Halifax. While fires burned in early June, incessant rains started squelching flames and lessening the threat of wildfires as the month progressed. By the end of June, 214 mm of rain had fallen in Halifax, nearly 2 ¼ times the average monthly total. July was also wet with 187 mm - nearly double the normal. But in July almost all the rain fell in less than two days on July 21-22 when a slow-moving trough of low pressure moved into the Maritimes. A sizable plume of tropical moisture also streamed into the region from the south and positioned over some of the warmest ocean waters ever seen in the North Atlantic, surface waters two or four degrees warmer than usual. A high-pressure system to the east enabled embedded thunderstorms to tap into the tropical air, efficiently wringing out copious amounts of water. Torrential downpours started in the afternoon of July 21 and by the end of the next day between 200 and 250 mm of rain fell across the province's southwestern shore, in parts of Halifax and in the central and western parts of the province. It was a summer’s total in one day - the most significant rainfall event in the Halifax area since Hurricane Beth on August 16, 1971. Because rains had been falling for most of the previous six weeks, the ground was already saturated with little ability to absorb further rainwater. The consistent nature of the thunderstorms was frightening. At Halifax International Airport, the heavy downpours started just before 4 pm on July 21 following several hours of fog. Over the next 28 hours, rain fell continuously during 10 thunderstorm hours in a process known as “training”. Like freight cars on a railroad spur, new thunderstorms developed as old ones dissipated. It finally stopped raining at 4 pm on July 22. Rainfall intensities were torrential – 100 mm in one hour and 173 mm in six hours in Bedford – a new national record and shattering the once in 100-year rainfall return period. The Bedford-Sackville area, Hammonds Plains, and the Annapolis Valley experienced some of the heaviest rains in more than half a century. Tragedy unfolded as families fled their homes; four lives were lost, including two young children. The damage and heartache that followed was unimaginable. Rivers formed where there had been roads, with as many as 50 roads remained impassable and 50 more washed out. At least seven bridges had to be replaced or rebuilt and 19 others repaired. About 1000 people were forced to flee their homes overnight. Nova Scotia Power had to deal with outages in the Halifax and Liverpool areas caused by non-stop lightning leaving 80,000 homes and businesses across the province without power. Nova Scotia saw the most July lightning ever recorded in the province in over 22 years, and almost all of it came from the single storm on July 21: 26,194 lightning strikes in July of which 23,008 struck on July 21 and 22. There was a province-wide state of emergency declared on July 21 for 2 ½ weeks. This is the same area where wildfires destroyed 150 homes two months earlier. Agriculture losses were also extensive owing to flooded fields, road washouts and crops of hay, soybeans and vegetables left submerged for several days. Following momentous rains on July 21-22, other big storms occurred in July and August leading to more flash flooding and water pooling. Halifax summer rains amounted to twice the normal at 619 mm. Elsewhere in the province at some private weather stations between 700 and 900 mm of rain fell including a whopping 981 mm at Mahone Bay. Total summer rainfall in New Brunswick ranged between 500 and 600+ mm or about 60 to 80% above normal. Rains from Hurricane Lee in September and Tropical Storm Philippe in October only added to the wettest five months in Maritime history. 5. Canada dry in the West and wet in the East Cattle grazing in dry pasture in Steveville, Alberta. Image credit: Kyle Brittain At the beginning of June, most of Canada was abnormally dry with large areas in the West in a state of moderate to extreme drought, because the first five months of 2023 lacked precipitation in the region. Drought stretched from coast to coast, in every province or territory. Even farmers in Eastern Canada were concerned about an alarmingly dry spring and maximum temperatures that soared above 30°C in mid-April - never had it been so warm so early in the year. Potato growers in Prince Edward Island were applying more irrigation water in May than in an average July. In Lethbridge, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba, the amount of precipitation from February through May was among the lowest on record in over 100 years, while in Québec’s Cote-Nord region, the moisture shortfall of 150 to 200 mm was the lowest in more than 100 years. Dry in the West Across Western and Northwest Canada, a persistent large high-pressure area stationed over British Columbia and Alberta kept rains away and temperatures elevated by as much as 10 degrees above normal for much of the year. The massive blockage prevented an influx of cooler northern air or any moist Pacific air. Also adding to the dryness was the dearth of a winter snowpack at higher altitudes. In some river basins, glacier-fed waters were the lowest in a century. Further, the snow had melted about six weeks earlier than usual. This meant waterways through parts of the Prairies peaked earlier, denying water for irrigation, fighting wildfires, domestic water supplies, and power generation. In Alberta, the flow of the Bow River was the lowest since 1911. More dry and hot weather in the summer further depleted groundwater, leading to river flows in July looking more like those in September or October. Across British Columbia, 10 months of winter, spring and summer precipitation totals were consistently less than half of normal. Penticton and Vernon experienced their driest summer since records have been kept. Penticton received just 8 mm of rain compared with the normal 105 mm, and Vernon 22 mm instead of its normal 122 mm. And in Kelowna, it was the second-driest summer on record with just 20 mm of rain coming down when 110 mm is the norm. Record drought across the province was a major reason for British Columbia's worst wildfire season ever. By mid-August, more than 80 per cent of the province had reached high to extreme levels of drought - the two highest and worst, possible drought rankings. It was also dry across the southern Prairies and in the Peace River/Grand Prairie region of Alberta. The Northwest Territories was also exceptionally dry extending across Western Nunavut. Across the West, the enduring drought prompted several communities to declare states of local emergency and impose strict water restrictions. Millions of residents and commercial customers were asked to conserve precious drinking water, even cautioning farmers to be frugal with their water usage, as some water reservoirs were nearing empty. It left some ranchers with no choice but to sell their cattle prematurely. Some locations such as McBride, British Columbia had to endure six or more months of water restrictions. The weather was a challenge to the province’s power-generating sector with production the lowest in 15 years. With low water levels, it became too hot for fish to survive and oxygen was depleted, leading to a massive die-off of steelhead trout and salmon. In Alberta, authorities with the St. Mary’s River Irrigation District declared it one of the six driest in the past 99 years. Along the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories, transport companies had to truck - rather than float on barges - goods and commodities at much higher costs. On June 1, two separate thunderstorms featuring intense rain dumped more than 40 mm of rain in Regina. The flash flooding led to basements filling and cars floating. Underpasses filled and cars ploughed through flooded streets creating a wake from rising waters. With all the talk of drought and wildfires in the West, an exception was an area between Red Deer and Edmonton, which was hammered by several days of heavy rains on June 17-20. Rains between 70 and 140 mm fell and in mountainous areas such as Jasper, 20 to 30 cm of snow fell. Edmonton was a real anomaly this summer recording almost 60% more rain than normal. Some residents of the town of Edson, twice forced from their homes by earlier forest fires, were now leaving home due to flooding. On August 24, strong super-cell thunderstorms brought large hail and torrential rainfall to several communities from Manitoba’s Interlake Region through the northern parts of Winnipeg. Selkirk got 110 mm in 30 minutes and Winnipeg got between 20 mm and 30 mm. It stayed dry in British Columbia right up to October 17-19 when an atmospheric river dumped 100 to 200 mm across coastal and central parts of the province. Wet in the East Summer in Southeastern Canada was as moisture-laden as the West and Northwest were dry. Stagnant low-pressure systems were repeatedly positioned between James Bay through the Great Lakes to the Maritimes favouring lengthy bouts of rain, overcast and coolness. Frequent weather systems brought in loads of moisture from tropical sources keeping surfaces wet from days of heavy rain or continuous drizzle. Lows moved in slowly, stalled or retrograded for weeks at a time. Further, there was an absence of the customary Bermuda High and its sunny and dry weather. The Maritimes experienced its wettest summer in history, more than double the normal amount of rainfall. Among the many stations in the Maritimes breaking summer rainfall records were Yarmouth, Greenwood, Kentville, Sydney, Saint John, Fredericton, and Charlottetown. Private weather stations along Nova Scotia’s south shore recorded 843 mm in Liverpool; 981 at Mahone Bay; and 500 to 600+ mm in southern New Brunswick. Saint John received a total of 763 mm of rain in June, July and August, which is almost three times the normal of 271 mm. It rained hard and often. There were 52 days in the summer with some rain when normally there would be 35. There were 24 days with rainfall amounts of 10 mm or more, when normally you would see 11 through summer. Normally, there would be three heavy rainfall events with more than 25 mm of rain, but Saint John had 11 events. Around July 10 to 12, record rains led to dramatic rises in Québec waterways leading to flooding and evacuations from Saguenay to Sherbrooke. More than 135 mm in less than 48 hours sent rivers surging, including the St-Francois River which rose from 2 to 6 m in less than four hours. By the end of July, Sherbrooke recorded three times its normal monthly total. Early on July 12 and into the next day, severe thunderstorms moved through southern Ontario and Québec causing flash flooding and wind damages from tornadoes. Rainfall totals ranged from 50 to 80 mm from Sarnia to Orillia and 50 to 90 mm of rain through the St. Lawrence Valley in Québec, including another 90 mm dump in Montréal. On July 20-21, another classic undercutting cold front of warm humid air triggered a series of supercell thunderstorms travelling from near Windsor to southern Québec. The weather featured microbursts, tornadoes, hailers with baseball-size hail and torrential flash floods. Joliette, Québec received the most rainfall, between 100 to 120 mm, with most of it within two hours. Barely a week later, a series of severe thunderstorms dropped more heavy rains resulting in flash flooding from Southwestern Ontario to Québec City. Storms led to widespread street flooding and left 55,000 without power. On August 3, more storms moved through southern Ontario and Québec, packing billiard ball-size hailstones, violent wind gusts in excess of 110 km/h and torrential downpours. On August 10, between 80 to 120 mm of rain in about an hour and a half fell across Montréal. Roads and underpasses were submerged along with warehouses, schools and lower levels of shopping malls. In Ottawa, with 100 mm of rain in six hours, roads became canals. To avoid flooding, motorists drove on sidewalks or abandoned their cars. Two weeks later a steady stream of showers and thunderstorms pushed through southwestern Ontario on August 23 and 24 bringing storm rainfalls as much as 185 mm to several locations. Flooding led to road washouts and the tragic death of a trucker who perished in a 3-m deep sinkhole. Greatest rainfall totals exceeded 200 mm in Pelee Island and Harrow, Ontario. Some of the moisture came from the remnants of Tropical Storm Hilary from Mexico via British Columbia and the prairies. Insurance costs to property losses from some of the more impactful storms this summer in Ontario and Québec totalled more than three quarters of a billion dollars. 6. Hurricane Lee… no Fiona but more than a windy day A man in a yellow rain suit is looking out to Indian Harbour in Nova Scotia in the first hours of Hurricane Lee. Image credit: Doug Mercer In early spring, forecasters predicted a below normal to average number of tropical storms for the Atlantic Ocean basin in 2023. That would be a change from six years of active storm seasons. An El Nino established and strengthened in the tropical Pacific Ocean, stronger atmospheric wind shear would most likely suppress the development and growth of Atlantic tropical storms by blowing the storms apart. However, by early August, forecasters revised their numbers upward calling for up to 21 named storms. El Nino was still present, if not stronger. However, record hot tropical seawaters would potentially counterbalance the shearing effects of El Nino. Around mid-August, the Atlantic hurricane season came alive after several weeks of little to no tropical activity. Tropical Storm Franklin, the season’s first major storm, remained offshore as it passed south of Atlantic Canada at the end of August. St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador received about 36 mm of rain over 19 hours on August 30 and 31, with wind gusts peaking at 76 km/h. On September 23, Ophelia was the 15th storm of the season. Only six storms were hurricane strength, of which three were major (Franklin, Idalia and Lee). In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Hilary was an odd storm of sorts. She formed over the Mexican State of Baja dropping a record 330 mm of rain in 24 hours on the Baja state before barreling up the hot Gulf of California and bringing record rains to Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. After soaking the desert southwest, she headed northward bringing badly needed rains to the eastern parts of British Columbia in the Kootenays and the Columbia Valley on August 20, but not to the rain-starved and fire-swept Okanagan Valley. The remains of Hilary moved across Saskatchewan and Manitoba on August 22. Two days later Hilary’s leftovers merged with another storm over southern Ontario. Several rounds of rain brought two months of rain in two days - above 200 mm - to communities there, causing extensive road flooding, filled basements and garages, and backed-up sewers. Major highways were closed for up to 12 hours due to flowing water. Near Glencoe, a life was lost after a transport truck fell through a sinkhole on a district road. In early September, another weather disturbance emerged from the west coast of Africa. In the next days, a tropical cyclone formed and quickly intensified into a powerful hurricane over the central tropical Atlantic. Storm Lee grew from a Category 1 to 5 hurricane in less than 24 hours with winds at 269 km/h - the third most rapidly intensifying storm in history and one of the 40 most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. As quickly as Lee grew, it weakened to a Category 3, but still a major hurricane. Hurricane Lee passed north of the Caribbean Sea on the 11th and started traveling toward the Gulf Stream. It stayed out over the ocean, and on the 14th, headed straight north for New England and the Canadian Maritimes. As Lee began to lose its strength, across the cooler Northern waters, some churned up by the blustery motion of storms Franklin and Idalia, it also widened its wind field as it transitioned to a Post-Tropical Cyclone. At one time, Lee’s size extended out to 145 km with hurricane-force winds and 500 km with tropical storm winds. Few Maritimers would not feel the effects of Lee’s wrath no matter where it made landfall during the weekend. Even while diminishing, Lee packed tree-felling wind speeds, flooding rains, and high surf to parts of coastal New England and into southwest Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy on the weekend of September 15 to 17, almost a year after Hurricane Fiona hammered the Maritimes, Québec and Newfoundland. Lee was compared to Fiona but, as it turned out, it was not the same intensity and magnitude storm. Lee became a post-tropical storm around 6 am Saturday, September 16 but retained its Category-1 force winds. Lee first made landfall on Long Island, Nova Scotia in the Digby Neck late afternoon and in a second landfall in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island after crossing the Bay of Fundy. Winds blew over 100 km/h at landfall in the west and northeastern area of Nova Scotia but peak winds were clocked at 117 km/h at Halifax International Airport. Large waves topped 5 to 7 metres with a peak wave at the Halifax harbour buoy of 16 metres. Storm rainfalls ranged from 50 to 150 mm. Days before Lee’s arrival as a post-tropical storm, store shelves started emptying from a wary citizenry still remembering the impacts of Hurricane Fiona. Residents stocked up on propane, bottled water, canned goods, batteries and flashlights and “storm chips”. Boaters pulled their vessels from the water and lashed down their gear along the coast. Many flights and ferry crossings were cancelled. At the height of the storm, 350,000 customers were without power and internet connection. Of major concern in the Maritimes was the sodden ground from weeks of heavy rain in a full summer of torrential record rains. Leafed trees made it easier for Lee’s winds to bring down trees and power lines. The storm surge pushed large waves and rocks onto coasts, destroying beaches and parks and washing out trails. Some beaches and parks, like Rissers Beach Provincial Park in Nova Scotia, were completely ruined; coastal roads were made impassable, bridges closed, trees downed, basements flooded, signage was scattered and traffic lights were left dangling. Three weeks later, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, tropical storm Philippe tracked very close to where Lee had made landfall in the Maritimes. Not as powerful as Lee, Philippe also transitioned into a post-tropical storm after merging with a non-tropical system and brought between 50 and 80 mm of rain and strong winds between 70 and 90 km/h across the Maritimes and parts of eastern Québec but leaving Newfoundland and Labrador alone. Significant wave heights south of Nova Scotia reached above 5 metres but were not a problem in the Bay of Fundy. 7. April glaze storm in Montréal-Ottawa – more beast than beauty A residential street in Ottawa is covered in snow and ice after an ice storm in April. Image credit: Brittaney Pilon On April 5, 2023 before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Ahead of the storm, mild air flooded the region and a cold front undercut the mildness, destabilizing the atmosphere. The unsettled weather prompted tornado watches in southwestern Ontario and heavy rain warnings across the province. Persistent winds through the low-lying valleys of the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence rivers kept surface temperatures hovering just below freezing for most of the day. The bad mix led to several hours of freezing rain and rain with a few early season “thundersnows”. Hearing thunder and the ping of freezing ice balls bouncing off surfaces created a real buzz across eastern Ontario and southern Québec. The ugly weather then featured up to twelve continuous hours of freezing rain in Montréal and nine in Ottawa. Ice accretion amounts totalled 30 to 37 mm in Montréal, 25 to 30 mm in Ottawa-Gatineau, and 15 to 25 mm in central Québec. Accompanying wind gusts of 60 to 70 km/h for two days added enormous stress to ice-encased utility lines and trees. Where heavy rain fell on still-frozen ground, localized flooding swamped backyards and fields and filled basements. Ice build-up on trees and power lines caused extensive damage, including the loss of 300 trees in Montréal. Power outages topped one million customers in Québec including half a million in Montréal and 200,000 in Ontario. Thousands were still without power two days later. There were numerous vehicle accidents and traffic was slowed or stopped on several routes. Sidewalks were also coated with treacherous ice. Ottawa’s light-rail transit went down leaving dozens of commuters waiting hours to be evacuated. Fallen branches and limbs littered streets and properties, damaging cars and smashing windshields. Sadly this ice storm took two lives in Québec. Rising temperatures the next day created the ominous sight and sound of ice falling from trees, power lines and balconies. Numerous businesses were closed including clinics and schools, although libraries remained opened to assist as electricity recharging stations. Property losses from floods, winds and icing topped $335 million from Sarnia to Saguenay. 8. Cold spells in a warm year A door opens on about two feet of snow after a snowstorm in Chippawa, Ontario. Image credit: Lauren Eldridge Days before Christmas 2022, and between Christmas and New Year’s Day, Canada was over-run by cold air, dangerous wind chills and all kinds of precipitation from heavy rains, freezing rain and ice pellets to heavy snows in blowing conditions. Travel was treacherous and several flights and trains were cancelled or delayed to the point of ruining holiday plans for thousands of Canadians. In addition, power outages were widespread and lengthy making for uncomfortable and disappointing end-of-the-year celebrations. On December 30th and 31st, the weather changed dramatically with the arrival of mild and dry weather. A new year saw a pronounced January thaw from coast to coast. Monthly January temperatures averaged between three to six degrees above normal from Alberta to Newfoundland-Labrador. In parts of Ontario, January was the fourth warmest month in more than 100 years of record-keeping. The four-week balmy spell only added to the severity of the cold at the end of January with a swing to numbing cold. Extreme cold warnings were issued for eight provinces and three territories, shattering several temperature records. The cold snap stood out for its severity but not duration – one of the most intense in recent years. Fortunately, the lack of a blocking high over Greenland allowed less cold air to rebound in the second week of February. Before that, the stratospheric polar vortex sat over Nunavut and the northern part of Hudson Bay in mid-January. On January 14, the deep polar low led to a record -62.4°C in Tongulakh, Siberia - the coldest day recorded anywhere in Russia in the past 20 years. A stationary and circular jet stream kept the polar vortex tightly tied up over the North Pole. Two weeks later an amplified jet stream dislodged the frigid air and the cold pool started to wobble. Eventually, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing through Western Canada. Across most of British Columbia in January, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal. Eventually, the wavering jet stream took the cold across southeastern Canada creating temperatures up to 20 degrees colder than normal. The cold low also came with blustery winds creating biting wind chills as low as -55. South of the border at Mount Washington in New Hampshire the same wind and cold produced a record low wind chill of -77. For eastern Canada, the first week of February featured the coldest air of the entire winter including punishingly cold wind chills. On February 4, 2023, Fredericton recorded -28.9°C; Saint John dipped to -29°C including a wind chill of -47 – an all-time lowest; Ottawa registered -33.1°C on the morning. The dangerous cold elevated risks of frostbite and hypothermia across the country. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. At the peak of the outages, more than 34,000 Maritimers were without power. Frozen and burst gas and water pipes led to flooding and broken infrastructure inside residences, and commercial and municipal structures. Property insurers across eastern Canada reported losses to the tune of $152 million. Travel was also impacted with flight cancellations and delays in public transit. Road assistance services were backlogged several hours. Thousands crowded into shelters and food banks. Even ski resorts reported lower weekend turnouts and reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. The cold finally started growing ice on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa but not enough to create safe skating conditions for Winterlude; for the first time its 53-year history, it was impossible to skate on the Canal in 2023. More cold warnings came into effect during the last week of February, especially in the West. On February 22, extreme cold warnings were issued in Alberta with temperatures feeling like -40 with the wind chill. Adding to the cold were bouts of messy precipitation; 30 cm of snow fell in Calgary, resulting in multiple crashes. In parts of the Prairies, the cold lingered well into March. Winter-weary Winnipeggers broke a record that stood since 1899 with no day in March above 0°C for the first time in 124 years. Farmers and ranchers began struggling financially with having to keep lambs warm and dry and calves and mother cows needing extra shelter and bedding. For some Prairie locations, their coldest moments of the winter occurred in the last 10 days of March. At the end of February, a Pacific frontal system brought around 5 to 15 cm of snow along the Pacific coast. The cold and icy rain and deep snow left a widespread mess to clean up with spun out vehicles, tree-blocked roads and slushy streets and sidewalks. The late-season snowfall caused flight and ferry cancellations, traffic delays and school closures. More snow fell in Vancouver on April 2, which meant that Vancouver got snow six months in a row from November to April, for the first time in 100 years of recorded history. 9. Flooded out: Québec’s Record Wet July A park is submerged by flooding in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Québec Several major weather systems loaded with tropical-sourced moisture brought frequent, intense and flooding rains to central and southern Québec through July. Slow-moving, soppy storm systems were trapped between areas of strong high pressure over Greenland and Western Canada bringing repeated rounds of rain, many embedded with thunderstorms, across the province leading to one of the wettest months ever. By month’s end, Montréal and Québec exceeded 200 mm of rain, more than double their normal monthly accumulation. Sherbrooke was the rainiest with 311 mm over 21 days, including six days with over 28 mm of rain per day, and a monthly total 2.5 times the normal. Besides summer thunderstorms there were occasional tornadoes and downbursts too. The first significant soaking occurred on July 1 when severe thunderstorms dumped torrential rains in the Rivière-Éternité area of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. The resulting flash floods caused roads to collapse, killing two people. Most rain and storm damage occurred during the second week of July. On July 10-11, a slow-moving storm moved up from the American Seaboard dumping huge amounts of rain across an area from Montréal-Sherbrooke-Québec City-Saguenay. Hard to imagine any city handling as much rain as these Québec cities when nearly 80 mm fell in two hours on the 10th, made worse by heavy rains of 40 mm or more days before, and an additional 125 mm in days after. Near Québec City, the town of Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval declared a state of emergency when more than 300 people were forced from their homes. More people were threatened with evacuations when the Saint-François River, which cuts through Sherbrooke, rose six metres in four hours. Sherbrooke had never seen the Saint-Francois River so swollen. Diluvian rains forced the closing of several highways and city streets across the province. In central Montréal, rising waters filled underground parking lots and basements, flushed intersections, swept away culverts, and destroyed key infrastructure. The intense rains and strong wind gusts up to 111 km/h forced delays in dozens of flights out of Montréal Trudeau International Airport. The summer of widespread power outages continued across the province arising from fires in the north and floods in the south. Hydro-Québec reported 500,000 customers without power at the storm’s peak. Repeated storms just days later added more water to waterlogged soil and swelled rivers and overloaded municipal sewers. Outside cities, heavy soaking rains left farm fields saturated and led to erosion, ground subsidence and minor landslides. The soggy scene was repeated on July 20 to 21 and a week later on the 28th and 29th as storms developed and redeveloped between Montréal and Québec. On July 20-21, street flooding in southern Québec forced numerous road closures between Gatineau and the Eastern Townships. Joliette measured 100 to 120 mm of rain (90 mm in less than two hours). By the end of the month, many large municipalities in Québec had come through their wettest July on record. For Montréal it was the wettest July measured at the Airport on record since 1941. In Québec City, it was a record in 150 years, and a similar situation in Sherbrooke. Insurance losses to personal and commercial property from five significant July storms totalled $330 million. 10. Canada Day tornado in Alberta A man stands beside an orange Jeep and watches the Canada Day tornado in Didsbury, Alberta. Image credit: Ricky Forbes On the last days of June and into July, the western Prairies saw days with high temperatures, elevated humidity and unsettled weather. Heat and storm warnings were in effect for much of Alberta. On June 29, Calgary was drenched with heavy rain from a severe thunderstorm causing flash flooding. On July 1, atmospheric conditions really started to boil up along the foothills of the Rockies. Around noon, a severe thunderstorm near Sundrie intensified into a supercell. Shortly before 2 pm, a tornado came twisting out of the supercell on farmland about 70 km north of Calgary. Rain and hailstones the size of golf and tennis balls and strong winds above 100 km/h accompanied the tornado. The twister ripped through 15 to 20 km of rural land about 670 metres at its widest. Estimated wind speeds topped 275 km/h between Didsbury and Carstairs. Based on the damage observed, the tornado received an EF4 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The debris field was unbelievable with toppled and debarked trees, downed power lines, and wrecked buildings. Wind tossed and rolled weighty farm equipment - such as a 10,000-kg combine - like toys, and snapped trees like matchsticks. The tornado damaged a dozen homes. No major injuries or fatalities were reported, however, 40 farm animals lost their lives to the storm. As the severe storms moved across Alberta and into Saskatchewan, they continued to take out trees and rows of fences, and sever gas lines. Debris landed on vehicles and campers adding to the cost of the insured property loss which totalled $100 million from 5,000 claims. Among those Saskatchewan communities inflicted with major losses were Nipawin and Hafford, Tisdale, Tobin Lake and Carrot River. There were 20,000 SaskPower customers without power. It was a busy summer for tornadoes in Ottawa with five tornadoes including an EF1 storm on July 13 that struck Barrhaven, 20 km south of the Ottawa city centre. A research project from Northern Tornado Project out of Western University (NTP) found about 20 tornadoes occurred across the Ottawa Valley over the past six years. It included seven tornadoes on September 21, 2018, one of which was an EF3 in the Dunrobin region with winds up to 265 km/h. Alberta’s Canada Day tornado was the most highly rated twister nationally in 2023. Moreover, it was one of the strongest top 20 tornadoes in Canada’s history to be classified as violent or catastrophic (EF ratings of 4 or more). It is one of only three F4 tornadoes in Alberta and the strongest since the F4 tornado that struck Edmonton 35 years ago. The country's only documented F5 tornado occurred in Elie, Manitoba in June 2007. About 82 tornadoes occurred in 2023. Ontario led with 39 twisters, while 16 occurred in Alberta. While Saskatchewan has an average of 14 tornadoes per year (with highs of 25 in 2022 and 33 in 2012), only one tornado was reported in the province this year. Page details Date modified: 2024-06-10",

Here's why Bill 81 sparked a furious debate in the legislative assembly and kept MLAs up sleepless until 3 a.m. Wednesday before a majority of government members rammed the bill through. Social Sharing Bill 81 could be a harbinger of things to come in 2022, writes columnist Graham Thomson Graham Thomson · For CBC Opinion · Posted: Dec 10, 2021 6:00 AM MT | Last Updated: 3 hours ago Alberta Premier Jason Kenney speaks after the UCP annual meeting in Calgary last month. (The Canadian Press) comments This column is an opinion from Graham Thomson, an award-winning journalist who has covered Alberta politics for more than 30 years. For more information about CBC's Opinion section , please see the FAQ . Bill 81, The Election Statutes Amendment Act, has a title designed to put the average Albertan to sleep. But this is the piece of legislation that sparked a furious debate in the legislative assembly and kept MLAs up sleepless until 3 a.m. Wednesday before a majority of government members rammed the bill through. The debate was long, raucous and at one time had the deputy Speaker of the assembly telling the government House leader, in so many words, to sit down and shut up. The altercation over Bill 81 exposed so many of the fault lines running through the political landscape that it was pretty much a microcosm of Alberta politics in 2021. 3 UCP MLAs vote against Bill 81 over bulk membership purchase issue Not only did it once again pit the NDP Opposition against the UCP government, it also revealed dissent inside the UCP caucus, displayed ongoing divisions within Alberta's conservative movement, and exhibited Premier Jason Kenney's tendency to invoke a top-down dictatorial style of leadership to win the day. Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul MLA Dave Hanson addresses the legislature Tuesday night as Calgary-Fish Creek MLA Richard Gotried looks on. Hanson, Gotfried and Chestermere-Strathmore MLA Leela Aheer broke with their UCP caucus members by voting against Bill 81. (Legislature Assembly of Alberta ) Bill 81 is a monumental piece of legislation weighing in at almost 170 pages and is so important it should really be called William 81, not a mere Bill. Even if you dozed off at the mention of The Election Statutes Amendment Act, you should care about Bill 81; about what it could have done, what it will do and, ominously, what it might yet do. Bill 81 goals Bill 81 originally set out to accomplish four goals: 1. Set up a fixed election date. Consequently, the next provincial election will take place May 29, 2023. 2. Close the Alberta Federation of Labour \"loophole,\" as Kenney describes it. The legislation ostensibly casts a wide net to stop any organizations \"affiliated\" with a political party from setting up a Political Action Committee to run political advertisements. But it's really aimed at preventing union-related organizations, notably the AFL, from using their money and clout to run ads attacking UCP government policies. The AFL is threatening to take legal action against the legislation, saying it is unconstitutional. 3. Bypass existing limits on financial contributions to political parties. The UCP has been falling behind by millions of dollars in fundraising to the NDP the past year. Bill 81 would have allowed well-heeled supporters to give unlimited money to political parties via local nomination contests, thereby bypassing a $4,200-a-year limit on contributions by individual Albertans. The extra money could then flow to party headquarters for use in a general election. However, this facet of the bill garnered so much outrage that the government backed down and amended the bill last Monday to put a cap on nomination-contest contributions to $4,000. That still allows more money into the system but at least puts a cap on it. 4. Buying bulk memberships. The bill allows, in theory, one person to buy hundreds of party memberships in other people's names without those people being notified. This raises the potential for political fraud and that's what sparked this week's tempestuous overnight debate. \"Tonight is an incredible night of anti-democracy and anti-grassroots,\" declared Independent MLA Drew Barnes who, along with MLA Todd Loewen, was kicked out of the UCP caucus last May after criticizing Kenney. \"The whole heart of this is that we're going from a situation where you cannot buy a membership for someone else to where you can now buy hundreds of memberships for someone else. I believe that's the heart of what the RCMP investigation is from three years ago into this premier and this leadership.\" Fractured politics Barnes was referring to the ongoing RCMP investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the 2017 UCP leadership race that Kenney won. Kenney has adamantly insisted he did nothing wrong. That immediately brought government House leader Jason Nixon to his feet who challenged the chair — deputy Speaker Angela Pitt — to explain why she was \"letting that rant go on about fake RCMP investigations.\" Pitt, who is a UCP MLA, immediately shut Nixon down: \"I'm about 44 seconds into listening to this member speak, in which most of that time has been listening to you yell at me from across the aisle.\" Minister of Justice and Solicitor General Kaycee Madu speaks at a news conference earlier this year. Madu is the sponsor of Bill 81. (CBC News) It was a remarkable exchange, one for the legislative record books, and revealed more of the fractured nature of Alberta politics, particularly within the government caucus. UCP board denies grassroots' demands for earlier leadership vote on Kenney Perhaps most troubling for the government is how three members of the UCP caucus spoke against the bill, pointing to the possibility of someone with money in their pocket and wickedness in their heart unfairly influencing nomination contests or leadership votes. \"Right now in my household, between myself, my children, and my husband, I can buy 400 memberships per person, 1,600 memberships within my own family. That doesn't actually take the big money out in any respect,\" said UCP MLA Leela Aheer. Opinion Could Alberta's fiscal future include a provincial sales tax? Aheer, as well as UCP colleagues Richard Gotfried and David Hanson, wanted the government to add a simple amendment stating that anyone receiving a membership in any party must confirm their consent in writing. Instead, Justice Minister Kaycee Madu, the bill's sponsor, said the UCP's rules already forbid anyone from buying party memberships for somebody other than a spouse or dependent child. But as Madu acknowledged himself, the bill does not legally prevent one person buying multiple memberships for other people. Consequently, there is an ominous cloud hanging over Bill 81 that unnerves MLAs on all sides of the assembly who see the potential for backroom abuse by political parties — and in this case, the party under that cloud is the UCP itself. This suspicion could taint the upcoming party vote on Kenney's leadership review. A group of 22 UCP constituency association presidents had banded together to demand the party hold the review before March 1 and ensure every party member could cast a ballot — either online or at a local voting station. Kenney touts 'Alberta is back' in first speech to Calgary Chamber since 2019 Instead, the UCP's board has declared the vote will take place on April 9 at a one-day convention in Red Deer where only those in attendance can vote — thus opening up the prospect of pro-Kenney forces manipulating the vote by stacking the meeting. Bill 81 is not only a microcosm of Alberta politics in 2021 but perhaps a harbinger of things to come in 2022.

By Morgan Winsor June 27, 2023, 6:56 PM 6:57 File image of the Titan submersible prior to commence diving. Ocean Gate Multinational search and rescue efforts for a submersible that disappeared while on a tour of the wreckage of the Titanic off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, have since become a recovery mission following the grim discovery that the deep-sea vessel had imploded underwater, killing all five people on board. While the recovery operation and investigation remain ongoing , here's what we know about the situation and how it unfolded. Sunday, June 18 The 21-foot sealed craft , named Titan, submerged at 8 a.m. ET with five people on board and a 96-hour oxygen supply. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the sealed craft lost contact with its operator, OceanGate Expeditions. At 5:40 p.m. ET, the United States Coast Guard received a report of an overdue submersible. The Titan was supposed to resurface at 3 p.m. ET. Monday, June 19 The U.S. Coast Guard in coordination with the Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Armed Forces conducted a surface search for the missing submersible using various aircraft, including one with underwater sonar capability. Tuesday, June 20 As of 7 a.m. ET, crews in multiple aircraft had flown over an area of the Atlantic Ocean \"roughly about the size of Connecticut\" while \"looking for any signs of surfacing,\" Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District, told ABC News. Bahamian research vessel Deep Energy, which specializes in pipe-laying and has remotely operated vehicle capabilities, arrived at 7 a.m. ET to help with the search. A source familiar confirmed to ABC News that there were reports of \"banging\" that were picked up by sonar in the search area sometime in the morning, but nothing has yet been found. At 4 p.m. ET, a crew from the New York Air National Guard arrived on scene to help with the search. Wednesday, June 21 At 12:18 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard announced via Twitter that a Canadian aircraft with sonar capabilities had \"detected underwater noises in the search area.\" Remotely operated vehicle operations (ROV) were then relocated \"in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises,\" according to the U.S. Coast Guard. \"Those ROV searches have yielded negative results but continue,\" the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted. Data on the noises was sent to the United States Navy to be examined, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. That evening, a U.S. Navy official told reporters that a portable crane system capable of bringing up items from as deep as 20,000 feet had arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland, but was waiting to be welded onto a chartered ship to take it to the search area. At the time, the U.S. Navy had not yet contracted a ship for the system, known as Fly Away Deep Ocean Salvage System or FADOSS, the official said. Once the ship is contracted, U.S. Navy teams will spend approximately 24 hours working around the clock to weld the system aboard the ship before it can leave port, according to the official. FADOSS is the salvage system the U.S. Navy uses for all of its deep-water recoveries. Thursday, June 22 At 6:56 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard announced via Twitter that a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV, deployed by the Canadian vessel Horizon Arctic has reached the sea floor, beginning its search for the missing submersible. The Titan's 96-hour oxygen supply was forecast to run out sometime in the morning. At 7:30 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted that the French vessel L'Atalante has deployed its ROV into the water in the search area. The Royal Canadian Navy's HMCS Glace Bay arrived on scene at around 8 a.m. ET. The ship provides a medical team specializing in dive medicine and a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber, according to officials. Meanwhile, Canadian Coast Guard ships John Cabot, Ann Harvey and Terry Fox were also on scene and ready to provide rescue equipment and personnel, should assistance be required. A Royal Canadian Air Force CP-140 Aurora aircraft was maintaining continuous on-scene support with additional aircrews and assets, officials said. At 11:48 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted that \"a debris field was discovered within the search area by an ROV near the Titanic\" and experts were \"evaluating the information.\" At 2:49 p.m. ET, OceanGate Expeditions issued a statement saying that all five people aboard the Titan were believed to be dead. During a press conference at 3 p.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that an ROV has located the tail cone of the submersible about 1,600 feet from the bow of the wrecked Titanic. Additional debris found was \"consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber,\" according to Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District. The victims' families were \"immediately notified,\" he said. Five major pieces of the Titan, including its nose cone and pressure hull, were discovered by the ROV in a large debris field and a smaller debris field nearby, suggesting a major implosion had occurred , according to Mauger. At the time, it was too early to tell exactly when the implosion happened. It was also unclear whether crews would be able to recover the bodies of those killed and how much of the vessel can be salvaged. Mauger told reporters during the press conference that two ROVs, one from France and the other from Canada, will remain at the site to continue mapping the debris fields. At around 6 p.m. ET, a senior U.S. Navy official confirmed to ABC News that an underwater acoustic detection system heard on Sunday what was likely the implosion of the missing submersible. The information was immediately shared with the U.S. Coast Guard and analysis continued afterward, the official said. Separately, a U.S. defense official told ABC News that an analysis of the \"banging\" noises picked up by sonar buoys on Tuesday were not from the Titan but were either natural ocean sounds, biological noises or noises associated with the surface response vessels.

(Chelsea Kemp/CBC) Social Sharing Fifteen people have been confirmed dead after a crash between a semi-trailer truck and a bus full of seniors headed to a casino near the southwestern Manitoba town of Carberry on Thursday, the commanding officer of the province's RCMP said at a news conference. Rob Hill said the small bus that collided with the semi was carrying about 25 people — most of whom were seniors from in and around the western Manitoba city of Dauphin, about 150 kilometres north of Carberry. Ten survivors were taken to hospital for their injuries, but Hill said the number of casualties may shift into the evening. \"Sadly, this is a day in Manitoba and across Canada that will be remembered as one of tragedy and incredible sadness,\" Hill said, adding many people in the Dauphin area are still waiting for news about their loved ones. \"To all those waiting, I can't imagine how difficult it is not knowing if the person you love the most will be making it home tonight. I'm so sorry we cannot get you the definitive answers you need more quickly.\" Earlier Thursday, there were multiple tarps on the ground close to where the collision happened at the intersection of the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 5, just north of Carberry, a small community about 160 kilometres west of Winnipeg. Ron Bretecher said both of his parents were among the passengers on the bus to the casino. While his mother is in hospital at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg, his father is still unaccounted for. \"So [my] family's just basically waiting for word,\" Bretecher said at the hospital Thursday evening. \"It's just very difficult.\" Barbara Czech, a spokesperson for Sand Hills Casino near Carberry, confirmed the bus was en route to that casino. Czech said to her knowledge, the private vehicle operator had not been there before. Kim Armstrong, the administrator of the Dauphin Active Living Centre, said the bus departed for the casino from the lodge in the morning. Seniors and community members often go on bus trips to nearby events and casinos, she said. The senior community is extremely tightly knit in Dauphin, a city of about 8,000, she told The Canadian Press. \"It's huge to lose so many individuals of our community and, of course, it is shocking. We just pray for those that are surviving.\" Dauphin Mayor David Bosiak said \"literally everyone in town knew someone that was on that bus.\" \"There's a collective feeling of shock — it's just a tremendous tragedy for our little community. \"It's a kick in the teeth, a punch in the gut.\" WATCH | Vehicle smoulders in ditch after crash: Serious crash in southwestern Manitoba leaves smoking vehicle in ditch 2 years ago Duration 0:21 A crash between a semi-trailer truck and a bus full of seniors near the southwestern Manitoba town of Carberry left the smaller vehicle smouldering in a ditch on Thursday. Both drivers alive: RCMP Supt. Rob Lasson, the Manitoba RCMP's officer in charge of major crime services, said Mounties were dispatched to the crash scene at 11:43 a.m. An initial investigation determined the seniors' bus was going south on Highway 5 and was crossing the eastbound lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway when it got hit by the semi, Lasson said. He said it's still early in what is a complex investigation and all the answers aren't immediately available. Investigators in Manitoba are connecting with those in Saskatchewan who worked on the deadly Humboldt Broncos crash for assistance, Lasson said. The drivers of both vehicles are alive and in hospital, but Lasson would not say which vehicle had the right of way. \"Answers will take some time, but I can assure you that the RCMP will get the answers,\" Lasson said. \"Even at the outset of an investigation such as this, we need to be alive to the fact that there could be wrongdoing. And if so, there could be a criminal element to this investigation.\" WATCH | Former RCMP collision analyst describes how he would approach investigation: What investigators will be looking for at the scene of the Manitoba crash 2 years ago Duration 2:21 Former RCMP collision analyst Rob Creasser describes how he would approach the investigation of a major highway accident and the questions he would have. Massive fire: witness Nirmesh Vadera said he was working at a café near the crash site when he went outside and saw a vehicle that had gone up in flames. \"The fire was about 10 to 15 feet high and the smoke was almost 20, 30 feet high,\" Vadera said, adding the vehicle was completely burned within a half hour. A plume of smoke is seen rising from the crash in this image provided by Nirmesh Vadera. (Submitted by Nirmesh Vadera via The Canadian Press) Witnesses recounted rescue workers frantically pulling people from the burning bus near a partially jackknifed semi-trailer truck with a Day & Ross logo on the side — its front end crumpled and smashed — amid broken glass, a large bumper and what appeared to be a walker, The Canadian Press reported. Jon Proven said he saw about 20 police vehicles and seven or eight ambulances at the scene as he passed it in the early afternoon. \"I have never seen an accident that big,\" he told CBC. \"It's a little bit shocking.\" Sherree Strain, who works at the Manitoba Crop Diversification Centre just north of the crash site, said she and a group of university students from the centre were shaken by what they saw in the aftermath of the collision. What remains of a burned vehicle was seen in the ditch near the crash site just outside of Carberry, Man., on Thursday afternoon. (Travis Golby/CBC) \"We sat out and watched it for a while,\" Strain said. \"I think they had their little cry.\" Manitoba RCMP said they deployed all available resources to the crash, with units from across western Manitoba there to help, along with other first responders. Major crime services will take over the investigation. Westbound Highway 1 had been reopened to traffic by late Thursday afternoon. Massive emergency response The response to the crash included 14 critical care medical crew and two helicopters from the STARS (Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service) air ambulance service, as well as two planes. STARS spokesperson Blake Robert said it was one of the service's biggest responses ever. \"This is sort of in line with the similar large incidents that we responded to in the past, such as the tragedy with Humboldt Broncos, the incident in James Smith Cree Nation ,\" Robert said in a phone interview. Twelve ambulances were also sent to the scene, Jennifer Cumpsty, executive director of acute health services at Health Sciences Centre, said at the RCMP news conference. \"Paramedics and first responders spend their entire careers preparing for a day like this, hoping it will never come. Today, it came,\" Cumpsty said. Most of the survivors' injuries were either head injuries or orthopedic, Shared Health chief executive officer Lanette Siragusa said at the news conference. First responders, including police and firefighters, were at the scene of the crash Thursday afternoon. (Travis Golby/CBC) A spokesperson for Shared Health said earlier in the day that a mass casualty response had been initiated, with several Manitoba hospitals prepared to receive patients from the crash, including HSC — the province's largest hospital — and others in the Prairie Mountain and Winnipeg health regions. Emergency department, surgical and critical care teams at HSC and the Brandon Regional Health Centre were all prepared for incoming patients, the spokesperson said. Rooms for families have been established at HSC and the Brandon Regional Health Centre, Shared Health said. Family members seeking information from HSC are asked to contact the hospital's switchboard at 204-787-3661 or 1-877-499-8774, while those seeking information from the Brandon hospital are asked to call 204-578-4080. 'Our hearts are broken': deputy premier At Thursday's news conference, deputy premier Cliff Cullen offered condolences to those affected by the deadly crash on behalf of the province. \"Our hearts are broken and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of all the lives impacted by the horrific and devastating tragedy near Carberry,\" he said. The crash left a bus that had been carrying a group of seniors smouldering in a ditch on Thursday. (Submitted by Leighton Hardinge) Other Manitoba officials released statements with similar sentiments, including Premier Heather Stefanson, Lt.-Gov. Anita Neville, Winnipeg Mayor Scott Gillingham and Brandon Mayor Jeff Fawcett. Stefanson and Fawcett said flags will fly at half mast at both the legislative building and all City of Brandon buildings in response to the tragedy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also issued a statement calling the crash \"incredibly tragic\" and offering condolences to those who lost loved ones. A spokesperson for Day & Ross said in a statement the trucking company was heartbroken about the crash but had limited details about what happened. \"We are holding out hope that those injured will recover,\" said William Doherty, the company's CEO. \"We will fully co-operate with the investigation and offer any assistance and support that we can.\" With files from The Canadian Press and CBC's Susan Magas, Brittany Greenslade, Bartley Kives, Zubina Ahmed and Emily Brass ABOUT THE AUTHOR Caitlyn Gowriluk Reporter Caitlyn Gowriluk has been writing for CBC Manitoba since 2019.

        "text": "A University of Waterloo sign stands in Waterloo, Ontario, on Wednesday. Nick Iwanyshyn/The Canadian Press/AP CNN — A 24-year-old student has been charged with stabbing three people during a gender studies class at the University of Waterloo in Canada this week in what police are calling a “ hate-motivated incident.” The suspect, Geovanny Villalba-Aleman, is an international student who recently graduated from the university, Waterloo Regional Police Service Chief Mark Crowell said during a Thursday news conference. Villalba-Aleman is accused of targeting the gender studies class, and “investigators believe this was a hate-motivated incident related to gender expression and gender identity,” according to a news release from the Waterloo Regional Police Service . He has been charged with three counts of aggravated assault; four counts of assault with a weapon; two counts of possessing a weapon for a dangerous purpose; and mischief under $5,000. “It is both sad and disturbing that this incident has occurred during Pride month,” Crowell said. “We hope this incident does not diminish from these celebrations but, instead, encourages us all to come together.” Police say the suspect walked into a university lecture classroom on Wednesday around 3:30 p.m. and stabbed a 38-year-old professor, a 20-year-old female student and a 19-year-old male student with a knife. Roughly 40 students were inside the classroom at the time of the attack, police said. At 3:37 p.m., police received multiple 911 calls from students at the university, saying people were stabbed inside a classroom, Crowell said. The first police officer arrived on the scene within three minutes, the chief said. The victims’ injuries are serious but not life-threatening, and all were being treated at hospitals, police spokesperson Cherri Greeno told CNN Wednesday. Officers found the suspect in the same building where the stabbings took place – Hagey Hall – and placed him under arrest “without further incident,” Crowell said. The suspect initially posed as a victim before officers quickly identified him, he added. Villalba-Aleman was not a member of the class, Crowell said, but spoke with the professor of the class “before attacking her with two large knives without provocation.” Several students attempted to stop the attack while others fled the room, Crowell said. As students were trying to escape, the suspect stabbed two students and attempted to stab a third student, who was not injured, he said. “We have since sought judicial authorizations to search the suspect’s home to further our investigation,” Crowell said during the news conference. “At this point, there’s no information to suggest the suspect coordinated with anyone else in carrying out this attack.” The stabbings prompted the university to issue orders to vacate the building and shelter in place order as police responded to the scene. Waterloo is about 70 miles west of Toronto. CNN’s Raja Razek contributed to this report.",

        "text": "News Canadian Police Just Arrested Influential Neo-Nazi ‘Dark Foreigner’ By Mack Lamoureux July 5, 2023, 11:32am Share: X Facebook Share Copied to clipboard Canada just arrested “Dark Foreigner,” one of the most influential neo-Nazi propagandists of the past decade. Patrick Gordon Macdonald, 26, was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and charged with participating in an activity of a terrorist group, facilitating terrorist activity, and commission of an offense for a terrorist group (wilful promotion of hatred.) Videos by VICE Macdonald was first initially identified as the neo-Nazi propagandist “Dark Foreigner” by VICE News in 2021. An investigation exposed Macdonald’s long history of working as essentially the chief propagandist with the neo-Nazi terrorist organization Atomwaffen. “Mr. Macdonald allegedly helped produce propaganda material for the benefit of the terrorist entity Atomwaffen Division,” reads the RCMP press release . “He allegedly participated in and facilitated the creation, production and distribution of three terrorist propaganda videos.” “This case is the first in Canada in which an individual advocating a violent far-right ideology has been charged with both terrorism and hate propaganda.” The RCMP did not comment on VICE News’ original story. Following the publication of Macdonald’s identity by VICE News, the neo-Nazi was raided by the RCMP in early 2022 and several computers were seized. At the time,Macdonald was living in his parent’s home, where he was running a small graphic design business. Read Next Two of the Worst Far-Right Groups Are Now Fighting Each Other Sources indicated to VICE News that he remained active with the extreme right after he was identified. Earlier this year, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network published an article alleging that he was a member of a Canadian Active Club, a neo-Nazi fitness group. Macdonald was an immensely influential neo-Nazi propagandist and his work inspired other neo-Nazis and was one of the cornerstones of an aesthetic that became known as “terrorwave.” Macdonald first joined the movement in 2017 via the influential neo-Nazi website Iron March, where he linked up Atomwaffen, an infamous neo-Nazi group connected to multiple murders. Using the alias “Dark Foreigner,” Macdonald quickly became the group’s chief propagandist and created posters and artwork celebrating terrorism, bigotry, and violence. “Dark Foreigner was a critical figure in the development of the neofascist accelerationism aesthetic,” Matthew Kriner, the managing director of the Accelerationism Research Consortium told VICE News. “His arrest shows that law enforcement in Canada is committed to addressing and disrupting the growing threat of accelerationist violence and hate. A screenshot from a neo-Nazi propaganda film Macdonald worked on. Photo via RCMP. “Dark Foreigner was well connected in accelerationist networks and likely will represent the first of additional investigations and arrests associated with the accelerationist threat.” Macdonald’s work and influence can still be seen today in the extreme right. On top of creating artwork and propaganda for these neo-Nazi groups, Macdonald actively helped organize and tried to grow the groups, even traveling internationally to visit neo-Nazis overseas, VICE News has previously reported . Multiple people that Macdonald worked and palled around with would catch terrorism charges in the United Kingdom. Other unnamed individuals were arrested alongside Macdonald but have not been named nor charged by the RCMP. Canada declared Atomwaffen a terrorist organization in February of 2021. He will go before a judge later today. With files from Ben Makuch. Tagged: Canadian News , Crime , Dark Foreigner , News , terrorism Share: X Facebook Share Copied to clipboard One email. One story.

In Manitoba, on the doorstep of an election, Premier Heather Stephanson is promising to make similar amendments if re-elected. Trending Now Bill Owens, head of ‘60 Minutes,’ quits show, citing loss of independence Advance voting over last 4 days shatters records, Elections Canada says Story continues below advertisement But the trend of governments spear-heading policy changes like in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and potentially Manitoba isn’t new. Political scientist Jamie Gillies said right-of-centre parties were likely already considering changes like these. “I think what we’re seeing here a little bit is that politicians are responding to their base because they’re not hearing it from elsewhere. It didn’t become an issue until they made it an issue,” he said in an interview Wednesday. Gillies said wedge issues have not worked in Canadian politics. “We saw this in the United States,” he said. “This is dangerous and divisive wedge politics in Canada — sometimes it might work in an election — but most times … if we have an election this will not be a vote-getter for the Progressive Conservatives.” In fact, a June 2023 Angus Reid poll showed Blaine Higgs as the second-least popular premier in the country, after least popular Heather Stephanson. Gillies said it could be Stephanson and Higgs trying to turn the tide for their popularity in the lead-up to an election. New Brunswickers are expecting to face another election in 2024. “But ultimately, their unpopularity does stem from these decisions, it stems from their management of the government, whether it’s the economy or health care,” Gillies said.

Sade London wants officials to talk to students first before enacting policy Paul Hantiuk · CBC Radio · Posted: Sep 01, 2023 4:38 PM EDT | Last Updated: September 1, 2023 Sade London, a non-binary high school student in Saint John, N.B., wants more officials in government to listen to students and teens before changing policies related to gender identity. (Sade London) Social Sharing Day 6 9:28 Non-binary student says requiring parental consent for name and pronoun changes is misguided and dangerous Sade London, a non-binary high school student from Saint John, N.B., isn't proud to say their province was the first when it comes to changing policy regarding pronoun use in schools. They say they're worried about what could happen to LGBTQ youth in different parts of Canada now that other provinces are looking at obtaining parental consent before their child can use a chosen name or pronoun at school. \"It's a very sickening situation. And the fact that it's being spread to more than my province... it makes my stomach turn,\" said London, who is about to start Grade 11. London was among the students who protested New Brunswick's changes to its Policy 713 earlier this year. Saskatchewan Education Minister Dustin Duncan announced students under the age of 16 will need parental permission to change their preferred name and pronouns in school. (Michael Bell/The Canadian Press) Last week, Saskatchewan's Education Minister Dustin Duncan announced a pronoun consent policy for students under 16 that echoed the changes in New Brunswick. Duncan says the policy in Saskatchewan is meant to increase parental involvement and make sure kids are safe in schools. The policy is facing a challenge from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), who argue it's discriminatory because it singles out students who are trans and gender-diverse. Saskatchewn Premier Scott Moe defended the government's move by citing an Angus Reid poll that found most Canadians surveyed support the idea that parents should be informed if their child changes pronouns at school. A number of teachers, LGBTQ activists and students have come out to say they believe these policies could endanger youth. \"If parents that aren't very accepting … find out their kid is trans and is trying to live out their true life at school, they can get very angry and it can end in very serious situations,\" said London. N.B. gender-identity policy will keep kids in the closet, says father of trans teen Civil liberties association calls Sask. government school naming and pronoun policy discriminatory They spoke with Day 6 guest host Stephanie Skenderis about experimenting with their gender identity at school and why politicians should talk to LGBTQ youth before drafting policy. Here is part of their conversation. What does it mean to you to have people in your school community call you by the right name and pronouns? It is the most affirming thing ever. I'm so excited to go back to school. It's only August, but to know I get to exist as Sade, which is a chosen name of mine, and get to also be called they and he and not just she is so exciting. I just feel a lot like myself. It's just like a form of expression, like listening to different music or like drinking the same brand of coffee every day. What does it feel like to be called by a name or by pronouns that don't match your gender identity? It's really weird. Sometimes I forget who it is because I feel so affirmed in a lot of areas of my life, especially school. But being called a name that doesn't line up with me is just confusing. And it feels like people have a lack of respect for me and how I want to be referred to. WATCH | People rally in Saskatoon against new sexual education, pronoun policies in province's schools People rally in Saskatoon against new sexual education, pronoun policies in province's schools 2 years ago Duration 3:05 Sunday's rally was the latest in a wave of opposition to the education policies announced earlier in Saskatchewan last week. Can you help us understand why some students use different pronouns at school than at home? Using different pronouns at school —  it felt like a safe — like an experimental zone, because I knew the staff and the students around me were really supportive. And if I wanted to only go by she/her or only go by they/them ... the people around me would support me without knowing me my whole life, like my family or like anyone in my home situation. Do you know anyone who doesn't want to tell their parents? I know multiple friends that don't want to tell their parents and have admitted the fact that they might not use the same pronouns that align with their sex assigned at birth. There's so many more than you might think. Poilievre says schools should leave LGBTQ issues to parents Something we've been hearing is that some parents who are in favour of policy changes, like the ones in New Brunswick or Saskatchewan, say that they feel they have the right to know what their kids are doing in school. What would you say to them? Kids themselves and these trans kids in this situation know [which] people around them are safe more than anyone. They know if their parents are a safe place to go to or if they feel comfortable talking to them about that sort of situation. Even though it's a very new concept to so many, it's ultimately up to the parents to create that safe space for their kids to be able to tell them these things. And maybe school does that first and maybe friends [do] that first  —  create that safe space first before parents do for kids, which is an unfortunate reality. But you shouldn't have to force your kid to tell you about these things. They should want to come to you because they think of you as a safe space. Sade London, who is a non-binary student at Saint John High School, attending a protest against changes to New Brunswick's Policy 713 this summer. (Grey Watts) When you look at your own school system, how do you think your teachers are going to deal with this situation? Before I even started writing the name Sade on my tests and quizzes and homework that I handed in at school, I also wrote my other name in brackets just so my teachers should know who's who. My teachers picked up my name very, very quickly and heard it amongst friends, and it was so empowering and validating to just know that like —  I'd been outed non-binary —  but once I came up with a new name, they were just so supportive … I know a lot of teachers take pride in the fact that they can have a safe space for kids at school ... Having to decide that and putting that weight on their shoulders to decide if it's okay, it hurts my heart because I know so many of them just want to [create] an accepting space.

Agence France-Presse World News Oct 20, 2023 07:39 am IST Published On Oct 20, 2023 01:55 am IST Last Updated On Oct 20, 2023 07:39 am IST Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Canada announced Thursday it had been forced to repatriate 41 of its 62 diplomats based in India. Montreal: Canada said Thursday it had withdrawn 41 diplomats from India -- fallout from a bitter row over the killing of a Khalistani terrorist on Canadian soil. India planned to \"unethically\" revoke diplomatic immunity for all but 21 of Canada's diplomats and their families by Friday, forcing Ottawa to pull out the others, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said. \"We have facilitated their safe departure from India,\" Ms Joly added. \"This means that our diplomats and their families have now left.\" Relations between India and Canada have plunged since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month publicly linked Indian intelligence to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which India has denied. Nijjar, who advocated for a separate Sikh state carved out of India, was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. \"Revoking the diplomatic immunity of 41 diplomats is not only unprecedented, but also contrary to international law,\" Ms Joly said Wednesday, but said Canada did not plan to retaliate in kind, so as to not \"aggravate the situation.\" \"Canada will continue to defend international law, which applies to all nations and will continue to engage with India,\" she said. \"Now more than ever we need diplomats on the ground and we need to talk to one another,\" Joly added. - Countermeasures - Canada has called for India to cooperate in the investigation but New Delhi has rejected the allegations and taken countermeasures, such as shutting down visa services for Canadians. Ottawa also expelled an Indian diplomat over the affair. External Affairs Minister SJaishankar said last month in New York that his country would be willing to examine any evidence presented by Canada. \"We have actually been badgering the Canadians. We've given them loads of information about organized crime leadership which operates out of Canada,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to Sikh separatists. \"We have a situation where actually our diplomats are threatened, our consulates have been attacked and often comments are made (that are) interference in our politics,\" he said. The Indian government has called the Canadian accusations over the killing \"absurd\" and advised its nationals not to travel to certain Canadian regions \"given the increase in anti-Indian activities.\" India also temporarily stopped processing visa applications in Canada. Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a Canadian citizen in 2015, was shot dead by two masked assailants in the parking lot of a Sikh temple near Vancouver in June. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal group calling for creating a separate state of Khalistan. The Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s. The tensions between Ottawa and New Delhi have created a delicate situation for close Canadian ally Washington, which has in recent months taken steps to move closer to India as the United States seeks to limit Chinese influence in the region.

I am confident that, with diverse leadership experience and impressive track records serving their communities, they will be strong voices for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the Upper House. I look forward to working with them and with all senators as we continue to build a better future for all Canadians.\" — The Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau , Prime Minister of Canada Quick Facts The Senate is the Upper House in Canada's parliamentary democracy. It unites a diverse group of accomplished Canadians in service of their country. Created to counterbalance representation by population in the House of Commons, the Senate not only defends regional interests, it also creates a space for the voices of historically underrepresented groups like Indigenous Peoples, racialized communities, and women. With today's announcement, there have been 75 independent appointments to the Senate made on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Under the Canadian Constitution, the Governor General appoints individuals to the Senate. By convention, senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister. In 2016, the selection process for senators was opened to all Canadians. Candidate submissions are reviewed by the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments, which provides recommendations to the Prime Minister. The Board is guided by public, transparent, non-partisan, and merit-based criteria to identify highly qualified candidates. Once appointed by the Governor General, new senators join their peers to examine and revise legislation, investigate national issues, and represent regional, provincial and territorial, and minority interests – important functions in a modern democracy.

Other debate focused on female spaces, the energy industry and Canada's passport John Paul Tasker · CBC News · Posted: Sep 09, 2023 4:55 PM EDT | Last Updated: September 12, 2023 Conservatives approve policy to limit transgender health care for minors 2 years ago Duration 1:34 Conservative delegates on Saturday voted in favour of some new social conservative policies, including banning medical or surgical intervention for children experiencing gender dysphoria. The controversial resolution passed with 69 per cent of the vote at the party's convention. Social Sharing Conservative delegates voted Saturday to add some new social conservative policies to their policy playbook, including a proposal to limit access to transgender health care for minors and another to do away with vaccine mandates. Despite warnings that these policies could be weaponized by their political opponents to hurt their standing among more moderate voters, a strong majority of the delegates on hand voted for a motion that stated children should be prohibited from gender-related \"life-altering medicinal or surgical interventions,\" and for another that said Canadians should have \"bodily autonomy\" when it comes to vaccines and other health treatments. About 69 per cent of the delegates agreed that young people should be barred from gender-affirming care, which sometimes includes hormone-related treatments that delay puberty or promote the development of masculine or feminine sex characteristics. Michelle Badalich, an Edmonton delegate, said dysphoria is a \"mental health disorder\" and it should be addressed with treatment not \"irreversible procedures.\" \"Please protect our kids,\" she said to thunderous applause. It's not clear precisely which medical treatments would be targeted by the proposed ban. The Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) has said that \"gender-affirming medical interventions may be an important component of comprehensive care\" for some transgender or gender-diverse adolescents. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is not bound to adopt any of the policies that were passed at this convention. Poilievre did not take questions from reporters after the votes. 'Protect your wives and daughters' Liam O'Brien, a Newfoundland and Labrador delegate, noted that \"Canada is watching\" as Conservatives debate controversial policies like this one. \"Canada is also watching our leader kick Justin Trudeau's ass,\" O'Brien said as he urged delegates to keep the focus on the high cost of living and \"Liberal incompetence.\" On another transgender-related policy, delegates voted by an overwhelming 87 per cent to support a plan to demand single-sex spaces that are only open to women, which the party now defines as a \"female person\" with the adoption of the policy. The policy is intended to keep transgender and other gender-diverse people out of women's prisons, shelters, locker rooms and washrooms. Badalich said it's \"not extremist\" to demand that what she calls \"biological women\" have a space to call their own. \"Vote yes to protect your wives and daughters,\" said another delegate, a 15-year-old from Sherwood Park, Alta. A dissenting delegate from Quebec who did not give her name said \"the Liberals will love nothing more\" than to see Conservatives pass policies like this one and use discriminatory rhetoric to describe sexual minorities. \"Please, let's get the Liberals out. Let's get elected,\" she said. Poilievre invokes former Liberal prime ministers' fiscal records in speech at Conservative convention Flush with cash, Conservatives plan to roll out more ads touting Poilievre The convention also adopted a proposal from the Alberta riding of Medicine Hat-Cardston-Warner to impose stiffer penalties on sex offenders and pedophiles. \"Children are little angels of the world,\" a delegate from that riding named Logan said during the debate. He said there are nefarious actors who are trying to \"assault, sexualize and traffic our children,\" and a Poilievre-led government needs to crackdown on the practice. About 86 per cent of the delegates agreed there should be \"stronger legislation\" to try and curb these activities. On the issue of vaccines, an Ontario delegate and medical doctor pleaded with Conservatives to reject mandates so to avoid repeat of what transpired during the COVID-19 health crisis. \"Justin Trudeau's coercive, divisive and ineffective vaccine mandate is a violation of the human right to bodily autonomy. Stand up for freedom, stand up for common sense,\" said Dr. Matt Strauss, the former acting medical officer of health for Haldimand-Norfolk. Delegates agreed with about 68 per cent voting to \"affirm Canadians have the freedom and right to refuse vaccines.\" The delegates were in lockstep on most policy matters. Hiring policies On the issue of preferential hiring for minorities by research institutions, delegates passed a policy that said federally funded jobs should go to a person who's best qualified, \"irrespective of the personal immutable characteristics,\" stated the motion. Adrian Dylianou, a Saskatchewan delegate who backed the policy, said \"woke ideology\" should be rooted out of Canada's universities. The \"woke ideology whims of whoever is in power\" is not the way to structure a workplace, he said. Justin Vuong, an Edmonton delegate who identified as a visible minority, said all job choices should be decided on merit, not the colour of a person's skin. WATCH | Pierre Poilievre's first leadership convention speech Watch Poilievre's entire speech at Conservative convention 2 years ago Duration 1:06:04 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attacked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's economic and fiscal record, as he doubled down on his promise to balance the federal budget, at his party's national policy convention Friday evening. About 95 per cent of members on hand for the vote agreed. On a similar matter, 81 per cent of delegates supported a policy to end \"forced political, cultural or ideological training of any kind\" at a workplace, such as mandatory diversity training and other such programs. Discussion about the motion focused on Jordan Peterson, a professor with a large following in right-wing circles who was ordered by the College of Psychologists of Ontario to take social media training in the wake of complaints about his controversial online posts and statements. \"Two words: Jordan Peterson,\" one Alberta delegate said during the debate. \"Forced cultural or ideological training — none of us that support that,\" he said. Oil and gas Virtually all those assembled agreed that Canada should have more \"robust measures to counter foreign interference\" amid alleged Chinese meddling, improve services for Canada's veterans, eliminate the deficit, reduce the national debt to tackle \"inter-generational inequity,\" and streamline the natural resources regulatory approvals process. In another vote, 84 per cent of delegates agreed there should be a \"purposeful, gradual transition to a lower carbon-use future,\" but the country should continue to use oil and gas. A majority of voters also supported a renewed push to get more infrastructure built to move those fuels to market. During a spirited debate on high-speed rail, an urban-rural divide became obvious as competing speakers weighed in on whether the Tories should back a new rail network. A Nova Scotia delegate said that rural dwellers shouldn't be forced to pay for proposed projects that would primarily benefit the country's cities. Trudeau blasted for passport redesign Earlier Saturday, Daniel Hannon, a member of the British House of Lords and a prominent Brexit campaigner, delivered a speech to the convention blasting Trudeau for allegedly unpatriotic acts taken by his government. A reoccurring theme of the Conservative convention is Tory disgust with the government's redesign of the passport. On Trudeau's watch, the document was stripped of references to notable events in Canada's history, including the country's First World War victory at the battle of Vimy Ridge. The government also dumped images of Terry Fox, who became a national hero with his Marathon of Hope, Quebec City's historic old quarter and the Famous Five trailblazing Canadian women who helped advance women's rights. These changes have been interpreted by many Conservatives delegates as an attempt to erase Canada's history. \"Who would want to efface the images of your history from the passports? Who would want to replace the pictures that tell your story with generic shapes and patterns that could come from anywhere?\" Hannon said. \"Canadians are not a random set of individuals who happen to qualify for the same passport,\" he said. \"Canadians are a nation and not just any nation — they're bound together by shared stories and shared dreams.\" Poilievre shares Hannon's position that the country should embrace a more robust form of national pride. In his keynote address Friday, Poilievre said Trudeau's trying to suppress Canadian patriotism. \"Justin Trudeau wants to cancel our proud history, erasing it from our passports,\" Poilievre said. \"Why? Because there can be no heroes but him.\" \"This business of deleting our past must end. And this is a matter on which English Canada must learn from Quebec. Quebecers — and I'm saying this in English deliberately — do not apologize for their culture, language or history. They celebrate it. All Canadians should do the same.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR John Paul Tasker Senior reporter J.P. Tasker is a journalist in CBC's parliamentary bureau who reports for digital, radio and television.

Ford of Canada said it reached a deal with Unifor , the auto workers union in Canada, on a new three-year national labor contract that would cover 5,000 union workers in the country. Ford would not outline any details of the deal, since the contract still needed to be ratified by Ford-Unifor members. A source told Automotive News that Unifor was seeking wage gains well “north of 20%,” and that pension plan expansion had been a sticking point. Union demonstrators march past West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Sept. 19, 2023. (Blair Gable/REUTERS) · Blair Gable / reuters “We believe that this tentative agreement, endorsed by the entire master bargaining committee, addresses all of the items raised by members in preparation for this round of collective bargaining,” Unifor national president Lana Payne said in a statement . The contract between Ford of Canada and Unifor expired on Sept. 18 at 11:59PM, but both sides continued to negotiate on a deal, with no strike called for by Unifor. Unifor said it had opened formal negotiations with Ford on Aug. 10, as it had picked Ford as its “target” company for securing an initial deal, which Unifor will then use to negotiate with other automakers — GM and Stellantis. In the US, meanwhile, Stellantis said this week it is currently engaged in negotiations with the UAW. But a source close to the talks tells Yahoo Finance negotiations with GM ( GM ) have hit some road bumps. Striking United Auto Workers member Brandon Cappelletty holds his strike sign outside the Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, Sept. 19, 2023. (Rebecca Cook/REUTERS) · Rebecca Cook / reuters GM has apparently continued its “dialogue” with the UAW, the source said, but the “gap is very big” between where the two sides are currently positioned. Finally the source said it was not clear at this point which UAW demands were the most important, or needed to be included in any deal. As for Ford, despite its recent win in Canada, in the US negotiations are ongoing, though the company has not publicly issued a contract proposal since Sept. 14, the day its contract with the UAW expired. The cost incentive of finding a deal soon for the Big Three automakers is rising, as UAW president Shawn Fain said this week that the union would “stand up” strike at additional plants at noon on Friday of this week if “substantial progress” hasn’t been made in talks with the automakers. Currently the strike — which began six days ago — would cost the automakers around $100 million to $125 million each per week, according to Goldman Sachs analysts . Now Barclays is predicting that if the strike were to expand on Friday, the UAW could target the automaker’s big truck plants , which assemble extremely popular and profitable pickups like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, and Ram 1500, in order to hasten the negotiating process.

A source told Automotive News that Unifor was seeking wage gains well “north of 20%,” and that pension plan expansion had been a sticking point. Union demonstrators march past West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Sept. 19, 2023. (Blair Gable/REUTERS) · Blair Gable / reuters “We believe that this tentative agreement, endorsed by the entire master bargaining committee, addresses all of the items raised by members in preparation for this round of collective bargaining,” Unifor national president Lana Payne said in a statement . The contract between Ford of Canada and Unifor expired on Sept. 18 at 11:59PM, but both sides continued to negotiate on a deal, with no strike called for by Unifor. Unifor said it had opened formal negotiations with Ford on Aug. 10, as it had picked Ford as its “target” company for securing an initial deal, which Unifor will then use to negotiate with other automakers — GM and Stellantis. In the US, meanwhile, Stellantis said this week it is currently engaged in negotiations with the UAW. But a source close to the talks tells Yahoo Finance negotiations with GM ( GM ) have hit some road bumps. Striking United Auto Workers member Brandon Cappelletty holds his strike sign outside the Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, Sept. 19, 2023. (Rebecca Cook/REUTERS) · Rebecca Cook / reuters GM has apparently continued its “dialogue” with the UAW, the source said, but the “gap is very big” between where the two sides are currently positioned. Finally the source said it was not clear at this point which UAW demands were the most important, or needed to be included in any deal. As for Ford, despite its recent win in Canada, in the US negotiations are ongoing, though the company has not publicly issued a contract proposal since Sept. 14, the day its contract with the UAW expired. The cost incentive of finding a deal soon for the Big Three automakers is rising, as UAW president Shawn Fain said this week that the union would “stand up” strike at additional plants at noon on Friday of this week if “substantial progress” hasn’t been made in talks with the automakers. Currently the strike — which began six days ago — would cost the automakers around $100 million to $125 million each per week, according to Goldman Sachs analysts . Now Barclays is predicting that if the strike were to expand on Friday, the UAW could target the automaker’s big truck plants , which assemble extremely popular and profitable pickups like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, and Ram 1500, in order to hasten the negotiating process.

During her career in health care and provincial politics, she has been an active advocate for nurses and for community and women's health. She was most recently a consultant with the University of New Brunswick's Faculty of Nursing. John McNair is a lawyer who believes in giving back to his community. He has served on the boards of several non-profits and charitable organizations in the province. He worked until recently as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary to Service New Brunswick and its predecessor corporation, a role he had held since 2009. Krista Ross is an established business and community leader. She is a former business owner who has worked with the Fredericton Chamber of Commerce for 20 years and has supported New Brunswick business and community development as a board member of several local and provincial non-profit organizations. Réjean Aucoin, a lawyer of over thirty years, is a member of the Acadian community of Chéticamp and has been deeply involved in community development across Nova Scotia . He is a proud francophone leader and the founder and past president of the Association des juristes d'expression française de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Rodger Cuzner is a former parliamentarian. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 2000, and represented his home province of Nova Scotia for 19 years while serving in various roles, including Parliamentary Secretary to former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien .

I am confident that, with diverse leadership experience and impressive track records serving their communities, they will be strong voices for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the Upper House. I look forward to working with them and with all senators as we continue to build a better future for all Canadians.\" — The Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau , Prime Minister of Canada Quick Facts The Senate is the Upper House in Canada's parliamentary democracy. It unites a diverse group of accomplished Canadians in service of their country. Created to counterbalance representation by population in the House of Commons, the Senate not only defends regional interests, it also creates a space for the voices of historically underrepresented groups like Indigenous Peoples, racialized communities, and women. With today's announcement, there have been 75 independent appointments to the Senate made on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Under the Canadian Constitution, the Governor General appoints individuals to the Senate. By convention, senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister. In 2016, the selection process for senators was opened to all Canadians. Candidate submissions are reviewed by the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments, which provides recommendations to the Prime Minister. The Board is guided by public, transparent, non-partisan, and merit-based criteria to identify highly qualified candidates. Once appointed by the Governor General, new senators join their peers to examine and revise legislation, investigate national issues, and represent regional, provincial and territorial, and minority interests – important functions in a modern democracy.

Runner-up David Pratt conceded Thursday after 6 rounds of voting Wednesday night Brett Forester · CBC News · Posted: Dec 07, 2023 11:53 AM EST | Last Updated: December 8, 2023 Cindy Woodhouse addresses those in attendance at the Shaw Centre in Ottawa after she was named the Assembly of First Nations national chief on Thursday. (Fenn Mayes/CBC) Social Sharing Cindy Woodhouse was elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) in Ottawa on Thursday, securing victory as runner-up David Pratt conceded. Following Pratt's announcement, Woodhouse, 40, took the stage at the Shaw Centre, where she read the assembly's oath of office and received an AFN medallion around her neck. The new leader promised to start working immediately and tirelessly on child welfare, housing, economic development, policing and other core issues facing communities, pointing to the upcoming federal budget as a first order of business. \"Canada, you cannot forget First Nations,\" she said to applause. \"You take our money from our land, you have to make sure that you work with us to get that out the door to our communities.\" Woodhouse, the AFN's regional chief for Manitoba, had 50.8 per cent support from 461 delegates registered to vote, while Pratt, first vice-chief for the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations in Saskatchewan, trailed with 39.3 per cent support on a sixth ballot late Wednesday night. Woodhouse, left, holds hands with interim National Chief Joanna Bernard and national chief candidate David Pratt on their way into the convention room at the Shaw Centre in Ottawa Thursday. (Olivia Stefanovich/CBC) Under the assembly charter, a candidate must secure 60 per cent of the vote to win, with more than 630 chiefs or proxies eligible to participate. Voting was forced to an end as the convention centre was scheduled to close at midnight, amid rising frustration with the stalemate. Voting was to resume Thursday with a seventh ballot when Pratt's concession was announced. In his speech, Pratt said the issues were too important to hold back the next national chief. \"We leave here united. We leave here behind our national chief,\" he said to applause. \"We're back, and the future belongs to First Nations people.\" Assembly of First Nations fails to elect new chief after 6 ballots, 2nd day of voting required Analysis As the Assembly of First Nations elects a new chief, who's running and how does the election work? Woodhouse, from Pinaymootang First Nation in Manitoba, worked as an AFN negotiator for a $23-billion child and family services class-action settlement reached with Canada last year. She pitched a return to stability, promoting her past experience working for national chiefs Perry Bellegarde and Shawn Atleo. Pledge to focus on core issues Woodhouse succeeds RoseAnne Archibald atop the largest national Indigenous advocacy organization in Canada, after the change-oriented Ontario Cree leader was ousted earlier this year, following harassment allegations and two regional chief-led revolts. Woodhouse is no stranger to the assembly's recent turmoil, having been among the regional chiefs recommending Archibald's removal , before declaring her own candidacy for the top job. In her speech, Woodhouse offered an olive branch, thanking Archibald for smashing the glass ceiling and becoming the first woman national chief. WATCH | Woodhouse says housing is a top priority: Challenges ahead for incoming AFN National Chief Cindy Woodhouse 1 year ago Duration 2:06 Cindy Woodhouse faces some big challenges as only the third woman to lead the Assembly of First Nations. She was part of the executive committee that recommended previous national chief, RoseAnne Archibald, be removed, which fractured the organization. Woodhouse's supporters stressed the strength of her platform, organizing and campaigning, while some opponents felt the AFN should focus on defending First Nations rights rather than co-operating with government. At a news conference Thursday afternoon, CBC Indigenous asked Woodhouse to respond to those chiefs keen on a more adversarial approach. \"Yes, sometimes we have to kick down doors,\" she said. \"But at the time, I think that, in this moment, I'm coming in here as a fresh start to try and say, 'Let's work through some of these issues together.'\" Chief Allen Polchies Jr. from St. Mary's First Nation in New Brunswick took the mic after the fifth round of voting on Wednesday night and expressed his frustration about how long the process was taking. (Fenn Mayes/CBC) Jeff Copenace, chief of the Ojibways of Onigaming in Ontario, was supporting Pratt based on the recommendation of a community youth delegation Copenace brought to the assembly. Copenace was also a vocal Archibald backer, calling her ouster \"a national embarrassment.\" But after the election, Copenance expressed optimism about the future and excitement to see another woman lead the assembly. \"There is always going to be debates about whether we should be more conciliatory or whether we should take a harder approach in terms of protests or blockades,\" he said in an interview. \"And the reality is that all of them are necessary.\" Rising frustration during rounds of voting On Wednesday, the mood became tense as the night wore on with no one close to the 60 per cent mark, particularly after Pratt got a late boost from Sheila North, who was eliminated after the third ballot. North endorsed Pratt in her concession speech, criticizing the \"disrespect\" shown Archibald and offering thinly veiled criticism of Woodhouse. By ballot five, chants of \"concede! concede!\" rang out from the Woodhouse camp, only to be met with \"David! David!\" from Pratt's. They were separated only by a small aisle in the convention centre but the difference between their visions seemed pronounced. David Pratt, first vice-chief for the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, considers his options as the election went late into the evening on Wednesday. (Fenn Mayes/CBC) Pratt wasn't shy of criticizing the federal government, pitching a return to the AFN's foundational vision. Woodhouse, in a scrum with reporters, said she looked forward to working with both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre. Woodhouse told reporters she and Pratt didn't reach a deal before he withdrew, but rather a mutual understanding to work together. In his concession speech, Pratt urged the assembly to unite. \"She has my 100 per cent support. Her success is all of our success, so let's lay aside the animosity,\" he said. \"Let's lay aside all the garbage. Let's lay aside all the voices. Let's lay aside all the negativity from the media, and let's come together and let's be the powerful, united AFN.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Brett Forester Reporter Brett Forester is a reporter with CBC Indigenous in Ottawa.

The Front Commun, which includes members of four major public sector unions representing a “common front” of some 420,000 workers, will be on the picket line through Thursday. The group includes the majority of elementary and high school teachers as well as school support staff. It also includes health-care workers like orderlies and technicians. Andrea Di Tomaso, a representative for school support staff with the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, said “this is not where we wanted to end up.” Educational support staff are among the lowest paid public sector workers and retention is a challenge, she added. “What we need is the right people in the right jobs and the only way to do that is to provide good working conditions and a decent salary,” Di Tomaso said from the picket line.

The Quebec government’s latest offer included a 10.3 per cent salary increase over five years and a one-time payment of $1,000 to each worker. Quebec Treasury Board President Sonia LeBel said the offer was a serious one while unions roundly rejected the proposal.

Speaking in Quebec City on Tuesday, Lebel suggested that the government was open to modifying its offer but said a main sticking point is the “organization of work.” The province, she said, wants to pay workers more for accepting less desirable shifts, such as on nights and weekends. The government’s goal, she said, “is for the day after the signing of the agreement, to see an impact not only in the daily lives of our employees, but also to have improved services for citizens.” Story continues below advertisement Flanked by the ministers of education and health, LeBel said the unions are focusing on the salaries to make a case for a strike. “But when we talk to nurses, when we talk to teachers, they’re talking about their workload.” However, she said the government won’t be able to, in the short term, meet a union demand to reduce the ratio of students to teachers in the province’s schools because of labour shortages.

Simon's office announced three new appointments of \"companions\" — the highest level of the Order of Canada — 15 officers, including one honorary officer, and 59 members. A number of journalists were inducted into the order this year, including two whose work took aim at the presidency of Donald Trump. Susanne Craig began her career at the Calgary Herald before moving on to the Globe and Mail, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. She was made a member of the order for her work as an investigative reporter. Craig, David Barstow and Russ Buettner won the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting in 2019 for their joint investigation into Trump's finances. Gov. Gen. Mary Simon announces 78 new appointments to Order of Canada 1 year ago Duration 6:20 The Governor General has announced 78 new appointments to the Order of Canada — a list that includes activists, authors, artists, Indigenous leaders and other accomplished Canadians. Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and honouree Susanne Craig discusses this distinction and the current climate of journalism. The Pulitzer Prize website says their 18-month investigation debunked Trump's \"claims of self-made wealth and revealed a business empire riddled with tax dodges.\" Reached in New York, Craig told CBC News that when she got the call from the Governor General's office, she thought they had the wrong person. \"I don't live in Canada but I am a Canadian through and through, and I started crying when I got the call ... I couldn't believe it,\" she said. Crossing Trump Craig said she hopes the award draws attention to the work of journalists, whom she described as a \"dying breed\" across the globe. \"Our work ... particularly on Donald Trump and his finances, it shows that one reporter or a small team of reporters can really make a difference,\" she said. \"When reporters are laid off, or they're just not there to bear witness, things do go uncovered. We all benefit from a healthy press.\" Michael de Adder, an editorial cartoonist based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, joins Craig on the member's list for his \"artistic contributions and pointed commentary\" over the years. De Adder's freelance contract with Brunswick News Inc. (BNI) was terminated days after he shared a cartoon depicting U.S. President Donald Trump playing golf next to the face-down bodies of two Salvadoran migrants. Michael de Adder, an editorial cartoonist based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has been made a member of the Order of Canada for his “artistic contributions and pointed commentary.” (Mairin Prentiss/CBC) While BNI did not publish the cartoon, it went viral online. While his freelance gig with BNI came to an end, de Adder was employed by the Washington Post two years later, a position he still holds. \"I think it's amazing. I can't express how happy it made me. The first feeling you have is unworthy, but it's great,\" he told CBC News about being inducted into the Order of Canada. De Adder said he does not know what the future holds for editorial cartooning, but awards like the Order of Canada can draw attention to how important his profession is in the current climate. \"Every time a cartoonist gets an Order of Canada … it highlights how important editorial cartooning is to democracy,\" he said. \"These days, we're constantly under attack.\" Indigenous leadership in arts, heritage, politics Willie Adams, 89 — the first Inuit appointed to the Senate in Canada — was honoured this year for his \"long-standing support of Indigenous interests and for advancing Indigenous representation in Canadian legislation.\" Adams, who was made an officer of the Order of Canada, said the news was a \"shock\" because he did not expect to get such a \"big award.\" Deantha Rae Edmunds, Canada's first Inuk opera singer, was made a member of the order \"for her original compositions and her mentorship of young Indigenous musicians.\" P.E.I. historian Ed MacDonald 'gobsmacked' to be named to the Order of Canada Indigenous author and activist, Raptors president, prolific songwriter joining Order of Canada She said that it means a lot to her to be recognized for dedicating her life to music. \"I'm still in disbelief about this appointment. I'm so touched and it is an absolute honour to be recognized for my work. I'm just thrilled,\" she said. Richard Wayne Hill, an Indigenous knowledge keeper inducted \"for his efforts to recover and restore Haudenosaunee artifacts and ways of living,\" is being given an honorary appointment as an officer. Hill was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, but now lives in Ohsweken, Ont. The Governor General can give honorary appointments to five people who are not Canadian citizens each year. Kim Thúy is an award-winning novelist who lives in Montreal. She has been made a member of the Order of Canada. (Sarah Scott) Another artist on the list of new members is Montréal-based novelist Kim Thúy, who fled Vietnam with her parents and two brothers at the age of 10. Thúy landed in a UN refugee camp in Malaysia before being resettled in Granby, Que. After studying linguistics, she worked as a translator before earning her law degree. Her 2009 debut novel Ru was a bestseller. It won the Governor General's Literary Award, was shortlisted for the Giller Prize and has since been translated into 15 languages. \"I feel absolutely privileged that I have had the opportunity to contribute in building our society and hoping to take it to a kinder place, a more beautiful place,\" she told CBC News. She said it's a \"privilege\" to live in a country that strives to improve through the generations. \"I hope that I won't waste the opportunity because if there is attention on me, then there is a responsibility that comes with it. And my responsibility is to speak up for those who don't have their voices heard,\" she said. Retired general Raymond Henault has been made a member of the Order of Canada. (Canadian Press/Jonathan Hayward) Also being honoured this year is retired general Raymond Henault, the former chief of the defence staff and chair of NATO's military committee. Already a commander of the Order of Military Merit, Henault told CBC News he is \"flattered and humbled\" to made a member of the Order of Canada. \"I have many friends, acquaintances and folks that I have worked with in the past who've received it and know how significant it is and what it means to them. And it certainly means the same thing to me,\" he said. Henault said being named to the order \"gives folks who are serving the confidence that government is acknowledging and appreciative of what they do.\" Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association, has been made a member of the Order of Canada for his work as a “leading policy expert in national trade and industry competition.” (CBC) Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturing Association, has been named a member of the order for his work as a \"leading policy expert in national trade and industry competition.\" \"I hope, at the very least, Canadians who live normal, everyday lives know that … the country notices hard, humble work and that you can make a difference for the Canada brand by just trying to be the best at what you're good at,\" he said.
