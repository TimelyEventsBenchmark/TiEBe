Nearly 50 vehicles were involved in multiple collisions along a highway in Hunan province within a span of 10 minutes on Saturday evening, “with some vehicles catching fire”, local traffic police said in a statement. Footage republished online by the state-owned People’s Daily showed multiple burning trucks bearing the logos of delivery companies, crushed and overturned cars, and a dark cloud of smoke rising from the crashes. Traffic police said 16 people were killed in the pile-up, including seven in a single collision, while 66 others were injured. “The injured were promptly sent to hospital for thorough treatment, including eight whose injuries were relatively severe, whose vital signs are currently stable,” the traffic police said. The People’s Daily said the pile-up took place in the provincial capital Changsha, and that more than 180 rescue workers were dispatched to the scene on Saturday. China’s emergency management ministry on Sunday said it had called for an investigation into the cause of the accident.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered a search and rescue operation which has so far found six survivors in the open-pit mine at Alxa League. But desperate efforts to retrieve others were temporarily disrupted by two landslides. It is not yet clear what caused the slope at the mine to give way. More than 900 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene, Xinhua news agency reported. Mr Xi has instructed authorities to make \"every possible effort\" to find survivors. China orders coal miners to boost output: reports How China shapes the world's coal - BBC Future Wei Zhiguo, leader of the rescue mission, said the operation had been interrupted by a \"large landslide\" on Wednesday evening. This had halted some search efforts overnight, which were also hampered by a second landslide later in the day. \"The rescue work is being carried out in an orderly and tense manner,\" he told state broadcaster CCTV. Police told CCTV that an investigation was underway, and that the relevant persons have been \"controlled\". The mine collapsed around 13:00 local time (0500 GMT) on Wednesday, burying more than 50 workers. It affected a \"wide area\", authorities said. The collapse left a pile of debris roughly 500m (1,640ft) across and an estimated 80m high. CCTV reported the shaft had been operated by the Xinjing Coal Mining Company, which has not issued a statement yet. Mines in China's Inner Mongolia region are some of China's top coal producers. Chinese mines have also been trying to boost output over the past year in a bid to boost supplies and lower prices. Accidents are not uncommon in China, where industrial safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December 2020, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. And in January 2021, 10 miners were killed in a blast at a gold mine in Shandong province.

Emergency workers respond to a gas explosion at a barbecue restaurant in Yinchuan, Ningxia, China, on June 21. CGTN CNN — At least 31 people are dead and seven injured in the Chinese city of Yinchuan, in northwest Ningxia region, after a gas explosion at a barbecue restaurant Wednesday night, according to state media. The explosion was caused by a leak of a liquified gas tank inside the restaurant, and took place around 8:40 p.m., according to state broadcaster CCTV. Among the seven injured, one person is still in critical condition. The other six are being treated in the hospital for minor injuries, burns and glass cuts. Local fire authorities sent 20 vehicles and more than 100 personnel to the scene, with search and rescue operations lasting until 4 a.m. Thursday, according to state media. Photos posted by state media show the damaged building, with blackened exteriors, debris on the ground and smoke in the air. Firefighters are seen entering the second floor on a ladder and lifting people out on stretchers. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called the incident “heartbreaking,” and said it was a “profound lesson,” state broadcaster CCTV reported Thursday. Xi added that it is imperative to treat the wounded and comfort the victims’ families, and to find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible. He also ordered a nationwide safety risk review and strengthening of safety supervision in key sectors, CCTV reported. Interviews by police and firefighters on the scene established that two restaurant staffers had smelled gas about an hour before the explosion, the Yinchuan government said in a statement posted online Thursday. The two staffers found the valve of the gas tank had broken, and sent another staff member to buy a new one, according to the statement. The explosion took place as the valve was being replaced. The restaurant is located on a busy street, state media reported. It occurred on the eve of China’s three-day national public holiday, from Thursday to Saturday, marking the Dragon Boat Festival. Police have detained nine people and frozen their assets, including the restaurant’s manager, employees and shareholders, local officials said Thursday. On Chinese social media, many commentators expressed outrage over what they saw as a lack of attention to safety causing the incident. “They smelled the gas leak an hour ago … and dared to (keep the valve) open for an hour, not evacuating the crowd at that time … It could have been avoided, and 31 people’s lives were lost in this way, which made people so angry,” read on post on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo, that garnered more than 9,000 likes. Some others expressed dismay that officials rush to shore up safety standards only after tragedy strikes. At a press conference Thursday evening, Yinchuan mayor Tao Shaohua apologized and expressed his condolences over the tragedy, which he called the most serious safety accident to have taken place in Ningxia in years. Tao detailed a raft of follow-up measures, including further investigation and holding those responsible accountable. He also announced the city would roll out a one-month campaign investigating and rectifying safety risks, focusing on areas like gas, mining, and construction, according to reports on the briefing from state media. Regional authorities also vowed to crack down on safety violations relating to gas supply and ramp up oversight. The accident had “exposed hidden dangers” such as the inadequate implementation of safety standards and low quality of inspection in some areas, industries and enterprises, Zhang Yupu, a leading Communist Party official for the region said at a meeting Thursday, according to state media. “The losses are very painful, and the lessons learned are extremely profound,” he said. The country has been rocked by a number of safety incidents this year. A coal mine collapse in Inner Mongolia in February left 53 dead ; then in April, the deadliest fire to hit Beijing in two decades killed 29 people in a hospital. On Friday, the Yinchuan city public library announced they would close, following the identification of “major safety hazards in the building” during an inspection, while they underwent “further assessment of the overall building structure and the safety quality.” CNN’s Candice Zhu, Simone McCarthy and Wayne Chang contributed reporting.

People were left trapped in their vehicles as falling snow engulfed the exit of a tunnel in the south-eastern city of Nyingchi on Tuesday evening. Local rescuers said the avalanche was \"triggered by powerful winds\". It is not known how many people are still missing. However, 53 survivors were found, five of whom were seriously injured, according to Global Times, citing a local government official. State-run Xinhua news agency , external reported that local authorities sent 1,348 rescue workers and 236 pieces of equipment to help excavate a passage of 7.5km (4.66 miles) The avalanche covered a highway that connects the town of Pai in Mainling county and Medog county in Tibet, a remote and mainly Buddhist autonomous region of western China. The mountain has an altitude of nearly 4,500 metres (14,764 ft), as well as steep slopes and part of the road that runs along it is rugged. Rising temperatures also played a part in the disaster, experts from the local emergency rescue headquarters told Xinhua. The Himalayas are often hit by avalanches, as it is home to the world's highest mountains. At least 26 people died back in October after a mountaineering expedition was caught in an avalanche on Mount Draupadi ka Danda-II, in India's northern state of Uttarakhand.

Videos posted online show the driver getting out of the car and throwing banknotes into the air, shortly after the crash. Police have detained the 22-year-old man and launched an investigation. The crash took place on Wednesday during the evening rush hour at a busy junction in the southern city of 19 million. \"He deliberately drove into the people who were waiting for the traffic light. He rammed the car into them maliciously. After that, he made a U-turn and hit people again,\" an eyewitness told local outlet Hongxin News. \"He wasn't driving too quickly, but some people couldn't run away in time because they wouldn't have known he was hitting people deliberately.\" The man also reportedly drove into a traffic police officer and his motorcycle, but the officer managed to escape. One widely circulated clip shows a young girl lying on the ground at the scene of the incident, while a woman said to be her mother is seen by her side wailing. Another eyewitness described the chaos of the aftermath on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter. The person said that an hour after the incident, the site was still filled with ambulances and traffic police \"and they had not moved all the injured and the bodies from the scene\". \"The scene was too tragic and I couldn't bear seeing it. I felt so sad that I wanted to throw up whenever I heard the siren of the ambulance,\" the person said. The incident has sparked public anger, with many expressing sorrow that it happened in the lead-up to Chinese New Year, a time for family reunions. \"The victims could be a girl who dressed up meticulously to go on a date… It could be a food deliveryman who earned five yuan after rushing an order. It could be a father who wanted to go home and have dinner with children. It could be a child who was happily shopping,\" one Weibo user wrote. Many noted that the man drove a luxury car and had thrown money into the air, and asked if he came from a rich and powerful family. The incident quickly became a trending topic on Weibo on Wednesday, but it later disappeared from the \"hot searches\" list, leading users to accuse the platform of censorship. There have been similar recent incidents. In February 2022, a driver ploughed a mini truck into people in the southern province of Fujian, killing three and injuring nine. Earlier this week, a hotel guest in Shanghai deliberately drove his car into the lobby following an argument with staff. Nobody was injured in that incident.

Police sealed off the area around the kindergarten after the stabbing attack [Video obtained by Reuters] Published On 10 Jul 2023 10 Jul 2023 Six people, including three children, have been killed and one injured in a stabbing at a kindergarten in southern China, according to an official. A spokeswoman for the city government said the attack took place in Lianjiang in Guangdong province on Monday. “The victims include one teacher, two parents and three students… and one suspect has been arrested,” she told the AFP news agency. (Al Jazeera) The BBC also reported the incident, citing local police who said the attack took place at 7.40am (23:40 GMT on Sunday), and the suspect – a 25-year-old man with the family name Wu – was arrested 20 minutes later. Police have classified the case as “intentional assault”, the report added. The incident was the top-trending discussion on the social media platform Weibo, with 130 million views as of 12.20pm (04:20 GMT), but videos shot by passersby claiming to show the crime scene were removed from Weibo as well as video-sharing platform Douyin. China has seen a number of stabbing attacks in schools in recent years, despite government efforts to improve security. Last August, three people were killed after an attack in southern Jiangxi province that also targeted a nursery school. In April 2021, two children were killed and 16 others wounded when a knife-wielding man entered a kindergarten in southern China. In June of the previous year, 37 students and two adults were wounded by a knife-wielding attacker at a primary school in southern China. And in November 2019, a man climbed a kindergarten wall in southwest Yunnan province and sprayed people with a corrosive liquid, injuring 51 of them, mostly students. The same year, eight schoolchildren died and two others were wounded in a “school-related criminal case” in the central Hubei province, with a 40-year-old man arrested. And in April 2018, a 28-year-old man killed nine college students and injured 12 others outside their school in the northern province of Shaanxi. The attacker later said he acted out of revenge after being harassed by a student at the same school.

The Syrian president is in Hangzhou to attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games scheduled for Saturday. (Xinhua/Yao Dawei) HANGZHOU, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Friday jointly announced the establishment of a China-Syria strategic partnership. The two presidents met in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, ahead of the opening of the 19th Asian Games scheduled for Saturday. Syria was one of the first Arab countries that established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and was one of the countries that co-sponsored the resolution to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, Xi said. Over the 67 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the China-Syria relationship has stood the test of changes in the international situation, and their friendship has grown stronger over time, he said. Xi noted that the establishment of the strategic partnership will be an important milestone in the history of bilateral ties. China is willing to work with Syria to enrich their relationship and continuously advance the China-Syria strategic partnership, Xi said. Xi emphasized that China will continue to work with Syria to firmly support each other on issues concerning the two sides' respective core interests and major concerns, safeguard the common interests of both countries and other developing countries, and uphold international fairness and justice. China supports Syria in opposing foreign interference, rejecting unilateralism and bullying, and safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said. China supports Syria in conducting reconstruction, enhancing counter-terrorism capacity building, and promoting a political settlement of the Syrian issue following the \"Syrian-led, Syrian-owned\" principle, Xi said. China also supports Syria in improving its relations with other Arab countries and playing a greater role in international and regional affairs, he added. China is willing to strengthen Belt and Road cooperation with Syria, increase the import of high-quality agricultural products from Syria, and jointly implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative to make active contributions to regional and global peace and development. Assad said that in international affairs, China has always aligned itself with international fairness and justice, and upheld international law and humanitarianism, playing an important and constructive role. Syria highly appreciates and firmly supports the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and will actively participate in them, Assad added. The Syrian side thanks the Chinese government for its invaluable support to the Syrian people, firmly opposes any act of interference in China's internal affairs, and is willing to be China's long-term and staunch friend and partner, he said. Assad said Syria will take the establishment of the Syria-China strategic partnership as an opportunity to strengthen bilateral friendly cooperation and step up their communication and coordination in international and regional affairs. After the talks, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents in areas including Belt and Road cooperation, and economic and technological cooperation. The two sides issued a joint statement on the establishment of the strategic partnership. Senior Chinese leaders including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Wang Yi and Shen Yiqin attended the activities. ■ Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Hangzhou, capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province, Sept. 22, 2023.

As of 8:15 pm (1215 GMT) on Friday, 144 residents aged between eight and 94 years old were injured amid the heavy rainfall, the Hong Kong government said in a statement. Videos showed water cascading down steep hillsides in the former British colony, flooding waist-deep in narrow streets, and inundating malls, metro stations and tunnels. The extreme weather also brought chaos to the nearby Chinese city of Shenzhen, a tech hub of more than 17.7 million people, with business and transport links across the economically important Pearl River Delta severely hit. \"I've never seen scenes like this before. Even during previous typhoons, it was never this severe. It's quite terrifying,\" said Hong Kong assistant nurse Connie Cheung, 65. The torrential rain was brought by Haikui, a typhoon that made landfall in the Chinese province of Fujian on Tuesday. Although it later weakened to a tropical depression, its slow-moving clouds have dumped huge volumes of precipitation on areas still soaked by rain from a super typhoon a week earlier. Hong Kong's weather bureau issued its highest \"black\" rainstorm warning early on Friday. It said more than 200 mm (7.9 inches) of rain was recorded on Hong Kong's main island, the Kowloon district and the northeastern part of the city's New Territories from late on Thursday. The alert was lowered by 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) but authorities warned of risks from ongoing flooding. The city's leader, John Lee, said he was very concerned about the severe flooding in most parts of the territory and had instructed all departments to respond with \"all-out efforts\". Hong Kong authorities shut schools on Friday and told workers to stay home. The city's stock exchange was also closed. Eric Chan, secretary for administration, said Hong Kong's transport network was \"severely disrupted\" and an \"extreme conditions situation\" would be extended to midnight on Friday. MTR Corp (0066.HK) , opens new tab , which operates the city's rail network, said at least one line was shut while others were operating with delays. One video clip showed metro workers wading waist-deep in a station. Some roads were partly washed out, including a main route to the city's southern beaches. A car was swallowed up by a metres-wide pothole when one section of road collapsed, social media pictures showed.

Hong Kong's cross-harbour tunnel, one of the main arteries connecting the island to Kowloon, was inundated and a shopping mall in the Chai Wan district was half-submerged. Some passenger and cargo clearance operations at two border points between Hong Kong and Shenzhen were suspended due to flooding. Macau ferry operators in Hong Kong said several sailings would be suspended to the gambling hub. More than 100 pigs in an area near the border with Shenzhen drowned in a flood, media reported. GUANGDONG SWAMPED The China Meteorological Administration said heavy rain would fall until early Saturday on the central and southwestern areas of Guangdong province. All schools, some subway stations and offices in the Guangdong city of Shenzhen were shut on Friday. Residents holding onto safety lines stepped gingerly through knee-deep water in Shenzhen, videos from state media showed. A rainfall log showed 465.5 mm (1.5 ft) of rain fell in Shenzhen over a 12-hour period, the most since records there began in 1952. Daily rainfall in the city in the Pearl River Delta linking Hong Kong to China's mainland was expected to exceed 500 mm, Shenzhen media said. Videos showed both the exit and entry areas of the Shenzhen railway station were flooded, with trains connecting the city and the provincial capital of Guangzhou suspended. About 100 people were stranded at the station. Schools in 10 districts of Guangzhou were suspended for the day or had to open late, while the city of Zhuhai near Macau warned of waterlogging and landslides. The industrial city of Dongguan north of Shenzhen reported its heaviest rain in 15 years. Sign up here.

[Photo/Xinhua] At least 21 people have been killed and six are missing after a flash flood and landslides triggered by heavy rain struck Weiziping village in the outskirts of Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province in Northwest China, according to the city's bureau of emergency management on Sunday. The disasters struck Weiziping in the Chang'an district shortly after 6 pm on Friday. The village is located on the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains. Two residential houses in the village were destroyed, and roads, bridges, power supply equipment and other infrastructure were damaged. A local restaurant owner said it was dinnertime when the torrential rain hit, and some tourists were swept away by the sudden flood. A woman surnamed Wu, who runs a homestay business in the village, told reporters that she has not received any information from her family about their safety, and she is still waiting for updates from rescue personnel. Emergency records show that the Xi'an meteorological center issued an orange alert, the second highest in China's four-tier color-coded warning system for rainstorms, at 12:35 pm on Friday, and upgraded the alert to the highest level three hours later. A team of more than 100 rescue personnel that arrived at the site on Friday night had relocated 81 people and searched 65 kilometers of river bank by Sunday morning, according to news reports. By Sunday afternoon, the authorities had dispatched nearly 1,000 rescuers to the village and relocated 186 people.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEIJING (AP) — A 50-year-old Israeli man who works at the Israeli Embassy in Beijing was stabbed Friday in front of a supermarket, Chinese police and the Israeli government said.\nBeijing police said they had arrested a suspect, a 53-year-old foreign man. They described the victim as a family member of an Israeli diplomat. No motive was given for the attack, and it was unclear if it was connected to the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas.\n“The employee was transferred to hospital and he is in a stable condition,” an Israeli government statement said, without giving additional details.\nA video posted on social media showed a man with a knife grappling with another man on the ground and stabbing him several times, leaving a trail of blood stains on the sidewalk.\nPeople working in the area said they heard the victim shouting as police cars and an ambulance arrived. A police cordon was set up and the blood later washed away. \nThe stabbing occurred as Muslims across the world took to the streets in large protests after Friday prayers over Israel’s intense bombing campaign in Gaza, following the unprecedented and deadly incursion by the militant group Hamas into southern Israel last Saturday.\nAlso Friday, Israel sharply criticized China’s statement about the initial Hamas attack. Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Ambassador Rafi Harpaz had expressed his country’s “deep disappointment” to China’s envoy for the Middle East, Zhai Jun. The two diplomats talked by phone on Thursday.\n\n\nThere was “no clear and unequivocal condemnation of the terrible massacre committed by the terrorist organization Hamas against innocent civilians and the abduction of dozens of them to Gaza,” the Israeli statement said. “The Chinese announcements do not contain any element of Israel’s right to defend itself and its citizens, a fundamental right of any sovereign country that was attacked in an unprecedented manner and with cruelty that has no place in human society.”\nAsked about the Israeli statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that China opposes acts harming civilians and violating international law.\n“China will continue to work unremittingly for de-escalation of the situation and the resumption of peace talks,” he said.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking at a joint news conference with the EU foreign policy chief, said that China’s Mideast envoy would travel to the region soon to work toward a ceasefire and de-escalation.\nChina has supported the Palestinians in their demand for an independent state. “Israel has the right to establish a state, and so does Palestine,” Wang said, saying the failure to create a Palestinian state is the root cause of the conflict.\nIn Beijing, about half-a-dozen plainclothes police were stationed outside the Israeli Embassy in addition to the normal contingent of uniformed officers. Some 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) away at the Palestinian Embassy in Beijing, plainclothes officers were also on hand and one was tightening wires on a fence.\nSince the war broke out, antisemitic remarks have surged on Chinese social media. Bombarded with hostile messages, the Israeli Embassy in Beijing is filtering comments on its Chinese social media account.\nThe embassy selected a comment that said, “Support Israel! Destroy the terrorist organization!“ — the remarks got 5,700 likes.\nChinese state media have blamed the United States for fanning tensions in the region. \n“The Chinese government has always propagated a narrative that places the blame squarely on Israel, a key U.S. ally, because this aligns with a key objective of (the ruling Communist Party’s) propaganda: to undermine the U.S. in the international community,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Freedom House. “This time, it is no exception.” \nWhile the United States remains Israel’s top ally, China in recent months had tried to reach out to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox government as tensions had risen with Washington over Netanyahu’s planned overhaul of the country’s judiciary, which sparked months of protests. \nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin were in the region Friday in support of Israel while President Joe Biden also has spoken out against the Hamas attack. America also has sent additional arms to Israel, deployed one aircraft carrier group and plans to send another to discourage a regional escalation as Israel prepares for a possible ground offensive in Gaza. \nThe U.S. ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, tweeted on X that “we are shocked by today’s attack on an Israeli diplomat in Beijing” and said the embassy had offered its full support to the Israeli Embassy and the Israeli community in China.\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing earlier this week, voiced dissatisfaction over the initial Chinese statement on the deadly Hamas incursion. \nSchumer later said he was gratified when a Foreign Ministry spokesperson later added that China is “deeply saddened by the civilian casualties” and “opposes and condemns acts that harm civilians.” \nGambrell reported from Jerusalem.

(Liu Bin/Xinhua via AP, File)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEIJING (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán held talks on Tuesday with Vladimir Putin in a rare in-person meeting for the Russian president with a leader of a European Union country.\nOrbán and Putin met in Beijing before an international forum on one of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature policies, the Belt and Road Initiative. Their meeting focused on Hungary’s access to Russian energy. \nEU and other Western leaders have largely eschewed contact with Putin over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began in February. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met with Putin in person in April 2022.\n“Hungary never wanted to confront Russia. Hungary always has been eager to expand contacts,” Orbán told Putin, according to a Russian translation of his remarks broadcast on Russian state television.\nBilateral ties between the two countries have suffered because of EU sanctions against Moscow, he said.\nHungary’s stance on the war has confounded its European partners and led to deadlocks in providing financial and military assistance to Kyiv. Orbán has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons and not allowed their transfer across the Hungarian-Ukrainian border. He has also threatened to veto EU sanctions against Moscow, though has always ultimately voted in favor of them.\nOrbán’s meeting with Putin appeared to be a boon for the Russian president, who could point to it as a sign that unity within the EU on its support for Ukraine — and its condemnation of Russia for starting the war — was faltering.\n\n\nPutin said that while opportunities for maintaining ties with some countries are “limited in the current geopolitical situation, it causes satisfaction that we have managed to preserve and develop relations with many European countries, including Hungary.”\nBudapest has blocked an EU military aid package to Kyiv worth 500 million euros ($526 million) since May, and said it would continue doing so until it receives concessions from Kyiv concerning its listing of a Hungarian bank as an international sponsor of the war.\nOrbán, a conservative populist leader who has repeatedly criticized Western sanctions against Russia, said that his country has remained eager to maintain ties with Moscow, on which Hungary is highly dependent for natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel. \nWhile most of Hungary’s neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe have taken great strides to wean themselves off of Russian energy, Orbán has worked to maintain and even increase supplies of Russian gas and oil, arguing that they are essential for the functioning of Hungary’s economy.\n“We are doing what we can and trying to save what we can in our bilateral contacts,” he said, noting the planned expansion of Hungary’s only nuclear power plant by Russian state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom. The project will be financed with a 10-billion euro ($10.5 billion) loan from a Russian state bank.\nIn a post on his Facebook page, Orbán reiterated his longstanding call for a cease-fire and immediate peace talks in Ukraine, though he has not indicated what such an arrangement would mean for Ukraine’s future security or territorial integrity.\n“In Europe today, one question is on everyone’s mind: will there be a cease-fire in Ukraine,” Orbán wrote. “For us Hungarians, too, the most important thing is that the flood of refugees, the sanctions and the fighting in our neighboring country should end.”\nPutin, making a rare trip out of Russia, is holding a series of meetings with other leaders who have come to Beijing for the Belt and Road Forum, and will also hold talks with Xi.\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vučić said Tuesday that he had had a short meeting with Putin, one that is also likely to raise concerns in Europe. Under Vučić, Serbia has been increasingly drifting away from its proclaimed goal of joining the EU and is moving closer to Russia and China economically and politically.\nSerbia has refused to join EU sanctions against Moscow, although Vučić says Serbia respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\nBoth China and Russia are the main suppliers of weapons for the Serbian army at a time when growing tensions over its former province of Kosovo is one of the main Western security concerns for regional stability.\nChina has provided Serbia with billions of dollars in loans for factories and highways that Chinese companies are building. A free trade agreement signed with China on Tuesday goes directly against EU economic policies and would have to be scrapped if Serbia were to join the EU.\nJustin Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary. Dusan Stojanovic contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.\nThis story has been corrected to delete references to Putin’s meeting with Orbán as being the first in-person talks for Putin with an EU leader since the start of the war. Putin met face-to-face with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer in April 2022, around two months after the start of the war.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING, Nov 21 (Reuters) - China is ready to work with Argentina to keep relations on a \"steady\" course, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday, after the presidential election victory of a right-wing libertarian who said he will not deal with communists. Argentinian president-elect Javier Milei has criticised China and Brazil , which are among his country's most important trading partners. A few months ago, Milei even likened the Chinese government to an \"assassin\" and said the people of China were \"not free\". Milei's tough talk on China stands in sharp contrast with a vow of cooperation by the outgoing president, Alberto Fernandez, who visited Beijing last month and hailed China as a \"true friend\" of Argentina. Fernandez also pledged coordination with China under frameworks such as the G20 and BRICS. \"Bilateral relations between China and Argentina have shown sound momentum of growth,\" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. \"China stands ready to work with Argentina to keep our relations on a steady course forward,\" she said. But Diana Mondino, an economist tipped to become foreign minister in the Milei government, was quoted as saying by Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti that Argentina would \"stop interacting\" with the governments of China and Brazil, when asked whether Argentina would encourage exports and imports with those countries. Mondino has previously told Reuters that Argentina under Milei had no intention of joining the BRICS grouping, which includes China and Russia. Argentina was among six countries invited to become new members of BRICS, a bloc whose members also include Brazil, India and South Africa. Mao, asked at a regular news conference about the comments attributed to Mondino, said the characterisation of Mondino's comments was different from the interview published by RIA Novosti. \"Mondino said in the interview that some in the world misread President-elect Milei's foreign policy,\" Mao said. \"No countries could step out of diplomatic relations and still be able to engage in economic trade and cooperation. It would be a huge foreign policy mistake for Argentina to cut ties with major countries like China or Brazil,\" Mao said. The Chinese foreign ministry said later on Tuesday that Mao was citing Mondino as saying it would be a mistake to cut ties with China or Brazil. Reuters could not immediately find a version of the interview containing those comments. Mondino did not respond to a Reuters request to clarify her comments to RIA Novosti. Earlier this month, Mondino said Argentina had no problem trading with Brazil, and as for China, Milei would seek to end opaque state-to-state deals. \"What we are not going to do are secret contracts. Argentina, this government, in the last 20 years, has had multiple secret negotiations,\" she said. \"That is not normal and it is what we have said we are not going to do.\" Chinese state media has so far played down Milei's comments but said it would be Argentina's loss if it were to shut China out of its market.

REUTERS/Nicoco Chan Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Companies Weibo Corp Follow Nov 23 (Reuters) - Chinese health authorities have not detected any unusual or novel pathogens and provided the requested data on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday. The WHO had asked China for more information on Wednesday after groups including the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in north China. As per the rule, China responded to the WHO within 24 hours. The WHO had sought epidemiologic and clinical information as well as laboratory results through the International Health Regulations mechanism. The data suggests the increase is linked to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions along with the circulation of known pathogens like mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common bacterial infection that typically affects younger children and which has circulated since May. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus have been in circulation since October. The agency does not advise against travel and trade as they have been monitoring the situation with authorities. No unusual pathogens have been detected in the capital of Beijing and the northeastern province of Liaoning. Chinese authorities from the National Health Commission held a press conference on Nov. 13 to report an increase in incidence of respiratory disease. Both China and the WHO have faced questions about the transparency of reporting on the earliest COVID-19 cases that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The U.N. health agency had also asked China for further information about trends in the circulation of known pathogens and the burden on healthcare systems. The WHO said it was in contact with clinicians and scientists through its existing technical partnerships and networks in China. WHO China said it was \"routine\" to request information on increases in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children from member states, such as China. The global agency decided to issue a statement on China to share available information, as it received a number of queries about it from media, WHO China said in an emailed statement. The ProMED alert was based on a report by FTV News in Taiwan that came out on Tuesday. Undiagnosed pneumonia was not mentioned at last week's press conference, according to a transcript, but one speaker said everyone felt like there had been an increase in respiratory illnesses this year compared with three years ago. The speaker said that global monitoring for mycoplasma pneumoniae had been at a low over the past three years and outbreaks were cyclical, occurring every three to seven years. 'SEASONAL SURGE' The rise in respiratory illnesses comes as China braces for its first full winter season since it had lifted strict COVID-19 restrictions in December. Many other countries saw similar increases in respiratory diseases after easing pandemic measures. \"It is just a relatively large seasonal surge, perhaps partly due to chance and partly because there's a bit of 'immunity debt' from the lesser winter surges in the last three years,\" said Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University. China's National Health Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, it published an interview with the state media agency Xinhua in which it advised parents what to do and mentioned that big hospitals were receiving a large number of patients and waiting times were long. It did not comment on the WHO notice. Since mid-October, the WHO said northern China had reported an increase in influenza-like illness compared with the same period in the previous three years. It said China had systems in place to capture information on trends in illness incidence and to report that data to platforms such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. In recent days, media in cities such as Xian in the northwest have posted videos of hospitals crowded with parents and children awaiting checks. Some social media users have posted photos of children doing homework while receiving intravenous drips in hospital. The WHO said that while it was seeking additional information, it recommended that people in China follow measures to reduce the risk of respiratory illness. Measures included vaccination, keeping distance from sick people, staying at home when ill, getting tested and medical care as needed, wearing masks as appropriate, ensuring good ventilation, and regular hand-washing, it said.

Biden and Xi met for about four hours on the outskirts of San Francisco to discuss issues that have strained U.S.-Chinese relations. Simmering differences remain, particularly over Taiwan. In a significant breakthrough, the two governments plan to resume military contacts that China severed after then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. “We’re back to direct, open clear direct communication on a direct basis,” Biden said. In addition, Biden said he and Xi agreed to high-level communications. \"He and I agreed that each one of us can pick up the phone call directly and we'll be heard immediately.\" But in a comment likely to irk the Chinese, Biden told reporters later that he had not changed his view that Xi is a dictator. \"Well, look, he is. I mean, he’s a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is a communist country,\" Biden said. Xi told Biden that the negative views of the Communist Party in the United States were unfair, a U.S. official told reporters after the meeting. Biden and Xi came into the talks looking to smooth over a rocky period in relations that took a turn for the worse after a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon transited the United States and was shot down by a U.S. fighter jet in February. The White House said Biden raised areas where Washington has concerns, including detained U.S. citizens, human rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong and Beijing’s aggressive activities in the South China Sea. \"Just talking, just being blunt with one another so there’s no misunderstanding,\" Biden said. MILITARY, TAIWAN U.S. and China's militaries have had a number of near-misses and acrimonious exchanges over the past year. After the pledge to renew communications, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will meet his Chinese counterpart when that person is named, a senior U.S. official said. Biden and Xi agreed China would stem the export of items related to the production of the opioid fentanyl, a leading cause of drug overdoses in the United States. \"It’s going to save lives,” Biden said, adding he appreciated Xi’s “commitment” on the issue. Under the agreement, China will go directly after specific chemical companies that make fentanyl precursors, a senior U.S. official told reporters. He vowed to \"trust but verify\" Chinese actions on the drug. The two leaders also agreed to get experts together to discuss the risks of artificial intelligence. A U.S. official described an exchange over Taiwan, the democratic island that China claims as its territory. China's preference is for peaceful reunification with the Chinese-claimed island of Taiwan, Xi told Biden, the U.S. official said, but Xi went on to talk about conditions in which force could be used.

The U.S. official said Biden argued to maintain the status quo and for China to respect Taiwan's electoral process. \"President Xi responded 'Look, peace is all well and good, but at some point we need to move towards resolution more generally',\" the official quoted Xi as saying. Xi also urged the United States to stop sending weapons to Taiwan and support China's peaceful \"reunification\" with Taiwan, Chinese state media said. Bonnie Glaser, a Taiwan expert at the Germen Marshall Fund of the United States, said Xi seemed to have conveyed both threats and assurances on Taiwan. \"The suggestion that a resolution needs to be found in the near term is a worrisome sign, even if he emphasized that there are no plans for military action against Taiwan in the coming years,\" she said. Biden said he asked Xi to use his influence with Iran to urge Tehran not to launch proxy attacks on U.S. targets in the Middle East as the Israel-Hamas conflict continues in Gaza. RESPECT AND WARMTH Biden welcomed the Chinese leader at the Filoli estate, a country house and well-manicured gardens about 30 miles (48 km) south of San Francisco, where they will move later for a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. APEC meets amid relative Chinese economic weakness , Beijing's territorial feuds with neighbors and a Middle East conflict that is dividing the United States from allies. Xi came into the meeting looking for respect from the United States as China's economy struggles to recover from sluggish growth. Biden, who had long sought the meeting, struck a warm, welcoming tone. Video of the two clasping hands in farewell after the meeting was posted on X by the Global Times, China's state-backed tabloid. \"Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed,\" Xi told Biden as they and their delegations sat across from each other at a long table in an ornate conference room. Biden said the U.S. and China had to ensure that competition between them \"does not veer into conflict\" and manage their relationship \"responsibly.\" After lunch, the leaders took a short walk together in the manicured garden of the mansion following an interaction that lasted around four hours. Biden waved to reporters and gave a two thumbs up sign when asked how the talks were going. \"Well,\" he said. Xi told Biden as they began their talks a lot had happened since their last meeting a year ago in Bali , citing the impacts of the COVID pandemic, and calling the U.S.-China relationship \"the most important bilateral relationship in the world.\" \"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,\" he said. \"It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other.\" After the two met, Biden welcomed global leaders to the APEC meeting in San Francisco, where he said Xi regarded the visit as a homecoming given the city’s large Chinese population.

The appointment comes as President Xi Jinping upgrades the military as part of his push to make China a dominant world power , a goal that has alarmed many neighbours. Dong, 62, was appointed at a meeting of the standing committee of China's National People's Congress, state news agency Xinhua said. The role of China's defence minister is to be the public face of the People's Liberation Army in its engagement with the media and with other armed forces. A crucial element of his job is to engage with the United States military to lower the risk of conflict over Taiwan and the South China Sea, two flashpoints to which Dong is no stranger. Before becoming the People's Liberation Army Navy chief and made a full general in 2021, he was vice commander of the East Sea Fleet, the backbone of what is now the Eastern Theatre Command - the main force responsible for fighting over Taiwan, a self-ruled island China considers its own. He also served as vice commander of the Southern Theatre Command which operates in the disputed South China Sea, most of which is claimed by China. \"Dong would be familiar with managing near-encounters between the Chinese and US military. This is useful when he has to manage crises between both militaries,\" said Li Mingjiang, an international relations scholar at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Wen-Ti Sung, political scientist and non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, said the selection of Dong could be a sign that purges are ongoing in the Rocket Force and Equipment Development Department. The two preceding defence ministers, who came from these two forces, have since disappeared from public view. Beijing has not explained Li's disappearance but stripped him of his title as defence minister and state councillor in October. Li had headed the department in charge of equipment procurement and research before taking up the defence minister job in March. He has not been seen in public since Aug 25. Reuters cited sources to report that Li was under investigation for corruption related to equipment procurement and development. Related: White House 'eager' to resume military talks with China Snap Insight: Chinese defence minister’s sacking reflects Xi Jinping’s deeper problems During his brief tenure as minister, Li did not meet his US counterpart - Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin. The ministry explained that Washington would have to first remove the sanctions it placed on Li in 2018 over his role in purchasing Russian aircraft and equipment. Dong would face no such constraint, as he is not known to be under US sanctions. When President Joe Biden and Xi met in San Francisco last month, both leaders agreed to resume senior military talks that were suspended following then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. SURPRISE PROMOTION Dong, born in 1961, was made commander of the navy in August 2021. He was replaced by Hu Zhongming earlier this month. His promotion comes as a surprise, however. Many analysts had expected Liu Zhenli, a 59-year-old general and head of China's joint staff department, to become the new defence minister. He notably spoke last week with his American counterpart during the first high-level call in more than a year between military personnel from the two leading world powers. That followed an agreement by President Joe Biden and Xi at a summit last month to restore military communications between their two countries. Biden at the time said the move was \"critically important\" to avoid possible conflicts. But that summit also saw Xi warn the US president against supplying further arms to Taiwan, insisting China's reunification with the island was \"unstoppable\".

Commentary: How to stop a war between America and China WIDER PURGE In a possible sign of a wider purge, nine senior military officials were removed from China's top legislative body, Xinhua reported, citing a separate Friday announcement from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. These include former People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force chief Li Yuchao who was abruptly replaced in July, his predecessor Zhou Yaning, two other rocket force officials, two officials from the PLA equipment development department, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department Zhang Zhenzhong and ex-Air Force commander Ding Laihang. Zhou headed the Rocket Force between 2017 and 2022. Zhang was deputy commander of the PLA Rocket Force between 2016 and March 2022, where he overlapped with Li Yuchao. He previously held commander or deputy commander roles at two satellite launch sites and a space launch site. Three executives at state-owned missile defence firms were also stripped of their membership of a ceremonial political advisory body on Wednesday. China's defence ministry vowed to \"crack down on every corrupt official\" in August when asked about the whereabouts of Li's predecessor, Wei Fenghe - its first reference to corruption probes among top military leaders following a major shake-up of the armed force overseeing China's nuclear and conventional missile arsenal. The US Department of Defense has been in touch with China at the working level about a sequence of upcoming engagements, Pentagon spokesperson John Supple said on Friday, adding the two sides are working to implement what Biden and Xi announced in November. \"These kinds of engagements take time to schedule and prepare for on both sides so that defense and military leaders from our two countries – including at the senior-most levels – can have substantive conversations with their appropriate counterparts,\" Supple said. Defense Policy Coordination Talks in January and Military Maritime Consultative Agreement talks in early 2024 are in the planning stages, he added.

As the world's largest video game vendor, Tencent's market value experienced a long fall following the reveal of these new laws.\nChina's biggest player in the gaming market has undergone massive growth over the last decade, with Tencent buying up plenty of game studios like Dying Light maker Techland. China has become the largest gaming market in the world, with many of its players buying microtransactions. It seems that the Chinese government is worried about the popularity of such practices, and intends to keep it from growing out of control.\nThe Finals' community manager reveals the company's plans for addressing its cheating issue, a common problem in multiplayer FPS games.\nAs reported by Reuters, Chinese lawmakers unveiled new laws pertaining to video games. These laws will ban rewards for spending money within a game for the first time, ban rewards for buying consecutive microtransactions, and ban rewards for daily log-ins. These practices have become commonplace in many free-to-play games. Also, these new laws will implement a cap on how much each player can spend within a game.\nFollowing this news, Tencent Holdings' shares fell 16% at one point, and China's next biggest gaming company, NetEase, fell as much as 25%. These drops make up the bulk of an $80 billion total selloff in China's gaming market over the last 24 hours. This massive amount of money displays the scale of gaming in China and how lucrative it has become. The nation's newest set of gaming laws comes after its 2021 implementation of regulations intended to curb video game addiction among minors.\nAlthough it's possible, it seems unlikely that similar laws will be implemented in the West. The practice has become intertwined with the successful free-to-play model, with nearly every game of that type offering a wide range of microtransactions.\nSome players take serious issue with these practices, with one NBA 2K player filing a lawsuit against Take-Two recently for its use of microtransactions. Although the implementation of this practice is largely unpopular and a far cry from gaming's early days, the cat seems to be out of the bag. Free-to-play games have become some of the most popular titles in gaming, and microtransactions are one of the only reasons that these games are sustainable. However, some game studios have found a healthy balance, offering microtransactions in addition to unlockable rewards.\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nPlease verify your email address.\nYou’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nDice Dreams players can enhance their gaming experience and get free rolls with the help of these links.\nSouth Korean studio Shift Up provides an update on the PC version of Stellar Blade, which now has a tentative release window.\nWith the highly anticipated Overwatch Classic mode set to launch on November 12, its return to Overwatch 2 may bring several benefits and challenges.\nThe first Scenario in Planet Coaster 2, Parks and Restoration starts off easy and then presents players with tough Platinum Medal tasks at the end.\nBoth F2P and premium players of Pokemon Pocket can level up faster if they follow these fundamental principles of EXP farming.\nOne Captain America: Brave New World star admitted they had to do reshoots even if they were only months away from the film's release.\nA popular actor from the hit Netflix series Stranger Things is writing and possibly directing a remake of a memorable 1990s horror movie.",

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations. The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs. This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine , providing a path back to lost websites and work. Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

The crash of a China Eastern Boeing 737-800 passenger jet in China's southwest started a fire big enough to be seen from space and forced rescuers to search a rugged, remote mountainside. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The Associated Press By JOE McDONALD, AP Business Writer BEIJING (AP) — China is, along with North America and Europe, one of the world’s top three air travel markets. It has dramatically improved safety since a string of deadly crashes in the 1990s and 2000s. The crash Monday of a China Eastern flight comes after years free of major air disasters. The country has not reported a crash of a commercial flight with more than five fatalities since 2010. The ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, also has suffered fatal crashes, but few details are available. CHINA EASTERN AIRLINES CORP. China Eastern is, along with Air China, China Southern Airlines and HNA Group, one of four major carriers in China, all state-owned. Founded in 1995, the airline is headquartered at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport. Its fleet of 749 aircraft includes 291 from the Boeing 737 series, according to its mid-2021 interim report. The carrier has 79,913 employees, mostly in China. It carried 44.3 million passengers in the first half of 2021. China Eastern reported a loss of 5.4 billion yuan ($850 million) in the first half of 2021. Political Cartoons on World Leaders View All 148 Images Political Cartoons View All 459 Images CHINA'S AIRLINE INDUSTRY Carriers have suffered heavy financial losses as the government tries to eliminate COVID-19 with a “zero tolerance” strategy that bars most foreign visitors from China and has disrupted travel by suspending access temporarily to major cities. Passenger numbers within China exceeded the United States in 2020 for the first time, according to Boeing Co. That was partly because populous China reopened to domestic travel relatively quickly after the initial coronavirus outbreak. Boeing forecasts 5.4% annual traffic growth and says China should account for one-sixth of future added airline capacity. State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern’s fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country — nearly 1,200 — and if identical planes at other Chinese airlines are grounded, it “could have a significant impact on domestic travel,” said aviation consultant IBA. CHINA'S LAST BIG CRASH An Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines and carrying a total of 96 passengers and crew hit the ground short of the runway on Aug. 24, 2010, while landing in the northeastern city of Yichun. The crash killed 44 people after the fuel caught fire, while 52 people survived. Investigators blamed an error by the pilot, who was landing at night and in reduced visibility. China Eastern’s last fatal crash was in November 2004, when a bombardier CRJ-200 plunged into a frozen lake just after takeoff from the Inner Mongolian city of Baotou, killing 53 people on board and two on the ground. Regulators blamed ice that had collected on the wings. The Civil Aviation Administration of China and China Eastern have sent officials to the crash site. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said a senior investigator was chosen to help, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help if asked. CHINA'S AIRCRAFT MARKET China is one of the most important markets for Boeing and its European rival Airbus Industries. They want Chinese carriers to drive sales as U.S. and European demand flatten. The ruling Communist Party wants to compete with them by making its own jetliners and eventually exporting them. State-owned COMAC, or the Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, has released a short-range jetliner, the ARJ21, for up to 105 passengers, and the larger but short-range C919 with up to 190 seats. The company says it is working on a long-range, twin-aisle plane, the C929, for as many as 290 passengers. ___ This version has corrected the plane that crashed in 2010 carried 96 people and 52 of them survived, not that the 44 who died was the total number on board.

(Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images) By Christian Shepherd October 14, 2022 at 7:29 a.m. EDT A one-person protest in Beijing has called for elections, an end to the country’s strict “zero covid” policy and the removal of “dictator” Xi Jinping, in a rare display of political dissent that was met with a wave of online censorship days ahead of a key political meeting expected to extend Xi’s rule for at least another five years. The banner called for elections, an end to the country’s strict “zero covid” policy and the removal of “dictator” Xi Jinping, in a rare display of dissent. (Video: Reuters) “We want to eat, not do coronavirus tests; reform, not the Cultural Revolution. We want freedom, not lockdowns; elections, not rulers. We want dignity, not lies. Be citizens, not enslaved people,” read the red handwritten characters on large white banners hung from Sitong Bridge in the city’s northwest Haidian district on Thursday at around midday local time, according to pictures and video of the banners shared widely online. 今天上午北京四通桥上有人挂出了条幅，在社交媒体疯传。 pic.twitter.com/cTUBePKMGF — Jingzhou Tao 陶景洲 (@JingzhouTao) October 13, 2022 A second banner read: “remove dictator and national traitor Xi Jinping.” Nearby pedestrians stopped to read the banners and stare at a plume of black smoke from a fire lit on the bridge by the individual who appeared to be dressed in the yellow hard-hat and orange jacket of a construction worker, according to videos of the incident. Advertisement Some images appeared to show the individual being taken away by police, although there had not been any official confirmation of an arrest by Friday. The Haidian district public security bureau hung up when called by The Washington Post. Xi Jinping’s quest for total control of China is just getting started The Chinese Communist Party, intolerant to criticism of top leaders at the best of times, is currently on hair-trigger alert as the country’s most senior 2,300 politicians are arriving in the capital city for a congress held every five years. For Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades, the meeting is expected to be a moment of triumph as he upsets past convention to stay on as party leader for more than two terms. On Chinese social media, censors battled with users who tried to share information about the protest, vastly limiting the number of posts visible. Search results for terms as generic as “Beijing,” “Haidian,” or “Sitong” returned far fewer entries than normal and only from officially verified accounts. Advertisement Some users attempted to circumvent the restrictions by referring obliquely to the incident — a common practice of censorship-evasion. Some posted a song titled “the brave one” or spoke about a “single spark” in reference to a famous revolutionary essay by Mao Zedong titled “a single spark can start a prairie fire.” The defiant act was hailed by Chinese dissidents and overseas human rights activists, many of whom likened the protester to “ tank man ,” the unidentified man who faced down Chinese soldiers on Chang’an Boulevard on June 5, 1989. China’s high-tech authoritarianism means activists can only operate in “lone warrior” mode, Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights advocate who now lives in the United States, wrote on Twitter. Xi’s focus on national security and “social stability” has severely limited space for dissent in China. The latest generation of Chinese human rights and democracy activists has found it increasingly difficult to privately meet or share ideas, let alone organize a serious revolt against Communist Party rule. Advertisement Security in the capital tends to be at it highest during major political events like the upcoming congress. Dissidents who live in Beijing are often taken away by minders to far-flung parts of the country and checks increase for people entering the city. This year, China’s continued strict covid controls have added a layer of travel restrictions and surveillance. Few signs that China is trying to escape its ‘zero-covid’ trap By Friday, police had been installed near prominent bridges across the city, according to pictures posted by residents online.

The first two cases confirmed in Tianjin were a 10-year-old girl and a 29-year-old woman working at the after-school centre. Both were infected by the Omicron variant. In subsequent testing of close contacts, 18 others tested positive and 767 tested negative as of Saturday night.

China has stepped up its zero-tolerance Covid-19 strategy in the run-up to the Winter Olympics, which open on 4 February in Beijing. The Chinese capital is 150km (90 miles) north-west of Tianjin and connected by a high-speed rail link that takes less than one hour. Millions of people are being confined to their homes in Xi’an and Yuzhou , two other cities that are farther away but have larger outbreaks. The city of Zhengzhou, a provincial capital 70km (40 miles) north of Yuzhou, is also conducting mass testing and closing schools starting Monday. China reported 165 confirmed coronavirus cases for 8 January, up from 159 a day earlier, its health authority said on Sunday. Of the new infections, 92 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, from 95 a day earlier. Most of the new local cases were in the provinces of Henan, home to Yuzhou, and Shaanxi, home to Xi’an. China reported 46 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, compared with 52 a day earlier. There were no new fatalities, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 103,619 confirmed cases as of 8 January.

Many others were trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the remote region . Rescue workers climbed mounds of broken bricks, some using ladders in heavily damaged villages, as they searched for survivors. Videos posted by China’s Ministry of Emergency Management showed two people being carried on stretchers by workers treading over the debris from collapsed homes. At least 188 people were injured in Tibet on the Chinese side of the border, the official Xinhua News Agency said. More than 1,000 homes were damaged in the barren and sparsely populated region, state broadcaster CCTV reported. In video posted by the broadcaster, building debris littered streets and crushed cars. People in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage, according to the country’s National Emergency Operation Center. The area around Mount Everest, about 75 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was empty in the depth of winter when even some residents move away to escape the cold. RELATED COVERAGE Aftershocks and lack of resources hinder recovery work 3 weeks after Myanmar’s deadly earthquake Myanmar’s military leader is in Thailand for talks on earthquake relief Rockies manager Bud Black’s commute to Dodger Stadium interrupted by Southern California earthquake The quake woke up residents in Nepal’s capital of Kathmandu — about 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the epicenter — and sent them running into the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China’s Earthquake Networks Center recorded the magnitude as 6.8. Shallow earthquakes often cause more damage. The epicenter was in Tibet’s Tingri county, where the India and Eurasia plates grind against each other and can cause earthquakes strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks in the Himalayan mountains. Tibet is part of China, but many Tibetans’ loyalties lie with the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. Western governments and human rights organizations have repeatedly accused the Chinese government of abuses in Tibet , where it has cracked down on dissent while investing heavily in economic development. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday’s quake hit over the past century, the USGS said. About 150 aftershocks were recorded in the nine hours after the earthquake, and the Mount Everest scenic area on the Chinese side was closed. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for all-out efforts to rescue people, minimize casualties and resettle those whose homes were damaged. More than 3,000 rescuers were deployed, CCTV said. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing was dispatched to the area to guide the work, and the government announced the allocation of 100 million yuan ($13.6 million) for disaster relief. About 6,900 people live in three townships and 27 villages within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of the epicenter on the Chinese side, state media said. The average altitude in the area is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the Chinese earthquake center said in a social media post. On the southwest edge of Kathmandu, a video showed water spilling out into the street from a pond in a courtyard with a small temple. “It is a big earthquake,” a woman can be heard saying. “People are all shaking.” ___ Associated Press writer Binaj Gurubacharya in Kathmandu, Nepal, and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

The Trump administration said tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants into the US, but they potentially risk substantial price increases for American consumers across an array of common goods from avocados to sneakers to cars. Hours later, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced “far-reaching” retaliatory levies. China’s commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and “take corresponding countermeasures,” without elaborating. The tariffs, and subsequent retaliation, risk igniting a trade war that could significantly damage the economies of the targeted countries and the United States. In anticipation, Trump’s executive action includes a clause that allows the president to expand the tariffs if a country imposes new tariffs on the United States. The new policy represents a reversal of virtually duty-free trade among the three North American nations that’s existed for several years — and an expansion of a frosty trade war between China and the United States that has escalated over the past two administrations. President Donald Trump speaks as he signs an executive order in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, on Friday. Carlos Barria/Reuters Related live-story Trump announces new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China As Trump has repeatedly promised over the past several months, the tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States. The tariffs will have no exemptions, and the executive action Trump signed Saturday will close the so-called de minimis loophole that had allowed shipments of $800 or less to come into the United States tax-free — a key provision used by many American small businesses but also Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu. Trump administration officials said the loophole prevented customs officials from properly inspecting those packages. Although Trump administration officials said Saturday the tariffs were designed to stop the flow of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants, they gave no specific benchmark for the new import taxes to be lifted — other than the cessation of the drugs and undocumented immigrants coming into the country. Notably, the tariffs included an important carve-out — the tariff on Canadian energy products will be 10%. Many Americans rely on Canadian energy products, including oil, electricity and natural gas, for fuel and home heating. The cost of those items could rise when the tariffs hit. To put the tariffs in place, Trump in his executive action declared a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as “IEEPA,” which authorizes a president to unilaterally manage imports during a national emergency. The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 am ET. “Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China,” Trump said in a message posted to Truth Social on Saturday. He said he used the IEEPA “because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all.” Igniting a potential trade war The tariffs  could lead to potentially much higher costs, disrupted supply chains and the loss of jobs. In a call with reporters Saturday, a Trump administration official said any retaliation from Mexico, China or Canada would likely result in even higher tariffs for that country. Even Trump acknowledged the potential for adverse consequences on American consumers. “There could be some temporary, short-term disruption, and people will understand that,” Trump said Friday when pressed by reporters on the cost of tariffs being passed on to importers and, by extension, consumers. “But the tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong — and we’re going to treat other countries very fairly.” Hours after Trump’s action, Trudeau announced retaliatory 25% tariffs on US goods, that will be “far-reaching and include everyday items,” making good on his promise that Canada would retaliate forcefully and swiftly if the United States imposed levies. The country’s trade representatives met with Trump administration officials as recently as Friday in an attempt to stave off the tariffs. “Tonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% trade tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods,” the Canadian leader said in a news conference Saturday night. “This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days’ time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.” Affected items will include American alcohol, produce, clothing, shoes, household appliances, furniture, materials such as lumber, and “much more,” Trudeau said. Avocados and bananas from Mexico are displayed at a grocery store in San Francisco on Thursday. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Here’s what will get more expensive from Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China Mexico’s Sheinbaum also struck a defiant tone Saturday. “When we negotiate with other nations, when we talk with other nations, [it is] always with our heads held high, never bowing our heads,” Sheinbaum said, speaking in Chicoloapan de Juárez, east of the country’s capital. “I instruct the Secretary of Economy to implement plan B that we have been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico’s interests,” Sheinbaum said later in a post on X. It is not clear exactly what the retaliatory tariffs involve. A White House fact sheet on the tariffs said Mexican drug trafficking organizations have an “intolerable alliance” with the country’s government, accusing the government of providing a “safe haven” to cartels. Sheinbaum strongly denied “having alliances with criminal organizations,” calling the accusation “slander.” Meanwhile, China’s Ministry of Commerce said the imposition of tariffs “seriously violates” World Trade Organization rules. “China will file a complaint with the WTO, and will take corresponding countermeasures to resolutely defend its rights,” it said. It is not clear what the measures will be. Beijing’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said tariffs are “not constructive” and will only “undermine” work by both nations to combat narcotics. China “provides support to the US on the issue of fentanyl” but ultimately, “fentanyl is America’s problem,” the ministry said. Tariffs are one of the few policies Trump has consistently supported for decades, a rare through-line from his days as a New York developer to his time in public office (another is immigration). As a candidate, he swore he’d use tariffs — “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” — to wield US leverage abroad. But tariffs are unpopular among mainstream economists, who largely agree they cause inflation. That’s because importers — not the countries exporting the goods — pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices. New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump’s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything — from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food. Businesses lash out at Trump’s tariff plan Corporations and business groups were apoplectic about the tariffs Saturday. The US Chamber of Commerce slammed the levies, warning they will raise consumer prices. In a statement, the powerful business group acknowledged that Trump is right to focus on securing the border and to fight the illicit flow of fentanyl. “But the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains,” said John Murphy, senior vice president and head of international at the chamber. “The Chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.” The National Association of Manufacturers said the tariffs would hurt American factories and their employees. “The ripple effects will be severe, particularly for small and medium-sized manufacturers that lack the flexibility and capital to rapidly find alternative suppliers or absorb skyrocketing energy costs,” said NAM CEO Jay Timmons. “These businesses—employing millions of American workers—will face significant disruptions. Ultimately, manufacturers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, undermining our ability to sell our products at a competitive price and putting American jobs at risk.” The Distilled Spirits Council of the US, the Mexican Chamber of the Tequila Industry and Spirits Canada said in a joint statement shared with CNN on Saturday that they are “deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries.” Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to US Department of Agriculture data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.

Kent Nishimura/Getty Images Related article With stiff tariffs he promised now in place, Trump opens a new trade war The energy industry was unsatisfied with the reduced tariffs on Canadian oil, gas and electricity. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents Big Oil and natural gas companies, said in a statement that it wanted to be fully left out of the tariffs. It noted fuel prices would rise on the $14.4 billion of oil and natural gas imported each year from Canada. “We will continue to work with the Trump administration on full exclusions that protect energy affordability for consumers, expand the nation’s energy advantage and support American jobs,” American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. NEMA, which represents the electricity industry, urged the Trump administration to take a more cautious approach to tariffs, noting the electricity and the electronics industries make up a large chunk of America’s imported and exported goods. Western Growers, which represents farmers, said the tariffs would hurt America’s food producers. “While we appreciate the border security issues apparently motivating the Trump Administration, rival growers of specialty crops outside of the U.S. will move quickly to seize the new business opportunities created by these tariffs to sell into the Canadian, Mexican and Chinese marketplaces,” its CEO Dave Puglia said in a statement. Consumer advocacy groups also warned Trump’s plans would raise costs for Americans. “Tariffs are a tax increase on American households and manufacturers,” National Taxpayers Union President Pete Sepp said in a statement. And new Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin came out swinging in a statement, offering an early preview of how his party intends to message more aggressively against Trump on kitchen table issues: “Here’s the thing about Donald Trump’s erratic tariff policy: Trump isn’t going to make corporate billionaires pay for these tariffs – working families and small businesses will. He’s using American workers as pawns in his petty political games,” Martin said. “If a president promised that they’d help my family get by, and then they did this, I’d be pretty pissed off. So, you should be pissed off.” Why those countries? Key trading partners Mexico, China and Canada are the United States’ three largest trade partners. And in 2023, Mexico overtook China as the top nation exporting goods to the US, marking the first time in two decades China was not the top-ranking exporter. Tariffs the first Trump administration put in place, which Joe Biden’s administration largely maintained, have negatively impacted the amount of goods the US imports from China. Mexican and Canadian goods have been imported in the US virtually duty-free as a result of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated with America’s bordering nations during his first administration.

Carlos Moreno/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Trump just gave his clearest picture yet of what new tariffs could look like Mexico maintained that top position last year as well, exporting $467 billion worth of goods to the US, followed by China and Canada, which exported $401 billion and $377 billion worth of goods, respectively. That’s according to Commerce Department figures from last year through November, the most recent month of available data. Collectively, the three countries accounted for 42% of the nearly $3 trillion worth of goods the US imported worldwide last year. Canada was the top country the US exported goods to last year, valued at $322 billion, followed by Mexico and China, which received $309 billion and $131 billion worth of goods from the US, respectively. US exports to the three countries accounted for over 40% of the $1.9 trillion worth of goods the US exported globally last year. That means Americans could pay a lot more for a wide range of goods. For instance, the US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, according to Commerce Department data. Both are likely to get more expensive almost immediately after any new tariffs that impact Mexican car exports to the US. Automakers have operated as if Canada, Mexico and the United States were one unified market for decades, moving vehicles and parts across borders as they assemble vehicles. Even cars assembled at US auto plants all have parts that come from both Mexico and Canada, and vehicles assembled in those two countries have parts that come from US factories. Canada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group. Gas, fresh produce, consumer electronics — some of the top goods the US imports from Mexico, China and Canada — could also be set to get more expensive with blanket tariffs.

The fresh duties, announced by China’s Ministry of Finance, levy a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars and pickup trucks. The measures take effect on February 10. The Ministry of Commerce and China’s customs administration also announced new export controls effective immediately on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies. Those include tungsten, a critical mineral typically used in industrial and defense applications, as well as tellurium, which can be used to make solar cells. The ministry also said it was adding two American firms — biotech company Illumina and fashion retailer PVH Group , owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — to its unreliable entities list, saying they “violated normal market trading principles.” A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said Tuesday that it found PVH discriminated against and interfered with the operations of Chinese companies, though the spokesperson failed to provide specifics. PVH criticized the decision and said it would work with Chinese authorities to resolve the situation. “We are surprised and deeply disappointed to learn of the decision from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,” a spokesperson for PVH said in a statement. “In our 20 years of operating in China and proudly serving our consumers, as a matter of policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices.” In a separate statement , China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said it was initiating an investigation into Google for suspected violation of its anti-monopoly. The company, whose search engine is not available in China, has minimal operations in the country. The raft of announcements come as a broad-based 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the United States announced by the White House on Saturday came into effect. China’s measures appear to vary in their potential impact on the US economy and businesses. For example, China is the leading global producer of tungsten concentrates, representing more than 80% of world production, according to US government estimates from 2020. The tariffed items, however, represent a relatively small proportion of overall bilateral trade. “The measures are fairly modest, at least relative to US moves, and have clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China Economics at financial insight firm Capital Economics, said in a research note Tuesday. The Chinese tariffs target at most $20 billion of the country’s annual imports from the US, about 12% of the total, which is “a far cry” from the more than $450 billion in Chinese goods being targeted by the US, he added. Beijing had slammed those tariffs in a statement Sunday and vowed to “resolutely defend its rights” by filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and taking “corresponding countermeasures.” In a statement Tuesday, China’s commerce ministry confirmed that it had brought the Trump administration’s tariff measures to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. “The US practice seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States, and disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain,” the ministry said. A new trade war? The Chinese measures, announced on the final day of China’s week-long new year holiday, mark what could be the opening salvo of a new tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing. However, they don’t rule out the possibility of further dialogue or deal-making between the two sides. The White House had announced the 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Saturday as part of broader trade measures also targeting Mexico and Canada – part of what the Trump administration said was a bid to hold those countries accountable for illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump attend a welcome ceremony when Trump visited Beijing in 2017. NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP/Getty Images Related article Trump fired the latest tariff shot at China. Is Beijing prepared to make it a trade war? Trump agreed to “immediately pause” tariffs on Mexico and Canada after holding separate calls with those countries’ leaders Monday — the day before the duties on goods from all three countries were meant to come into effect. Both leaders had agreed to strengthen security along their borders. Trump said Monday that he expected he could speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the next 24 hours. Beijing has yet to confirm any call. A White House spokesperson said later Monday the call could happen “in the next couple of days.” This potential exchange comes as Beijing and Washington aim to set the tone for their relationship and navigate a raft of thorny issues — including a gaping trade deficit, a tech and military rivalry and the fentanyl trade. US law enforcement believes a number of China-based entities supply precursor chemicals, which can be used to make finished fentanyl in labs operated by drug cartels in the US and Mexico. Canada makes up just 0.2% of US border fentanyl seizures. Beijing has defended its efforts to control exports of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl and said the latest tariffs would “erode the foundation of trust and cooperation in the field of drug control between China and the United States.” The Shanghai stock index was still closed Tuesday for the Lunar New Year holiday. But stock markets elsewhere in Asia closed higher. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 2.8%. Japan’s Nikkei index was 0.7% up and South Korea’s KOSPI 1.1% higher. Both fell Monday. US stock futures were relatively flat. Room for a deal The 10% duties are a far cry from the upwards of 60% tariffs that Trump had threatened to levy on China during his campaign, signaling that there could be more to come if the two sides are not able to reach a deal on a broader host of issues. Trump campaigned on winning an economic competition against China, and, on his first day in office, ordered a review of the US-China economic relationship, which is due April 1. The results could form the basis for additional duties on Chinese goods. Those could address the gaping trade imbalance between the two countries, while Trump has specifically linked the 10% tariffs to the fentanyl trade. The US president has also said he hopes that countries can reach a trade deal and work together on issues, including ending the war in Ukraine. He also paused the enforcement of a law requiring the ban of social media app TikTok if its Chinese parent company did not divest its US business. These issues are expected to factor into expected talks between the two countries in the weeks and months to come. Beijing has also signaled its intention to avoid a spiraling trade war like the one seen during Trump’s first term in office. At that time, the White House slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of US imports from China, while Beijing retaliated. China has diversified its economy and trade partners since that time, but its export-reliant economy is grappling with slowing growth and other challenges.

The post office had announced Tuesday that it would no longer accept parcels from the China and Hong Kong after the U.S. imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods and ended a customs exception that allowed small value parcels to enter the U.S. without paying tax. The Postal Service reversed course Wednesday but gave no reason. It said it would work with Customs and Border Protection to implement a collection process for the new China tariffs to avoid delivery disruptions. The post office pointed to the short prepared statement on the reversal when asked for more details about the reversal Wednesday by The Associated Press. AP AUDIO: USPS lifts suspension of parcels from Hong Kong and China, reversing decision from a day earlier AP correspondent Julie Walker reports USPS is no longer suspending parcels from Hong Kong and China. The ban had the potential to create massive disruptions for online shopping platforms like Shein and Temu , popular with younger shoppers in the U.S. for cheap clothing and other products, usually shipped directly from China. Cheap, direct postal service helps these companies keep costs low, as did the “de minimis” exemption that previously allowed shipments to go tax-free if their value is under $800. The suspension by USPS would have likely have created delays in shipments and potentially higher prices for the companies that rely on rock-bottom pricing for huge sales. RELATED COVERAGE Rory McIlroy returns at Zurich Classic in New Orleans. LPGA holds year’s first major in Houston US and global economic outlook deteriorates in Trump trade war, IMF says World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab retires as chairman What exactly did the USPS announce? One day after the U.S. Postal Service said in a notice that it would stop accepting inbound parcels from the China and Hong Kong Posts until further notice, it said Wednesday that would “continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong.” Letters and flats — mail that measures up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) long or 3/4 inches (1.9 centimeters) thick — were not included in the brief ban. Why did it happen? The USPS did not give a reason for the ban Tuesday, but the suspension came after Trump closed the “de minimis” customs exemption this week for China that allowed shoppers and importers to avoid duties on packages worth below $800. The exemption was removed as part of an executive order to levy a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. U.S. Customs and Border Protection previously stated that it processes an average of over 4 million “de minimis” imports each week. It also gave no reason for its decision on Wednesday and did not immediately respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment. What’s likely to happen next? Under the new tariffs imposed by Trump on Chinese imports, analysts say consumers are likely to see price hikes and potential delays in shipments from companies like Shein and Temu. Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu, which is owned by China’s PDD Holdings, and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said. Alibaba’s AliExpress has also commonly used the trade loophole. Neil Saunders, a managing director with research firm GlobalData, noted some businesses who sell through Shopify and other e-commerce platforms, such as Etsy, also ship packages to consumers directly from China. Amazon does the same for a subset of products sold through Amazon Haul, a low-cost online storefront it launched last year to better compete with Shein and Temu, which rely more heavily on de minimis. Shein and Temu did not immediately comment on the USPS policy changes. On its website, Temu says it also works with private shipping companies such as FedEx and UPS. Shein notes customers can return their packages through USPS and FedEx. In general, the U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories. ____ Associated Press writers Haleluya Hadero in Charlotte, North Carolina and Matt Ott, in Washington, contributed to this report ZEN SOO Soo reports on technology and business in China and across Asia for The Associated Press.

Just after midnight, Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Beijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. In an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, “they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” Trump also acknowledged there could be “a little disturbance” from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market’s sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation. “It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,” he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. “You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days. “Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said. President Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. Here’s what you need to know about them. Later in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico “in the middle,” with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. Lutnick told Fox Business Network that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise.

A Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford’s press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he’ll go harder. The official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau’s “very dumb” comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump’s trade war. AP AUDIO: Trump’s trade war draws swift retaliation as Mexico, Canada and China impose tariffs on the US AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s blistering rejection of the Trump tariffs. China indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X. The president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient. Import taxes are “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,” Trump said Monday. “And now we’re using them.” Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday’s hikes will lift America’s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. “We’re in a new era for sure.” As the trade disputes escalated, stocks racked up more losses Tuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next. A truck drives past the passenger entry point at the United States and Canada border in Surrey B.C., on Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Ethan Cairns /The Canadian Press via AP) During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs only after lengthy investigations — into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. But by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, “he can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,’’ House said. “It’s chaotic.” Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs. “Presidents don’t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Abusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn’t leadership — it’s dangerous.” Even some Republican senators raised alarms. “Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. Truck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he’s done for decades. Like many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. “Things could change drastically,” Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S. Alan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump’s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States. “Nobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,” Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn’t find enough workers in the United States.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) U.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada. Sales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. “They’re putting that 25% on studs.’' Builders will strain to stay within their budgets. After years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada’s crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold. “That hurts,” he said. At his small distillery “every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.” Bard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky’s Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin. The China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling,” as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.

Indonesia's Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Daniel Marthin outplayed China's Chen Xujun and Huang Di 21-15, 21-9 in the decisive men's doubles to seal the victory, prompting the stadium to erupt in celebration and the entire Indonesian team to rush onto the court to yell and dance in a circle. Mixed doubles pair Rinov Rivaldy and Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti gained an early lead for the team in the first match against China's Gao Jiaxuan and Wu Mengying. The Indonesian shuttlers on Saturday bounced back from a rocky start to beat Thailand 3-1, winning three consecutive matches after dropping the first, propelling them to the finals for the first time. China, on the same day, overcame a tough semi-final against Japan, with the men's doubles pair Chen Xujun and Huang Di edging their opponents out to win the third game, securing a narrow 3-2 victory. Japan and Thailand picked up the bronze medals. China won the 2023 championship with a comfortable 3-1 victory over South Korea in Dubai and in 2019 when they beat Japan 3-2 in Hong Kong. The 2021 edition in Wuhan was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and Japan won the inaugural edition in 2017 in Ho Chi Minh City with a 3-0 win over South Korea. © 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Rescue teams salvaged the ferry on Friday night, according to Xinhua, and are continuing the search. One person who was rescued escaped the ferry by breaking a window with his foot, a relative told The Paper, a Shanghai-based newspaper.

After he resigned from the institute, the researcher, identified by his surname Liu, came up with a \"carefully designed\" plan to sell intelligence to foreign agencies, according to an article published on Wednesday by China's Ministry of State Security. The ministry did not name Liu's former employer or the foreign groups that allegedly bought his material. The announcement comes amid increasing warnings from China that its citizens are being co-opted by foreign entities to serve as spies. \"Desperadoes who want to take shortcuts to heaven will all suffer consequences,\" the ministry said in Wednesday's article. Believing that he had been treated unfairly at the institute, Liu saved a large amount of classified material before he left, intending to use it for revenge and blackmail, the ministry stated. He then joined an investment firm and, after failed investments drove him into debt, approached a foreign spy agency which got the material from him at a \"very low price\", according to the ministry. This agency subsequently cut off contact with Liu, the ministry added, and he tried to sell the information abroad. \"In half a year, he secretly travelled to many countries and seriously leaked our country's secrets,\" the article said. Liu, who confessed after being arrested, has been stripped of political rights for life. Beijing has been increasingly wary of espionage, and warned that its citizens are being recruited by foreign spy agencies trying to secure Chinese state secrets. Last November, a former employee at a Chinese state agency was handed the death sentence after his USB work flash drive was allegedly seized by foreign spies and he became their \"puppet\", according to Chinese authorities. In February last year, Australian writer Yang Hengjun, known for blogging about human rights issues in China, was handed a suspended death sentence on espionage charges. That sentence was upheld, and Yang remains behind bars in China, despite Australian leaders calling for his release. Concerns about Chinese influence and infiltration operations are also brewing among governments across the world, several of which have in recent years stepped up arrests of Chinese nationals on espionage charges.

The Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world’s largest F&B chain by number of outlets, overtaking Starbucks and McDonald’s . The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means “Honey Snow Ice City,” in Chinese, is capitalizing on the region-wide sweet tooth with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee and bubble tea drinks. “Even on social media like TikTok and others, there is a joke that any empty shophouse would soon turn into a Mixue store,” Rahma Yuliana said, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia , where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.

An ice cream sells for as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald’s. As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores carrying its Mixue tea drinks, ice creams and Lucky Cup coffee products, more than the store numbers of Starbucks and McDonald’s, industry analysts reported . About 40,000 of those are in China. RELATED COVERAGE Which US companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives? Which US companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives? Can suspending a cage-free egg law solve the soaring price problem? Nevada takes a crack at it More broadly, by December, Chinese F&B brands had opened over 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, Singapore-headquartered research firm Momentum Works reported . India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds, while there are relatively more Chinese brands in Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations. Nearly all of Mixue’s stores are franchises that the company supplies with ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea. Apart from Mixue, other market stars include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and well-known beverage brands such as Luckin Coffee, Heytea and Chagee. Mixue’s shares have doubled from their IPO price since their March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong. Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are actively seeking new growth in Southeast Asia after facing fierce competition in their home market.

(AP Photo/Vincent Thian) The push by food and drink retailers has raised awareness that China has more to offer than just cheap electronics. The companies are well-equipped, using automation to enhance their efficiency, and adept at online marketing, Li said. Big Western brands sometimes take a long time to find local partners and develop long-term plans. The Chinese F&B companies are “much more impatient,” he said. In Thailand’s capital Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested over $1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish and fried chicken steaks in about six years. Outlets in shopping malls take time to recover costs due to huge rent deposits, she said, but her other outlets typically break even within six months to a year, excluding their lease guarantees. “If you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can’t survive,” she said. In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You vice president Liu Liujun also spotted opportunity in Southeast Asia’s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies. The brand’s $235,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company’s overseas expansion across the region. A customer, Victoria Kovalan said the new Chinese brands made it easier for her to try new cuisines. “It’s opened up our palates,” she said, referring to the popularity of Sichuan hotpots, known for their spicy flavors. Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Hoài in Hanoi initially was skeptical about Mixue as a Chinese brand but has become a regular customer, she said, won over by its affordability and better-than-expected quality. The expansion of Chinese food and beverage brands is part of a broader trend where Chinese goods are no longer seen as merely cheap but as having real value, said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Liu, 68, becomes the 54th laureate of the prize, considered akin to a Nobel in the field of architecture. In an interview with The Associated Press in his office in Chengdu in China’s southwestern Sichuan region, the architect said he had a simple definition of his profession: “To simplify, the task of architects is to provide a better living environment for human beings,” he said, speaking in Mandarin. “First of all, you do something that is functional. But if it is just like that, it cannot be called architecture. (So) you have to provide poetry.” The West Village project by Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Chinese architect Liu Jiakun is seen in Chengdu in southwestern China’s Sichuan province on Sunday, March 2, 2025.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, “forging a positive relationship between density and open space,” a Pritzker statement said. The architect “upholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,” the statement said.

The five-story project includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around “its own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.” They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, “with upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.” Liu was born in 1956 in Chengdu and sent at age 17, during the Cultural Revolution, to labor on a farm in the countryside. He has said life felt inconsequential — until he was accepted to architecture school in Chongqing, where he “suddenly realized my own life was important.” In the interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said the speed of change in China during his early adulthood was “very fast, and it was turning things upside down. Even until now, sometimes I feel like I have lived several lifetimes.” The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun, who earned the field’s highest honor for “affirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,” organizers announced on Tuesday. (AP video shot by Wayne Zhang) Liu established his practice, Jiakun Architects, in 1999. He said he is not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, Liu said, he pays more attention to method and strategy. “Many architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,” Liu said. “No matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.” “I don’t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,” he said. “I take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems … and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.” Liu also said he tries to balance his country’s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology. “I think China’s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,” he said, “but it is a product of its time.” A view of the Luyeyuan Stone Carving Art Museum project by Liu.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) He said he hopes to deeply understand “the thematic part of tradition that can survive,” and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, “tradition can be used as a core … but the presentation of your work is contemporary.” Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns. “The rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,” he said. But he added: “You have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes … without even a place to go and no space for communication.” The Pritzker Architecture Prize was established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: “I have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy … I don’t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.” He had another concern, too. “And will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?” he pondered. “I hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.” —— AP senior video producer Wayne Zhang contributed from Chengdu, China JOCELYN NOVECK Noveck is an Associated Press national writer specializing in culture and gender, and a film critic. twitter mailto",

All of them were dual citizens and their identities have been withheld, Canada's foreign minister Mélanie Joly said. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canada urged Ottawa to \"stop making irresponsible remarks\", as pundits feared a further downturn in relations between the countries after years of strain. China's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had acted \"in accordance with the law\", while the embassy said there was \"solid and sufficient\" evidence for their crimes. Beijing had \"fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned\", the embassy said, urging Canada to respect \"China's judicial sovereignty\". China does not recognise dual citizenship and takes a tough stance on drug crimes. However, it's rare for the death penalty to be carried out on foreigners. Joly said she had been following the cases \"very closely\" for months and had tried with other officials, including former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to stop the executions. In a statement to Canadian media, Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said Canada had \"repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere\". China imposes the death penalty on serious crimes including those related to drugs, corruption and espionage. While the number of executions are kept secret, human rights groups believe China has one of the highest execution rates in the world. \"These shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,\" said Ketty Nivyabandi, from Amnesty International Canada. \"We are devastated for the families of the victims, and we hold them in our hearts as they try to process the unimaginable. \"Our thoughts also go to the loved ones of Canadian citizens whom China is holding on death row or whose whereabouts in the Chinese prison system are unknown.\" In 2019, Canadian national Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was sentenced to death in China for drug smuggling, in a high-profile case condemned by the Canadian government. He was not among the Canadians who were executed. \"We'll continue to not only strongly condemn but also ask for leniency for other Canadians that are facing similar situations,\" Joly said on Wednesday. Relations between Canada and China have been icy since 2018, after Canada detained a Chinese telecom executive, Meng Wanzhou, on a US extradition request. China arrested two Canadians shortly afterwards, both of whom have now been released. In 2023, Canadian media released reports, many based on leaked intelligence, about detailed claims of Chinese meddling in the country's federal elections. China denied the reports, calling them \"baseless and defamatory\". More recently, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports after Ottawa placed levies on Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminium.

Advertisement Paris : Nanjing has had its hosting of the World Indoor Athletics Championships postponed for a third time due to Covid-19 and will hold them in 2025 the sport’s governing body World Athletics announced on Thursday. Glasgow will host the next edition of the event in March 2024, with the Chinese city finally stepping in as host five years later than planned in 2025. “It is with regret that the World Athletics Council has decided to postpone the World Athletics Indoor Championships Nanjing 2023, scheduled for 17-19 March 2023, until March 2025 (exact dates to be confirmed),” said World Athletics in a statement. Advertisement “This decision was taken with the agreement of both the Nanjing organising committee and the Chinese Athletics Association (CAA), due to the ongoing pandemic conditions.” The 2020 championships were first held over until March 2021, and then to March 2023, as the pandemic continued, with Belgrade hosting the 2022 edition. “Weâre disappointed that we have had to postpone this event again due to circumstances beyond our control, but we have done so to give certainty to athletes and Member Federations preparing for the 2023 competition season,âÂ World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said. “Unfortunately, the timeframe will prevent us from relocating the 2023 event, but the indoor championships will return in 2024 in Glasgow.” Coe said they had given Nanjing the slot for 2025 “because we are mindful of the substantial preparations the LOC has already done to host the event and we want to avoid potential financial losses for all parties”.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said it has yet to receive an official report on the matter. “China’s state security authorities have uncovered a case of Filipino espionage and apprehended three Filipino nationals suspected of spying in the country,” Global Times said on X (formerly Twitter). “The investigation revealed that Philippine intelligence agencies have long been focused on gathering information about China’s military deployments,” it added. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Chinese authorities will “strictly handle” the case. “China’s judicial and relevant authorities will strictly handle the case in accordance with law, and protect the lawful rights and interests of the personnel involved,” Guo said. In a statement,  AFP spokesperson Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla said it is still awaiting an official report, but added it is prepared to lend support \" as needed.\" \"The Armed Forces of the Philippines has not received any official report from relevant authorities regarding the alleged espionage claims. We defer to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is currently verifying the situation through appropriate diplomatic channels,\" Padilla said. \"The AFP recognizes the significance of this matter. As it falls under the purview of the Department of Foreign Affairs, or DMW (Department of Migrant Workers) we defer to their expertise and mandate. The AFP remains ready to support as needed,\" she added. GMA News Online has also sought comment from the Philippine Embassy in China, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Department of National Defense (DND), National Security Council (NSC), and Philippine National Police (PNP) about the report, but they have yet to provide a statement as of posting time. Meanwhile, Philippine authorities in the past months have arrested suspected Chinese spies in Manila. Guo called the arrests “a typical act of stigmatization and politicization based on presumption of guilt in the absence of clear evidence.” “China urges the Philippines to stop shadow-chasing and making false accusations, handle the cases concerning Chinese citizens in a just manner and in accordance with the law, and effectively protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the Philippines,” he said. The AFP earlier said it is improving its intelligence and cyber defense amid the reported espionage activities in the country. National Security Adviser Secretary Eduardo Año urged Congress to amend the Espionage Act as well as the Countering Foreign Interference and Malign Influence bill. —VAL/RF, GMA Integrated News Tags: China , Filipino spy , spies News Voter's Education Candidates Find out your candidates' profile Debates Find the latest news Stand on Issues Find out individual candidate platforms MyKodigo Choose your candidates and print out your selection.

Follow BEIJING, March 31 (Reuters) - The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has discovered an oilfield in the South China Sea with proven reserves exceeding 100 million tonnes, Xinhua news agency reported on Monday. The newly found Huizhou 19-6 oilfield is not in a disputed part of the South China Sea and lies within China's Exclusive Economic Zone, which runs for 200 nautical miles or 370 km from its coast. Sign up here. The oilfield, around 170 km (106 miles) off the coast of Shenzhen, sits at an average water depth of 100 metres, the report said, adding that test drilling has yielded a daily production of 413 barrels of crude oil and 68,000 cubic metres of natural gas. Huizhou 19-6 is China's first large-scale integrated clastic oilfield in the deep to ultra-deep layers, the report said. Such reserves are challenging for oil and gas exploration, given the high temperatures and pressures exerted at these depths. China wants to reduce its import dependency to bolster its energy security, but its crude oil imports are expected to peak as early as next year as transport fuel demand begins to decline for the world's top oil buyer.

The event, set to take place in China for the first time in its history, is due to take place between August 7 and 17. The dates were agreed upon by the International World Games Association (IWGA) and the Local Organising Committee in the capital of Sichuan Province. After the 11th edition of the World Games in Birmingham in Alabama had to be postponed by one year to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IWGA is thus returning to its standard scheduling. The World Games 2025 are due to be the first edition held under the guidelines set by the strategy paper \"Growth Beyond Excellence\". The maximum permitted number, including athletes and technical officials, for the official sports programme of the 2025 World Games and onwards will be increased from 4,200 to 5,000. In principle, this number will include 4,000 participants proposed by the 39 IWGA Member Federations with events on the programme. The remaining 1,000 participants will be made up of participants from other disciplines in agreement with the host cities, participants from disciplines determined in consultation with the International Olympic Committee, and participants from Para disciplines. These disciplines will be determined after consultation with the International Paralympic Committee. Chengdu, the fifth most populous city in China, is due to host the Summer FISU World University Games next year ©Getty Images The next edition of the World Games in Birmingham in Alabama is set to be attended by 3,600 athletes from more than 100 countries. A total of 34 sports are on the programme for the Games, which take place from July 7 to 17 next year. Chengdu was awarded the 2025 World Games during the IWGA Annual General Meeting at the SportAccord Convention in Gold Coast in May 2019. The World Games is set to be the second major international multi-sports event to be staged by Chengdu. It is already hosting the 2021 International University Sports Federation (FISU) World University Games, an event postponed until June 26 to July 7 next year due to the coronavirus crisis. Chengdu is the fifth most populous city in China, with a population of more than 10 million, but is best known as a major breeding centre for pandas at Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system designated as a World Heritage Site. The World Games were set up in 1981 to help promote sports and disciplines that are not contested in the Olympic Games. They were first held in Santa Clara, and this will be only the second time they have taken place in Asia having been held in Kaohsiung in Chinese Taipei in 2009. They were last held in 2017 when they were staged in Wroclaw in Poland.

        "text": "Trump's top tariffs for 'worst offenders' take effect 9 April 2025 Share Save Ian Aikman BBC News Share Save Reuters US President Donald Trump's latest wave of tariffs has come into force, with imports from China hit by a 104% rate amid an escalating standoff between the world's two biggest economies. Tariffs ranging from 11% to 104% now apply to imports from around 60 US trade partners, which Trump has dubbed the \"worst offenders\" for what he considers unfair trade practices. China has since hit back by raising import duties on US goods arriving in China to 84%. Markets across the globe lost trillions of dollars after Trump announced the new tariffs last week, with many Americans fearing price rises and some analysts predicting increased odds of recession. On Tuesday, Trump accepted the fallout from the move had been \"somewhat explosive\" but said that money had been \"pouring in\" from the new tariffs so far. Speaking at a Republican Party dinner in Washington, Trump acknowledged the 104% rate for China \"sounds ridiculous\" but insisted that Beijing wanted to \"make a deal\" to avoid it. In a defiant speech championing his controversial trade policy, Trump said many countries had \"ripped us off left and right, but now it's our turn to do the ripping\". \"I know what the hell I'm doing,\" he told guests, adding that countries hit by his tariffs were \"dying to make a deal\". But China on Wednesday said it would \"fight to the end\" if the US \"insists on provoking a tariff war or trade war\", and announced it would increase its own tariffs on US goods, effective from 12:01 CST (05:00 BST) on Thursday. Live updates: Biggest tariffs come into effect Full list: See all of Trump's tariffs, country-by-country Watch: Is the US heading for a recession? Analysis: What would a US-China trade war do to global economy? The effect: How Trump's action threatens Vietnam's growth Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them? Trump arrived at the 104% tariff for China, the highest for any country, after Beijing responded to an earlier rate with tit-for-tat tariffs of its own. The US president unveiled an additional 34% tariff on Chinese goods last week, on top of a 20% levy he had put in place earlier this year. Beijing retaliated with a 34% tariff on US imports to China. In response, Trump threatened an additional 50%, bringing the total to 104%, if Beijing did not back down. China did not change course, accusing the US president of behaving like a bully. Just hours after the 104% tariffs from the US kicked in on Wednesday, Beijing announced it would raise its own tariffs on American goods from 34% to 84%. Before this, during his speech on Tuesday night, Trump said China was hoping to reach an agreement with the US. \"They want to make a deal,\" he said. \"They just don't know how to get started because they're proud people.\" Analysts who spoke to the BBC were not so certain, with one saying Washington may be \"overplaying its hand\" . China's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian on Wednesday said the US \"continues to impose tariffs on China in an abusive manner\". He said China opposes such \"bullying practices\" and that America must show \"an attitude of equality, mutual respect, and reciprocity\" if it hopes to resolve issues through negotiation. A white paper released by Beijing on Wednesday said China was willing to continue a dialogue with the US to resolve differences. Watch: Trump says tariffs will be 'legendary' ahead of 104% tax on China Trump said more than 70 countries have reached out to begin negotiations since the tariffs were announced. \"I'm telling you these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,\" he told the audience at the dinner on Tuesday. \"They are dying to make a deal.\" Delegations from Tokyo and Seoul are en route to Washington, as import taxes of 24% for Japan and 25% for South Korea take effect. The European Union, hit with a blanket 20% tariff, is \"ready to negotiate\" according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The bloc has offered a mutual reduction of tariffs on industrial goods to zero – a proposal that Trump has praised, while saying it was still \"not enough\". On Wednesday, EU member states voted in favour of imposing tariffs on some US imported goods, with new tariffs set to come into effect from 15 April. These tariffs specifically respond to the 25% import taxes Trump imposed on all steel and aluminium, which came into force in mid-March. A statement from the European Commission said the bloc considers US tariffs \"unjustified and damaging\". \"The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the US, which would be balanced and mutually beneficial,\" it added. Other countries on Trump's \"worst offenders\" list include Cambodia (now under a 49% tariff), Vietnam (46%) and India (26%). Major market turmoil followed Trump's tariffs announcement last week, with sell-offs sparking trillions in losses across the globe . After some signs of recovery earlier this week, losses continued across European and Asian markets on Wednesday, with London's FTSE 100 index opening 2.5% down and Japan's Nikkei 225 falling 4.3% after the new tariffs kicked in. The past week's drama appears to have fuelled divisions within the White House, erupting in a feud between Elon Musk and Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro, who the Tesla boss described as \"dumber than a sack of bricks\". But Trump himself has remained upbeat, telling Republican Party diners on Tuesday evening that his tariffs were \"going to be legendary, in a positive way\".

The Committee’s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate. Proceedings of the meeting Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference The Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin. Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat. A representative of the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities. Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting. The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters. Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital. The WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths. At its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion. This second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases. Conclusions and advice The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools. The very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multisectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world. The Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners. The Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns, cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China. The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations. The Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the front lines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that. Advice to WHO The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national and local experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures. The Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out hidden transmission and to inform risk management measures The Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring. WHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally. WHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions. Measures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed. WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus. WHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005). WHO should timely review the situation with transparency and update its evidence-based recommendations. The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. The Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC and accepted the Committee’s advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. To the People’s Republic of China Continue to: • Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment. • Enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak. • Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce. • Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China. • Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it. • Share relevant data on human cases. • Continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available. • Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travellers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic. To all countries It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website . Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR. Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease. Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multisectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research. The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR. The Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation. To the global community As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment. Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics. Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received. The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General. The Director-General thanked the Committee for its work.

Tedros, who visited Beijing for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers in late January, returned with an agreement on sending an international mission. It took nearly two weeks to get the green light from the Chinese government on the team, which Tedros said would number between 10 and 15. There have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported in China and 909 deaths, as well as 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, he said. Tedros voiced concern at incidents, reported by European authorities at the weekend, of person-to person spread of the virus by people with no history of travel to China. Advertisement \"In recent days, we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the United Kingdom today,\" he said. \"The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now it's only a spark. Our objective remains containment.\" Tedros urged countries to take public health measures to help \"prevent a bigger fire,\" adding: \"This is a message for the whole world.

A day of remembrance was declared in China on Saturday to honour the more than 3,300 people who died of Covid-19. At 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT), people stood still nationwide for three minutes in tribute to the dead. Cars, trains and ships then sounded their horns, air raid sirens rang as flags were flown at half-mast. The first cases of coronavirus were detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province late last year. Since then, the virus has swept the globe, infecting more than one million people and killing nearly 60,000 in 181 countries. In pictures: Wuhan partially reopens Confirmed global cases pass one million Tracking the global outbreak In Wuhan, the epicentre of China's outbreak, all traffic lights in urban areas were turned red at 10:00, ceasing traffic for three minutes. China's government said the event was a chance to pay respects to \"martyrs\", a reference to the 14 medical workers who died battling the virus. Getty Images China came to a standstill during the three-minute silence at 10:00 local time They include Li Wenliang, a doctor in Wuhan who died of Covid-19 after being reprimanded by the authorities for attempting to warn others about the disease. \"I feel a lot of sorrow about our colleagues and patients who died,\" a Chinese nurse who treated coronavirus patients told AFP news agency. \"I hope they can rest well in heaven.\" Wearing white flowers pinned to their chest, Chinese President Xi Jinping and other government officials paid silent tribute in Beijing. Saturday's commemorations coincide with the annual Qingming festival, when millions of Chinese families pay respects to their ancestors. China pays 'virtual' respects to ancestors China first informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on 31 December last year. By 18 January, the confirmed number of cases had risen to around 60 - but experts estimated the real figure was closer to 1,700. Getty Images China's government said the commemoration was held to pay respects to \"martyrs\" Just two days later, as millions of people prepared to travel for the lunar new year, the number of cases more than tripled to more than 200 and the virus was detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. From that point, the virus began to spread rapidly in Asia and then Europe, eventually reaching every corner of the globe. The BBC met people in Beijing heading out after the lockdown In the past few weeks, China has started to ease travel and social-distancing restrictions, believing it has brought the health emergency under control. Last weekend, Wuhan partially re-opened after more than two months of isolation. On Saturday, China reported 19 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, down from 31 a day earlier. China's health commission said 18 of those cases involved travellers arriving from abroad. As it battles to control cases coming from abroad, China temporarily banned all foreign visitors, even if they have visas or residence permits. What is the latest worldwide? As the coronavirus crisis in China abates, the rest of the world remains firmly in the grip of the disease. In the US, now the global epicentre of the outbreak, the number of deaths from the disease jumped to 7,152 on Friday, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University . The deaths increased by 1,480 in 24 hours, the highest daily death toll since the pandemic began, AFP news agency reported, citing Johns Hopkins University's case tracker.

AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO: The 20-second hand wash As of Friday, there were 277,953 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, a rise of more than 32,000 in 24 hours. Meanwhile, deaths continue to climb in Italy and Spain, the second and third worst-affected countries in the world. In Italy, deaths increased by 766 on Friday, bringing the total to 14,681. In Spain, the death toll stood at 10,935, a rise of 932 in the past day. However, there was a glimmer of hope for both countries, as the downward trend in the rate of new cases continued.

Second, as pointed out by loyal reader Caner in the comments yesterday, there has been a recent raising of the height of the tailings dams, which has extended across the intact terrain between the two original structures.  It appears that this raising has been undertaken by the upstream method, which is now widely considered to be problematic.\nThe news reports of the problems suggest that the mine operators are building a road to the location of the problem.  I am struggling to see any such construction around the dams themselves.  However, there does seem to be a substantive change towards the back of the tailings pond:-\nPlanet Labs SkySat image of the aftermath of the Luming Mine accident.

Xinhua 丨 Updated: March 24, 2020 Chinese authorities on Monday deployed measures to guard against imported cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and a rebound in domestically transmitted cases in response to changes in the epidemic situation. A leading group of China's COVID-19 epidemic response convened a meeting on Monday, which was chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee. The meeting called for proactive and orderly resumption of work and production while ensuring effective epidemic prevention and control. \"At present, the spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has been basically blocked, but the risks of sporadic cases and regional outbreaks still exist,\" said a statement issued after the meeting, urging people to remain clear-headed as the global pandemic situation remains complex and severe. A two-pronged prevention and control strategy should be implemented by focusing on both the prevention of imported cases and a rebound in indigenous cases so as to secure the hard-won achievements in the fight against COVID-19, according to the meeting. The meeting required the outbreak epicenter province of Hubei and the city of Wuhan to continue treating severely ill patients, promptly admitting new cases and conducting epidemiological investigations. Local authorities across the country should release epidemic information in an open and transparent manner without withholding truth, the statement said, calling for swift and targeted control measures once a case is identified. International exchange and cooperation should be strengthened to accurately and effectively curb cross-border COVID-19 transmission, according to the meeting. The meeting called on provincial-level regions at low risk to restore economic and social order while ensuring scientific and precise epidemic containment. These regions should adjust or call off preventive measures that are no longer commensurate with normal production and living order, the meeting noted. Migrant workers should not be subjected to isolated quarantine before returning to work if they are not from the very few areas still at high or medium risk, according to the meeting. Road traffic and public transportation in both urban and rural areas should be fully restored on the condition that the spread of the virus is under control, the meeting noted, urging a full reopening of logistics centers, freight transportation stations and express delivery services in these areas. The meeting also demanded safe and orderly efforts to send personnel stranded in Hubei to return home, and Hubei workers to return work. Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy head of the leading group, attended the meeting.

There have been long-running border tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, with a bitter war fought over the Indian north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh in 1962. “Aggressive behaviour by the two sides resulted in minor injuries to troops. It was stone-throwing and arguments that ended in a fistfight,” Indian army eastern command spokesman Mandeep Hooda said. The “stand-off” on Saturday – at Naku La sector near the 15,000-feet (4,572-metre) Nathu La crossing in the northeastern state of Sikkim – was later resolved after “dialogue and interaction” at a local level, Hooda said. “Temporary and short-duration face-offs between border-guarding troops do occur as boundaries are not resolved,” he said. One hundred and fifty soldiers were involved in the face-off, the Press Trust of India reported.

Photograph: Diptendu Dutta/AFP/Getty Images There have been numerous face-offs and brawls between Chinese and Indian soldiers, including one near the north-west Indian region of Ladakh, that was captured on video in 2017, where troops were seen throwing punches and stones. In 2017, there was a high-altitude standoff in Bhutan’s Doklam region for two months after the Indian army sent troops to stop China constructing a road there. Relations since the Doklam dispute between the two Asian giants appeared to improve following talks between Chinese president Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan, China, in 2018. The two men also met in October last year in Chennai in southern India. China still claims about 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 square miles) of territory under New Delhi’s control.

Mr Xi outlined the steps when speaking via videolink to the UN General Assembly in New York. The announcement is being seen as a significant step in the fight against climate change. China is the world's biggest source of carbon dioxide, responsible for around 28% of global emissions. Green plans diluted as government protects farmers Arctic sea-ice shrinks to near record low extent Prince Charles calls for 'swift' action on climate With global climate negotiations stalled and this year's conference of the parties ( COP26 ) postponed until 2021, there had been little expectation of progress on the issue at the UN General Assembly. However China's president surprised the UN gathering by making a bold statement about his country's plans for tackling emissions. He called on all countries to achieve a green recovery for the world economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the official translation, Mr Xi went on to say: \"We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.\" Until now China has said it would peak its emissions by 2030 at the latest, but it has avoided committing to a long-term goal. Emissions from China continued to rise in 2018 and 2019 even as much of the world began to shift away from fossil fuels. While the Covid-19 crisis this spring saw the country's emissions plunge by 25%, by June they had bounced back again as coal-fired plants, cement and other heavy industries went back to work. Getty Images In 2014 the US and China reached a surprise agreement on climate change Observers believe that in making this statement at this time, the Chinese leader is taking advantage of US reluctance to address the climate question. \"Xi Jinping's climate pledge at the UN, minutes after President Donald Trump's speech, is clearly a bold and well calculated move,\" said Li Shuo, an expert on Chinese climate policy from Greenpeace Asia. \"It demonstrates Xi's consistent interest in leveraging the climate agenda for geopolitical purposes.\" Back in 2014 Mr Xi and then US-President Barack Obama came to a surprise agreement on climate change, which became a key building block of the Paris agreement signed in December 2015 . Mr Xi has again delivered a surprise according to Li Shuo. \"By playing the climate card a little differently, Xi has not only injected much needed momentum to global climate politics, but presented an intriguing geopolitical question in front of the world: on a global common issue, China has moved ahead regardless of the US. Will Washington follow?\" There are many questions about the announcement that remain unanswered, including what is meant exactly by carbon neutrality and what actions the country will take to get there. \"Today's announcement by President Xi Jinping that China intends to reach carbon neutrality before 2060 is big and important news - the closer to 2050 the better,\" said former US climate envoy Todd Stern. \"His announcement that China will start down this road right away by adopting more vigorous policies is also welcome. Simply peaking emissions 'before 2030' won't be enough to put China on the rapid path needed for carbon neutrality, but overall this is a very encouraging step.\" Getty Images This week has seen the second lowest Arctic sea ice minimum on record Most observers agreed that the announcement from China was a significant step, not least because of the country's role in financing fossil fuel development around the world. \"China isn't just the world's biggest emitter but the biggest energy financier and biggest market, so its decisions play a major role in shaping how the rest of the world progresses with its transition away from the fossil fuels that cause climate change,\" said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a UK-based think tank. \"The announcement today is also a major fillip for the European Union, whose leaders recently urged President Xi to take exactly this step as part of a joint push on lowering emissions, showing that international moves to curb climate change remain alive despite the best efforts of Donald Trump and [Brazil's president] Jair Bolsonaro in the run-up to next year's COP26 in Glasgow.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc British Broadcasting Corporation Home News US Election Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Video Live Audio Weather BBC Shop BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info Contact technical support Copyright 2024 BBC.

The 28-year-old was initially cleared of wrongdoing by Fina, , external the swimming federation, in January 2019. Following an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), the decision has been overturned. An eight-year ban was imposed on Sun because this was his second offence. He had served a three-month suspension in 2014 for taking prohibited stimulant Trimetazidine. Sun told China's Xinhua news agency that he plans to appeal against the decision. He said: \"This is unfair. I firmly believe in my innocence.\" Fina said it would implement the decision \"notwithstanding any further legal action and as directed\". This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, 'You're a loser, I'm a winner' - ugly scenes as GB's Scott refuses to share podium with Sun Cas said its decision can be challenged before the Swiss Federal Tribunal within 30 days. Sun had told an appeal hearing in November that he missed a test because testers failed to prove their identity when they arrived at his home. He also denied a vial containing his blood samples was smashed with a hammer. Cas said: \"The athlete failed to establish that he had a compelling justification to destroy his sample collection containers and forego the doping control when, in his opinion, the collection protocol was not in compliance with the ISTI (international standard for testing and investigations). \"As the Cas panel noted, it is one thing, having provided a blood sample, to question the accreditation of the testing personnel while keeping the intact samples in the possession of the testing authorities; it is quite another thing, after lengthy exchanges and warnings as to the consequences, to act in such a way that results in destroying the sample containers, thereby eliminating any chance of testing the sample at a later stage.\" Wada welcomed the ruling, , external and added that it was \"satisfied that justice in this case has been rendered\". At the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in July, Sun won gold in the 200m freestyle but Britain's Duncan Scott refused to share the podium with him. Australian Mack Horton took a similar stance after the 400m freestyle, years after accusing him of being a \"drug cheat\". Scott said on Friday: \"I fully respect and support the decision that has been made. \"I believe in clean sport and a level playing field for all athletes and I trust in Cas and Wada to uphold these values.\" Sun's results prior to, during and after the championships will stand because he has not tested positive for doping. He has won 11 world titles since 2011, including two golds at last year's event in Gwangju, South Korea. When Fina originally cleared him, it said that testers had breached several rules, including failing to produce authorisation letters and a nursing licence. Sun was subsequently issued with a warning. The Cas appeal was heard in public. The only previous time that had happened was in 1999 when Ireland's triple Olympic swimming champion Michelle Smith de Bruin failed with her appeal against a four-year ban for tampering with an anti-doping sample. 'You're disrespecting your country' - reaction Adam Peaty, British Olympic 100m breaststroke champion: \"Very good. For anyone that's been banned once, potentially it's a mistake. \"You're looking at it twice - you're a fool. I believe that you're disrespecting the sport, you're disrespecting yourself and you're disrespecting your country.\" Mack Horton, Australian swimmer who refused to share a podium with Sun: \"My stance has always been for clean sport. It is not, and never will be about individuals or nations. Today's outcome does not change my stance.\" Lizzie Simmonds, British two-time Olympian & former European champion: \"I once called this man the Harry Houdini of doping control, but it seems that justice has finally been served. \"Imagine there will be a few very relieved freestylers waking up across the world. \"Given the damning length of this sentence, it seems inconceivable that he originally just received a slap on the wrist from Fina. \"A strong message to those who cheat, but I hope an even stronger message to those who seek to protect bureaucratic harmony over sporting integrity.\" James Guy, British four-time world swimming champion: \"The truth always comes out.\" Analysis Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This is a hugely significant case for sport, and one that will lead to serious questions about the judgement and credibility of Fina, which will now come under pressure to establish an integrity unit, similar to those created for athletics and cycling. Swimming's world governing body caused dismay among many in the sport when it cleared Sun last year. That decision, combined with Sun's mega-stardom in the sporting superpower of China, his infamy after already serving a doping suspension in 2014, and the dramatic symbolism of a case in which a blood vial was smashed with a hammer, meant an especially bitter controversy - the antipathy with some of his rivals marring last year's World Championships. The severity of the eight-year ban (which almost certainly ends Sun's career) will be celebrated by many in swimming and beyond as a sign of the sport getting tougher on doping, and perhaps restore some faith in the anti-doping system. But it will no doubt provoke outrage in China, and may reinforce the sense both there and in places like Russia (which is appealing over its Olympic ban) that Cas is biased against countries in the east. Expect further appeals (to the Swiss Federal Tribunal) and recriminations. Related internet links Fina The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "text": "“大寒已过腊来时，万物那逃出入机。”《中国天文年历》显示，北京时间1月20日23时27分迎来农历二十四节气中的最后一个节气——“大寒”。专家提示说，在气象记录中，大寒时节虽不像小寒期间那样冷，但仍处于“三九四九冰上走”的数九寒天。大寒时节寒潮南下也比较频繁。寒潮和强冷空气通常会带来大风降温和雨雪天气。公众出行要注意防寒保暖。\n\n焦点 1\n\n降温“祸首”系北极涡旋\n\n最近几天，在全国多地领略强烈“冰冻感”的同时，有关“世纪寒潮”将袭击我国的消息也不断蔓延。\n\n本次寒潮影响范围到底多大？真的会是一个“世纪寒潮”吗？\n\n“目前，有一个大尺度的涡旋盘踞在西伯利亚地区，冷空气在此不断集聚、堆积，在其西侧的偏北气流不时把一些冷空气带到南边，这也是近期北方偏冷的原因。”中央气象台高级工程师李勇表示。\n\n不少气象专家认为，极地涡旋离开北极地区南下，其“罪魁祸首”可能是一个强大的气旋式风暴。通常情况下，北极涡旋并不会轻易离开北极地区。但去年12月底，位于冰岛的强大气旋式风暴将北大西洋的热量带向北极地区，使通常温度在零下30摄氏度左右的北极突然升温至0摄氏度以上，堪称北极的“世纪之暖”。在这个气旋式风暴“排挤”下，北极涡旋“被迫”离开极地，携带冷空气一路南下。\n\n北极涡旋仿佛“扫地僧”，平日“深居简出”，一旦“出手”威力无穷。中央气象台首席预报员张涛表示，在这次寒潮爆发之前，已经有一些冷空气先期渗透南下，但这次南下的将是冷空气的“主体”，其影响范围十分广泛，除了新疆和东北地区东北角，我国大部分地区都“不能幸免”。\n\n焦点 2\n\n多地逼近历史同期最冷\n\n寒潮自西伯利亚启程“袭击”我国，首当其冲的是东北地区。这两天，内蒙古根河地区最低温度已经超过零下40摄氏度，堪称名副其实的“冰窖”。\n\n从最低气温或日平均气温来看，北方多地虽然可能会出现今冬以来最低温，但远达不到各地历史低温极值。\n\n除东北地区东部外的我国中东部大部分地区来说，这股强冷空气的确带来今冬最冷天气，加之影响范围较广，因而可称作“今冬最强冷空气”。\n\n在南方，1月20日至23日江淮及其以南地区将开启“速冻模式”。23日至24日，冷空气将进一步深入，多地降温可达10至14摄氏度。江浙一带最低气温可能跌破-10℃，逼近历史同期极值。\n\n上海中心气象台19日发出最新预报，上海即将出现近30年同期当地最强的冷空气过程。极端最低温可能达到零下10摄氏度。\n\n20-26日，江西将迎来明显低温雨雪冰冻天气，23日后局地将出现1992年以来最寒冷天气。\n\n随着21日强冷空气“大举南下”，多地将出现雨转雪过程。\n\n中央气象台预计，1月20日至23日，湖北、安徽南部、江苏南部、上海、浙江中北部、江西中北部、湖南中北部等地将有小到中雨转大到暴雪，浙江中北部局地有大暴雪，主要雨雪时段在20日夜间至22日白天，积雪深度可达5至10厘米，部分地区15至20厘米。新京报记者 邓琦\n\n焦点 3\n\n不会重现2008年冰冻灾害\n\n南方出现大范围雨雪冰冻天气总会让人想起2008年的灾情。本次雨雪冰冻过程与2008年相比如何？\n\n“这次南方低温雨雪过程不会有2008年那次严重。”张涛表示，这次寒潮虽然强度大，但过境速度快，对于大部分地区来说，影响时间为3天左右，不会出现持续性低温雨雪冰冻灾害。\n\n从冷空气过境时间看，21日夜间，冷空气前锋影响到内蒙古大部分地区。22日夜间，黄河以北地区完成降温。23日，冷空气加速南下。到24日夜间，冷空气前锋就将进入南海。气象专家表示，北方最冷的时间为23日至24日，南方最冷的时间为24日至25日。\n\n实际上，由于前期冷空气的作用，部分地区的气温已经很低，本次寒潮过程算是一次“雪上加霜”。“由于降温幅度没有很大，中央气象台可能只会针对本次寒潮发布蓝色预警。”张涛表示。\n\n中央气象台预计，26日开始，中东部地区气温将逐渐回升；27日前后，华南、江南等地又将有中到大雨，局地暴雨天气，但无明显冰冻天气；29日前后，南方地区的气温将恢复到正常水平。\n\n本组稿件（除署名外）/综合新华社电",

答：中方已多次表明在有关问题上的立场。美国推动在韩国部署“萨德”不是一个单纯的技术问题，而是关乎东北亚地区和平稳定的战略问题。部署“萨德”系统远远超出朝鲜半岛实际防御需要，将直接损害中国战略安全利益，破坏地区战略平衡。当前半岛局势复杂敏感，希望有关国家以负责任态度慎重行事，多做有利于维护地区和平与安全的事情。 问：日本新安保法正式实施后，日本成为可以行使集体自卫权的国家，日本首相安倍还宣称将推动修宪。外界不少人认为这是为了应对中国。中方对此有何评论？这将对中日关系产生怎样的影响？ 答：日本实施新安保法是战后日本军事安全政策的重大调整，引发外界对日本是否要改变和平发展道路的质疑，日本国内对新安保法也有强烈反对意见。 由于历史和现实原因，近年来日本国家走向问题备受关注。作为日本近邻和二战受害国，我们敦促日方切实汲取历史教训，认真倾听日本国内和国际社会正义呼声，重视亚洲邻国安全关切，在军事安全领域慎重行事，坚持和平发展道路。需要强调的是，日本某些势力一直试图通过制造所谓“中国威胁”推进国内政治议程，中方对此坚决反对，要求日方不得损害中国主权和安全利益，不做损害地区和平稳定的事。 问：据报道，中国在西沙群岛部署了反舰导弹，你能否证实？有人说这是中国推动南海“军事化”的又一表现。中方对此有何评论？ 答：西沙群岛是中国固有领土。中国在自己的领土上部署国土防御设施合情合理，不是所谓的“军事化”。 本文来源：外交部网站\n                    \n                    \n                    责任编辑：\n

The CSI 300 briefly plummeted 7.02 percent; when that index rises or falls 7 percent, a trading halt in China's markets is triggered for the rest of the session. Regulators announced the latest step in its attempts to tame the wild gyrations in its stock markets back in September and was introduced for the first time Monday Here is what you need to know: What is a circuit breaker? A circuit breaker refers to measures put in place to avert panic in markets by putting temporary halts or a freeze in trading if, for instance, the index in question falls by a pre-determined level. Read More U.S. circuit breakers explained How will the circuit breaker work in China? The proposed mechanism will be tied to the benchmark CSI300 Index , which tracks the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen, where a move of 5 percent in either direction from the index's previous close will trigger a 30-minute trade suspension across the country's equity indexes if the move occurs before 2.30 pm local time. After that, a 5 percent move will freeze trading until the market close at 3.00 pm. Meanwhile, a 7 percent rise or fall in the CSI300 Index will prompt a trading halt in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges for the rest of the day, the statement posted on the exchange's website said. Both circuit breakers will only be activated once a day. How do things work currently? Under current rules, individual stocks and index futures are allowed to move a daily maximum of 10 percent from the previous closing level in either direction. Trading of a stock stops when it hits the daily trading limit. Employees walk out of the Shanghai Stock Exchange building in China. Zhang Peng | LightRocket via Getty Images Why is the Shanghai Stock Exchange doing it? \"The circuit breakers are required for movements in both  directions to suppress excessive trading and control market  volatility. With domestic markets still in the emerging stages  and traders mainly made up of small retail investors, huge share  price movements in either direction will lead to panic downward  spirals or rapid rises,\" the statement said. \"Hence, when there are explosive increases on the markets,  circuit breakers will be needed to stabilize market exuberance,  prevent investors from overreacting and give them more time to  evaluate whether current share prices are reasonable. \" the  exchanges added. The CSI300 Index has been chosen due to its wider representation  of large companies and stocks listed in both bourses, compared  with the CSI Smallcap 500 Index, according to the statement  issued late Monday. What do traders think? Market participants have until September 21 to give feedback on  the proposal. However, Hao Hong, MD of research & chief strategist at Bank of  Communications International, told CNBC that the proposal contradicts with the current trading limits imposed on the mainland's equity markets. \"If you have a circuit breaker, you don't need the 10 percent  daily trading limits anymore and vice versa. You can imagine such  a situation when the market opens down 7 percent like a few weeks  ago, then the full-day trading will be halted and that would create  even more selling pressure the next day. So, I would say it is a very  strange rule to introduce to the market,\" Hong said. watch now VIDEO 3:51 03:51 Why China's plan for circuit breakers is 'strange' Street Signs Asia What else have Chinese authorities done to curb  volatility? The announcement comes on the back of a pledge by the China  Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Sunday to take more  steps to ensure  stability in its markets , following whirlwind rides that have  taken a toll on market confidence. As of late, authorities have  rolled out tighter rules over stock-index futures trading  and penalized  three firms that run stock trading platforms . However, the volley of unprecedented measures has thus far fallen  short of resuscitating the mainland's equity markets, which have  plummeted nearly 40 percent since its mid-June peak. On Monday,  the benchmark closed down 2.55 percent in yet  another typical volatile session following a four-day long  weekend. * Note: The draft proposals were later revised. A move of 5  percent in either direction from  the CSI300 index's previous close will now  trigger a 15-minute trade suspension across the country's equity  indexes if the move occurs before 2.30 pm local time. After that,  a 5 percent move will freeze trading until the market close at  3.00 pm. A 7 percent rise or fall in the CSI300 Index  will still prompt a trading halt in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock  exchanges for the rest of the day Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Supply Chain Values CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Digital Products News Releases Closed Captioning Corrections About CNBC Internships Site Map Ad Choices Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

One child died and 14 people are missing after the boat, carrying a total of 18 people, capsized on Bailong Lake due to strong gales. Three survivors remain under observation at a local hospital. Meanwhile, in Taiwan, a search is underway for six tourists swept away by a flash flood when they were “river tracing” in New Taipei City, according to the local fire department. In Guangyuan, as of yesterday morning, a 320-member rescue team, including divers, had been sent to the scene and the search for the missing is continuing. The 40-seat “Shuanglong” is owned by a local company, according to the Lizhou District maritime department, where the accident occurred. Around noon yesterday, Blue Sky Rescue, a civilian group made up of outdoors experts, found the capsized boat thanks to a locating device and underwater cameras. However, they could detect no signs of life. Li Xiang, a member of the Blue Sky team, told reporters that the boat had sunk to a depth of 65.1 meters. Underwater robots will be sent to assist salvage operations today. The State Administration of Work Safety has demanded an investigation into the incident. It also called on local authorities in Sichuan to launch water transport safety inspections, improve the management of sightseeing boats, remove possible dangers and prevent major accidents in the future. The tourists swept away in Taiwan, four adults and two teenagers, were all wearing life jackets and helmets during the river tracing activity, also known as canyoning, on a river in the city’s Pinglin District. They were part of a group of 24 people taking part in the activity. The other 18 members of the group are safe, Taiwan officials said. Pinglin District experienced heavy rainfall at midday yesterday, with more than 10 centimeters falling in an hour. Ambulances, rescue vehicles and a helicopter are at the scene and the search continues. River tracing, or canyoning, is an increasingly popular outdoor activity that involves walking, wading, climbing and trekking through rivers.

China Daily/via REUTERS Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING (Reuters) - A powerful blast at a prefabricated house in northwestern China on Monday killed at least 14 people and injured 147, state news agency Xinhua said. The explosion occurred in the early afternoon in the town of Xinmin in Shaanxi province, damaging dozens of buildings including the local hospital, Xinhua said. An initial police investigation indicated that the blast was caused by illegally stored explosives, Xinhua said, adding that authorities had detained the owner of the building and were searching for the tenant. Eleven of the injured were in intensive care. Pictures carried by state media showed rescuers digging through the rubble of low rise buildings, though searches for the incident on Chinese social media were blocked on Tuesday. China has a bad safety record, with previous blasts blamed on poorly stored chemicals or industrial explosives which are easy to get hold of due to their use in China's booming coal mining sector. A series of powerful explosions last year at a chemicals warehouse in the northern city of Tianjin killed 165. There have also been cases of people deliberately setting off blasts to settle local grievances such as land disputes.

At the opening ceremony, Chan said the forum has taken place since 2006 and during those years “the KMT had been in opposition, became the ruling party [in 2008] and has now again become the opposition.” “Looking back on the 10-year history of the forum, we see that the resolutions made in the past have been adopted by the governments in each side of the Taiwan Strait and turned into policies that greatly benefited the people,” he said. Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu, right, yesterday addresses Taiwanese businesspeople and students at a seminar at the Beijing Hotel in China. Photo: CNA Chan said that government officials of both sides had participated in the forum over the past eight years to discuss possible policies, which was “a rare page in history.” “That page has been brought to a temporary end and it is widely known that the cause is the denying of the ‘1992 consensus’ as a political foundation” by the Democratic Progressive Party government, he said. As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have experienced “more than 60 years of institutional, military and diplomatic differences, it takes time and wisdom to discuss fusing this half-century gap and that is why a new panel — the political panel — has been added to this year’s forum,” he said. He said that while many Taiwanese political pundits have expressed doubts about holding this year’s forum, “the KMT knows that there cannot be a lack of communication across the Strait, as prosperity has only been possible in the past eight years after the KMT decided in 2005 [to hold talks with Beijing] after witnessing the cross-strait stalemate caused by [then-president] Chen Shui-bian’s (陳水扁) administration.” This year’s forum includes five panels — political, economic, cultural, social and youth. This year the “cross-strait economic, trade and cultural forum,” has been renamed the “cross-strait peaceful development forum.” The change is believed to have been decided by KMT Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱) to advance her “peace party platform,” which was passed by the party’s national congress in September and has since spawned controversy within the KMT as it calls for a peace agreement with China. KMT Policy Committee executive director Alex Tsai (蔡正元) said that the party is not looking to replace the Straits Exchange Foundation, as it is an agency of public authority, the Chinese-language Apple Daily reported. The KMT, working as a non-governmental organization, is constructing a KMT-CCP communication mechanism, which would not affect cross-strait dialogue at the official level, he added. “The KMT’s and Hung’s goal is to reduce the negative effects and damage caused by [President] Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to a minimum,” Alex Tsai said.

Media caption, Should China's Xi be president for life? China has approved the removal of the two-term limit on the presidency, effectively allowing Xi Jinping to remain in power for life. The constitutional changes were passed by the annual sitting of parliament, the National People's Congress. The vote was widely regarded as a rubber-stamping exercise. Two delegates voted against the change and three abstained, out of 2,964 votes. China had imposed a two-term limit on its president since the 1990s. But Mr Xi, who would have been due to step down in 2023, defied the tradition of presenting a potential successor during October's Communist Party Congress. Instead, he consolidated his political power as the party voted to enshrine his name and political ideology in the party's constitution - elevating his status to the level of its founder, Chairman Mao. On paper, the congress is the most powerful legislative body in China - similar to the parliament in other nations. But it was widely believed that it would approve what it was told to. In depth: Xi, the president who lived in a cave How China's 'two sessions' meetings work A Chinese move that many expected Xi forever? Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing It is now hard to see Xi Jinping being challenged in any way whatsoever. He has amassed power the likes of which has not been seen since Chairman Mao Zedong. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Xi applauded after the amendment was passed Only five years ago Beijing was being ruled by a collective leadership. Under ex-President Hu Jintao you could imagine differing views being expressed in the then nine-member Politburo Standing Committee. There was a feeling that Mr Hu needed to please various factions within the Communist Party and it seemed that every 10 years a new leader would come along with their own people in a process of smooth transition. From today all this has gone. The constitution has been altered to allow Xi Jinping to remain as president beyond two terms and they would not have gone to this much trouble if that was not exactly what he intended to do. There has been no national debate as to whether a leader should be allowed to stay on for as long as they choose. Quietly but surely Xi Jinping has changed the way his country is governed, with himself well and truly at the core. Rare dissent The issue is not, however, without controversy. Online censors in China have been blocking discussion around the topic, including images of Winnie the Pooh. Social media users have taken to using the cartoon character to represent Mr Xi . Image source, WEIBO/AFP Image caption, Social media users create \"Winnie the Pooh\" memes to avoid being seen as making derogatory posts against Mr Xi (r) One government critic described the proposal in an open letter last month as a \"farce\" , in a rare show of public dissent. Former state newspaper editor Li Datong wrote that scrapping term limits for the president and vice-president would sow the seeds of chaos - in a message sent to some members of the national congress. \"I couldn't bear it any more. I was discussing with my friends and we were enraged. We have to voice our opposition,\" he told BBC Chinese. State media, however, have portrayed the changes as much-needed reform. US President Donald Trump was criticised by some commentators for seeming to approve of Mr Xi's unlimited rule, saying on Monday: \"President for life... I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day.\" At a political rally on Saturday, Mr Trump insisted he had merely been joking during a fundraiser, and that his comments were represented unfairly by some media. Xi Jinping thought Mr Xi's possible third term is not the only item the National People's Congress is likely to approve. It was also expected to: confirm China's new government line-up for the next five years, kicking off Xi Jinping's second term as president ratify a law to set up a new powerful anti-corruption agency ratify the inclusion of the president's political philosophy - \"Xi Jinping thought\" - in the constitution Xi Jinping thought is the ideology approved by the Communist Party last October. Officially, it is \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era\". Schoolchildren, college students and staff at state factories will have to study the political ideology, which the Communist Party is trying to portray as a new chapter for modern China. More on China under Xi Human cost of China's economic reforms The changing Chinese family in five charts The lawyer who simply vanished Mr Xi became president in 2013, and quickly consolidated personal power while cementing China as the regional superpower. He also fought corruption, punishing more than a million party members - which has helped his popularity among some. At the same time, however, China has clamped down on many emerging freedoms, increasing its state surveillance and censorship programs. Critics also say Mr Xi has used the anti-corruption purge to sideline political rivals.

REUTERS/Jason Lee Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court has sentenced Sun Zhengcai, the former Communist Party boss of the southwestern city of Chongqing, to life in prison for corruption, state media said on Tuesday. Sun is the latest former senior official taken down in President Xi Jinping's war on graft. He admitted in April to an intermediate court in the city of Tianjin that he had taken bribes of more than 170 million yuan ($27 million). \"After the judgment was announced, Sun Zhengcai told the court he admitted his guilt, expressed repentance, accepted the decision, and said he would not appeal,\" the official Xinhua news agency said, citing the Tianjin court. Reuters has not been able to reach Sun or a representative for comment since he was put under investigation last year. Sun, 54, was abruptly removed in July from his post as party chief of Chongqing, one of China's most important cities. He was replaced by Chen Miner, who is close to Xi. Until then, Sun, one of the youngest of the 25 members of the ruling party's decision-making Politburo, had been considered a contender for top leadership. Prosecutors charged Sun in February with accepting \"huge sums\" in bribes during various posts going back 15 years in Chongqing, Beijing, the northeastern province of Jilin, and during his term as minister of agriculture. He was certain to be found guilty because China's courts are controlled by the party and will not challenge its accusations. Xi has presided over a sweeping corruption crackdown since coming to power in 2012, vowing to target both \"tigers\" and \"flies\" in a reference to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats. The campaign has led to the jailing or punishment of thousands of officials and also brought down dozens of senior party and military officials. The anti-corruption effort has not just been focused on issues like bribery and using public money to fund lavish lifestyles. It has also taken aim at those whose political loyalty is found lacking or who express doubt in public about party policies. China has rebuffed criticism that the campaign is as much about settling political scores as about stamping out genuine criminal acts.

In a comedy routine celebrating Chinese-African ties an Asian actress appears in blackface and with exaggerated buttocks. Using make-up to lampoon black people - a practice known as blackface - is seen by many as deeply offensive. The annual state media variety show is hugely popular, and has up to 800 million viewers. China 'racist' video on India sparks fury Lunar New Year pictures from across Asia Some observers have pointed out that this sketch would not have been intended as offensive to Africans. However, this is not the first time Chinese entertainment shows have caused controversy with their portrayals of other ethnicities. Allow Twitter content?

Accept and continue The controversial sketch was part of the four-hour CCTV New Year Gala - also known as the Spring Festival Gala - which aired on Thursday night. By some estimates, the show is the most watched entertainment programme on earth. The skit begins with a routine by a group of African dancers in \"tribal\" attire and people dressed up as zebras, giraffes, lions and antelopes. This is followed by a comedy skit where a young black woman asks a Chinese man to pose as her husband when meeting her mother. While the young woman is played by a black actor, her mother appears to be an Asian actor in blackface make-up, donning a traditional outfit complete with huge fake buttocks. Youtube/CCTV The African mother is played by a Chinese lady with extra buttocks added on She walks on stage carrying a fruit plate on her head and is accompanied by what is thought to be have been a black actor in a monkey suit, carrying a basket on his back.

At one stage, the character of the African mother exclaims how much she loves China. China has over the past years stepped up investment into many African countries. The sketch was set around people working on the Nairobi-Mombasa railway project. China's soft-power a work in progress by John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing China's TV gala has become as much a part of the spring festival tradition as dumplings and lanterns. The gaudy sets, highly choreographed dance troupes and sentimental ballads serve as the background noise to hundreds of millions of private family reunions and provide the mass media glue that binds them all into a genuine national moment. In recent years though there have been grumblings that the gala is taking on a more political tone and this year was no exception - with the whole event a kind of pageant to China's rising power and national rejuvenation. The Africa skit was clearly meant to be part of this same vision and is, if nothing else, proof that art is rarely improved by a large dollop of propaganda. But what's particularly striking about the whole toe-curling spectacle is that it is also strangely at odds with China's own message. Chinese investment in Africa is one of the defining economic stories of our time and it has been accompanied by a massive publicity drive. Bristling at any suggestion that it is involved in neo-colonialism, China insists that it comes not to exploit, but in partnership with and for the mutual benefit of its African partners. The sight then, of a Chinese actress in blackface, leading an African man dressed as a monkey around a stage as a way of celebrating a vital trading relationship on prime-time national TV, seems particularly ill-judged. Simply naive and clumsy? Or a sign of something deeper? Either way it suggests China's soft-power project is still a work in progress. Europe's racist history The notion of blackface being racist is linked to the history of minstrel shows in the US and Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries where white actors would paint their skin black for condescending portrayals of black people. In China, the vast majority of people have no experience of interacting with black people and are less aware of Europe's and the US' history of slavery and racism. Youtube/CCTV Celebrating Chinese-African ties? Nonetheless, Chinese users on the country's biggest social media website Weibo have condemned the programme. Comments included \"it's full of racism,\" that \"it makes me feel like I'm living in the last century,\" and that \"we are going to lose face internationally\". Putting it into a larger context beyond the specific history of blackface, one user asks \"if an American white person painted yellow, says I love the USA and recites some Trump quotes while pulling his eyes, how would you feel?\" Some Chinese articles criticising the annual gala on the eve of Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, have been blocked overnight, as have some critical comments on Chinese social media sites. In 2016, a TV advertisement for a laundry detergent had caused widespread outrage for being racist. The ad featured a black man with paint stains on his face who gets put into a washing machine by a young Chinese woman to later re-emerge as a fair-skinned Chinese man.

Then she got censored Published Wed, May 2 2018 2:08 AM EDT Cheang Ming @cheangming WATCH LIVE Key Points Douyin, a Chinese short video platform, has removed some 30,000 video clips featuring animated character Peppa Pig, the Global Times said. The children's cartoon has been used in online memes in China. Specific details on the removal of Peppa Pig-related content are unclear. Characters from the Peppa Pig animated series. Julian Paker | UK Press | Getty Images Peppa Pig — the anthropomorphic pink pig from the eponymous British animated series — is the latest cultural product that's been given the axe on a Chinese platform. Some 30,000 video clips featuring the children's cartoon character have disappeared from social media platform Douyin, according to Chinese state-owned tabloid Global Times . The videos had previously been searchable on the platform under the hashtag \"#PeppaPig,\" which now shows zero search results. Douyin, an app that allows users to create and publish short videos, is owned by Beijing-based new media company Bytedance. Zhang Yiming, the chief executive of Bytedance, last month said on social media that the company would increase the number of employees handling censorship at Toutiao — a popular news app that's also part of the social media giant — to 10,000 after being temporarily banned earlier this year. Given the recent developments, \"it is not surprising that the platform has become more paranoid in the interpretation of parodic content,\" said Severine Arsene, managing editor of AsiaGlobal Online, a digital journal published by the University of Hong Kong. Specific details surrounding the removal of Peppa Pig-related content, such as whether it was the result of an official directive, remain unclear, but self-censorship is understood to be a common practice. \"In many cases, [platforms] tend to over-censor, particularly during sensitive periods,\" Arsene said. Douyin, meanwhile, has not publicly discussed its latest move. The company did not reply to a request for comment. Subcultural icon Part of the move appears to be due to the character's popularity as a subcultural figure of sorts — Peppa is a popular face in online memes on the mainland. In particular, the cartoon character is associated with \"shehuiren\" subculture, referring to those who \"run counter to the mainstream value and are usually poorly educated with no stable job,\" said the Global Times, which called Peppa Pig an \"unexpected cultural icon.\" The tabloid added that such individuals were also \"unruly slackers roaming around and the antithesis of the young generation the Party tries to cultivate.\" That provides clues as to why Douyin might be concerned with the online activities of subcultural Chinese youths. Given how the state had spent time building up a new middle class, \"[a]ny deviation from the mainstream, or irony, is seen as a threat to the credibility and legitimacy of the [Chinese Communist] Party in bringing [an] idealized way of life to reality,\" Arsene told CNBC in an email. She added that the recent move reflected a \"strong stigmatization of poorer categories\" in society. While Peppa Pig was made scarce on one online platform, plenty of chatter about the cartoon character cropped up on other platforms. Website What's on Weibo reported that internet users had taken to discussion boards Baidu Tieba and Zhihu to iron out what exactly constituted \"shehuiren\" subculture. The popularity of the animated series, which saw its local debut on China Central Television network in 2015, on the mainland has resulted in plans for Peppa Pig theme parks to be built in Shanghai and Beijing as early as 2019. Entertainment One Group, which owns Peppa Pig, had not responded to a request for comment as of publishing time.

The quake rocked Uchturpan county in Aksu prefecture shortly after 2 a.m., the China Earthquake Networks Center said. Rescue crews rushed to the area, with about 1,000 on hand by midday. By evening, authorities said three people had died and five were injured, two seriously, in the county that’s also called Wushi in the Mandarin language. Rescue crews combed through the rubble. Emergency survival gear — including coats and tents to help the thousands of people who fled their homes — had arrived or were on their way, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The quake’s epicenter was located in a mountainous area about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) above sea level, Zhang Yongjiu, the head of Xinjiang Earthquake Administration, told a news conference.

The area is populated mostly by Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnicity that is predominantly Muslim and has been the target of a state campaign of forced assimilation and mass detention. The region is heavily militarized, and state broadcaster CCTV showed paramilitary troops moving in before dawn to clear rubble and set up tents for those displaced. Jian Gewa, a 16-year old student in Uchturpan, said he was in the bathroom when the quake began. The entire building shook violently. “I just thought I had to get myself to safety as quickly as possible,” Jian said. He had been evacuated to a school and was staying in a dorm room with his grandfather, joining about 200 others. Local officials said they planned to check houses’ stability before people could return. Among the more than 120 buildings damaged, 47 houses had collapsed, the government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region posted on its official Weibo social media account. Officials said most of the houses that collapsed were in remote areas and were mainly built by residents. The new public housing recently built by the government did not collapse. Associated Press journalists saw some walls had cracked or partially collapsed in the empty Aksu country village of Youkakeyamansu, a name transliterated in Mandarin from Uyghur. All residents had been evacuated to a shelter. The mountainous Uchturpan county is recording temperatures well below freezing, with the China Meteorological Administration forecasting lows reaching negative 18 degrees Celsius (just below zero Fahrenheit) this week. The county had around 233,000 people in 2022, according to Xinjiang authorities. The quake downed power lines but electricity was quickly restored, Aksu authorities said. The Urumqi Railroad Bureau resumed services after 7 a.m. following safety checks that confirmed no problems on train lines. The suspension affected 23 trains, the bureau serving the Xinjiang capital said on its official Weibo account. The U.S. Geological Survey said the area’s largest quake in the past century was also magnitude 7.1 and occurred in 1978, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) to the north of Tuesday’s epicenter. Multiple aftershocks were recorded Tuesday, the strongest measured at 5.3 magnitude. Tremors were felt hundreds of kilometers (miles) away. Ma Shengyi, a 30-year-old pet shop owner in Tacheng, 600 kilometers (373 miles) from the epicenter, said her dogs started barking before she felt her apartment building shudder. Her neighbors ran downstairs. Ma rushed to her bathroom and started to cry. “There’s no point in running away if it’s a big earthquake,” Ma said. “I was scared to death.” Tremors also were felt in neighboring Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Videos posted on the Telegram messaging platform showed people in the Kazakh city of Almaty running downstairs in apartment blocks and standing in the street, some of them wearing shorts in the freezing weather. In Xinjiang and Kazakhstan, classes were suspended to allow children to recover from the shock. Earthquakes are common in western China. A 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Gansu province in December killed 151 people and was China’s deadliest quake in nine years.

The final body was found in the evening, according to state broadcaster CCTV, which posted photos of excavators and teams of searchers in orange uniforms and helmets, part of a contingent of more than 1,000 rescuers. The landslide slammed into houses at the foot of a slope early Monday morning in Liangshui, a village in a remote and mountainous part of Yunnan province. It left a barren swath on the slope after hitting the village, which sits between snow-covered, terraced fields. Two survivors were found on Monday. A preliminary investigation found that the landslide had been triggered by the collapse of a steep clifftop area, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It did not elaborate on the cause of the initial collapse. Rescuers struggled with snow, icy roads and freezing temperatures. The area is about 2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles) southwest of Beijing, the Chinese capital, with altitudes ranging up to 2,400 meters (7,900 feet).

        "text": "Emergency management bureau in Pingdingshan city says the accident was caused by a coal and gas outburst. At least 10 people have died and six are missing after an accident at a coal mine in central China, according to the local emergency management agency and state media. In a statement on Saturday, the agency said it would continue rescue operations at the mine in the city of Pingdingshan and conduct citywide safety checks. A total of 425 people were working underground when the accident took place, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Pingdingshan’s emergency management bureau said the accident occurred at about 2:55pm (06:55 GMT) on Friday due to a coal and gas outburst at the mine owned by China’s Pingdingshan Tianan Coal Mining company. The emergency agency said it was investigating the cause of the accident. A safety inspection campaign in coal-rich Pingdingshan, in Henan province, could disrupt coal production there and strain coal supplies. Last November, coal prices in China jumped after the country’s cabinet promised to ramp up safety checks as deaths from accidents in the top coal-producing region Shanxi rose sharply. Those in charge of the mine have been taken into custody, Xinhua reported, but did not say how many people were being held. Mining safety in China has improved in recent decades, as has media coverage of major incidents, many of which were once overlooked. However, accidents are still common in an industry with a poor safety record and where regulations are not necessarily enforced. In 2022, 245 people died in 168 accidents, according to official figures. Last month, 12 people were killed and 13 injured in a mining accident on the outskirts of Jixi city in northeastern Heilongjiang province. Eleven people were killed in November in an accident at another coal mine in the same province.

China has seen a spate of deadly fires in recent months, prompting calls from President Xi Jinping last month for “deep reflection” and greater efforts to “curb the frequent occurrence of safety accidents”. In January dozens died after a fire broke out at a store in the central city of Xinyu, with state news agency Xinhua reporting the blaze had been caused by the use of fire by workers in the store’s basement. That fire came just days after a late-evening blaze at a school in central China’s Henan province killed 13 schoolchildren as they slept in a dormitory. A teacher at the school told the state-run Hebei Daily that all the victims were from the same third-grade class of nine- and 10-year-olds. Domestic media reports suggested the fire was caused by an electric heating device. In November, 26 people were killed and dozens sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China’s Shanxi province. The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in the north-west of the country left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.

Hengda Real Estate said in an exchange filing that China's securities watchdog also penalised the company and several of its former senior executives after an investigation. Sign up here. The penalty represents the latest challenge for Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer, which defaulted on its offshore debt in late 2021 and was ordered by the Hong Kong High Court to liquidate in January. It comes days after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) vowed to crack down on securities fraud, and protect small investors with \"teeth and horns\". Last September, Evergrande said its founder was being investigated over suspected crimes. Hengda Real Estate said a probe by the CSRC found that it inflated revenues by 213.99 billion yuan, or half of the total, in 2019. In 2020, sales were inflated by 350 billion yuan, or 78.5% of total. And the developer issued bonds based on those falsified statements. In addition, the company failed to make timely disclosure of annual and mid-term results, lawsuit cases and outstanding debts. Hui was directly responsible at the time, so the misconduct was particularly \"egregious and grave in nature\", the company said in a statement, citing the CSRC decision. Other executives punished include Hengda Real Estate's former vice chairman and its former chief financial officer. Hengda Real Estate will be fined 4.2 billion yuan, and ordered by the regulator to rectify.

One side of the four-lane highway in the city of Meizhou gave way about 2 a.m. on Wednesday after a month of heavy rains in Guangdong province. Twenty-three vehicles fell down a steep slope, some sending up flames as they caught fire. Construction cranes were used to lift out the burnt-out and mutilated vehicles. Officials in Meizhou said three other people were unidentified, pending DNA testing. It wasn’t immediately clear if they had died, which would bring the death toll to 51. Another 30 people had non-life-threatening injuries. The search was still ongoing, Meizhou city Mayor Wang Hui said at a late-afternoon news conference. No foreigners have been found among the victims, he said. Search work has been hampered by rain and land and gravel sliding down the slope. The disaster left a curving earth-colored gash in the otherwise verdant forest landscape. Excavators dug out a wider area on the slope. “Because some of the vehicles involved caught fire, the difficulty of the rescue operation has increased,” said Wen Yongdeng, the Communist Party secretary for the Meizhou emergency management bureau. “Most of the vehicles were buried in soil during the collapse, with a large volume of soil covering them,” he said. He added that the prolonged heavy rainfall has saturated soil in the area, “making it prone to secondary disasters during the rescue process.” Over 56 centimeters (22 inches) of rain has fallen in the past four weeks in the county where the roadway collapsed, more than four times as much as last year. Some villages in Meizhou flooded in early April, and the city has seen more rain in recent days.

China immediately vowed retaliation. Its commerce ministry said Beijing was opposed to the U.S. tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests. Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of EV duties to over 100% and doubling the duties on semiconductor tariffs to 50%. The new measures affect $18 billion in imported Chinese goods including steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, critical minerals, solar cells and cranes, the White House said. The EV figure, while headline-grabbing, may have more political than practical impact in the U.S., which imports very few Chinese EVs. The announcement confirmed earlier Reuters reporting. The United States imported $427 billion in goods from China in 2023 and exported $148 billion to the world's No. 2 economy, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the revised tariffs were justified because China was stealing U.S. intellectual property. But Tai recommended tariff exclusions , opens new tab for hundreds of industrial machinery import categories from China, including 19 for solar product manufacturing equipment. FREE TRADE NO MORE Even as Biden's steps fell in line with Trump's premise that tougher trade measures are warranted, the Democrat took aim at his opponent in November's election . Biden cast Trump's 2020 trade deal with China as failing to increase American exports or jobs, and he said a Trump proposal to raise import tariffs 10% across-the-board from any point of origin would raise prices. Trump, who has floated tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese goods, said on Tuesday the Biden administration's new tariffs should be applied to other types of vehicles and products \"because China's eating our lunch right now.\" Item 1 of 8 U.S. President Joe Biden shakes hands with the International Vice President at Large for the United Steelworkers, Roxanne Brown during an event regarding new tariffs targeting various Chinese exports including electric vehicles, solar equipment, and medical supplies, at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 14, 2024.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more \"He's been feeding them a long time,\" Biden retorted when asked about the comment. Administration officials said their measures are combined with domestic investment in key industries and unlikely to worsen a bout of inflation that has already angered U.S. voters. Biden has struggled to convince voters of the efficacy of his economic policies despite a backdrop of low unemployment and above-trend economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed Trump had a 7 percentage-point edge over Biden on the economy. Analysts have warned that a trade tiff could raise costs for EVs overall, hurting Biden's climate goals and his aim to create manufacturing jobs. Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but not to launch a trade war. He has worked in recent months to ease tensions in one-on-one talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both 2024 U.S. presidential candidates have departed from the free-trade consensus that once reigned in Washington, a period capped by China's joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Trump's broader imposition of tariffs during his 2017-2021 presidency kicked off a tariff war with China. As part of the long-awaited tariff update , Biden will increase tariffs this year under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 from 25% to 100% on EVs, bringing total duties to 102.5%, from 7.5% to 25% on lithium-ion EV batteries and other battery parts and from 25% to 50% on photovoltaic cells used to make solar panels. Some critical minerals will have their tariffs raised from nothing to 25%. The tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes will rise to 25% from zero, those on syringes and needles will rise to 50% from nothing now and some personal protective equipment (PPE) used in medical facilities will rise to 25% from as little as 0% now. Shortages in PPE made largely in China hampered the United States' COVID-19 response. More tariffs will follow in 2025 and 2026 on semiconductors, as well as lithium-ion batteries that are not used in electric vehicles, graphite and permanent magnets as well as rubber medical and surgical gloves. A step Biden previously announced to raise tariffs on some steel and aluminum products will take effect this year, the White House said. A number of lawmakers have called for massive hikes on Chinese vehicle tariffs or an outright ban over data privacy concerns. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty vehicles being imported now. The United Auto Workers, a politically important union that endorsed Biden, said the tariff moves would ensure that \"the transition to electric vehicles is a just transition.\" Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington\nAdditional reporting by David Shepardson, David Lawder, Jeff Mason and Andrea Shalal in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Ros Russell, Heather Timmons and Nick Zieminski Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Climate & Energy Public Policy Grid & Infrastructure Energy Storage Solar Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next category US Supreme Court poised to revive challenge to California emissions standards 5:15 PM UTC · Updated  ago Carbon Markets category South Dakota regulators deny Summit Carbon Solutions a carbon dioxide pipeline permit 5:08 PM UTC · Updated  ago World category China's action on climate change will not slow despite global political changes, Xi says 4:25 PM UTC Climate & Energy category GE Vernova's quarterly revenue beats on strength in power, electrification units 2:27 PM UTC",

Sergei Bobylov/Pool/AFP/Getty Images Hong Kong CNN — Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in Beijing on Thursday, in a stark show of their growing alignment as Moscow’s troops advance in Ukraine . Putin — whose delegation includes top defense and security officials — was welcomed by Xi to Beijing’s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of the Russian president’s two-day state visit . A sweeping joint statement released by the two leaders laid out their countries’ alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine, Taiwan and conflict in the Middle East. The visit — Putin’s symbolic first overseas foray since starting a new term as Russia’s president last week — is the latest sign of tightening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy friction with the West. The statement proclaimed that China-Russian relations have stood “the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,” the two leaders calling each other “priority partners.” Putin, whose country’s economy has become increasingly reliant on China since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, hailed the countries’ “practical cooperation” in meetings with Xi, noting their record bilateral trade last year, while stressing the importance of bolstering energy, industrial, and agriculture cooperation, according to Russian state media Tass. Their meeting is Putin and Xi’s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine — weeks after the two declared a “no limits” partnership on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. This week’s state visit comes amid mounting international concern about the direction of the war in Ukraine amid delays to aid for Kyiv and as Russia’s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions — a situation that United States officials have alleged is linked to Chinese support, which Beijing denies. Putin says he and Xi will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening, which are expected to include Russia’s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia’s Security Council.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Kyiv earlier this week to reaffirm the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine after months of Congressional delay in approving American military aid to the embattled country. Blinken pledged $2 billion in foreign military financing and said much-needed ammunition and weapons are being rushed to the front lines.

Thomas Peter/Pool/Reuters Related article How the Ukraine war brought China and Russia closer together Pressure has also been mounting on Xi from both the US and Europe to ensure soaring exports from China to Russia since the start of the war aren’t propping up the Kremlin’s war effort. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support for Russia’s defense industrial base — in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and microelectronics exported from China. Beijing has slammed the US as making “groundless accusations” over “normal trade and economic exchanges” between China and Russia. Beijing has never condemned Russia’s invasion, rather it claims neutrality in the conflict and has released a vaguely articulated 12-point position on its resolution. Ahead of an expected peace conference in Switzerland next month, Xi has called for peace talks that take both sides’ positions into account. “China hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role,” Xi said in a joint press appearance with Putin. On Ukraine, Russia said in Thursday’s joint statement that it welcomed the readiness of China “to play a constructive role” in the political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict and that “it is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,” in an apparent allusion to their shared view that NATO is responsible for the conflict in Ukraine. The convoy of Russian President Vladimir Putin passes by Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Wednesday. Zhou Chengfeng/VCG/Getty Images Alignment on shared frictions This week’s visit marks the leaders’ 43rd meeting in the more than one decade that Xi has been in power. Xi and Putin, known for their close personal chemistry, have steadily expanded their countries’ diplomatic coordination and economic and security cooperation in that time — as both faced mounting frictions with the US and its allies. Even as Xi seeks to repair frayed relations with Europe and stabilize his country’s ties with the US, he is widely seen as unwilling to sacrifice his partnership with Putin, who the Chinese leader sees as an indispensable partner in reshaping a world order both believe is unfairly dominated by the US and seeking to contain them. This shared worldview was also on show Thursday as Xi, speaking alongside Putin, decried a lingering “Cold War mentality,” and said “unilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country” — using language typical of Beijing and Moscow’s criticisms of the US and its allies. The two leaders said in the joint statement they will “deepen trust and cooperation” in the military field by expanding the scope of joint exercises and combat training, regularly conducting joint sea and air patrols and improving the “capabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.” Putin nodded to Xi’s concerns about rising engagement between NATO and like-minded countries in Asia, calling for a “reliable and adequate architecture of security in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there will be no place for closed military-political alliances.” “We think the creation of such alliances to be counterproductive and harmful,” Putin said following meetings Thursday. In the statement, the two countries also expressed “very deep concern” over what they described as US military activity with allies “that have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation,” calling the actions “extremely destabilizing.” The two leaders “reaffirmed there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be fought,” and called for revisions to global security arrangements to prevent military confrontation. Besides engagements in Beijing, which are expected to include a “gala” marking the two countries’ 75 years of diplomatic ties, Putin is also expected to attend trade and cooperation forums in Harbin, the capital of China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province bordering Russia’s Far East. The region is historically a site of long-simmering border tensions between the two neighbors, which erupted in conflict between China and the Soviet Union in 1969. It has seen increasing connectivity with parts of Russia’s Far East in recent years. Putin is also expected to meet with the students and faculty of the Harbin Institute of Technology, a university sanctioned by the US government in 2020 for its alleged role in procuring items for China’s military.

The landing elevates China's space power status in a global rush to the moon, where countries including the United States are hoping to exploit lunar minerals to sustain long-term astronaut missions and moon bases within the next decade. Sign up here. The Chang'e-6 craft, equipped with an array of tools and its own launcher, touched down in a gigantic impact crater called the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the moon's space-facing side at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time (2223 GMT), the China National Space Administration said. The mission \"involves many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty\", the agency said in a statement , opens new tab on its website. \"The payloads carried by the Chang'e-6 lander will work as planned and carry out scientific exploration missions.\" The successful mission is China's second on the far side of the moon, a region no other country has reached. The side of the moon perpetually facing away from the Earth is dotted with deep and dark craters, making communications and robotic landing operations more challenging. Given these challenges, lunar and space experts involved in the Chang'e-6 mission described the landing phase as a moment where the chance of failure is the highest. \"Landing on the far side of the moon is very difficult because you don’t have line-of-sight communications, you’re relying on a lot of links in the chain to control what is going on, or you have to automate what is going on,\" said Neil Melville-Kenney, a technical officer at the European Space Agency working with China on one of the Chang'e-6 payloads. \"Automation is very difficult especially at high latitudes because you have long shadows which can be very confusing for landers,\" Melville added. The Chang'e-6 probe launched on May 3 on China's Long March 5 rocket from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan, reaching the lunar vicinity roughly a week later before tightening its orbit in preparation for a landing. Chang'e-6 marks the world's third lunar landing this year: Japan's SLIM lander touched down in January, followed the next month by a lander from U.S. startup Intuitive Machines.

The United States is the only country to have landed humans on the moon, starting in 1969. SAMPLING THE MOON Using a scoop and drill, the Chang'e-6 lander will aim to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of lunar material over two days and bring it back to Earth. The samples will be transferred to a rocket booster atop the lander, which will launch back into space, tag up with another spacecraft in lunar orbit and return, with a landing in China's Inner Mongolia region expected around June 25. If all goes as planned, the mission will provide China with a pristine record of the moon's 4.5 billion-year history and yield new clues on the solar system's formation. It will also allow for an unprecedented comparison between the dark, unexplored region with the moon's better understood Earth-facing side. A simulation lab for the Chang'e-6 probe will develop and verify sampling strategies and equipment control procedures, China's official Xinhua news agency said. It will use a full-scale replica of the sampling area based on exploration results on the environment, rock distribution and lunar soil conditions around the landing site. China’s lunar strategy includes its first astronaut landing around 2030 in a programme that counts Russia as a partner. In 2020 China conducted its first lunar sample return mission with Chang'e-5, retrieving samples from the moon's nearer side. The U.S. Artemis programme envisions a crewed moon landing by late 2026 or later. NASA has partnered with space agencies including those of Canada, Europe and Japan, whose astronauts will join U.S. crews on an Artemis mission. Artemis relies heavily on private companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose Starship rocket aims this decade to attempt the first astronaut landing since NASA's final Apollo mission in 1972. On Saturday Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled a private mission around the moon he had paid for, which was to have used SpaceX's Starship, citing schedule uncertainties in the rocket's development. Boeing and NASA postponed the company's first crewed launch of Starliner, a long-delayed capsule meant to become the second U.S. space taxi to low-Earth orbit.

Here’s how it works . Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya speaks as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) convene to a draft resolution spearheaded by Russia, advocating for the prohibition of the placement of any weapons in space in New York, United States on May 20, 2024. (Image credit: Fatih Aktas/Anadolu via Getty Images) The United Nations Security Council has voted against a resolution introduced by Russia and China that would ban member states from placing weapons of any kind in outer space. This isn't the first time these two countries have suggested such an idea. In late April, the United States and Japan introduced a resolution of their own that sought specifically to ban the deployment of weapons of mass destruction; at the time, Russia and China introduced an amendment to this resolution that had similar tones to their recent resolution that's been struck down. That Russian-Chinese amendment sought to \"prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space, and the threat of use of force in outer space.\" Votes were counted for the American-Japanese resolution last month; 13 countries voted \"yes,\" while China abstained and Russia voted \"no.\" The resolution was ultimately vetoed. The latest Russian-Chinese resolution, introduced on May 20 and now shot down as well, was largely the same as the one vetoed in April. However, it also proactively included the amendment these countries proposed for the previous one. When voting on this new resolution, seven countries voted in favor, seven voted against, and one — Switzerland — abstained.

The vote to shoot down this Russian-Chinese resolution comes just days after the U.S. accused Russia of launching a counterspace weapon — a spacecraft designed to destroy or disable other satellites — into the same orbit as an American satellite. Neither the capabilities nor the intended mission of the Russian satellite, known as Cosmos 2576, are known, according to SpaceNews . But observers have noted that it appears to be in the same orbit as USA 314, believed to be a spy satellite , according to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek.

The U.S. Department of State said the possible test \"displayed characteristics of a space-based weapon.\" Chinese satellites have been observed dragging other spacecraft into \"graveyard orbits.\" Perhaps most worryingly, reports surfaced earlier this year that Russia has launched a nuclear-capable counterspace weapon , although it remains unclear what exactly the spacecraft is capable of.

The probe's successful departure from the moon means China is closer to becoming the first country to return samples from the far side of the moon, which permanently faces away from Earth. Sign up here. The probe, which departed the moon at 7:38 am local time (2338 GMT) successfully completed its sample collection from June 2-3. China National Space Administration (CNSA) said in a statement that Chang'e-6 \"withstood the test of high temperature on the far side of the moon\". Compared with its predecessor Chang'e-5, which retrieved samples from the near side of the moon, Chang'e-6 faced an additional technical challenge of operating without direct communications with ground stations on Earth, according to CNSA. Instead, the probe relied on relay satellite Queqiao-2, put into orbit in April , for communications.

The probe is now in lunar orbit and will join up with another spacecraft in orbit, CNSA said on Tuesday morning. The samples will then be transferred to a return module, which will fly back to Earth, with a landing in China's Inner Mongolia region expected around June 25. The return of the lunar samples to Earth is being followed by scientists around the world, who hope the soil collected by the Chang'e-6 can help answer questions about the origins of the solar system. The mission has also been closely followed domestically as a source of national pride. Last month, thousands of tourists flocked to different viewing spots in the southern island province of Hainan to watch Chang'e-6's launch . Pictures of a hole left on the lunar surface from the sample digging by Chang'e-6 went viral on Tuesday on Chinese social media platform Weibo after state broadcaster CCTV said the hole was shaped like the character \"zhong\", a nod to the Chinese word for China, \"zhongguo\".

The ministry said Wang had gone to Britain as a student in 2015 and was later joined by his wife. It said Wang was given hotel rooms, trips around the country and financial incentives. It said the couple worked for the Chinese government in a “central state agency” and handled government secrets, which they passed to MI6. No information was given about what specific information the couple may have provided. The ministry said the case was still under investigation and gave no word on the location of the couple.

The Iowa Cornell College instructors were taken to hospital after a \"serious incident\" during the daytime attack in the northern province of Jilin, a college statement said. Iowa Representative Adam Zabner said his brother, David, was one of the four instructors injured in what he described as a stabbing. China's foreign ministry said that none of those injured were in a life-threatening condition. Police said an assailant with the surname Cui clashed with one of the Americans and then stabbed the person. He went on to injure three other US visitors and a Chinese tourist who tried to come to their rescue. Mr Zabner said the group of instructors had been visiting a local temple on Monday when they were attacked by a man with a knife. He said his brother had been stabbed in the arm at Beishan Park in Jilin city and was recovering well in hospital. \"My family is incredibly grateful that David survived this attack,\" he told the BBC. \"We’d like to see David home in Iowa as soon as possible,\" he added. \"We’re deeply thankful to the state department and Iowa’s federal delegation and understand that they are working hard to make that happen.\" Cornell College said the four instructors had been teaching \"as part of a partnership with a university in China\". The group had been accompanied by a member of Beihua University at the time of their visit to the park on Monday. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that police believed the attack was \"an isolated incident\" and that China was \"one of the safest countries in the world\". \"We believe this will not damage relations with other countries,\" he added. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on X/Twitter that the US was \"deeply concerned\" by the stabbing. \"Our team has been in touch with these Americans and our PRC counterparts to ensure that the victims’ needs are met, and appropriate law enforcement steps are being taken,\" he said. \"We wish them a speedy recovery.\" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said that she was in contact with the department about the “horrifying” attack. “Please pray for their full recovery, safe return, and their families here at home,\" she wrote on X/Twitter. Images of the incident circulating online appear to show at least three people bleeding and lying on the ground. Reuters The instructors had been visiting a local temple on Monday when they were attacked by a man with a knife However, the pictures appear to have been quickly censored on China's internet. On Tuesday, searches for terms such as \"foreigners Jilin\" produced no results despite the search term trending on Weibo. Internet users instead resorted to discussions under adjacent topics while some were also seen asking for more information about the incident. Online commentator Hu Xijin, who is formerly the chief editor of China's Global Times, had earlier posted on Weibo that China has been seeing a growing number of foreign visitors and the Chinese are \"typically friendly\" toward them. He described the incident as a \"chance event\". The post has since been removed. There are also few reports about the incident in Chinese state media. Mr Zabner said his brother, a Tufts University doctoral student, had visited China before and was on his second trip to the country with Cornell College. According to a 2018 news release from Cornell, the US school began a partnership with Beihua University that year to provide money for Cornell professors to live in China and teach a part of a course over a two-week period. The partnership focused on computer science, mathematics and physics, Cornell said at the time. Beihua University serves 24,000 students in the north-eastern Chinese city of 4.4 million people.

The probe landed in the Inner Mongolian region in northern China on Tuesday afternoon. “I now declare that the Chang’e 6 Lunar Exploration Mission achieved complete success,” Zhang Kejian, Director of the China National Space Administration, said in a televised news conference after the landing. Chinese scientists anticipate the returned samples will include 2.5 million-year-old volcanic rock and other material that scientists hope will answer questions about geographic differences on the moon’s two sides. The near side is what is seen from Earth, and the far side faces outer space. The far side is also known to have mountains and impact craters, contrasting with the relatively flat expanses visible on the near side. The probe had landed in the moon’s South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater created more than 4 billion years ago. The samples scientists are expecting will likely come from different layers of the basin, which will bear traces of the different geological events across its long chronology, such as when the moon was younger and had an active inside that could produce volcanic rock.

The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. — still the leader in space exploration — and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there. China’s leader Xi Jinping sent a message of congratulations to the Chang’e team, saying that it was a “landmark achievement in our country’s efforts at becoming a space and technological power.” The probe left earth on May 3, and its journey lasted 53 days . The probe has drilled into the core and scooped rocks from the surface. The samples “are expected to answer one of the most fundamental scientific questions in lunar science research: what geologic activity is responsible for the differences between the two sides?” said Zongyu Yue, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a statement issued in the Innovation Monday, a journal published in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. China in recent years has launched multiple successful missions to the moon, collecting samples from the moon’s near side with the Chang’e 5 probe previously. They are also hoping that the probe will return with material that bear traces of meteorite strikes from the moon’s past. That material could shed light on the solar system’s early days. There’s a theory that the moon acted as a vaccum cleaner of sorts, attracting all the meteorites and debris in the system’s earlier era so that they didn’t hit Earth, said de Grijs, who is also executive director at the International Space Science Institute — Beijing. China has said it plans to share the samples with international scientists, although it did not say exactly in which countries. ___ AP video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.

New maritime rules issued by China that allow its coastguard to detain foreigners for trespassing in the disputed South China Sea have taken effect – but their international legitimacy is being questioned by neighbouring countries. China claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, brushing aside competing claims from several Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines and a 2016 ruling by an arbitration tribunal in The Hague, which declared that its stance had no legal basis . The Chinese government has been deploying the country’s coastguard and other boats to patrol the waters it claims as its own, and has turned several reefs into militarised artificial islands. In recent years, Chinese and Philippine vessels have had a series of confrontations in disputed areas that have raised fears of a wider conflict. From Saturday, China’s coastguard can detain foreigners “suspected of violating management of border entry and exit”, according to the new regulations published online. Detention is allowed for up to 60 days in “complicated cases”, they say. “Foreign ships that have illegally entered China’s territorial waters and the adjacent waters may be detained.” Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr last month called the new rules a “very worrisome” escalation. And on Saturday, the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs announced that it has submitted to the United Nations in New York legal filings asserting its own “maritime entitlement” under the UN maritime rules to an extended continental shelf on parts of the South China Sea, which it refers to as the West Philippines Sea. The Philippines has accused the Chinese coastguard of “barbaric and inhumane behaviour” against Philippine vessels after coastguard vessels used water cannon against Philippine boats multiple times in the contested waters. There have also been collisions that injured Filipino soldiers. Philippine military chief General Romeo Brawner told reporters on Saturday that authorities in Manila were “discussing a number of steps to be undertaken in order for us to protect our fishermen”. Philippine fishermen were also told “not to be afraid, but just to go ahead with their normal activities to fish there in our Exclusive Economic Zone”, ignoring Beijing’s new rules, Brawner said.    The Group of Seven (G7) bloc of powerful economies on Friday also criticised what it called “dangerous” incursions by China in the vital waterway, where Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also have overlapping claims in some parts. Trillions of dollars in ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea annually, and huge unexploited oil and gas deposits are believed to lie under its seabed, though estimates vary greatly. The sea is also important as a source of fish for growing populations. China has defended its new coastguard rules. A foreign ministry spokesman said last month that they were intended to “better uphold order at sea” while the Chinese defence minister warned this month that there were “limits” to Beijing’s restraint in the South China Sea. China has also been angered in the past by United States and other Western warships sailing through the South China Sea. The US Navy and others undertake such voyages to assert the freedom of navigation in international waters, but Beijing considers them violations of its sovereignty. Chinese and US forces have had a series of close encounters in the South China Sea.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",

A man stabbed the woman and her child at a bus stop for a Japanese school, and then seriously injured a Chinese woman on the bus who tried to block him when he tried to get on, the spokesperson said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of embassy policy. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the man was arrested at the scene after the Monday afternoon attack in Suzhou, a tech center and historic canal city outside Shanghai. “It is a regrettable incident,” she said. “China will continue to take effective measures to earnestly protect the safety of all foreigners in China.” The motive for the attack was unclear, the Japanese Embassy spokesperson said. An investigation is ongoing. The Chinese woman was being treated at a hospital, Mao said. The injuries to the Japanese mother and child were not serious.

Issued on: 03/07/2024 - 04:45 Modified: 03/07/2024 - 04:46 1 min An aerial view of flooded buildings and streets in central China's Hunan province following heavy rains this week © STR / CNS/AFP China has been enduring extreme weather conditions in recent months, from torrential rainfall to searing heat waves. The country is the leading emitter of greenhouse gases, which scientists say drive climate change and make extreme weather events more frequent and intense. State news agency Xinhua said the storms had affected 991,000 residents in Anhui province and forced the evacuation of 242,000 people by Tuesday afternoon. \"As of 4 pm Tuesday, rainstorms had wreaked havoc in 36 counties and districts in seven prefecture-level cities in Anhui,\" Xinhua reported, citing the provincial emergency-management department. It said the Yangtze, China's longest river, has seen water levels in its Anhui section exceed warning marks and continue to rise. Torrential rains have also pushed waters above their alert levels in another 20 rivers and six lakes in the province. Footage on state broadcaster CCTV Wednesday showed a section of the Yangtze rising high enough to nearly cover a sculpture in the city of Wuhu that typically stands about 12 metres above the water line. Images showed umbrella-carrying volunteers in red jackets patrolling the river's edge and stockpiling bright red lifejackets and lifebuoys on the shore. More than 100 millimetres of rainfall was recorded at hundreds of weather stations across Anhui between 5 pm on Monday and the same time Tuesday, according to Xinhua. In Hexi county, near the provincial capital of Hefei, about 266 millimetres was recorded. Tens of thousands of officials have been deployed to monitor dams and dykes along the Yangtze in Anhui, Xinhua said. The provincial weather office forecast more rain across swathes of Anhui from Wednesday until Friday and issued warnings for \"geological disasters\" in southern areas. Intense rainfall has triggered deadly disasters in southern China in recent months. Mountain floods in central Hunan claimed five lives last month, according to state media reports, while a landslide in the same province killed eight people. Heavy rains and flooding also left 38 dead in southern Guangdong province in June. © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The flight, which happened over the weekend, comes as Chinese immigration has become the subject of intense political debate in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. “We will continue to enforce our immigration laws and remove individuals without a legal basis to remain in the United States,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. The department said it was working with China to “reduce and deter irregular migration and to disrupt illicit human smuggling through expanded law enforcement efforts.” It did not respond to questions about how long the migrants had been in the U.S. In recent years, the United States has had a difficult time returning Chinese nationals who do not have the right to stay in America because China has resisted taking them back. Last year, the United States saw a drastic surge in the number of Chinese immigrants entering the country illegally from Mexico. U.S. border officials arrested more than 37,000 Chinese nationals on the southern border in 2023, 10 times the number during the previous year.

Earlier this year, the U.S. and China resumed cooperation on migration issues. The Chinese government has said it is firmly opposed to “all forms of illegal immigration.” In a statement in May , China’s Embassy in the U.S. said the country’s law enforcement was cracking down “hard on crimes that harm the tranquility of national border, and maintained a high pressure against all kinds of smuggling organizations and offenders.” Homeland Security said they are working with China on more removal flights in the future but did not give a timeline for when the next one would happen. Earlier this year, a charter flight carried a small but unknown number of deportees to the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, according to Thomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks deportation flights. Homeland Security officials did not say how many people were on that March 30 flight, but the Gulfstream V aircraft typically has a seating capacity of 14. It also made a stop in South Korea before heading back to the U.S., Cartwright said. The announcement of the large charter flight comes after Ecuador cut off a key route used by Chinese migrants to get to the Western Hemisphere. Ecuador was one of only two mainland countries in the Americas to offer visa-free entry to Chinese nationals and had become a popular starting point for Chinese migrants to then trek north to the U.S. As of July 1, Ecuador has effectively reinstated visas for Chinese nationals after the South American country said it had seen a worrying increase in irregular migration.

The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has expelled former Defence Minister Li Shangfu, who was sacked last year, and his predecessor, as part of an anticorruption crackdown, according to state media. The expulsion of Li, who was not seen in public for almost two months before he was fired in October 2023 , and predecessor Wei Fenghe for the “serious violation of party discipline and the law” was reported by official news agency Xinhua on Thursday. Their expulsions from the party come at a time of increasing tension between China and the United States over a range of issues including the democratic island of Taiwan, and the disputed South China Sea. Xinhua reported that Li’s case had been referred to military prosecutors, potentially setting up a trial that could lead to him getting life in prison. The announcement followed a meeting of the party’s powerful Politburo of senior leaders to review Li’s status. They ruled that Li had “betrayed his original mission and lost his party spirit and principles”, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Li is alleged to have “seriously polluted the political environment and industrial ethos in the field of military equipment, and caused great damage to the party’s cause, national defence and the construction of the armed forces”.    The former defence minister was also accused of bribery, suspected of “taking advantage of his position and taking huge sums of money to seek benefits for others … and giving money to others to seek inappropriate benefits”, said CCTV. Wei, who retired as defence minister in 2023 after five years in office, was accused of accepting money and gifts in violation of the rules and taking advantage of his post to seek benefits for others, accepting money and valuables in return, according to Xinhua. Wei’s case has also been referred to military prosecutors. President Xi Jinping, who is also party leader and heads the armed forces as chairman of the Central Military Commission, has made the fight against corruption a hallmark of his rule since taking power more than a decade ago. Insiders have alleged a widespread purge of officers suspected of conspiring with outside forces or simply being insufficiently loyal to Xi. High-ranking officers occupy an elevated position in Chinese politics and can command extensive privileges. Li was considered a Xi loyalist. Chinese media also reported on Thursday that the CCP would hold its high level third plenum on July 15-18, much later than expected.

The hearing was requested by cognac houses Martell, Societe Jas Hennessy & Co., Remy Martin and other stakeholders, the ministry said in a statement. China has repeatedly urged the EU to cancel its EV tariffs and said it is willing to negotiate. Already stung by U.S. tariffs, it has said it does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, but would take all steps to protect its firms. There is a four-month window during which the EV tariffs are provisional and intensive talks are expected to continue between the two sides. The hearing on European brandy will be held two days before the deadline set by Brussels for EV makers to comment on the provisional EV tariffs. Reuters Graphics In January, Beijing opened a tit-for-tat anti-dumping investigation into European brandy imports and in June launched a second probe into pork shipments from the bloc of 27 countries, while Brussels looked into whether China's EV makers benefited from unfair subsidies. China's state-backed Global Times newspaper has reported that officials are considering opening an anti-subsidy probe into European dairy imports and imposing tariffs on large-engined petrol cars made in Europe. Analysts say China chose brandy and pork to persuade France and Spain, which have been among the firmest backers of EU curbs, to join countries such as Germany, whose automakers made a third of their sales in China last year. It reportedly wants the Commission to stop the tariffs. Italy, which has also indicated it would back tariffs, sent Adolfo Urso, its economic development minister, to Beijing, where China's industry ministry said he met his counterpart Jin Zhuanglong on Friday.

'SHOW SINCERITY' After the Commission confirmed the provisional tariffs would take effect from Friday, the Global Times published an editorial urging Brussels to consider European automakers' opposition to the curbs, as well as a separate article calling on Brussels to \"show sincerity\" in talks to find a negotiated settlement. The newspaper also called attention to U.S. EV maker Tesla's (TSLA.O) , opens new tab manufacturing plant in Shanghai, broadening its call for protest against the tariffs. Beijing had hoped Brussels would scrap plans to impose the curbs ahead of July 4, but the Commission said at the time China would need to come to the talks with a roadmap \"addressing the injurious subsidisation\" of its EV industry. China has accused the Commission of using its anti-dumping probe to snoop on Chinese companies' supply chains, the efficiency of which Beijing maintains gives it the upper hand in cheaply turning out electric cars, among other reasons.

The first stage of the Tianlong-3 rocket left its launch pad due to a structural failure at the connection between the rocket and the test stand, said company Beijing Tianbing, also known as Space Pioneer, in a statement on its official WeChat account. The rocket landed in a hilly area of the city of Gongyi in central China, it said. Video footage from the incident published by Chinese digital media outlet The Paper showed the rocket soaring straight up into the air before losing power and turning horizontally, falling back down to earth and exploding into flames on nearby forested hills. The new ‘space race’: what are China’s ambitions and why is the US so concerned? Read more An initial investigation of the unplanned flight found there were no reports of casualties, it said. Wow. This is apparently what was supposed to be a STATIC FIRE TEST today of a Tianlong-3 first stage by China's Space Pioneer. That's catastrophic, not static. Firm was targeting an orbital launch in the coming months. https://t.co/BY9MgJeE7A pic.twitter.com/L6ronwLW1N — Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) June 30, 2024 Parts of the rocket stage were scattered within a “safe area” but caused a local fire, according to a separate statement from the Gongyi emergency management bureau. The fire has since been extinguished and no one was hurt, the bureau said. The two-stage Tianlong-3, “Sky Dragon 3”, is a partly reusable rocket under development by Space Pioneer, one of a small group of private-sector rocket makers that have grown rapidly over the past five years. Falling rocket debris in China after launches is not unheard of, but it is very rare for part of a rocket under development to make an unplanned flight out of its test site and crash. According to Space Pioneer, the first stage of the Tianlong-3 ignited normally during a hot test but later detached from the test bench due to structural failure. A rocket can consist of several stages, with the first, or lowest, stage igniting and propelling the rocket upwards upon its launch. When the fuel is exhausted, the first stage falls off, and the second stage ignites, keeping the rocket in propulsion. Space Pioneer says the performance of Tianlong-3 is comparable to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 , which is also a two-stage rocket. In April 2023, Space Pioneer launched a kerosene-oxygen rocket, the Tianlong-2, becoming the first private Chinese firm to send a liquid-propellant rocket into space. Chinese commercial space companies have rushed into the sector since 2014 when private investment in the industry was allowed by the state. Many started making satellites while others including Space Pioneer, focused on developing reusable rockets that can significantly cut mission costs. The test sites of such companies can be found along China’s coastal areas, located by the sea due to safety reasons. But some are also sited deep in the country’s interior such as Space Pioneer’s test centre in Gongyi, a city of 800,000 people in the central province of Henan.

The sternly worded final communiqué, approved by the 32 NATO members at their summit in Washington, makes clear that China is becoming a focus of the military alliance. The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China. Beijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region. In the communiqué, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its “no-limits partnership” with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia’s defense industrial base. “This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia’s war effort,” read the communiqué, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People’s Republic of China. RELATED COVERAGE Tackling tariffs: What some companies are saying, and doing, about tariffs US Treasury secretary says trade war with China is not ‘sustainable’ Rory McIlroy returns at Zurich Classic in New Orleans. LPGA holds year’s first major in Houston “The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,” the document says. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are “enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.” He said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday said China is neither a creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis. “China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles, which is widely applauded by the international community,” said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman. He said China’s normal trade with Russia is “done aboveboard” and “beyond reproach.” Danny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia, called the new wording by NATO “an extraordinary step,” particularly because it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose “systemic challenges” to European interests and security. “It is a mark of how badly Beijing’s attempt to straddle Russia and Western Europe has failed and how hollow its claim of neutrality rings,” said Russel, who is vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “China’s attempts at divide-and-conquer have instead produced remarkable solidarity between key nations of the Euro-Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific regions.” Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the statement is “highly significant” because it signals to China that Europe, just like the U.S., also condemns support to Russia. “The U.S. believes that Europe has influence in Beijing, and that while China will not pay any attention to U.S. condemnation, they will pay attention to European condemnation because just because Europe trades with China, China also trades with Europe,” Bergmann said. In this year’s final declaration, NATO member countries reiterated their concerns that China poses “systemic challenges” to Euro-Atlantic security. It was first raised in 2021. The alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over China’s space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that China is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems. Liu, the Chinese embassy spokesman, said China handles such issues “in a responsible manner with transparent policies.” “Hyping up the so-called ‘China threat’ is completely futile,” Liu said, adding Beijing firmly opposes NATO’s use of regional hotspot issues to smear China and incite a new Cold War. In Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition’s 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance. In the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were “strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.” NATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber defense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would “enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.” DIDI TANG Tang joined the AP Washington bureau in 2023 after spending 11 years in Beijing as a China correspondent.

(Li Xueren/Xinhua via AP) TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping called on world powers to help Russia and Ukraine resume direct dialogue during a meeting Monday with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Orbán made a surprise visit to China after similar trips last week to Russia and Ukraine to discuss prospects for a peaceful settlement of more than the two-year war. Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union this month and Orbán has since embarked on a peace mission, which, however, lacks the endorsement of other European leaders. “China is a key power in creating the conditions for peace in the Russia-Ukraine war,” Orbán wrote on the social media platform X. “This is why I came to meet with President Xi in Beijing, just two months after his official visit to Budapest.” Orbán is widely seen as having the warmest relations with Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin among European leaders. His visit to Moscow last week drew condemnation from Kyiv and EU officials, who insisted Orbán was not acting on behalf of the whole European bloc. Their rebuke failed to deter Orbán from extending a similar visit to Beijing, which he called “Peace mission 3.0” in a picture posted on X. During his meeting with Xi, Orbán described China as a stabilizing force amid global turbulence and praised its “constructive and important” peace initiatives. China has been promoting its own six-point peace plan, which it issued with Brazil in May. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict, though in practice it supports Moscow through frequent state visits, growing trade and joint military drills. While hosting Orbán, Xi called on Russia and Ukraine to cease fire and on other major powers to create an environment conducive to talks. Only when all major powers project “positive energy rather than negative energy” can a cease-fire occur, Xi said, according to CCTV. Orbán hosted the Chinese leader in Hungary only two months ago as part of a three-country European tour that also included stops in France and Serbia, which unlike the other two is not a member of the EU or NATO. During the trip, China upgraded its ties with Hungary to an “all-weather, comprehensive strategic partnership,” one of its highest designations for foreign relations that in addition to Hungary applies only to Belarus, Pakistan and Venezuela. Hungary under Orbán has built substantial political and economic ties with China. The European nation hosts a number of Chinese electric vehicle battery facilities, and in December it announced that Chinese EV manufacturing giant BYD will open its first European EV production factory in the south of the country. The Hungarian prime minister broadly opposes Western military aid to Ukraine and has blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow over its invasion. Orbán has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country’s territorial integrity or future security. That posture has frustrated Hungary’s EU and NATO allies, who have denounced Russia’s invasion as a breach of international law and a threat to the security of Eastern Europe. Standing alongside Orbán last week in Moscow, Putin declared that Russia wouldn’t accept any cease-fire or temporary break in hostilities that would allow Ukraine “to recoup losses, regroup and rearm.” Putin repeated his demand that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four regions that Moscow claims to have annexed in 2022 as a condition for any prospective peace talks. Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected that demand, suggesting it is akin to asking Kyiv to withdraw from its own territory. China meanwhile has spread its influence in Central Asia and Eastern Europe in recent years beyond its “no limits” partnership with Moscow. Over the weekend, China held “anti-terror” military drills with Belarus — a key ally of Russia — near the border with Poland. The drills came after last week Belarus joined a regional security organization led by China and Russia. Orbán will next head to Washington, D.C., where NATO leaders are holding a summit to discuss ways to assure Ukraine of the alliance’s continued support. “Next stop: Washington,” Orbán posted on his social media account Monday.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who leads the Fatah movement, has previously criticized the Islamist Hamas group for the war, while Hamas has accused the Palestinian president of taking Israel's side. The two main Palestinian factions have been at odds since Hamas won legislative elections in 2006 and took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 after a brief civil war in which it routed the Western-backed Palestinian forces loyal to Abbas. Efforts since 2007 by Arab countries, led by Egypt, have so far failed to end power-sharing disputes between Hamas, which runs Gaza, and the Fatah movement of Abbas, which makes the backbone of the Palestinian Authority.

Once believed to be among the richest people in China, Guo was arrested in New York in March 2023 and accused of operating a racketeering enterprise that stretched from 2018 through 2023. Over a seven-week trial, he was accused of deceiving thousands of people who put money into bogus investments, with the aim of preserving a luxurious lifestyle. He was convicted of nine of 12 criminal counts, including racketeering conspiracy. Guo’s lawyers said prosecutors had not proven he had cheated anyone. Guo, who is also known by the name Miles Kwok, left China in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown that ensnared people close to him, including a top intelligence official. Chinese business tycoon and Bannon ally Guo Wengui arrested in $1bn fraud conspiracy Read more Chinese authorities accused Guo of rape, kidnapping, bribery and other crimes, but Guo said those allegations were false and designed to punish him for publicly revealing corruption as he criticized leading figures in the Communist party. He applied for political asylum in the US, moved to a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park and joined Donald Trump ’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. While living in New York, Guo developed a close relationship with Trump’s former onetime political strategist, Steve Bannon . In 2020, Guo and Bannon announced a joint initiative to overthrow the Chinese government. Prosecutors say hundreds of thousands of people were convinced to invest more than $1bn in entities Guo controlled. Among those businesses and organizations was Guo’s media company, GTV Media Group Inc, and his so-called Himalaya Farm Alliance and the Himalaya Exchange. In a closing argument, assistant US attorney Ryan Finkel said Guo “spouted devious lies to trick his followers into giving him money”. He said Guo made hundreds of broadcasts and videos in which he promised followers that they would not lose money if they invested with him. “I’m rich. I’ll take care of you,” the prosecutor said Guo told them. Explore more on these topics China Steve Bannon Donald Trump New York Asia Pacific Communism news Share Reuse this content",

The report said 24 people were still missing from the July 19 disaster in the province of Shaanxi in China’s northwest. One person was saved. The area where the bridge on the Danning highway fell had experienced heavy rains in the preceding days. At least 25 cars fell into the river, according to CCTV, and teams have searched kilometers (miles) downstream looking for victims. A photo released by the Xinhua news agency shortly after the incident showed a section of the bridge snapped and folded at almost a 90-degree angle into the rushing brown water below. The river passes through a mountain valley and the waters are turbulent, the report said.

Analysts said the agreement would prove hard to implement, with complications including the deep enmity between Palestinian factions and Western opposition to Hamas having any role in governance. No timetable was declared for implementation. Sign up here. The Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout. The meeting marked the latest attempt to heal the Palestinian national schism that has defied all attempts at mediation since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in a brief civil war with Fatah. The meeting was held amid attempts by mediators to reach a ceasefire deal after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . One of the sticking points is the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war, which began on Oct. 7, ends. Hamas welcomed the declaration, saying it created a \"barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests\". But there was no immediate comment from the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March, Abbas appointed a new Palestinian Authority (PA) government led by one of his allies, Mohammad Mustafa. Israel signalled its objection, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying on X that Abbas had embraced \"the murderers and rapists of Hamas\" instead of \"rejecting terrorism\". \"In reality, this won’t happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more Shunned by the West as a terrorist group even before Oct. 7, Hamas has previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic PA government. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the militant, Iran-backed Hamas and opposes it having any part in a post-war Gaza administration. Netanyahu's right-wing government, which rejects Palestinians' quest for an independent state, has also objected to a revamped PA returning to govern Gaza - an idea supported by the United States and its Arab allies. The most prominent highlight in the deal was a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Senior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the unity government would also oversee reconstruction and prepare conditions for elections. Ashraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval. \"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said. Dismissing the China meeting as \"a celebratory event\", he said it was \"impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days\". Nonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year. Chinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.

Manila deliberately beached a naval ship , the Sierra Madre, on Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to reinforce its claims over disputed waters surrounding it, and it has since maintained a small contingent of sailors aboard the vessel who require resupply missions that China has been accused of repeatedly trying to block . Why the rusting wreck of a second world war ship is so important to China Read more The Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) did not provide details on the “provisional arrangement’ agreed on Sunday for the resupply missions to the Sierra Madre but said it followed “frank and constructive discussions” between the two sides earlier this month. “Both sides continue to recognise the need to de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea and manage differences through dialogue and consultation and agree that the agreement will not prejudice each other’s positions in the South China Sea,” the DFA said. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed the arrangement, adding: “The Chinese side still demands that the Philippine side tow away the ship and restore the original status of [Second Thomas Shoal] as if it were unmanned and without facilities,” a spokesperson said in a statement released early on Monday. “If the Philippines needs to provide supplies to the ship’s occupants before the Philippines tows away the beached warship, the Chinese side is willing to allow the Philippine side to carry out the transportation and replenishment on humanitarian grounds,” the spokesperson said. On Monday, Philippine foreign ministry spokesperson Teresita Daza said in a statement that Manila would “continue to assert our rights and jurisdiction in our maritime zones”, which included Second Thomas Shoal. The foreign ministry also rejected suggestions by China that the “provisional arrangement” announced on Sunday required Manila to give Beijing “prior notification” and verification of deliveries to the BRP Sierra Madre, reports Agence France-Presse. China also stood firm over its territorial claims regarding the disputed waters. “If the Philippines transports a large amount of building materials to the ship and tries to build fixed facilities and permanent outposts, China will never accept it and will resolutely block it in accordance with laws and regulations, so as to safeguard China’s sovereignty,” the spokesperson added. Philippine security officials also said on Sunday they would carry out the resupply missions on their own despite an offer of help from the US. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday the US would “do what is necessary” to ensure its treaty ally can resupply the Sierra Madre on the Second Thomas Shoal. Sullivan’s Filipino counterpart, Eduardo Año, said the resupply will remain “a pure Philippine operation”. “There is no need at this time for any direct involvement of US forces in RORE [resupply] mission,” Año said in a statement. Reuters had previously reported that the Philippines had turned down offers from the US to assist its operations in the South China Sea. Tensions in the disputed waterway have boiled over into violence in the past year, with a Filipino soldier losing a finger last month in a clash that Manila described as an “intentional-high speed ramming” by the China Coast Guard. Manila and Washington are bound by the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, a pact that can be invoked in case of an armed attack against Philippine forces, public vessels or aircraft in the South China Sea. President Joe Biden has affirmed an “ironclad” commitment to aid the Philippines. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, overlapping maritime claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. In 2016, a Hague-based tribunal said China’s claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected.

        "text": "Beijing said the US’s weapons sales to Taiwan has ‘compromised the political atmosphere’ for continued talks on nuclear non-proliferation. China has suspended negotiations on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control with the United States in protest against Washington’s arms sales to the self-ruled island of Taiwan. The US called Beijing’s decision on Wednesday “unfortunate”, while analysts said the move deals a potentially serious setback to global arms-control efforts. China and the US began nuclear weapons discussions in November as part of a bid to ease mistrust ahead of a summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden. Further dialogue had not been publicly announced since, with a White House official in January urging Beijing to respond “to some of our more substantive ideas on risk reduction”. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday said the US’s arms sales to Taiwan, a territory that it claims, had “seriously compromised the political atmosphere for continuing the arms-control consultations”. “Consequently, the Chinese side has decided to hold off discussion with the US on a new round of consultations on arms control and non-proliferation,” Lin Jian, the spokesperson, told a regular news briefing in Beijing. “The responsibility fully lies with the US,” he said. Lin added that China was willing to maintain communication on international arms control, but said the US “must respect China’s core interests and create necessary conditions for dialogue and exchange”. The US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 but has remained Taiwan’s most important partner and biggest arms supplier, sparking repeated condemnations from China. Taiwan has protested for the past four years about stepped-up Chinese military activity near the island, including almost daily missions by Chinese warplanes and warships. Washington in June approved two military sales to Taiwan worth approximately $300m in total, mostly of spare and repair parts for the island’s F-16 fighter jets.    US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller slammed China’s move, saying Beijing has chosen to follow Russia’s lead by asserting that arms-control engagement cannot proceed while there are other challenges in the bilateral relationship. “We think this approach undermines strategic stability. It increases the risk of arms-race dynamics,” Miller told reporters. “Unfortunately, by suspending these consultations, China has chosen not to pursue efforts that would manage strategic risks and prevent costly arms races, but we, the United States, will remain open to developing and implementing concrete risk-reduction measures with China,” he said. The Biden administration advocates a policy of “compartmentalization”, in which nuclear arms control talks are segregated from other contentious Sino-US issues. The Chinese decision comes just over a month after the Biden administration said the US may have to deploy more strategic nuclear weapons to deter growing threats from Chinese and Russian arsenals. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association advocacy group, told the Reuters news agency that the US, Russia and China are legally bound as signatories of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty – the cornerstone of global arms control – to “engage in talks to prevent the arms race”. “The only way they can accomplish that is through serious dialogue and Russia’s refusal to do so and China’s decision to do so are very serious setbacks,” he said. The US has a stockpile of about 3,700 nuclear warheads, of which roughly 1,419 strategic nuclear warheads were deployed. Russia has about 1,550 nuclear weapons deployed and according to the Federation of American Scientists, a stockpile of 4,489 nuclear warheads. Washington meanwhile estimates that China has 500 operational nuclear warheads and will probably have more than 1,000 by 2030. US officials have expressed frustration that Beijing has shown little interest in discussing steps to reduce nuclear weapons risks. But Beijing has long argued that the US already has a much larger arsenal.           Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Thursday on the sidelines of Association of Southeast Asian Nations meetings in Laos, where they stressed the need for an early resolution of outstanding issues along the disputed Line of Actual Control , the long Himalayan border shared by the two Asian giants. The line separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India’s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. Ties between the two countries deteriorated in July 2020 after a military clash killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese. It turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Both India and China have withdrawn troops from some areas on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but continue to maintain extra troops as part of a multitier deployment.

Jaishankar in his opening remarks said the border issues have “cast a shadow” over India-China ties for the last four years despite considerable efforts by both sides to solve them. “The state of the border will necessarily be reflected on the state of our ties,” he said, according to the statement. Wang stressed that improving China-India ties is beneficial for both countries as well as for other nations, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported. The two sides agreed to work together to maintain peace in border areas and push for progress, it said. India and China fought a war over their border in 1962.

        "text": "Taiwan and China reach deal over fishermen's deaths 30 July 2024 Share Save Kelly Ng BBC News Share Save Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration Taiwanese coast guards inspect the vessel which capsized during a chase in February After months of negotiation, Taiwan and China have \"reached an agreement\" on how to respond to the deaths of two Chinese fishermen following a sea chase by Taiwan's coastguard, Taipei said. The settlement involves compensation to the victims' families and the repatriation of their bodies to China, according to reports. Taiwan's coastguard declined to share details. The deal may reduce tensions in the sensitive Taiwan Strait, which Beijing claims as its own. China had condemned the incident in February as \"malicious\" and started regular patrols around Taiwan's Kinmen archipelago following it. The regular patrols aimed to “maintain operational order in sea areas and safeguard fishermen’s lives and property”, Beijing's coastguard said in February. The two men who died were among four people on board a fishing boat which trespassed into Taiwanese waters off Kinmen on 14 February and resisted inspection. The boat capsized when Taiwanese authorities gave chase and the two fishermen drowned while trying to flee. Beijing and Taipei used to be more flexible about each other's fishing fleets, especially around Taiwan’s off-shore islands, which lie extremely close to the Chinese coast. Kinmen - Taiwan's northernmost archipelago - lies just 3km (1.9 mi) from China. But in recent years Taiwan has been enforcing its own waters more strictly - a response to what it says is a massive increase in poaching by fishermen from China's coastal Fujian province. Kinmen residents have reported seeing an increased presence of Chinese dredging vessels in its vicinity. China's Taiwan Affairs Office had for months urged Taiwanese authorities to investigate the incident and offer assistance to the victims' families. It also accused the self-ruled Taiwan - which Beijing sees as a breakaway province which will eventually be part of China - of \"using various excuses to forcefully seize Chinese fishing vessels\". Taiwan has defended its coastguard's actions and called on Beijing to \"restrain similar behaviours\" on its waters. On Tuesday, Taiwan's coast guard director Chang Chung-lung apologised to the victims' families \"for the suffering [they have] endured\" and also \"for not recording evidence in this case\". Both sides \"will actively implement the agreed consensus as quickly as possible\" said Hsieh Chin-chin, deputy director-general of the coastguard administration. \"We respect the families and the content of the consensus, so we are unable to provide further details,\" Mr Hsieh added. A spokesman for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council revealed the compensation will be paid by private donors, while stressing it does not have any impact on the outcome of the investigation into what happened, and who was responsible. Beijing said it hopes Taiwan will \"actively implement the terms of the agreement to provide peace of mind to the victims and offer an explanation to their families\".

UNESCO experts, who are deliberating on a list of sites nominated for the World Heritage Site tag, announced the decision in Indian capital New Delhi, where they are holding their 46th session. The Charaideo Moidams, located in Assam state, are a mound burial system that served as a resting place for Ahom kings and queens. They were constructed by providing an earth cover over a hollow vault made of bricks, stone or earth. The designated site contains 90 modiams of different sizes, which were created over a period of 600 years, and include other cultural features like ceremonial pathways and bodies of water, said a spokesperson from ICOMOS, the advisory body of the World Heritage Committee. “The moidams are an exceptional example of an Ahom necropolis that represents funeral traditions and associated beliefs in a tangible way,” they added. The Ahom clan established their capital in different parts of the Brahmaputra River Valley between the 12th to 18th century, after migrating from China, according to the U.N. cultural agency’s website. They established the first capital at the Patkai hills in eastern India and named it Charaideo, which means “a dazzling city above the mountain” in their language. Even though the clan moved across cities, the burial site they built was seen as the most sacred place for the departed souls of the royals.

In totaal gaat het om 4000 lijken. Het complete netwerk is blootgelegd. Verschillende begrafenis- en crematieondernemingen haalden lijken op na de plechtigheden en lieten familieleden gewoon betalen voor de kosten van de uitvaart. Ook vervalsten ze de papieren, waardoor het leek dat het om lichamen van donoren ging. Vervolgens hakten ze de lijken in stukken en werden ze vervoerd naar twee bedrijven, Shanxi Biomaterials en Sichuan Hengpu Technologies. Die bedrijven gebruikten de lichamen om bottransplantaties te doen. De verdachten zouden het tekort aan donoren hebben gebruikt om veel geld te verdienen. In totaal hebben de criminelen zo'n 53 miljoen dollar buitgemaakt. Correspondent Laura van Megen: \"De Chinese bevolking reageert geschokt op het nieuws. Mensen vragen zich af of het de lichamen zijn van hun geliefden, die in plaats van gecremeerd in stukken gesneden en illegaal verhandeld zijn. Of, aan de andere van kant van de keten, of zij het zelf zijn die transplantaties hebben gekregen van donoren die daar geen toestemming voor hadden gegeven. De zaak loopt al een tijd, maar ging pas viraal toen een advocaat er iets over plaatste op socialemedianetwerk Weibo, het Chinese X. Hij deed zijn beklag dat de wettelijke strafmaten, een celstraf van drie jaar of minder en geen geldboete, veel te laag waren. 'Dit maakt me nog wel het wanhopigst', schreef hij.

Analysts believe China would want to sound out Vietnam’s newly minted Communist Party chief To Lam over the country’s foreign policy front and also to promote President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road” projects in Vietnam such as the Lao Cai - Hanoi - Hai Phong railway project among others. Observers say the timing of the trip is crucial to note, given that it’s coming soon after Washington’s decision to classify Hanoi as a “non-market economy”, even if the visit was likely planned in advance. The decision on August 2 by the US Commerce Department to continue to classify Vietnam as a “non-market economy” (NME) sparked great disappointment from the Vietnamese especially after a period of tightening ties between Hanoi and Washington.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading An upgrade to market economy status would have made Vietnamese exports to the US significantly cheaper, according to experts. “Hanoi is clearly angered by the decision,” said Professor Zachary Abuza from the National War College in Washington, adding that he was expecting Chinese leaders to capitalise on hurt feelings. “They are always whispering in the ears of the Vietnamese that the United States cannot be trusted and that the country should remain committed to its socialist foreign policy,” he told CNA. Related: Vietnam President To Lam takes top job as Communist Party chief At the same time, Beijing will take the opportunity to evaluate Mr Lam’s leadership, Mr Abuza added. “To Lam has made multiple visits to China and is a known quantity to the Chinese leadership. China obviously wants to sound him out and make sure that there will be foreign policy continuity going forward,” he said. WARM BUT “SCEPTICAL” WELCOME Mr Lam’s three-day trip began on Sunday with his arrival in Guangzhou, his first overseas state visit since becoming the new Vietnamese Communist Party chief earlier this month. He took over the party reins on August 3, following the death of Nguyen Phu Trong on July 19. Notably, Mr Trong also chose China for his first state visit when he assumed the party role in 2011. After he flew to Beijing on Sunday evening, Mr Lam met Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. He inspected a military parade outside the Great Hall of the People before meeting with Mr Xi. Inside the state building near Tiananmen Square, the two leaders signed cooperation agreements. During their discussions, President Xi highlighted the importance of the relationship between the two ruling communist parties, urging China and Vietnam to \"uphold the original spirit of friendship, maintain traditional ties, and deepen the strategically important Sino-Vietnamese shared community of destiny.\" Congratulating Mr Lam on his new role, Mr Xi expressed confidence that by continuing their \"common endeavour of promoting the cause of world socialism,\" both countries would see their paths \"widen.\" In response, Mr Lam lauded Mr Xi for steering China into becoming a \"strong and prosperous country,\" and praised his efforts in advancing Beijing's \"role in peace, cooperation, and development in the region and the world\".

(Photo: Pool Photo via AP/Andres Martinez Casares) Mr Lam’s visit to China has been warmly portrayed by Chinese state media, which highlighted the enduring ties and shared history between the two socialist nations. Reporting on the Vietnamese leader's visit to Guangzhou, Chinese state media agency Xinhua prominently highlighted his statement that Vietnam regarded its relationship with China as a top foreign policy priority and remained committed to maintaining the enduring friendship established by past generations of leaders from both nations. State-owned newspaper The Global Times praised the camaraderie between the two nations in a commentary, stating that their robust ties will lead to increased economic collaboration benefiting both populations. The mutual goodwill displayed by China and Vietnam, the newspaper added, sets a positive example for the entire region. But some Chinese netizens on Weibo remained sceptical about the visit. \"(China) should be careful not to offer too many incentives to Vietnam, as it might later shift its alignment (towards the West),\" said one Weibo user. Commenting on ongoing disputes in the South China Sea, another Weibo user remarked: \"(Vietnam) should drop its claims on the disputed waters; only then will relations with China be smooth.\" WHAT VIETNAM WANTS China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner, with two-way trade accounting for US$173.3 billion last year. On Monday, both leaders signed 14 deals ranging from cross-border railway infrastructure projects to exports of various goods including coconuts, durians and crocodiles, according to media reports. Vietnamese officials previously said rail links connecting the countries would be high on the agenda when the leaders meet. Chinese manufacturers have been expanding operations to Vietnam amid trade tensions with the US. Related: China eyes plan to connect Southeast Asian rail links Vietnam president wants maritime disputes with China to be well managed Emeritus professor Damien Kingsbury from Deakin University’s School of Humanities and Social Sciences told CNA that it was currently an “opportune time” for Vietnam’s new Communist Party chief “to deepen trade and investment ties” with its neighbour, also the world’s second-largest economy. “Vietnam is clearly looking to expand its economy with whoever is prepared to be a willing partner,” Mr Kingsbury said, adding that Hanoi was expected to build on existing economic relations by “increasing trade and Chinese investment” in the Southeast Asian country. “There may also be discussion about a free trade zone along the border, or some lessening of barriers to trade and investment in their common border region,” he added. Dr Hoang Viet from Ho Chi Minh City University of Law said that even if the US had recognised Vietnam as a NME, Hanoi will still want to continue to promote economic and trade relations with Beijing at a deeper level. “However, Vietnam does not only want to do so with the Chinese market, it also wants to increase economic and trade relations with other important partners such as the US, EU, Japan etc,” he added, saying it’s part of the country’s policy of multilateralisation and diversification. Mr Lam’s visit to China is also designed to stress Vietnam's commitment to its established foreign policies while showcasing his administration’s focus on improving economic prospects amid recent domestic political instability, analysts say. In this context, experts believe he is seeking to solidify his political standing at home in Vietnam following a period of leadership turbulence, which saw the ouster of several high-ranking party officials including former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong, deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh and the National Assembly chairman Vuong Dinh Hue, over corruption allegations. Mr Kingsbury noted the significance of improved relations between the two neighbours. “Strengthening relations with China could not only mend ties with Laos and potentially Cambodia (for Vietnam) but also open opportunities for closer relations with Thailand, which could enhance exports and investment,” he said.

(Duong Van Giang/VNA via AP) International relations expert Chong Ja Ian of the National University of Singapore said both sides are expected to discuss a range of issues, such as management of tributaries to the Mekong and cross-border trade. “The visit signals the continued valuing of Vietnam’s relationship with PRC (People’s Republic of China), and a desire to have smooth ties even if differences remain,” he added. Emeritus professor Carlyle Thayer from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, drew reference to Mr Lam’s first China visit as Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, like his predecessor Trong did. “(Like Trong), To Lam is signalling that Vietnam is acknowledging China’s pre-eminent role as a socialist country (and) that intra-party relations is the most important bilateral conduit for relations,” added Prof Thayer. He believes Mr Lam is also likely to seek assurances that China remains committed to the proposals made between former General Secretary Trong and Chinese President Xi, including the revision of financial regulations to facilitate currency exchanges between the renminbi and the dong. In addition to his visit to China, Mr Lam is scheduled to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York this September. Professor Abuza from the National War College noted that the Vietnamese leader may meet with US President Joe Biden during his visit. The back-to-back visits to the two superpowers underscore Vietnam's flexible foreign policy, known as \"bamboo diplomacy,\" in navigating complex geopolitical challenges. “Vietnam’s bamboo diplomacy is a metaphor not a strategy… The ends of Vietnam’s foreign policy are to remain independent and self-reliant by diversifying and multilateralising its foreign relations. Bamboo diplomacy – the ways – are to be firm on principle such as defending national sovereignty – but flexible in practices.” said Professor Thayer. WHAT CHINA WANTS Beijing, on the other hand, was not only willing but would also be highly motivated to advance key projects under its Belt and Road Initiative, such as the Lao Cai-Hanoi-Hai Phong railway. The new train lines are expected to link up with the recently built routes extending China’s railway network to the Vietnamese border, facilitating imports of Chinese industrial goods and materials, experts said. Exports to China reached $27.8 billion in the first half of the year, a 5.3 per cent increase from the previous year, according to the Vietnamese General Statistics Office. Concurrently, Vietnam imported $67 billion worth of goods from China, up 34.7%, resulting in a trade deficit of $39.2 billion, a 67.9 per cent rise. The Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade subsequently reported that bilateral trade between the two countries surpassed $100 billion during that period, solidifying China's position as Vietnam's largest trading partner. “(President) Lam will be looking to build a more positive relationship (by) increasing trade and Chinese investment in Vietnam… There may also be discussion about a free trade zone along the border, or some (sort of) lessening of barriers to trade and investment in their common border region, ”  said Prof Kingsbury of Deakin University. TERRITORIAL DISPUTES Mr Lam’s inaugural state visit to China also follows weeks of political posturing between Hanoi and Beijing over competing claims in the South China Sea. Earlier this month, the Philippine and Vietnamese coast guards held their first joint drills, amid ongoing territorial disputes with each other and, more critically, with China, which claims nearly the entire South China Sea. But ongoing territorial disputes are unlikely to impede the strengthening of bilateral relations between China and Vietnam this time round, according to analysts. “Joint patrols among the Vietnamese Coast Guard and others of ASEAN countries are completely normal. The Vietnamese Coast Guard has also conducted joint patrols with the Chinese Coast Guard many times, therefore, these joint patrols should be understood as activities to promote cooperative relations among Vietnam and many friendly countries,” said Dr Viet.

Each blamed the other for the collision near Sabina Shoal, a disputed atoll in the Spratly Islands, where Vietnam and Taiwan also have overlapping claims. There were no reports of injuries. China’s coast guard accused the Philippines of deliberately crashing one of its ships into a Chinese vessel. It said in a statement on its website that two Philippine coast guard ships entered waters near the shoal, ignored a warning from the Chinese coast guard and intentionally collided with one of the Chinese boats at 3:24 a.m. “The Philippine side is entirely responsible for the collision,” spokesperson Gan Yu said. “We warn the Philippine side to immediately stop its infringement and provocation, otherwise it will bear all the consequences arising from that.” AP AUDIO: Chinese and Philippine ships collide again in disputed waters, and the countries are trading blam AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on tensions between the Philippines and China following a collision of ships in disputed waters. Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the Philippine government’s National Security Council, accused the Chinese coast guard of falsely saying the Philippine coast guard ships had rammed its vessels. RELATED COVERAGE Tackling tariffs: What some companies are saying, and doing, about tariffs US Treasury secretary says trade war with China is not ‘sustainable’ Rory McIlroy returns at Zurich Classic in New Orleans. LPGA holds year’s first major in Houston Video and photographs, including ones taken by journalists from a U.S. TV network who were on board one of the Philippine coast guard ships, showed that the Chinese ships caused the collisions, Malaya told a news forum in Manila. The Philippines’ National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea said two of the coast guard ships, BRP Bagacay and BRP Cape Engaño, “encountered unlawful and aggressive maneuvers” from Chinese coast guard vessels while en route to Patag and Lawak islands, which are occupied by Filipino forces, in the contested region. “These dangerous maneuvers resulted in collisions, causing structural damage to both Philippine Coast Guard vessels,” the statement said. The Philippine coast guard said one of the Chinese ships rammed the BRP Cape Engaño, ripping a 1.1-meter (3.6-foot) hole on the right side. An engine exhaust was also damaged, it said. About 16 minutes later, the other Philippine ship, BRP Bagacay, was rammed twice on its left and right sides by another Chinese vessel, leaving a hole 3 feet (36 inches) wide and 2.5 feet (30 inches) long and a dent that was 1 foot (12 inches) deep, the Philippine coast guard said. “This is the biggest structural damage we have incurred as a result of the dangerous maneuvers carried out by the Chinese coast guard,” Commodore Jay Tarriela of the Philippine coast guard said at the news forum. The task force said the Philippine coast guard “stands firm in its responsibility to ensure the safety and security of our maritime domain while addressing any threats to our national interests.” Gan, the Chinese coast guard spokesperson, said China claims “indisputable sovereignty” over the Spratly Islands, known in Chinese as the Nansha Islands, including Sabina Shoal and its adjacent waters. The Chinese name for Sabina Shoal is Xianbin Reef. In a separate statement, he said a Philippine ship that was turned away from Sabina Shoal entered waters near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, ignoring the Chinese coast guard’s warnings. “The Chinese coast guard took control measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with law and regulation,” he added. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also blamed the Philippines for the incident. “Not only did they ignore China’s coast guard’s warnings, the vessels deliberately collided into Chinese coast guard vessels that were carrying out law enforcement operations in a dangerous manner,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing Monday. Sabina Shoal, which lies about 140 kilometers (85 miles) west of the Philippines’ western island province of Palawan, has become a new flashpoint in the territorial disputes between China and the Philippines. The Philippine coast guard deployed one of its key patrol ships, the BRP Teresa Magbanua, to Sabina in April after Filipino scientists discovered submerged piles of crushed corals in its shallows that sparked suspicions that China may be preparing to build a structure at the atoll. The Chinese coast guard later deployed a ship to Sabina in a new territorial faceoff. Sabina is near Philippine-occupied Second Thomas Shoal, which has been the scene of increasingly alarming confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard ships and accompanying vessels since last year. China and the Philippines reached an agreement last month to prevent further confrontations when the Philippines transports replacement sentry forces, along with food and other supplies, to Manila’s territorial outpost in Second Thomas Shoal, which has been closely guarded by Chinese coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships. The Philippine navy transported food and personnel to Second Thomas Shoal a week after the deal was reached and no incident was reported, sparking hope that tensions in the shoal would ease. But Monday’s incident raises questions about whether the deal will make a difference. “We are of course disappointed again,” Malaya said. “Despite this preliminary understanding, which we hoped was the first page in a new chapter between the Philippines and (Chinese) relations, we have … another incident.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao said, “We hope the Philippines will keep its promise, earnestly abide by the preliminary agreement it has reached with China, and not take actions that could complicate the situation so as to work with us to jointly manage and control the maritime situation.” China has been at odds with many other countries in the Asia-Pacific for years over its sweeping maritime claims, including almost all of the South China Sea, a strategic and resource-rich waterway. Beijing is rapidly expanding its military and has become increasingly assertive in pursuing its territorial claims , giving rise to more frequent confrontations, primarily with the Philippines, though it is also involved in longtime territorial disputes with Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. U.S. Ambassador MaryKay Carlson said on the social media platform X that the United States stands with the Philippines “in condemning the China coast guard’s dangerous maneuvers near Sabina Shoal that endangered lives and caused damage” to the two Philippine vessels. “We are committed to supporting the rights of our friends, partners, allies under international law,” the statement said. A 2016 arbitration ruling by a United Nations tribunal invalidated Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea, but China did not participate in the proceedings and rejected the ruling. ___ Gomez reported from Manila, Philippines.

        "text": "A view of the Kremlin towers and Ivan the Great cathedral in Moscow on May 7, 2024. Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images CNN — The United States on Friday unveiled a massive tranche of sanctions in the latest effort to target Russia’s war machine and President Joe Biden announced additional aid for Kyiv as the war in Ukraine continues. The sanctions from the US Treasury and State Departments hit nearly 400 people and entities both in and outside Russia, including China. The sanctions – unveiled ahead of Ukrainian Independence Day – specifically target those supporting the Russian supply chain and defense base, as well as those helping Moscow to evade current sanctions. In a further show of support for Ukraine, Biden on Friday announced a new aid package that includes air defense missiles and counter-drone equipment. “When Russia’s senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country,” Biden wrote in a lengthy statement. “Today, it is still a free country. And the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free, sovereign, and independent country.” Biden, who spoke Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that for two and a half years, the Ukrainian people had “repelled Russia’s vicious onslaught, including retaking more than half of the territory Russian forces seized in the initial days of the war” and had “remained unbowed in the face of Russia’s heinous war crimes and atrocities.” “And day after day, they have defended the values that unite people across both of our nations and around the world—including independence,” Biden wrote. “That is why I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid for Ukraine today.” In addition to air defense equipment, the package includes anti-armor missiles and ammunition. “Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict,” he wrote. “The independent people of Ukraine will prevail—and the United States, our Allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of the way.” “We continue to support Ukraine’s fight for their independence, and independence that that they have had to defend pretty mightily here over the last two and a half years,” National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told reporters Friday morning. “And so, I suspect that as we officially mark their Independence Day … you’ll see that we will back up that philosophical support for their independence with more tangible support as well, including in particular more security assistance coming to Ukraine to help them as they defend themselves.” ‘Enduring commitment’ Friday’s slew of sanctions – which Biden called “part of our enduring commitment to hold Russia accountable for its aggression” – specifically crack down on a number of Chinese-based companies. The US and its European partners have expressed strong concern about Beijing’s support for Russia’s war economy and its export of dual-use items for use in the war in Ukraine. July’s NATO Summit declaration called Beijing “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine” and warned that China “cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.” US officials said they had warned their Chinese counterparts about the risk of supporting Moscow’s war effort. A State Department fact sheet said it remains “concerned by the magnitude of dual-use goods exports from the PRC to Russia,” using the acronym for China’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China. “Russia continues to leverage sanctions evasion and circumvention networks” to get microelectronics and machine tools “which it uses to make weapons,” it said. “Imports from the PRC are filling critical gaps in Russia’s defense production cycle, thereby enabling it to produce weapons, ramp up defense production, and bolster its military-industrial base.” “Today, the Department is also designating several PRC-based entities that have supplied goods supporting Russia’s war effort, including ones responsible for developing, producing, and supplying manufacturing equipment to entities based in Russia,” the fact sheet said. Treasury said it is targeting “numerous transnational networks, including those involved in procuring ammunition and military materiel for Russia, facilitating sanctions evasion for Russian oligarchs through offshore trust and corporate formation services, evading sanctions imposed on Russia’s cyber actors, laundering gold for a sanctioned Russian gold company, and supporting Russia’s military-industrial base by procuring sensitive and critical items such as advanced machine tools and electronic components.” It is “also targeting Russian financial technology companies that provide necessary software and IT solutions for Russia’s financial sector,” the press release said. At the same time, the State Department “is targeting entities and individuals involved in Russia’s future energy, metals, and mining production and exports; sanctions evasion; Russia’s military-industrial base, including armed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) production, Belarusian support for Russia’s war effort, and air logistics entities; additional subsidiaries of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom; and malign actors involved in the attempted, forcible ‘re-education’ of Ukraine’s children,” the Treasury Department press release said. The new round of sanctions come as Ukraine has launched an audacious incursion into Russia’s Kursk region that has left Moscow on the back foot for the first time in months. On Tuesday, Ukrainian military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said troops had advanced up to 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) through Russian defenses since the start of their surprise assault, capturing 93 settlements. Kirby said Friday that “it’s too soon to know whether what’s going on in Kursk … the potential impact that that could have in terms of escalation, but it is something that we remain concerned about.” This story has been updated with additional details.",

The Gao Brothers are known for their provocative sculptures, which critique the founder of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong, and his regime. Gao Zhen left China two years ago to live permanently in the United States, but had been visiting family when he was taken by authorities in Hebei province, his brother said in a post on Facebook. Chinese authorities have not responded to the allegations by Gao Qiang, who said about 30 police officers stormed the brothers’ art studio in Sanhe City on 26 August. He added that they had confiscated several artworks in addition to detaining Mr Gao. Since the 1980s, the brothers have been drawing international acclaim for works such as Mao’s Guilt, a bronze statue of the former Communist dictator kneeling remorsefully. Other works include The Execution of Christ, a statue depicting Jesus facing down a firing squad of Maos, and Miss Mao, a collection of statues of Mao with large breasts and protruding noses. Mao Zedong, often called Chairman Mao, helped found Communist China in 1949 and led it through a tumultuous period in the 1960s and 1970s known as the Cultural Revolution, in which more than a million people are believed to have died. During this period, the Gao Brothers' father was labelled a class enemy and dragged off to a place that was “not a prison, not a police station, but something else”, where he died, Gao Zhen told The New York Times in 2009. Reuters The brothers' Miss Mao pieces are among their most well-known sculptures Spoofing or insulting China's revolutionary \"heroes and martyrs\" was made a crime in 2021, as part of a newly amended criminal code, under a campaign by China’s leader, Xi Jinping. It carries a penalty of up to three years' imprisonment. For most of his career Mr Gao had been able to escape serious punishment from the Chinese authorities - often by choosing to hold secret or invite-only exhibitions. However in 2022, Gao Zhen decided to emigrate to New York, where he held permanent residency. This was because his son, who is an American citizen, was reaching school age and also because of the “deteriorating environment in China”, according to his brother Gao Qiang. Several prominent Chinese artists and creatives have written an open letter calling on authorities to release Mr Gao. \"Today, the Sanhe police department seems to see Gao Zhen's artistic works as evidence of crime, repeating the persecution of the Cultural Revolution,\" the letter said.

Analysts believe China would want to sound out Vietnam’s newly minted Communist Party chief To Lam over the country’s foreign policy front and also to promote President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road” projects in Vietnam such as the Lao Cai - Hanoi - Hai Phong railway project among others. Observers say the timing of the trip is crucial to note, given that it’s coming soon after Washington’s decision to classify Hanoi as a “non-market economy”, even if the visit was likely planned in advance. The decision on August 2 by the US Commerce Department to continue to classify Vietnam as a “non-market economy” (NME) sparked great disappointment from the Vietnamese especially after a period of tightening ties between Hanoi and Washington.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading An upgrade to market economy status would have made Vietnamese exports to the US significantly cheaper, according to experts. “Hanoi is clearly angered by the decision,” said Professor Zachary Abuza from the National War College in Washington, adding that he was expecting Chinese leaders to capitalise on hurt feelings. “They are always whispering in the ears of the Vietnamese that the United States cannot be trusted and that the country should remain committed to its socialist foreign policy,” he told CNA. Related: Vietnam President To Lam takes top job as Communist Party chief At the same time, Beijing will take the opportunity to evaluate Mr Lam’s leadership, Mr Abuza added. “To Lam has made multiple visits to China and is a known quantity to the Chinese leadership. China obviously wants to sound him out and make sure that there will be foreign policy continuity going forward,” he said. WARM BUT “SCEPTICAL” WELCOME Mr Lam’s three-day trip began on Sunday with his arrival in Guangzhou, his first overseas state visit since becoming the new Vietnamese Communist Party chief earlier this month. He took over the party reins on August 3, following the death of Nguyen Phu Trong on July 19. Notably, Mr Trong also chose China for his first state visit when he assumed the party role in 2011. After he flew to Beijing on Sunday evening, Mr Lam met Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. He inspected a military parade outside the Great Hall of the People before meeting with Mr Xi. Inside the state building near Tiananmen Square, the two leaders signed cooperation agreements. During their discussions, President Xi highlighted the importance of the relationship between the two ruling communist parties, urging China and Vietnam to \"uphold the original spirit of friendship, maintain traditional ties, and deepen the strategically important Sino-Vietnamese shared community of destiny.\" Congratulating Mr Lam on his new role, Mr Xi expressed confidence that by continuing their \"common endeavour of promoting the cause of world socialism,\" both countries would see their paths \"widen.\" In response, Mr Lam lauded Mr Xi for steering China into becoming a \"strong and prosperous country,\" and praised his efforts in advancing Beijing's \"role in peace, cooperation, and development in the region and the world\".

(Photo: Pool Photo via AP/Andres Martinez Casares) Mr Lam’s visit to China has been warmly portrayed by Chinese state media, which highlighted the enduring ties and shared history between the two socialist nations. Reporting on the Vietnamese leader's visit to Guangzhou, Chinese state media agency Xinhua prominently highlighted his statement that Vietnam regarded its relationship with China as a top foreign policy priority and remained committed to maintaining the enduring friendship established by past generations of leaders from both nations. State-owned newspaper The Global Times praised the camaraderie between the two nations in a commentary, stating that their robust ties will lead to increased economic collaboration benefiting both populations. The mutual goodwill displayed by China and Vietnam, the newspaper added, sets a positive example for the entire region. But some Chinese netizens on Weibo remained sceptical about the visit. \"(China) should be careful not to offer too many incentives to Vietnam, as it might later shift its alignment (towards the West),\" said one Weibo user. Commenting on ongoing disputes in the South China Sea, another Weibo user remarked: \"(Vietnam) should drop its claims on the disputed waters; only then will relations with China be smooth.\" WHAT VIETNAM WANTS China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner, with two-way trade accounting for US$173.3 billion last year. On Monday, both leaders signed 14 deals ranging from cross-border railway infrastructure projects to exports of various goods including coconuts, durians and crocodiles, according to media reports. Vietnamese officials previously said rail links connecting the countries would be high on the agenda when the leaders meet. Chinese manufacturers have been expanding operations to Vietnam amid trade tensions with the US. Related: China eyes plan to connect Southeast Asian rail links Vietnam president wants maritime disputes with China to be well managed Emeritus professor Damien Kingsbury from Deakin University’s School of Humanities and Social Sciences told CNA that it was currently an “opportune time” for Vietnam’s new Communist Party chief “to deepen trade and investment ties” with its neighbour, also the world’s second-largest economy. “Vietnam is clearly looking to expand its economy with whoever is prepared to be a willing partner,” Mr Kingsbury said, adding that Hanoi was expected to build on existing economic relations by “increasing trade and Chinese investment” in the Southeast Asian country. “There may also be discussion about a free trade zone along the border, or some lessening of barriers to trade and investment in their common border region,” he added. Dr Hoang Viet from Ho Chi Minh City University of Law said that even if the US had recognised Vietnam as a NME, Hanoi will still want to continue to promote economic and trade relations with Beijing at a deeper level. “However, Vietnam does not only want to do so with the Chinese market, it also wants to increase economic and trade relations with other important partners such as the US, EU, Japan etc,” he added, saying it’s part of the country’s policy of multilateralisation and diversification. Mr Lam’s visit to China is also designed to stress Vietnam's commitment to its established foreign policies while showcasing his administration’s focus on improving economic prospects amid recent domestic political instability, analysts say. In this context, experts believe he is seeking to solidify his political standing at home in Vietnam following a period of leadership turbulence, which saw the ouster of several high-ranking party officials including former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong, deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh and the National Assembly chairman Vuong Dinh Hue, over corruption allegations. Mr Kingsbury noted the significance of improved relations between the two neighbours. “Strengthening relations with China could not only mend ties with Laos and potentially Cambodia (for Vietnam) but also open opportunities for closer relations with Thailand, which could enhance exports and investment,” he said.

(Duong Van Giang/VNA via AP) International relations expert Chong Ja Ian of the National University of Singapore said both sides are expected to discuss a range of issues, such as management of tributaries to the Mekong and cross-border trade. “The visit signals the continued valuing of Vietnam’s relationship with PRC (People’s Republic of China), and a desire to have smooth ties even if differences remain,” he added. Emeritus professor Carlyle Thayer from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, drew reference to Mr Lam’s first China visit as Vietnam’s Communist Party chief, like his predecessor Trong did. “(Like Trong), To Lam is signalling that Vietnam is acknowledging China’s pre-eminent role as a socialist country (and) that intra-party relations is the most important bilateral conduit for relations,” added Prof Thayer. He believes Mr Lam is also likely to seek assurances that China remains committed to the proposals made between former General Secretary Trong and Chinese President Xi, including the revision of financial regulations to facilitate currency exchanges between the renminbi and the dong. In addition to his visit to China, Mr Lam is scheduled to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York this September. Professor Abuza from the National War College noted that the Vietnamese leader may meet with US President Joe Biden during his visit. The back-to-back visits to the two superpowers underscore Vietnam's flexible foreign policy, known as \"bamboo diplomacy,\" in navigating complex geopolitical challenges. “Vietnam’s bamboo diplomacy is a metaphor not a strategy… The ends of Vietnam’s foreign policy are to remain independent and self-reliant by diversifying and multilateralising its foreign relations. Bamboo diplomacy – the ways – are to be firm on principle such as defending national sovereignty – but flexible in practices.” said Professor Thayer. WHAT CHINA WANTS Beijing, on the other hand, was not only willing but would also be highly motivated to advance key projects under its Belt and Road Initiative, such as the Lao Cai-Hanoi-Hai Phong railway. The new train lines are expected to link up with the recently built routes extending China’s railway network to the Vietnamese border, facilitating imports of Chinese industrial goods and materials, experts said. Exports to China reached $27.8 billion in the first half of the year, a 5.3 per cent increase from the previous year, according to the Vietnamese General Statistics Office. Concurrently, Vietnam imported $67 billion worth of goods from China, up 34.7%, resulting in a trade deficit of $39.2 billion, a 67.9 per cent rise. The Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade subsequently reported that bilateral trade between the two countries surpassed $100 billion during that period, solidifying China's position as Vietnam's largest trading partner. “(President) Lam will be looking to build a more positive relationship (by) increasing trade and Chinese investment in Vietnam… There may also be discussion about a free trade zone along the border, or some (sort of) lessening of barriers to trade and investment in their common border region, ”  said Prof Kingsbury of Deakin University. TERRITORIAL DISPUTES Mr Lam’s inaugural state visit to China also follows weeks of political posturing between Hanoi and Beijing over competing claims in the South China Sea. Earlier this month, the Philippine and Vietnamese coast guards held their first joint drills, amid ongoing territorial disputes with each other and, more critically, with China, which claims nearly the entire South China Sea. But ongoing territorial disputes are unlikely to impede the strengthening of bilateral relations between China and Vietnam this time round, according to analysts. “Joint patrols among the Vietnamese Coast Guard and others of ASEAN countries are completely normal. The Vietnamese Coast Guard has also conducted joint patrols with the Chinese Coast Guard many times, therefore, these joint patrols should be understood as activities to promote cooperative relations among Vietnam and many friendly countries,” said Dr Viet. Philippine Coast Guard personnel wave Vietnamese and Filipino flags to welcome the Vietnam Coast Guard (VCG) ship, CSB 8002, in Manila, Philippines, Monday, Aug 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Joeal Calupitan) Professor Abuza seconded that, adding that ongoing disputes in the South China Sea were unlikely to affect current relations between Hanoi and Beijing. “I imagine both sides will downplay this,” Mr Abuza said. “For Vietnamese leaders, the South China Sea (situation) is something they just don't want to deal with as they really can't stop Chinese aggression which makes them look weak in the eyes of their public – and China never picks on multiple countries at the same time, for fear of turning it into a multilateral issue. “They (Beijing) would prefer to deal with it as a bilateral issue because of their overwhelming asymmetry in power.” Source: CNA/lg(ht) Newsletter Week in Review Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Two residents of Zhoushi Town, about 80 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of Shanghai, were hit by a falling high-voltage power line and electrocuted on Monday, according to state broadcaster CCTV. They are the only known deaths thus far to be caused by Bebinca, which swept over the megacity of Shanghai and neighboring provinces on Monday, flooding roads with water and broken tree branches and knocking out power to some homes. One resident of Shanghai’s Chongming Island was also reported injured by a falling tree. More than 414,000 people were evacuated ahead of the powerful winds and torrential rain. Schools were closed and people were advised to stay indoors, while flights, ferries and train services were suspended. The typhoon, which weather authorities described as the strongest to hit Shanghai since at least 1949 , weakened as it moved inland. Around 2 a.m. on Tuesday, it was downgraded to a tropical storm.

In a phone call with U.S. diplomats in China, Beijing said it “will not continue to process cases at any stage” other than those cases covered by an exception clause. The embassy is seeking clarification in writing from China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs, the U.S. State Department said Thursday. “We understand there are hundreds of families still pending completion of their adoption, and we sympathize with their situation,” the State Department said. At a daily briefing Thursday, Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said China is no longer allowing foreign adoptions of the country’s children, with the only exception for blood relatives to adopt a child or a stepchild. She didn’t explain the decision other than to say that it was in line with the spirit of relevant international conventions.

A suspect is in custody. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa expressed condolences and noted that the attack occurred despite Tokyo’s requests for caution and enhanced safety as China marks a key anniversary of its war with Japan. The student was stabbed on Wednesday about 200 meters (220 yards) from the gate of the Shenzhen Japanese School, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said in a daily briefing. Lin said the attacker was arrested on the spot and the case was still under investigation. In a statement released Wednesday, Shenzhen police said a 44-year-old man with the surname Zhong had been taken into custody in connection with a knifing on a minor. No motive for the attack was immediately clear. Kamikawa noted that Japan had asked China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for increased security around Japanese schools ahead of the Sept. 18 anniversary of the Mukden Incident in 1931, which China marks as the beginning of Japanese invasion of Manchuria, now northeast China.

Kamikawa said she had also advised Japanese schools in China to review their safety measures, and requested Beijing to provide details of the killing and do its utmost to prevent similar attacks on Japanese citizens. Lin on Thursday expressed condolences and sadness over the boy’s death. “Our hearts go out to his family,” he said, adding that China will provide necessary assistance. He identified the boy as a Japanese citizen with parents from Japan and China. Following an earlier knife attack at a bus stop for a Japanese school, the ministry has urged Japanese school operators in China to review their safety measures, said Masashi Mizobuchi, the ministry’s assistant press secretary, and officials will discuss how they can better secure the safety of Japanese students. On June 24th, a knife attack at a school bus stop for a Japanese school in the southeastern city of Suzhou killed a Chinese national who was trying to stop the attacker and injured a Japanese mother and her child. Lin denied any link between the two incidents, saying “similar cases may happen in any country” and denied the attacks will harm China’s relations with Japan. “China and Japan are in communication on the case. We always welcome people from all countries, including Japan, to come to China for traveling, studying, business or living,” Lin said, pledging to take effective measures to protect their safety while in China. “We believe individual cases will not affect the exchanges and cooperation between China and Japan,” he said. While the news of the Japanese boy’s death was not on reported in Chinese media Thursday, people posted condolences on the social media platform Weibo and condemned the attack. In an email sent to Japanese citizens living in China, the Japanese Embassy warned residents to be vigilant and take precautions, citing knife attacks in recent months. The Japanese Consulate in Guangzhou, which is responsible for Shenzhen, called for measures to prevent such incidents.

Temperatures were already at 30 degrees Celsius (roughly 86 Fahrenheit) by 9 a.m. during Friday's outdoor opening ceremony in a mock Alpine square, but were closer to freezing point inside the building. The building has a skiing area of 90,000 square meters or 9 hectares. Incorporating other facilities likes shops, hotels, and a still-unopened water park the construction area extends to 350,000 square meters. The vast resort is one of many large expensive projects developed in recent decades in Shanghai's once sparsely-populated Pudong district Image: CFOTO/picture alliance The festivities marked the end of a difficult teething and test period for the facility.

Industry expansion amid Winter Olympics Years in the making, once scheduled to open in 2019 according to Chinese media, the vast resort is part of a state-supported winter sports investment drive rooted partly in the country hosting the last Winter Olympics in 2022 and also in a more general bid to cater to the recreational wishes of an expanding middle class.

The top legislative body on Friday approved proposals to raise the statutory retirement age from 50 to 55 for women in blue-collar jobs, and from 55 to 58 for females in white-collar jobs. Men will see an increase from 60 to 63. China's current retirement ages are among the lowest in the world. According to the plan passed on Friday, the change will set in from 1 January 2025, with the respective retirement ages raised every few months over the next 15 years, said Chinese state media. Retiring before the statutory age will not be allowed, state news agency Xinhua reported, although people can delay their retirement by no more than three years. Starting 2030, employees will also have to make more contributions to the social security system in order to receive pensions. By 2039, they would have to clock 20 years of contributions to access their pensions. The state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said in 2019 that the country's main state pension fund will run out of money by 2035 - and that was an estimate before the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit China's economy hard. The plan to raise retirement ages and adjust the pension policy was based on \"a comprehensive assessment of the average life expectancy, health conditions, the population structure, the level of education and workforce supply in China,\" Xinhua reported. But the announcement has drawn some scepticism and discontent on the Chinese internet. \"In the next 10 years, there will be another bill that will delay retirement until we are 80,\" one user wrote on a Chinese social media site Weibo. \"What a miserable year! Middle-aged workers are faced with pay cuts and raised retirement ages. Those who are unemployed find it increasingly difficult to get jobs,\" another chimed in. Others said they had anticipated the announcement. \"This was expected, there isn't much to discuss. \"Men in most European countries retire when they are 65 or 67, while women do at 60. This is going to be the trend in our country as well,\" one Weibo user said. China's huge population has fallen for a second consecutive year in 2023 as its birth rate continues to decline. Meanwhile, its average life expectancy has risen to 78.2 years , officials said earlier this year. According to the World Health Organization, almost a third of China's population - about 402 million people - will be aged over 60 by 2040, up from 254 million in 2019. A demographic crisis unfolding A slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in China, our China correspondent Laura Bicker wrote earlier this year. China's pension pot is running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly. Over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population. So who will look after them? The answer depends on where you go and who you ask.

        "text": "China's long-range missile test sparks concerns 25 September 2024 Share Save Kelly Ng & Frances Mao BBC News Share Save Getty Images The US says China has more than 500 nuclear warheads in its arsenal - including these intercontinental ballistic missiles seen at a 2019 military parade China says it carried out a rare test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into international waters, sparking protests from neighbouring countries. The launch on Wednesday – its first in more than 40 years - was “routine” and not aimed at any country or target, according to Beijing. Chinese media reported the government also gave “relevant countries” notice. But Japan said it had not received a warning and expressed concerns, along with Australia and New Zealand. The launch contributes to tensions across the Indo-Pacific region, with analysts saying it highlights China's increased long-range nuclear capabilities. The US warned last year that China has built up its nuclear arsenal as part of a defence upgrade. An intercontinental ballistic missile can travel more 5,500km - putting China within striking range of the US mainland and Hawaii. But Beijing’s arsenal is still estimated at less than a fifth of the size of the US's and Russia’s, and China has long maintained that its nuclear maintainance is only about deterrence. On Wednesday, Beijing announced that the long-range missile was fired at 08:44 local time (04:44 GMT). It carried a dummy warhead and landed in the designated area - believed to be in the South Pacific. Beijing's defence ministry added the test launch was \"routine\" and part of its \"annual training\". But analysts said China was last known to have test-fired an ICBM internationally in the 1980s. Typically, it tests internally - having previously fired ICBMs west into the Taklamakan Desert in the Xinjiang region. “This sort of testing is not unusual for other countries, including the United States, but is for China,” nuclear missile analyst Ankit Panda told the BBC. China’s “ongoing nuclear modernisation” already has resulted in substantial changes, he said. This launch now appears to also show a change in its approach. It has sparked immediate reaction from other countries. Japan said it had received “no notice” and expressed “serious concern” about Beijing’s military build-up. Meanwhile, Australia said the action was \"destabilising and raises the risk of miscalculation in the region” and that it had sought “an explanation” from Beijing. New Zealand called it “an unwelcome and concerning development”. Mr Panda said he doesn't believe China’s actions were primarily designed to send a political message - “but no doubt this will be a stark reminder to the region and to the US that nuclear dynamics in Asia are quickly changing”. Other analysts went further, saying it was another wake-up call for the US and its allies in the region. “To Washington, the message is that direct intervention in a conflict across the Taiwan Strait would involve the American homeland being vulnerable to attack,” said Leif-Eric Easley, an international relations professor at Ewha Women's University in South Korea. For US allies in Asia, the “provocative test… demonstrates China’s capabilities to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously,\" he added. \"Timing is everything,\" Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, wrote on X. \"[China's] statement claims the launch does not target any country, but there are high-levels of tension between China and Japan, Philippines, and of course perpetual tension with Taiwan.\" While the relationship between Beijing and Washington has improved in the past year, China's increasing assertiveness in the region remains a sticking point. Tensions have ramped up between China and the Phil i ppines as their ships have repeatedly collided in disputed waters. Last month, Japan scrambled fighter jets after it accused a Chinese spy plane of breaching its air space, a move that it called  \"utterly unacceptable\". Sabina Shoal: The new flashpoint between China and the Philippines What is Xi Jinping prepared to pay for Putin’s war? The US is quietly arming Taiwan to the teeth Beijing's relationship with self-governed Taiwan is another source of strain. Taiwan's defence ministry said earlier on Wednesday that China had been carrying out \"intensive\" missile firing and other drills recently. The same statement noted that it detected 23 Chinese military aircraft operating around Taiwan on \"long-range missions\". Beijing routinely sends ships and aircraft into Taiwanese waters and airspace, called a \"greyzone warfare\" tactic meant to normalise the incursions. In July, China suspended its nuclear arms control talks with Washington, in retaliation for the US's continued arms sales to Taiwan . The US last year warned of China's nuclear modernisation although its numbers still far short of Washington's.  The Pentagon estimated that China has more than 500 operational nuclear warheads in its arsenal, of which approximately 350 are ICBMs. The report projected that China will reach over 1,000 warheads by 2030; the US and Russia each say they possess more than 5,000 warheads. There also have been conflicts around the Chinese military’s Rocket Force , the elite unit managing its nuclear arsenal. An aggressive anti-corruption campaign led to the firing of two of its leaders last year. Asia China",

The official Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday reported that Zhang Xiaopeng, a top police official, attended a news conference at Dalian to release details of a “two-year investigation that uncovered a series of online gambling, match-fixing and bribery cases.” Xinhua said 120 matches in domestic leagues, 128 criminal suspects, and 41 clubs were implicated in the investigation. Of those banned, 38 were players and five were officials working for various clubs. Former Chinese internationals Jin Jingdao, Guo Tianyu, and Gu Chao were among those to receive life bans from the sport. Other players and officials were given shortened bans, including foreign players lured to China by the promise of high salaries.

The 2018 agreement, extended twice previously, was an attempt under Pope Francis to bridge long-standing differences over control of the church in China. There have been disagreements since, but they have so far not derailed the fragile rapprochement. “The two sides will maintain contact and dialogue following a constructive spirit and continue to advance the improvement of China-Vatican relations,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Tuesday while confirming the extension. The Vatican said that it “remains dedicated to furthering the respectful and constructive dialogue” with China, “in view of the further development of bilateral relations for the benefit of the Catholic Church in China and the Chinese people as a whole.” Francis has reached out to China during trips to Asia both this year and last year, repeating his desire to visit the country on a flight home from Singapore last month. The Vatican’s relations with China were severed more than seven decades ago when the Communist Party came to power.

        "text": "Family tells of 'relief' after 1924 climberâs foot found on Everest Image source, Jimmy Chin Tessa Wong and Flora Drury BBC News Published 11 October 2024 It was the call the family of a young British climber who went missing on Everest 100 years ago had given up hope of ever getting. Last month, a team of climbers filming a National Geographic documentary stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. This boot was believed to belong to Andrew Comyn \"Sandy\" Irvine, who disappeared while attempting to climb Everest in June 1924 with his partner George Mallory. What's more, it could potentially help solve one of mountaineering's biggest mysteries: whether or not the pair succeeded in becoming the first people to reach the summit, 29 years before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Well-known adventurer Jimmy Chin, who led the team for National Geographic, hailed the discovery of the boot - with a foot inside it - as a \"monumental and emotional moment\". But for Irvine's great-niece Julie Summers it was simply \"extraordinary\". \"I just froze.... We had all given up any hope any trace of him would be found,\" she told the BBC. A number of people have searched for Irvine's body over the years, partly because  the 22-year-old is said to have been carrying a camera with an undeveloped film inside, potentially with a photograph of the pair at the summit. Could the discovery of the boot be the first step to finding his body - and the camera? The family have now given a DNA sample to help confirm the foot is indeed Irvine - but the filmmaking team is fairly confident it belongs to the mountaineer. The sock found inside the boot has a name tag stitched into it with the words \"A.C. Irvine\". \"I mean, dude... there's a label on it,\" Chin, who is known for making Oscar-winning climbing documentary Free Solo alongside his wife, was quoted as saying in a National Geographic report , external . Image source, Jimmy Chin The team made the discovery as they descended the Central Rongbuk Glacier by the north face of Everest in September. Along the way, they found an oxygen bottle marked with the date 1933. An Everest expedition that year had found an item belonging to Irvine. Energised by this possible sign that Irvine's body could be nearby, the team searched the glacier for several days, before one of them saw the boot emerging from melting ice. It was a fortuitous find - they estimated the ice had only melted a week before their discovery. The foot has since been removed from the mountain because of concerns that birds were disturbing it, according to reports, and passed to the Chinese mountaineering authorities who govern the north face of Everest. For Irvine's descendants, the discovery has been emotional - especially in this, the centenary year of his disappearance. Summers had grown up hearing stories of her grandmother's adventurous, Oxford-educated younger brother, who they knew as \"Uncle Sandy\". \"My grandmother had a photo of him by her bed until the day she died,\" she recalled. \"She said he was a better man than anyone would ever be.\" Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Sandy Irvine, as he was popularly known, was 22 when he went missing Birkenhead-born Irvine was just 22 when he disappeared, the youngest member of an expedition that has intrigued the mountaineering world for a century. He and Mallory were last seen alive on 8 June 1924 as they set off for the peak. Mallory's body would not be found until 1999 by an American climber. In recent decades, the search for the climbers' remains has been mired in controversy amid suspicions that the bodies were moved , external . Summers has always dismissed those stories and suspicions, revealing her feeling of \"relief\" following the Chin's call that \"he was still there on the mountain\". But what if it could now be proved that Irvine and Mallory reached the summit, becoming the first to do so - an idea which, Summers acknowledged, would \"turn mountaineering history onto its head\"? \"It would be nice - we would all feel very proud,\" she said. \"But the family has always maintained the mystery, and the story of how far they got and how brave they were, was really what it was about.\" And anyway, she said, \"the only way we will ever know is if we find a picture in the camera he was believed to be carrying\". Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The last picture of Mallory (left) and Irvine (right) before they left for their climb in 1924 The search, she suspects, will now continue for that camera. \"I think it will be irresistible,\" she said. Whether it will be found remains to be seen. Chin, meanwhile, is hoping that the boot's discovery - \"a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground\" - will \"finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large\". For Summers, it is a chance to remind the world about a young man \"who took life and lived it\", embracing every opportunity - and above all, was \"having fun\". But perhaps surprisingly, she and her cousins are grateful the older generation were not here for this discovery. \"For them, Everest is his grave,\" she explained.

        "text": "The pact is part of a resolution to the four-year standoff at the contested border areas, India’s foreign ministry says. India and China have agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas that could lead to the resolution of a conflict that began in 2020, according to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. “Over the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomats and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other, and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the LAC in the India-China border leading to the disengagements and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in 2020,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in New Delhi on Monday, referring to the Line of Actual Control notional demarcation line between the two countries. The LAC is a 3,488km-long (2,167-mile) border in the Himalayas shared by the two Asian giants, with China claiming a considerably shorter portion. It separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India’s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety considering it part of its Tibet region, and the two fought a border war in 1962.  Misri did not specify whether the pact means the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed by the two countries along their disputed border in the northern Ladakh region since their armies clashed in 2020 in a significant escalation. There was no immediate comment from Beijing. The announcement was made on the eve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit, which involves China and other major developing economies. Local media reported that Modi could hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the event.    Ties between India and China deteriorated in July 2020 after a military clash killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese. It turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. India and China have withdrawn troops from some areas on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso Lake, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but continue to maintain extra troops as part of a multitier deployment. Top Indian and Chinese army commanders have held several rounds of talks since the military clash to discuss the disengagement of troops from areas of tension. Earlier this month, India’s army chief said New Delhi wants the status on the frontier in the western Himalayas to be restored to its pre-April 2020 position when the standoff began and the situation will remain sensitive until then. The two sides have resolved the “low-hanging fruits” and now need to address difficult situations, General Upendra Dwivedi said, adding that there was “positive signalling” from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries. India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday said the pact is “a product of very patient and very persevering diplomacy” and that it will resume military patrolling the way it was before the 2020 clash. “Hopefully, we will be able to come back to peace and tranquillity. And that was our major concern because we always said that if you disturb peace and tranquillity, how do you expect the rest of the relationship to go forward,” Jaishankar told India’s NDTV news channel.

Social Media/Reuters CNN — Eight people were killed and 17 others injured in a stabbing attack on a college campus in eastern China on Saturday, police said — the latest in a recent spate of attacks that has shaken a nation long used to low rates of violent crime. The attack took place around 6:30 p.m at the Wuxi Vocational Institute of Arts and Technology in the city of Yixing, Jiangsu province, according to a police statement. Video verified by CNN shows several people lying motionless on the ground, some of them surrounded by onlookers as screams are heard in the background. A suspect detained at the scene was a recent graduate who was motivated by “failing (an) exam, not receiving a graduation certificate, and dissatisfaction with internship compensation,” police said. An investigation is ongoing. The attack is the latest mass casualty incident to hit China — a country of 1.4 billion that has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance.

State media said \"several students and adults were injured and fell to the ground\", and several people were hospitalised, but a police statement later said there were no life-threatening injuries. The driver of the vehicle - identified as a white SUV - was caught by parents and school security officers and handed over to police. This is the third attack on a crowd in China in a week, and it has fuelled concerns about public safety. \"About a dozen people were hit, some of them seriously, but luckily the ambulance came very quickly,\" Mr Zhu, a parent of one of the children at the school, told the BBC. He said he heard the attack just as he was leaving the school premises, after dropping off his eight-year-old. \"Six or seven parents had forced the car of the person who hit others to stop. Even the security guard was knocked down. The guard is quite old, in his 70s or 80s, and couldn’t do much,\" he said. The school has been identified as the Yong’an Primary School in Dingcheng District in Hunan province. Video from the scene posted on a private WeChat account showed some children lying on the ground, while others, carrying school bags, were fleeing in panic. Another video filmed soon after the incident showed an angry pedestrian hitting the SUV with a snow shovel while the driver was still inside. The driver is then seen stepping out of the other side of the vehicle, only to be surrounded by bystanders who started beating him with sticks. Similar attacks in recent days have sparked discussions online about the social phenomenon of \" taking revenge on society \", where individuals act on personal grievances by attacking strangers. On Saturday eight people were killed and 17 others were wounded in a knife attack at a vocational school in eastern China. Police said the suspect was a 21-year-old former student at the school who was meant to graduate this year but had failed the exam. Before that, on 12 November, at least 35 people were killed in a car attack in southern China ,  when a man ran into groups of people exercising on a sports track. And in October, in Shanghai, a man killed three people and wounded 15 others in stabbing at a supermarket. According to police records, there have been 19 incidents of indiscriminate violence in China this year in which the perpetrator was not known to the victims. Sixty-three people have been killed and 166 injured in these attacks. This is a sharp increase on previous years - 16 killed and 40 injured in 2023, for instance. While the incidents are still sporadic and rare, they are high-profile. And the videos that often circulate soon after on social media have prompted concern and fear among people. \"These are symptoms of a society with a lot of pent-up grievances,\" Lynette Ong, distinguished professor of Chinese politics at Canada's University of Toronto, told AFP. \"Some people resort to giving up. Others, if they're angry, want to take revenge.\" A slowing economy, high youth unemployment and a property crisis that has hurt savings have led to increasing uncertainty about the future among Chinese people. Ong said, in the circumstacnes, violent attacks were the \"negative side of the same coin\". President Xi Jinping has ordered local officials to ensure the safety and \"social stability\" of communities and to “strictly prevent extreme cases”. Officials are keen to show they are acting quickly. They worry that such a high number of casualties in a single year could raise questions about China's safety record, further alarming people and even discouraging tourism. The Communist Party has rapidly expanded surveillance in recent years and after the car attack last week in Zhuhai, there have been further orders to deploy local officials and community workers to try to prevent unrest.

Police say a man crashed his car into a stadium in Zhuhai on Monday where he ran down groups of people exercising on the sports track. The \"serious and vicious attack\" also injured 45 people - among them elderly and children, local media report. Police say the 62-year-old driver, identified as a Mr Fan, appeared to have acted out of unhappiness over a divorce settlement. Reuters Mourners visiting the stadium on Tuesday He was arrested as he tried to flee the Zhuhai Sports Center and is in a coma due to self-inflicted wounds, police said in a statement. The incident has sparked a national outcry in China, where President Xi Jinping vowed \"severe punishment\" for the perpetrator, and called for \"all-out efforts\" to treat the injured. When horror hits China, the first instinct is shut it down Details of those who were killed have not been disclosed by authorities yet, but mourners and members of the public had begun laying flowers and other tributes outside the stadium on Tuesday. The venue - featuring a running track loop - had been a popular exercise ground for locals. Witnesses told Chinese media it appeared Mr Fan had deliberately run people down. One man named Mr Chen told Caixin news magazine he and his walking group had just completed a lap of the stadium when a car charged towards them at high speed, \"knocking down many people\". Another person at the scene told Caixin: \"It drove in a loop and people were hurt in all areas of the running track.\" According to local police, who released a statement on Tuesday, they said their initial investigations suggested Mr Fan's actions were triggered by a property dispute following his divorce. He is still in a coma and so has not been questioned, police said. The attack may be the deadliest act of random public violence in China in recent decades. A number have been reported this year including a mass stabbing and firearms attack in Shandong in February which killed at least 21 people. That incident was heavily censored by Chinese authorities. BBC/ ED LAWRENCE Police forces outside the stadium on Tuesday night Reports of Monday's attack were already being restricted online on Tuesday - with several videos taken by witnesses at the scene removed from Chinese social media platforms. But some footage still circulating online showed dozens of people lying on the ground and being attended to by paramedics and bystanders. In China it is common for censors to quickly take down social media videos which are linked to high-profile incidences of crime. BBC journalists reporting from the stadium at Zhuhai on Tuesday were also harassed and told to stop filming. China has seen a spate of violent attacks on members of the public in recent months that have been reported in local media to varying degrees. In October, a knife attack at a top school in Beijing injured five people, while in September, a man went on a stabbing spree at a supermarket in Shanghai , killing three people and injuring several others. Also in September, a 10-year-old Japanese student died a day after he was stabbed near his school in southern China. Following Monday's car attack, Japan's embassy warned its nationals living in the country to avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public. The incident in Zhuhai has also taken place during heightened security in the city, which is hosting a major military airshow this week. The attack on Monday night took place 40km (24 miles) from where the high-profile Airshow China kicked off on Tuesday. China is showcasing its newest warplanes and attack drones at the show, which top Russian defence official and former defence minister Sergei Shoigu is expected to attend. Several entrances and exits to the sports centre were closed during the airshow to facilitate \"control\", the centre's management said on Tuesday. Additional reporting by Kelly Ng.

Dong Yuyu, 62, who has been detained since 2022, was active in academic and journalism circles in the US and Japan and met regularly with foreign diplomats. He was having lunch with a Japanese diplomat in Beijing when he was arrested by police. At the time of his detention, Dong had been a senior staff member of the Guangming Daily, one of the five major newspapers linked to the Chinese Communist Party. In February 2022, Dong was arrested while having lunch with a Japanese diplomat the day after the Winter Olympics ended in Beijing, at a restaurant where he had often met foreign friends. The diplomat was also detained - then released several hours later amid protests from the Japanese government. Dong met regularly with other journalists and foreign diplomats as part of his job. His family said in a statement that according to a court judgement, two other Japanese diplomats Dong met with were named as \"agents of an espionage organisation\", which is the Japanese embassy. \"We are shocked that the Chinese authorities would blatantly deem a foreign embassy an 'espionage organization'\", said his family's statement. “Today’s verdict is a grave injustice not only to Yuyu and his family but also to every freethinking Chinese journalist and every ordinary Chinese committed to friendly engagement with the world,” they added. The Beijing court where Dong was sentenced on Friday had a strong security presence, Reuters reported, as journalists were asked to leave and a diplomat said they were not allowed to attend the hearing. “In the past, the Chinese court system has selected Western holidays to release news as it is a time when the public is focused on other matters,” the US National Press Club said in a statement on Tuesday, ahead of Dong's sentencing on Thanksgiving night in the US. While Dong’s trial had been completed in July 2023, he was held with no verdict and barred from seeing his family, the press club said. Rights groups and advocates have criticised his conviction and called for him to be released. \"Chinese authorities must reverse this unjust verdict, and protect the right of journalists to work freely and safely in China,\"  Beh Lih Yi, Asia programme manager at the Committe to Protect Journalists told Reuters. \"Dong Yuyu should be reunited with his family immediately.\" Dong joined the Guangming Daily after graduating from Peking University's law school in 1987. In 1989, he was one of tens of thousands of students who participated in the Tiananmen Square protests. He was later sentenced to hard labour, but kept his job at the newspaper, according to a family statement. He eventually rose to become deputy head of the editorial department, and was among the most pro-reform voices at Guangming Daily, the statement added. A Nieman fellow at Harvard University in 2007, Dong had also written several articles for the New York Times and was previously a visiting fellow and professor at several Japanese universities.

Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung are on their way back to the US, a spokesperson for the National Security Council (NSC) said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first time in many years,\" the statement said. The exchange was reportedly months in the making, and included the release of three Chinese citizens in US custody, Chinese authorities confirmed on Wednesday. \"Through the unremitting efforts of the Chinese Government, the three Chinese citizens wrongfully detained by the United States have returned to their motherland safely,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a statement Wednesday. \"China has always been firmly opposed to the suppression and persecution of Chinese nationals by the United States for political purposes,\" she added. President Biden raised the issue of Americans wrongfully detained in China directly with President Xi Jinping earlier this month when the two met during the Apec summit in Peru, according to an American official familiar with the negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also urged for their return during his visit to China in August. \"Thanks to this Administration’s efforts and diplomacy with the PRC, all of the wrongfully detained Americans in the PRC are home,\" the NSC spokesperson said. The swap was first reported by Politico. Mr Swidan, 48, had been detained since 2012 and was facing the death penalty after a conviction for narcotics trafficking. Swidan denied the charges and the State Department classified him as wrongfully detained, previously raising concerns about his health. Mark Li, 60, had been held in China since September 2016 on what activists say were trumped-up spying charges. John Leung, 78, has lead several pro-Beijing groups in the US. He was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to life in prison on espionage charges two years later. According to the New York Times, multiple US officials said they had discussed releasing Chinese citizen Xu Yanjun, 42, who was convicted in the US on espionage charges two years ago and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Xu was first Chinese government intelligence officer ever to be extradited to the US to stand trial, the Justice Department said. As of Wednesday morning, Xu was listed in the Bureau of Prisons system as \"not in BOP custody\". The deal marks a diplomatic win for Biden in the final months of his presidency. It follows the release of another American considered wrongfully detained: David Lin, a pastor who had been jailed in China from 2006 until his release in September. During his four years in the White House, Biden oversaw the release of more than 70 Americans, including from Russia, Venezuela and Iran. On Wednesday, the US also lowered its travel advisory level for mainland China to Level 2: Exercise increased caution. With additional reporting by Koh Ewe China United States China-US relations",

The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications. The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology. China’s Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof. “China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China’s technological progress,” Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday. “I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,” Lin said. The minerals sourced in China are used in computer chips, cars and other products China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony , which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite. Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report. The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials. China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology. China says it’s protecting itself from US trade restrictions After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called “entity list” subject to strict export controls, China’s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China’s “rights and interests.” Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington’s latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security. China’s government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China’s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology. Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, “abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.” “Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,” it said in a statement. The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies. “U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China’s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,” it said. The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources. The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

Issued on: 28/11/2024 - 09:05 Modified: 28/11/2024 - 10:53 2 min Top Chinese military official Miao Hua had been removed from office and is suspected of \"serious violations of discipline\", Beijing said Thursday © Kim Won Jin / AFP/File The ruling Communist Party has \"decided to suspend Miao Hua from duty pending investigation\", Wu Qian, a spokesman for Beijing's defence ministry, told a press briefing. Wu did not provide further details about the charges against Miao, an admiral and a member of Beijing's powerful Central Military Commission (CMC). But \"serious violations of discipline\" are commonly used by authorities in China as a euphemism for corruption. Miao sat on the CMC alongside five other men -- including President Xi Jinping at the top -- and headed its most important office, the Political Work Department. Miao has been described as a \"close ally\" of Xi and a \"trusted interlocutor\" between the military and the party by Lyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society. Beijing has deepened a crackdown on alleged graft in the armed forces over the past year, with Xi this month ordering the military to stamp out corruption and strengthen its \"war-preparedness\". The intensity of the anti-graft drive has been partially driven by fears that endemic corruption may affect China's ability to wage a future war, Bloomberg reported citing US officials this year. The investigation into Miao is \"in line with Xi's added scrutiny on the armed forces\" said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. His removal reveals the \"endurance of corruption and discipline issues across the system in the (armed forces), despite the strong efforts made by Xi,\" said Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. Deepening crackdown At the same briefing, Wu denied reports that Defence Minister Dong Jun has been placed under investigation for corruption. \"The reports in question are pure fabrications,\" Wu said. \"The rumour-mongers are ill-intentioned. China expresses its strong dissatisfaction with such slanderous behaviour,\" he added. A former navy commander, Dong was appointed defence minister in December following the surprise removal of predecessor Li Shangfu just seven months into the job. Li was later expelled from the Communist Party for offences including suspected bribery, state media said. He has not been seen in public since. His predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also kicked out of the party and passed on to prosecutors over alleged corruption. The country's secretive Rocket Force -- which oversees China's vast arsenal of strategic missiles, both conventional and nuclear -- has come under particularly intense scrutiny. In July, a top Chinese official in the Rocket Force, Sun Jinming, was kicked out of the party and placed under investigation for corruption. At least two other high-ranking officers connected to the Rocket Force, a relatively new unit of the Chinese military, have also been removed for graft. \"We will see many more investigations into the (armed forces) and this will not end with Miao Hua or Li Shangfu,\" Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, told AFP. © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Tang Shuangning, who had also held senior posts at the People’s Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, was arrested in January , part of a wider wave of prosecutions of senior officials accused of financial crimes. A court in the city of Tangshan, about 100 miles (160 kms) east of Beijing, found him guilty of taking advantage of his position at the state-owned bank in “seeking convenience for others” in jobs and loans, in exchange for illegal payments. The court said he had accepted illegal property with a total value of more than 11 million yuan (about $1.5 million). Tang, who retired in 2017, was expelled from the ruling Communist Party in January. His successor at Everbright, Li Xiaopeng, was also suspected of graft, expelled from the party and removed from public office. They are among many officials caught up in President Xi Jinping’s decade-long anti-corruption campaign , which critics say is also designed to remove his political rivals.

        "text": "China jails ex-football head coach for bribery 13 December 2024 Share Save Kelly Ng BBC News Share Save Getty Images Li Tie pleaded guilty to fixing matches, accepting bribes, and offering bribes to people to get the top coaching job The former coach of the Chinese national men's football team has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for bribery, state media reported. Li Tie, who also played for Everton in the English Premier League, confessed earlier this year to fixing matches, accepting bribes, and offering bribes to get the top coaching job. The case shows how President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption crackdown has cut through sport, banking and the military. Earlier this week, three former officials from the Chinese Football Association (CFA) were also handed jail sentences for bribery. More than a dozen coaches and players have been investigated. Li, who was the national team's head coach from January 2020 to December 2021, pleaded guilty in March to taking over $16 million in bribes. The court said that this happened from 2015, when he was an assistant coach at the Hebei China Fortune Club, until 2021, when he quit as the national coach. In exchange for the bribes, Li would select certain individuals for the national team and help football clubs win competitions. The 47-year-old was featured in an anti-corruption documentary aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV early this year, wherein he apologised for his offences. \"I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path,\" he said. \"There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football.\" Li had made 92 appearances for China and played at the 2002 World Cup - the country's only appearance in the finals so far. His former boss, the former CFA president Chen Xuyuan , was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year for accepting bribes worth $11 million. Xi had in the past voiced his ambition to turn China into a major football power. In 2011, he spoke of his \"three wishes\" for Chinese football: to qualify for the World Cup again, to host the tournament and to one day win the trophy. But the recent detentions and convictions of major football figures - some of whom were officials tasked to lead the football revolution -  have dealt another setback to the country's football ambitions. This latest anti-graft campaign echoes an earlier crackdown in Chinese football in 2010, when several officials, national team players and referees were jailed for corruption. That was also led by Xi, who was then China's vice-president. Rowan Simons, who authored the book Bamboo Goalposts, on his long-term efforts to develop grassroots football in China, told BBC Chinese earlier this year: \"In many ways, [the current campaign] looks exactly the same as it was 10 years ago with a different set of characters. \"How is it different? There's much more money involved.\" Additional reporting by Zhijie Shao in Hong Kong Asia China Corruption China corruption",

Video Ad Feedback Presidents of Taiwan and China to meet 01:51 - Source: CNN Story highlights Presidents of China and Taiwan hold landmark meeting Analysts say talks may be aimed at influencing upcoming Taiwan elections CNN — Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to shake hands, hold talks and share dinner with Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou Saturday in a landmark meeting that could reboot relations between the two rivals or drive them further apart. Separated by a sea channel and decades of mistrust , the leaders of China and Taiwan  – officially the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China – haven’t met since the two sides split in 1949 amid a bloody civil war. The meeting, which takes place in Singapore, will be governed by complicated protocol reflecting the bitter history between the two. How they greet each other and what gestures they make will be closely scrutinized. Both leaders will eschew their presidential titles and address each other simply as “Mr.” In a Thursday press conference, Ma said that the two sides would split the hotel and meal bill. Google Maps “No country would like to see war and conflict. If we can stabilize cross-strait relations, I believe other countries would love to see it too,” Ma said. Both sides have said that no agreements would be signed at the meeting and they would discuss ways to cement peace. “If Xi tries to put down any markers about improving political ties or setting any deadlines for steps toward reunification, it will cause a massive anti-Beijing backlash across Taiwan,” said Robert Manning, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. READ: Explained: Why historic meeting matters China still considers the island a breakaway province and has warned that a formal declaration of independence could lead to military intervention. To this day, it’s reported to have missiles pointed at the island of 22 million people. Despite the rift, China is Taiwan’s biggest trade partner, hundreds of flights go between the two nations each week and Chinese banks now operate on the island, while some Taiwanese companies have factories in China. Ma, former head of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, has been a key driver in forging closer ties since he came to power in a 2008 election. Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  and the leading candidate to replace Ma in January elections, has spoken out against the meeting. Analysts think the timing of the meeting is aimed at boosting the governing party’s chances in the vote – by sending a message that the KMT can best manage relations with China. The KMT’s candidate Eric Chiu is trailing Tsai and Ma cannot run because of term limits. “The DPP is wildly ahead in the polls and will not only probably win, but it could be a landslide,”  said Manning. “In the past, every time Beijing has tried to intervene to influence Taiwan elections, it has blown up in their face and been counterproductive.” MORE: Summit: Empty symbolism or game changer?

Normally, only certain “sensitive” pages are blocked, while most of the site is accessible. Shenzhen-based “williamlong” (@williamlong) reports at williamlong.info:\nThe domain name for Chinese Wikipedia, zh.wikipedia.org, has been keyword blocked and DNS poisoned since May 19. At present there is no way to visit Chinese Wikipedia or to resolve the site’s IP address within China. English Wikipedia has not been affected.\nThe last time Wikipedia was blocked was 2013. After that point, Wikipedia’s IP address would change so that after a short delay the user could visit the site as usual. This current instance of DNS poisoning makes it so the site cannot be accessed even if the IP address is changed, unless the user in China revises the local Hosts file or uses a tool like DNSCrypt to counter the DNS poisoning. [Chinese]\nKeyword blocking drops a user’s connection to a URL containing a certain keyword, such as “1989.” DNS poisoning causes the server to return an incorrect IP address, making it impossible to reach the targeted website.\nGreatFire.org’s Great Firewall monitor confirms that Chinese Wikipedia was blocked on May 19 and 20.\nWikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has refused to censor Wikipedia in order to stay viable in China. “While many of us around the world enjoy the fruits of the information revolution, we must not leave behind the people who are still subject to oppressive regimes and are restricted from freely enjoying it,” Wales writes in a May 18 op-ed for the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz.\nWikipedia is non-profit and user-driven, with an editorial system that monitors edits for objectivity, balance, and sourcing. The Chinese search engine giant Baidu created its own community-edited encyclopedia, Baidu Baike, in 2006. Baidu Baike rivals Wikipedia’s volume of entries, but “is clearly inferior to Wikipedia in terms of entry quality, neutrality, and [respect for] copyright,” according to williamlong. Jason Q. Ng noted allegations of plagiarism from Wikipedia on mainland wiki encyclopedias in his 2013 study comparing protected (uneditable) articles and “missing entries” among Chinese Wikipedia, Baidu Baike, and Hudong.\nThe Chinese Internet space has constricted over the past few months, with a Gmail outage in December, disruptions to several virtual private networks (VPNs) in January, and attacks on platforms hosting mirror sites, including an unprecedented attack on the code sharing site GitHub in March. Netizens have found a silver lining, though. Replying to a Weibo post about the block of Chinese Wikipedia, Haodamao (@郝大毛) writes, “The motherland has really gone the extra mile to get us to study English.”",

The largely ceremonial advisory council also dismissed former spy boss Ma Jian and Zhu Mingguo, once a senior official in the southern export powerhouse province of Guangdong, according to media reports. Both have been accused of graft. Ling was demoted in September 2012 after sources said his son was involved in a deadly crash involving an expensive sports car in an embarassment to the party, which is sensitive to public criticism that its officials and their families lead lifestyles of excess. Ling was dropped from his post as head of the party's General Office of the Central Committee, a powerful post similar to cabinet secretary in governments modelled after the politics of Britain, such as Australia and Canada. He was then appointed as minister for the less influential United Front Work Department, which is in charge of co-opting non-Communists, religious groups and ethnic minorities. The country's National People's Congress, a largely rubber-stamp parliament, also cast out Liu Zheng, a former deputy director of the powerful General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, who is being investigated for corruption, state media reported on Saturday. The development, which comes as China's leadership pursues a campaign to weed out corruption and excess in its armed forces, is significant because it means Liu has been stripped of immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament. Liu is under investigation, the Ministry of Defence said in January, accused of \"seriously violating party discipline\", a euphemism for graft. Serving and retired Chinese military officers have said graft in the armed forces is so pervasive it could undermine China's ability to wage war. China's campaign to rid its military of corruption has ensnared several high-ranking officials, including Xu Caihou, who retired as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission last year. Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to target high-flying \"tigers\" as well as lowly \"flies\" in his anti-corruption campaign.

Ni Fake, former vice-governor of the eastern province of Anhui, was found guilty of taking more than $2m (£1.3m) in bribes, the municipal intermediate people’s court for the eastern city of Dongying said in a statement. He also failed to explain the sources for nearly $1m of additional assets, the court said. China is in the midst of a sweeping anti-graft campaign under President Xi Jinping, who has warned that widespread corruption has threatened the rule of the Communist party. The campaign, now in its third year, has shown no sign of relaxing, with the party’s disciplinary officials vowing to root out the scourge that has alienated the party from the public. Ni was known for his connoisseurship of jade and arts, and those seeking his favours bribed him with the precious stone and scrolls of calligraphy and paintings, in addition to cash, according to the court. It said that Ni confessed and would not appeal the verdict. Meanwhile, Liu Zheng, a senior military official embroiled in a corruption scandal, has been booted from the Chinese parliament, state media reported on Saturday. The move means Liu Zheng has been stripped of immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament, state media said, citing a statement from the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, the largely rubber-stamp legislature. Liu, a former deputy director of the powerful General Logistics Department of the People’s Liberation Army, is under investigation, the Ministry of Defence said in January, accused of “seriously violating party discipline” – a common euphemism for graft.

Hundreds of people have been killed in resource-rich Xinjiang, strategically located on the borders of central Asia, in violence in the past two years between the Muslim Uighur people who call the region home and ethnic majority Han Chinese. The government has also blamed attacks elsewhere in China, including Beijing, on Islamist militants from Xinjiang. Monday's violence came two months after 15 people were killed when a group threw explosives into a crowded street of vendors selling food in Xinjiang. Police in Shule county, south of the old Silk Road city of Kashgar, had acted on a tip-off about \"a suspicious person carrying an explosive device\", the Xinjiang government said on its official news website. An axe-wielding individual tried to attack police officers and set off an explosive device, prompting the officers to shoot him, the government said. The report added that police trying to dispose of an explosive device were attacked by five \"thugs\" who sought to detonate it, but did not make clear if this was a separate incident. Police killed the men, according to the government. The report said there were no other casualties, but gave no details of the assailants. China's allegations were an \"excuse to cover up the excessive use of force\", said Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for exile group the World Uyghur Congress. \"China's hostile policy will only provoke more turbulence there,\" he said in emailed comments. Many Uighurs call Xinjiang East Turkestan. China often blames frequent outbreaks of violence there on extremists agitating for an independent nation. Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang, including controls on Islam, have provoked unrest. Beijing denies this. In a previous outbreak of violence in Shule in 2008, at the time of the Olympic Games in Beijing, three security officers were stabbed to death and another wounded by attackers police described as \"terrorists\". Xinjiang is crucial to China's growing energy needs, but analysts say the bulk of the proceeds from sales of its resources has gone to majority Han Chinese, stoking resentment among Uighurs. China has blamed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement for past attacks, but experts and rights groups have cast doubt on its existence as a cohesive group.

Facebook Twitter Print Email Health experts arrive in Wuhan to investigate COVID-19 origins 14 January 2021 Health Members of an international team studying the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19 arrived in Wuhan, China, on Thursday, the head of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) announced during an expert meeting on the disease. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General, was addressing the latest session of the Emergency Committee on COVID-19 established under the International Health Regulations (IHR), a treaty that guides global response to public health risks. Tweet URL World Health Organization (WHO) January 14, 2021 The new coronavirus that sparked the pandemic first emerged in Wuhan in December 2019.  Tedros reported that most of the 15 members of the delayed mission are now in the city, although two people are still in Singapore awaiting COVID-19 test results. “All members of the team had multiple negative PCR and antibody tests in their homes countries prior to traveling”, he said. “The team members who have arrived in Wuhan will be in quarantine for the next two weeks, and will begin working remotely with counterparts in China. They will then continue their work on the ground for a further two weeks.” Focus now on vaccine equity, travel prospects Thursday marked the sixth meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on COVID-19. Members first convened a year ago, when there were less than 560 cases of the new disease. Today, more than 90 million cases have been reported globally, and the death toll has almost reached two million. Tedros said although the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines represents “hope of light at the end of the tunnel”, focus is now on ensuring all countries can access them on an equitable basis. He also highlighted two urgent issues for the committee’s attention: the recent emergence of multiple new variants of the virus, and the potential use of vaccination and testing certificates for international travel. “One theme ties both issues together: solidarity”, said Tedros.  “We cannot afford to prioritize or punish certain groups or countries. We are all in this together, and we must all come out of it together.” Challenges in Africa Meanwhile, the UN agency has warned of the need to avert a “runaway surge” of infections in Africa, as cases there top three million and new variants of the virus emerge on the continent. COVID-19 cases have risen steadily since mid-September, with a steeper rise from late November, and could increase in the wake of the Christmas and New Year holidays due to travel and festive gatherings. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said although virus mutations are not surprising, preliminary analysis reveals that a new variant circulating widely in South Africa, known as 501Y.V2, is more transmissible. Coronavirus Portal & News Updates Readers can find information and guidance on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from the UN, World Health Organization and UN agencies here. For daily news updates from UN News, click here. “Even if the new variant is not more virulent, a virus that can spread more easily will put further strain on hospitals and health workers who are in many cases already overstretched”, she said. “This is a stark reminder that the virus is relentless, that it still presents a manifest threat, and that our war is far from won.” WHO is supporting African countries with reinforcing genome sequencing efforts, key to finding and understanding new COVID-19 variants. So far, 501Y.V2 has been identified in Botswana, the Gambia and Zambia, while Nigeria is further investigating another variant found in samples collected in August and November.   The virus variant circulating in the United Kingdom has not been reported on the continent. ♦ Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic. ♦ Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices. coronavirus COVID-19 Related Stories WHO concerned about COVID-19 impact on indigenous people in the Americas COVID-19: No return to ‘old normal’, says UN health chief, as cases top 15 million Young people ‘not invincible’ in COVID-19 pandemic:  WHO chief News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue Step up surveillance of emerging coronavirus variants, WHO urges 13 January 2021 Health Efforts should be stepped up to quickly identify and study emerging variants of the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, UN World Health Organization (WHO) scientists said on Tuesday.

Members of a rescue team work at the site of a gold mine explosion where 22 miners are trapped underground in Qixia, in eastern China's Shandong province, on January 20, 2021. STR/AFP/Getty Images CNN — Eleven miners who were trapped in a gold mine for more than two weeks in eastern China have been rescued, while ten so far have died, Chinese state media reported. Authorities have been racing to dig out 22 people trapped underground in the city of Qixia, Shandong Province, since an explosion blocked their exit on January 10. The first miner was rescued on Sunday morning at about 11:13 a.m. local time, and was in “extremely weak condition,” according to state-run news wire Xinhua. State broadcaster CCTV said he was sent to hospital. The next 10 were lifted from a deeper section of the mine. At least one of them was injured, according to CCTV, but it is not clear how seriously. A total of ten miners have been found dead, according to Yantai city mayor Chen Fei speaking on Chinese state media. One miner’s body was recovered on January 21 and nine more recovered Monday, media reported. Rescuers are still searching for one more miner out of 22. Rescue teams work to drill through debris to reach the 22 trapped gold miners, on January 20, 2021. STR/AFP/Getty Images Authorities had previously said 10 people who were stuck in the mine’s chamber 600 meters (1,969 feet) underground were in contact with the outside world after rescue workers drilled a channel into a section the mine and installed a telephone line, according to Xinhua . It is not yet clear if those 10 are among those who have been rescued. Efforts have been underway to reach the workers since the blast occurred about 240 meters (800 feet) from the mine’s entrance, but Chinese officials had said Thursday it could take 15 days to drill through 70 tons of debris trapping many of the miners. Food, medical supplies, blankets, and batches of nutrient solution have been passed down a shaft to the 10 workers who have been located. They are in good physical and psychological condition, Xinhua reported. According to state media, rescue teams are hoping to pull the miners out through a 711-millimeter (28-inch) diameter passage. By noon Thursday, rescuers had drilled 18 meters (59 feet) into the mineshaft but heavy debris could slow efforts. Concern has been growing for the uncontacted miners. Some of the workers in the chamber are trying to help rescuers locate their missing colleagues by using laser pointers and loudspeakers, but they have received no response, Xinhua reported. Rescuers have also drilled smaller channels into other sections of the mine and are lowering nutrient solutions and other means to detect breathing or movement, but no signs of life have been encountered. Chinese state media said it could take 15 days to reach the miners trapped 600 meters underground. STR/AFP/Getty Images Rescue workers are reported to have first heard knocking sounds from those trapped on January 17, followed by pulling on iron ropes. On Monday, miners were able to get a note to rescuers. Xinhua quoted the note as saying: “We are heavily exhausted and in urgent need of stomach medicine, painkillers, medical tape, external anti-inflammatory drugs, and three people have high blood pressure.” Explosions and deaths are not uncommon in Chinese mines. In September, at least 16 workers in southwestern China died after they became trapped underground in a coal mine and exposed to unsafe levels of carbon monoxide, state media reported. And in 2016, dozens of workers were confirmed dead after a gas explosion at a coal mine in the city of Chongqing.

Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock China This article is more than 3 years old China records first Covid death since May as WHO team arrives in Wuhan This article is more than 3 years old Delegation arrives as China suffers growing outbreak of coronavirus in Hebei province Coronavirus – latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage Helen Davidson in Taipei Thu 14 Jan 2021 09.22 GMT First published on Thu 14 Jan 2021 05.44 GMT Share Mainland China has reported its first Covid-19 death in eight months, as most of a team of experts from the World Health Organization landed in Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic. Two members of the team were stopped in Singapore after tests detected antibodies, while the rest of the delegation began quarantine in Wuhan for two weeks before beginning their inquiries. Their arrival, which was live-streamed by state media, came after almost a year of negotiations with the WHO, and diplomatic spats between China – which has been trying to change the narrative about where the virus came from – and other countries who demanded it allow a “robust” independent investigation . No details of China’s 4,635th death were provided on Thursday, except that the person was in Hebei province, the main site of China’s worst outbreak in months and where new lockdowns have been imposed on tens of millions of people. It is the first death from the disease since May. WHO's Covid mission to Wuhan: 'It's not about finding China guilty' Read more China’s national health commission reported 138 new cases of confirmed Covid-19, and 78 new asymptomatic cases, which they count separately. It is the highest daily tally in China since March and comes weeks before the start of the busy lunar new year holiday period. Of the 138 cases, 124 were local transmissions including 81 in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and 43 in the north-eastern Heilongjiang province. All new cases in Heilongjiang were close contacts or secondary close contacts of earlier infections in a Wangkui county village, authorities said. In response, authorities have locked down major cities home to tens of millions of people, and enacted tough travel restrictions. Anyone seeking to enter Beijing for work from surrounding Hebei must provide proof of employment and a negative test. The coastal city of Shanghai has forbidden entry to residents of designated streets within middle-high risk areas, and those from elsewhere in the designated areas will be subject to 14 days quarantine on arrival and testing. The regulation was announced on Wednesday and is valid until the end of March. In the outskirts of Hebei’s capital Shijiazhuang on Wednesday, construction began immediately on a newly ordered centralised isolation facility, state media reported. Described by Xinhua as “integrated housing” for centralised medical observation, the facility is reportedly expect to contain 3,000 makeshift wards. Authorities are pushing ahead with a drive to have 50 million people vaccinated before the lunar new year period begins on 11 February, and travel has been discouraged or banned in some sectors and provinces. On Tuesday, Dr Zhang Wenhong, a director of a Shanghai hospital’s infectious diseases department, said the outbreak would take at least a month to be controlled , and called for the vaccination programme to speed up so authorities could get ahead of virus mutations. The outbreak has alarmed officials, as each day this week recorded numbers not seen since early 2020, when the city Wuhan was still under its then-unprecedented lockdown. The WHO team includes virus and other experts from theUS, Australia, Germany, Japan, Britain, Russia, the Netherlands, Qatar and Vietnam. “All team members had multiple negative PCR [polymerase chain reaction tests for current Covid infection] and antibody tests for Covid-19 in their home countries prior to travelling,” the WHO said. “They were tested again in Singapore and were all negative for PCR. But two members tested positive for IgM [immunoglobulins] antibodies.” The pair were now undergoing further testing. The rest of the team will begin consulting immediately with Chinese counterparts via video link while they complete quarantine. A Chinese government spokesperson said this week the WHO team would “exchange views” with Chinese scientists but gave no indication whether they would be allowed to gather evidence. A “scientific audit” of records and safety measures would be a “routine activity”, said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. But that depended on how willing Chinese authorities were to share information. “There’s a big element of trust here,” Woolhouse said. The WHO team were en route to China a week ago but some members had to turn back after Beijing announced they had not received valid visas. It prompted a rare criticism from the head of the WHO, but Beijing said it was a “misunderstanding”.

File image Chinese and Indian troops have reportedly clashed again in a disputed border area, with injuries on both sides, Indian media say. The incident took place in north Sikkim last Wednesday. India's army said there had been a \"minor\" incident that had been \"resolved\". Tensions are high along the world's longest disputed border. Both sides claim large areas of territory. At least 20 Indian soldiers died in a skirmish in the Ladakh area last June. The border row explained in 400 words Why tensions are rising between the neighbours India and China race to build along a disputed frontier What happened in the latest incident? It happened at Naku La in north Sikkim, the media reports said. Sikkim is an Indian state sandwiched between Bhutan and Nepal, about 2,500km (1,500 miles) east of the Ladakh area. A Chinese patrol tried to enter Indian territory and was forced back, the officials said. Some reports said sticks and stones were used, but there were no gunshots. An Indian army statement played down the incident, saying there \"was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on 20 January 2021 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols\". One source told the Times of India that both sides brought in reinforcements after a \"brawl\" but there was no gunfire and the situation was under control. China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian did not give details of the incident, but said China's troops were \"committed to upholding peace\" and urged India to \"refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border\". The editor-in-chief of China's state-affiliated Global Times tweeted there was \"no record of this clash in the patrol log of the Chinese side\". Flashpoints and dialogue Analysis by Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi The latest reports about skirmishes show that tensions are still running high. The Indian army statement shows that both nations are still keen on keeping the dialogue route open and don't want skirmishes to derail the process. They have conducted several military-level talks to ease tensions but nothing concrete has come of them yet. And troops are still facing each other at several flashpoints along their contested border. Some former Indian officers say such exchanges can't be avoided when the situation is so fluid. But they agree that talks need to continue as both nations would not want a war - not even a limited one. Why are there border disputes? A lot of the 3,440km (2,100-mile) border is ill defined. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line can shift, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes leading to confrontations. There was a minor clash last May at Naku La, which is at an altitude of more than 5,000m (16,000ft). One month later a deadly clash erupted in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh . In addition to the Indian deaths, China also reportedly suffered casualties although it made no official comment. Ros Atkins looks at what happened on the India-China border in June 2020 Since the savage hand-to-hand fighting there, in which no shots were fired, the two sides have held de-escalation talks. The ninth round of them took place between military commanders on Sunday in eastern Ladakh but there have been no details of any agreements. How misleading India-China border claims were shared online The nuclear-armed neighbours have a lot to lose, with China one of India's biggest trading partners. Relations have worsened amid the border face-off. Both have stepped up infrastructure construction along some of the border areas. India's government has also banned more than 200 Chinese apps , citing cyber security concerns. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a heavy defeat. An agreement was signed in 1996 barring the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known. It has held, although both sides did accuse each other of firing warning shots or shots into the air in Ladakh last September. What is Sikkim's strategic significance? The tiny east Himalayan region has been a key flashpoint between India and China for decades. It saw clashes in their 1962 war. Five years later, fighting along its border left several hundred soldiers dead on either side. The former kingdom was an Indian protectorate at the time, and only became the country's 22nd state after a referendum in 1975. Sikkim is near a high-altitude plateau known as Doklam in India and Donglang in China. India fears that greater Chinese road access to the plateau would threaten India's strategically vulnerable \"chicken's neck\", the 20km (12-mile) wide Siliguri Corridor that links seven north-eastern states, including Assam, to the rest of the country. The border in Sikkim is also crucial for another reason. Indian military experts say it's the only area through which India could make an offensive response to a Chinese incursion, and the only stretch of the Himalayan frontier where Indian troops have a terrain and tactical advantage. They have higher ground, and the Chinese positions there are squeezed between India and Bhutan.

The reactor in Fuqing in China's southeastern province of Fujian was first connected to the grid on Nov. 27 last year, following more than five years of construction work. \"This marks that China has mastered independent third-generation nuclear power technology following the United States, France, Russia and others,\" the company said in a statement on its official WeChat account. The Hualong One units, designed to have a 60-year lifespan, have an installed capacity of 1.161 million kilowatts each, CNNC said. Construction of a second Hualong One unit at the Fuqing site is due to be completed this year. CNNC said the project would help China secure its national energy safety and to reach carbon neutrality.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING (Reuters) - The former chairman of China Huarong Asset Management Co has been sentenced to death, a court in the northern city of Tianjin said on Tuesday, in one of the country's highest profile corruption cases. Lai Xiaomin was convicted of receiving or seeking bribes totalling 1.788 billion yuan ($276.72 million) from 2008 to 2018, when he was also a senior banking regulator, according to the Secondary Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin. Lai, who was expelled from the ruling Communist Party in 2018, was also convicted on a charge of bigamy. Reuters was unable to contact Lai or his lawyer for comment. \"Lai Xiaomin was lawless and extremely greedy,\" the court statement said. Huarong said its Communist Party committee supports the verdict. \"The severe treatment of Lai Xiaomin reflects the strong determination of the Central Committee with President Xi Jinping as the core to administer the party and its zero tolerance in punishing corruption,\" the company said in a statement. The court noted that most of the activity in question took place after the 18th Party Congress in late 2012, referring to an event that sparked a sweeping anti-corruption campaign by soon-to-be President Xi Jinping that became a hallmark of his first term. \"The social harm was huge and the crimes were extremely serious and he should be severely punished according to law,\" the court said.

Photograph: World Health Organization/AFP/Getty Images The World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on senior Chinese officials to allow the research team into the country. Photograph: World Health Organization/AFP/Getty Images Sarah Boseley , health editor Tue 5 Jan 2021 15.08 EST Last modified on Tue 5 Jan 2021 15.11 EST China has blocked the arrival of a team from the World Health Organization investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic , claiming that their visas had not yet been approved even as some members of the group were on their way. The WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed his dismay and said he had called on China to allow the team in. “I’m very disappointed with this news, given that two members have already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute,” he said. “But I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials. And I have once again made made it clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team.” The WHO has been attempting to send in the team of global experts from a number of countries for some months. It has been talking with Chinese officials since July. Scientists have long said it is essential to find out how the virus jumped species into humans. Origin story: what do we know now about where coronavirus came from? Read more The expedition to China was heading to Wuhan to investigate the earliest cases. It was not intending to probe claims that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, which have been dismissed by most scientists . The mission has been criticised by the US, where the outgoing president, Donald Trump, has categorically blamed the Chinese for the pandemic. Garrett Grigsby, of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said in November the investigation appeared to be “inconsistent” with the WHO’s mandate. “Understanding the origins of Covid-19 through a transparent and inclusive investigation is what must be done to meet the mandate.” Dr Mike Ryan at WHO said the team had been working very closely with Chinese colleagues on planning the trip. “We were all operating on the understanding the team will begin deployment today [Tuesday],” he said. Two members of the team, who had a long distance to travel, had begun their journeys, he said, but it had become clear that their visas had not been approved by the Chinese authorities. “We did not want to put people in the air unnecessarily if there wasn’t a guarantee of their arrival in China being successful,” said Ryan. “Dr Tedros has taken immediate action and has spoken with senior Chinese officials and has fully impressed upon them the absolute critical nature of this.” The team hoped it was “just a logistical and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly”. One of the two colleagues who were on their way had gone back, while the other was remaining in a third country in transit. “This is frustrating and, as the director general said, disappointing. That disappointment has been expressed very clearly by Dr Tedros directly to our counterparts in China. We trust that in good faith, we can solve these issues in the coming hours and recommence the deployment of the team as urgently as possible,” said Ryan. Ilona Kickbusch, the founding director and chair of the Global Health Centre in Geneva, said geopolitics had got in the way of countries joining together to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and the hostilities that had been generated could now get in the way of finding out how it began. “I think it will be incredibly difficult to be able to find the origin of the virus, because so much time has passed,” Kickbusch said. The world managed to come together to eradicate smallpox at the height of the cold war, she pointed out. Even when SARS, another coronavirus, surfaced in China and caused havoc between 2002 and 2003, the global reaction had been one of cooperation and a push for more transparency. Back then, Beijing had acknowledged it had made mistakes, reorganised its health ministry and created the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Other countries had given it the benefit of the doubt and called for more cooperation. “SARS actually led to China [understanding] that they needed to be much more integrated into the [global] system,” Kickbusch said. “It was a period of opening.” But now, she said: “There is a closing of the mind, quite clearly, on all sides.” Before the crisis, geopolitical tensions had bled into the global health response, she said, pointing to how the US-China trade war had morphed into a “geopolitical blame game”. As a result “China clamped down totally [and] the US did what it did” and in the end “the whole world has suffered”.

It's the first time the country has managed to get a spacecraft to the Red Planet and comes a day after the United Arab Emirates accomplished the same feat. Tianwen-1, or \"Questions to Heaven\", comprises an orbiter and a rover. Engineers will bide their time before despatching the wheeled robot to the surface but the expectation is that this will happen in May or June. Wednesday's orbit insertion underlines again the rapid progress China's space programme is making. It follows December's impressive mission to retrieve rock and soil samples from Earth's Moon - by any measure a very complex undertaking. History-making UAE probe brakes into Mars orbit Nasa's Perseverance rover is bearing down on Mars China's Chang'e-5 mission returns Moon samples NASA-JPL Nasa's 1976 Viking-2 mission also landed on Utopia Planitia Tianwen-1's mission, particularly the surface element, will be no less challenging. Its five-tonne spacecraft stack, made up of orbiter and rover, was launched from Wenchang spaceport in July , and travelled nearly half a billion km to rendezvous with the Red Planet. Engineers had planned a 14-minute braking burn on the orbiter's 3,000-newton thruster, with the expectation that this would reduce its 23km/s velocity sufficiently to allow capture by Mars' gravity. The manoeuvre was automated; it had to be. Radio commands currently take 11 minutes to traverse the 190 million km now separating Earth from Mars. It should have put Tianwen-1 in an initial large ellipse that comes in as close as 400km from the surface and out as far as 180,000km. This will be trimmed over time to become tighter and more circularised. Getty Images Artwork: The Tianwen-1 rover looks a lot like the US robots of the 2000s In contrast to the Emiratis' live TV coverage on Tuesday, China chose to report the orbit insertion at Mars only after it had occurred. It was clear early on, however, that events were proceeding as they should because amateur radio enthusiasts could listen across Tianwen-1's signals, and they could see each milestone in the manoeuvre was being achieved. How long does it take to get to Mars and why is it so difficult? China is following the strategy employed by the Americans for their successful Viking landers in the mid-1970s. The idea then was to make orbit first and only later send a robot to the surface. A period of reconnaissance will now follow but Tianwen-1's primary choice for a touchdown is a flat plain within the Utopia impact basin just north of Mars' equator. The rover, which has yet to be named, looks a lot like the US space agency's (Nasa) Spirit and Opportunity rovers from the 2000s. It weighs some 240kg and is powered by fold-out solar panels. A tall mast carries cameras to take pictures and aid navigation; five additional instruments will help assess the mineralogy of local rocks and look for any water-ice. A key experiment will be the ground-penetrating radar, which should be able to sense geological layers at depths of many metres. CNSA Tianwen-1 took this image of Mars from a distance of 2 million km This surface investigation is really only half the mission, however, because the orbiter that has been shepherding the rover will also study the planet, using a suite of seven remote-sensing instruments. Like previous satellites, this spacecraft will observe characteristics of the high atmosphere and examine the structures and composition of the surface. High- and medium-resolution cameras should return some impressive pictures. Tinawen-1 is one of three missions arriving at Mars this February. The UAE's Hope probe made it safely into orbit on Tuesday. Next week, Nasa will attempt to put another of its big rovers on the surface.

Tencent restricts users from sharing Douyin content on its instant messaging apps WeChat and QQ, which should be prohibited by anti-monopoly law, ByteDance said, adding that it has asked the court to order Tencent to stop such behaviour. \"We believe that competition is better for consumers and promote innovation,\" Douyin said in a statement. \"We have filed a lawsuit to protect our rights and those of our users.\" Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Douyin's lawsuit comes as Chinese regulators step up regulations on tech giants. Beijing issued draft rules in November aimed at preventing monopolistic behaviour by internet firms, marking China's first serious regulatory move against the sector. The State Administration of Market Regulation in December announced the launch of an antitrust investigation into e-commerce giant Alibaba. ByteDance competes with Tencent in social media in China and has challenged Tencent previously. In 2018, it sued Tencent for anti-competitive behaviour, alleging Tencent's social platform QQ zone and its Guanjia software blocked ByteDance's news aggregator Toutiao's links. Tencent filed a lawsuit accusing ByteDance of defamation around the same time.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING (Reuters) - Sinovac Biotech said on Saturday that its unit's COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use by the general public by China's medical products regulator. It marks the second vaccine approved for public use in China, after one developed by a Beijing institute affiliated with state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) was approved in December. Both vaccines, as well as a third candidate from Sinopharm, have already been used in China's vaccination program which has administered over 31 million doses, mainly targeting groups at higher infection risk. A fourth candidate from CanSino Biologics is being used among military personnel. Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency authorisation for the CoronaVac vaccine developed by Sinovac Life Sciences, Sinovac said in a news release. Approval of the two-dose regimen by China's National Medical Products Administration is based on results from two months of late-stage clinical trials overseas, from which the final analysis data has not yet been obtained, Sinovac said. Its Beijing-based unit Sinovac Life Sciences is expected to be able to produce over 1 billion doses per year in the form of bulk ingredient by February, it said. Sinovac is also expanding its capacity to fill vaccine into vials and syringes, which currently lags its vaccine manufacturing capacity. It has also outsourced filling and finishing procedures to overseas partners. China plans to provide 10 million vaccine doses to COVAX, a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine-sharing initiative that Sinovac, Sinopharm and CanSino have applied to join, the foreign ministry has said. A Phase I and II trial in China showed the vaccine could safely trigger immune response for older participants and it is also being tested in participants aged three to 17. Sinovac cautioned, however, that data for the protection rate among people aged 60 and above was \"limited\". \"When the relevant institutions ...use this vaccine, the necessity of inoculating this product should be evaluated in consideration of the health status and exposure risk of this age group,\" it added. VARIED EFFICACY RATES Sinovac's vaccine is being tested in Phase III clinical trials in countries including Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, where varied efficacy readings had been released separately, without sufficient details made available to public. The vaccine was found 50.65% effective against COVID-19 disease in the Brazil trial which had recruited 12,396 medical workers older than 18 as of December 16 and recorded 253 cases, Sinovac said in a statement on Friday. The success rate from the Turkey trial was 91.25%, local researchers said, based on a preliminary analysis of 29 cases. There was a 65.3% efficacy rate in the Indonesia trial. Brazil's more rampant epidemic, and the trial's focus on medical workers, are among factors which Sinovac believe may have lowered the efficacy rate seen in data from there, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. The Brazil trial also found the vaccine was 83.7% effective against the disease that requires medical treatment, and 100% effective against hospitalization, severe cases and death in the same trial, Sinovac said on Friday. The protection rate was nearly 70% based on observation of a smaller sub-group in the Brazil trial, in which participants received the two doses at a three-week interval rather than two weeks apart for most participants, Sinovac said last month.

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING (Reuters) - China's state broadcaster has come under fire once more for a performance featuring dancers made up to look African during its annual gala show to celebrate the Lunar New Year. During CCTV's four-hour show which typically draws hundreds of millions of viewers, performers appeared on stage wearing outfits that approximated African clothing and had darkened their skin with make-up. \"The New Year Gala director team is just stupid and vicious,\" said one of a number of users who took to Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, to criticise the skit. \"Is there any difference between Chinese people doing blackface and white people slanting their eyes to make fun of Asians?\" China's foreign ministry said the integration of cultural elements from other countries into Chinese shows was a sign of respect and the inclusion of the African segment was not a diplomatic issue. \"If anyone wants to seize on the CCTV Spring Festival Gala programme to make a fuss, or even sow discord in relations between China and African countries, they obviously have ulterior motives,\" it said in a statement to Reuters. The gala sparked similar controversy in 2018 over a skit featuring actress Lou Naiming. She appeared on stage in colourful garb, her face and arms coloured brown, carrying a fruit basket on her head and accompanied by someone costumed as a monkey. ( reut.rs/3p7KpxW ) Organisations and advocates for Africans in China also lambasted the show, which aired Thursday evening. \"While supporters of the practice allege that blackface centres on empathy & realism, it’s difficult to disassociate it from a long history of minstrelsy & fixation on problematic caricatures,\" Black China Caucus, an activist group, said on Twitter. \"Next year, we hope organizers decide to end this practice & hire some of thousands of Black people living in many parts of China.\" A representative for CCTV could not be reached for comment on Friday, a public holiday. The show, which this year celebrated Chinese medical workers and the country's space programme, has been a television staple since it was first broadcast in 1983.

REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Access to U.S. audio app Clubhouse was blocked in China on Monday, users and an anti-censorship watchdog said, ending a brief window that allowed thousands of mainland users to join in discussions often censored in China. Launched in early 2020, Clubhouse's global user numbers soared earlier this month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev held a surprise discussion on the platform. Masses of new users joined from mainland China, taking part in discussions on topics that included sensitive issues such as Xinjiang detention camps, Taiwan independence and Hong Kong's National Security Law. However, users of China's Twitter-like social media app Weibo began posting that they were having issues accessing the Clubhouse app on Monday evening. Some showed screenshots of a message the app displayed when they tried to open it which said a secure connection to the server could not be made. Anti-censorship activist website GreatFire.org said on Twitter late on Monday that the app had been blocked for users in China at around 7 p.m. Beijing time (1100 GMT) that day. Many Western social media apps including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are banned in China, where the local internet is tightly regulated and often censored of content that could undermine the country's ruling Communist Party. Clubhouse did not respond to requests for comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's top internet regulator, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. \"Clubhouse has been walled,\" said one Weibo user on Monday, referring to the system China uses to regulate its internet. \"This is just too fast,\" said another. Many Weibo posts discussing the blocking of the app were deleted from the platform by Tuesday morning. The Clubhouse app is only available on iOS devices and is unavailable in the local Apple app store in China, but mainland Chinese users had been able to access the app by modifying the location of their app store. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday that China governed its cyberspace according to laws but that he was unaware of the situation around Clubhouse. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said a China ban on Clubhouse was not surprising and called upon Beijing to allow its citizens unfettered access to the internet and other media. \"Internet freedom is an important right and is key to ensuring an informed citizenry can share their ideas freely amongst themselves and with their leaders,\" she said. As first reports of the internet disruptions began on Monday, nearly 3,000 users opened a room in Clubhouse to discuss whether it had been blocked by Chinese censors, with some expressing concerns that authorities could be monitoring discussions. Some users urged others not to panic. \"Let bullets fly for a while. Let's monitor for a few days first, don't panic yet,\" one user said.

The motion - which passed 266 to 0 - was supported by all opposition parties and a handful of lawmakers from the governing Liberal Party. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and most members of his cabinet abstained. The motion makes Canada just the second country after the United States to recognise China's actions as genocide. Lawmakers also voted to pass an amendment asking Canada to call on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing \"if the Chinese government continues this genocide\". China responded late on Tuesday, saying it condemned and rejected Canada's motion, according to a Reuters report. It quoted foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin as saying that China had lodged \"stern representations\" with Canada. Who are the Uighurs? Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape US: China 'committed genocide against Uighurs' Mr Trudeau has so far been hesitant to label China's actions against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang a genocide, calling the term \"extremely loaded\" and saying further examination was needed before a decision could be made. Just one member of his cabinet, Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau, appeared in parliament for the vote. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Garneau said he had abstained \"on behalf of the government of Canada\". Speaking ahead of the vote, opposition leader Erin O'Toole said the move was necessary to send a \"clear and unequivocal signal that we will stand up for human rights and the dignity of human rights, even if it means sacrificing some economic opportunity\". In an open letter to Mr Trudeau earlier this month asking him to \"stand up to China\", Mr O'Toole noted the recent banning of BBC World News from China - a decision that followed a BBC report alleging systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture in China's \"re-education\" camps in Xinjiang. Monday's non-binding motion marks the latest escalation in Canada-China relations, which have soured over recent years. The BBC's John Sudworth reports from Xinjiang, where all filming and reporting by foreign media is tightly controlled (from 2018) China's ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu had earlier told the Canadian Press that the motion was \"interfering in [China's] domestic affairs\". \"We firmly oppose that because it runs counter to facts,\" he said. \"There's nothing like genocide happening in Xinjiang at all.\" Rights groups believe that China has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as \"re-education camps\". BBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour. Canada's symbolic motion does not lay out next steps, but says the Canadian government needs to follow the lead of its US neighbours. Both the current and former US Secretaries of State, Anthony Blinken and Mike Pompeo, have declared that China's policies against Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its western Xinjiang region constitute genocide.

Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least one million Muslims are being detained in camps in the remote western region of Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations. China denies any human rights abuses in Xinjiang and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism. \"A genocide on the Uighur minority is occurring in China,\" the Dutch motion said, stopping short of directly saying that the Chinese government was responsible. The Chinese Embassy in The Hague said on Thursday any suggestion of a genocide in Xinjiang was an \"outright lie\" and the Dutch parliament had \"deliberately smeared China and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs.\" Canada passed a resolution labelling China's treatment of the Uighurs genocide earlier this week. The Dutch motion said that actions by the Chinese government such as \"measures intended to prevent births\" and \"having punishment camps\" fell under United Nations Resolution 260, generally known as the genocide convention. Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD party voted against the resolution. \"GREAT CONCERN\" Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the government did not want to use the term genocide, as the situation has not been declared as such by the United Nations or by an international court. \"The situation of the Uighurs is a cause of great concern\", Blok told reporters after the motion was passed, adding that the Netherlands hoped to work with other nations on the matter. The author of the motion, lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma of the centre-left D-66 Party, has separately proposed lobbying the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics away from Beijing. \"Recognising the atrocities that are taking place against the Uighurs in China for what they are, namely genocide, prevents the world from looking the other way and forces us into action,\" he told Reuters in an emailed response to questions. In a statement on its website, the Chinese Embassy in The Hague said the Uighur population in Xinjiang has been growing in in recent years, enjoying a higher standard of living, and a longer life expectancy. \"How can you call this a genocide?\" it said. \"Xingjiang-related issues are never about human rights, ethnicity or religion, but about combating violent terrorism and succession.\" China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva accused Western powers on Wednesday of using the Uighur issue to meddle in his country's internal affairs.

        "text": "BEIJING (AP) — Attacks on Chinese-run factories in Myanmar’s biggest city drew demands Monday from Beijing for protection for their property and employees, while many in Myanmar expressed outrage over China’s apparent lack of concern for those killed in protests against last month’s military coup.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the Chinese Embassy had contacted authorities in Myanmar and urged that police be deployed to protect the Chinese companies and personnel.\nPolice and firefighters were sent to protect the factories, which are scattered across several industrial zones in Yangon, spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing. He said China was closely watching and “is very concerned about the impact on the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel.”\nA statement posted by the Chinese Embassy to Myanmar on Facebook about the efforts to protect Chinese businesses triggered an outpouring of fury in more than 52,000 comments.\n“Does it hurt? How about people dying?” said a post from Naing Oo.\n“If you want to do business peacefully in Myanmar, respect Myanmar people,” said Aye Myat Kyaw. “Stop supporting terrorist army and join Myanmar people.”\nMany accused Myanmar police or other agitators of causing the destruction to try to incite more trouble.\nMore than 100 civilians have been killed by security forces since the Feb. 1 coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. Many more have been injured, and thousands have been arrested.\n\nThe attacks on Myanmar’s garment factories have injected an extra complication into an already very complex situation. A fair share of the hundreds of garment factories in Myanmar’s biggest city, Yangon, and other major cities are run by Chinese manufacturers. Most are private companies and many are suppliers to big-name fashion, sports and household goods retailers.\nTaiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand also have a large number of manufacturers running factories in Myanmar that play a crucial role in providing jobs and exports that help keep the economy afloat.\nTaiwan’s representative office in Yangon recommended that Taiwan-owned companies use Burmese language signs to identify their factories as a “Taiwan Enterprise.” It also advised them to hang Taiwan’s national flag outside and explain to local employees and people living nearby that their factories are Taiwan-run, not from mainland China, to help minimize risks.\nMyanmar’s military leaders have often chafed at China’s outsized influence over their economy. But Beijing’s adherence to a policy of non-interference in other countries’ politics has already angered many who are protesting the coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, with some calling for boycotts of Chinese products.\nThe protesters have been appealing for support from other countries and the United Nations to restore civilian rule, staging protests and strikes in a massive show of civil disobedience that has nearly paralyzed the economy.\nMyanmar state media have reported that martial law was declared in six districts in Yangon, including the major industrial zones of Hlaing Thar Yar and Shwepyitha. At least 38 people were killed Sunday and dozens were injured in one of the deadliest days of the crackdown on anti-coup protesters, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.\nThe state-run Myanmar News Agency, which like most other media in the country is controlled by the military, reported that five factories were set afire in Hlaing Thayar, a factory area to the west of Yangon.\nIt said protesters had blocked roads, hindering fire engines from reaching the blazes.\nOne of those named, Global Fashion Garment Factory, is a Chinese-owned supplier to the fashion retailer C&A, according to a list on the C&A website.\nFu reported from Bangkok. Associated Press video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing and AP writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Kiko Rosario in Bangkok contributed to this report.",

A 59-year-old man suspected of being responsible for the explosive device was also killed in the explosion, local police said on their official Weibo account, adding that five people were wounded in the blast. The incident happened near the southern city of Guangzhou on Monday morning in the tiny village of Mingjing, which has about 3,000 residents and is the intended site of a major property redevelopment that involves relocating locals. A video shared on news site Jiemian showed a destroyed office, with blood splattered on the walls and at least two people motionless on the ground. Local media said the blast occurred at the village committee office, which decides on matters linked to land use. Officials had given 270 acres of land to a developer in Shanghai last year to recreate an old village to attract tourists, according to Guangzhou Daily. The eight-billion yuan ($1.2bn) project involves relocating farmers already on the land. Several people who claimed to be living near the area said online that the attack was triggered by a dispute over compensation. Countryside fit for a superpower? Inside China’s colossal rural revamp Read more AFP could not independently verify that the two are linked. It is unclear how many families are to be relocated for the project. Farmers in China have faced forced evictions and illicit land grabs for decades as the country raced to urbanise, frequently leading to social unrest. Local governments have taken land from between one million and five million agricultural workers every year between 2005 to 2015 – often in violation of national land-use laws with little or no compensation – a study by the University of Hong Kong found. In a major shake-up of its property law last year China gave judges greater independence when ruling on such issues and curbing the influence of local officials, but the judiciary is still ultimately answerable to the Communist party.

A tanker anchored off the port was reportedly hit Tuesday by another vessel, causing an oil spill in the Yellow Sea. Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images A collision between an oil tanker and a bulk carrier off China's east coast port city of Qingdao on Tuesday has resulted in an oil spill in the Yellow Sea, China's maritime safety authority and the ship's Singapore-based operator said. The nearly 900-foot tanker A Symphony was reportedly at anchor when the other vessel, Sea Justice (about 620 feet) apparently careened into it in waters southeast of Beijing. \"The force of the impact on the forward port side caused a breach in way of No. 2 Port ballast tank, with a quantity of oil lost into the ocean,\" Goodwood Ship Management, which operates the Suezmax tanker, told Reuters. Immediately \"the master initiated emergency procedures onboard, mobilizing the vessel's oil spill response team and initiating an internal transfer to limit the loss of product,\" the operator said, suggesting that dense fog at the time might have been a factor. Sponsor Message \"All of the crew have since been accounted for, and there are no injuries,\" the company said in an email. It said the collision occurred about 8:50 a.m. local time (8:50 p.m. Monday ET). Reuters reported that the collision was also confirmed by China's Shandong Maritime Safety Administration. It said other ships had been warned to stay at least 10 nautical miles (11.5 miles) away from the site but gave no further details, according to The Associated Press. S&P Global Platts , a London-based provider of energy news, quoted a source at Qingdao port as saying, \"Oil has been spilled into the sea, hard to determine the amount, and it's difficult to predict how long it will [take to] be cleared.\" In Malaysia earlier this month, the Liberian-flagged tanker A Symphony reportedly took on about 1 million barrels of bitumen — a viscous mixture of hydrocarbons used in road surfacing and roofing — before departing for China, Reuters reported.

March 11, 2021 by Dan Glaun China’s national legislature has approved a proposal granting Beijing increased control over Hong Kong’s elections, effectively barring political dissidents from running for local office. Following the direction of the Chinese Communist Party, the National People’s Congress ratified the measure by a near-unanimous vote Thursday. The rule will allow a pro-CCP committee to approve or reject candidates for the city’s legislature, in yet another blow to the limited civil liberties that have distinguished Hong Kong from mainland China for decades. The move comes after the CCP-backed government of Hong Kong announced last month that only “patriots” will be allowed to run for election, effectively preventing pro-democracy activists — like those who took to the streets in massive numbers throughout 2019 — from winning power. “You cannot say you love the country but you don’t respect [the Chinese Communist Party],” Erick Tsang, Hong Kong’s secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, told The Washington Post in February. “It does not make sense.” On Thursday, American members of U.S. Congress, including Republican Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Democrat Bob Menendez (D-NJ) criticized Beijing’s latest effort to assert control over Hong Kong’s politics. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Chinese authorities of trying to “quash” democracy in Hong Kong on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Chinese diplomats scheduled for next week, the Financial Times reported. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs pushed back, comparing activists in Hong Kong to those who overran the U.S. Capitol on January 6 in an effort to prevent the certification of the presidential election results. “Different definitions of and attitudes towards Riot in #HongKong & Riot in #US Capitol reveal the western #DoubleStandards!” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijan Zhao tweeted Thursday . The United Kingdom ruled Hong Kong for over 150 years as part of the British Empire before returning the city to Chinese jurisdiction in 1997. Under its agreement with the UK, China agreed to govern Hong Kong following the principle of “one government, two systems,” allowing the region to maintain its capitalist economy and semi-autonomous local government for 50 years, until 2047. But the CCP began asserting greater control over Hong Kong in the mid-2010s, telling the British government China no longer considered the agreement valid. In 2014, democracy activists launched months of unprecedented demonstrations against pro-CCP changes to Hong Kong’s political system, resulting in hundreds of injuries and arrests. The dispute intensified in 2016, after multiple Hong Kong booksellers who sold literature critical of the Chinese government disappeared, sparking thousands of residents to protest against their alleged illegal detention. More recently, tensions escalated into a crisis in 2019 after Hong Kong’s government attempted to pass a law allowing the extradition of residents to mainland China. Fearful that the law would allow Chinese authorities to prosecute political dissidents without the remaining due process protections of Hong Kong law, hundreds of thousands of activists took to the streets in the largest pro-democracy protests on Chinese territory since Tiananmen Square. The protests evolved into a months-long and increasingly violent conflict, as police used brutal tactics against demonstrators, and militant protesters responded by targeting officers with bricks, incendiary devices and other deadly weapons. FRONTLINE covered the fight for Hong Kong’s future in the February 2020 documentary Battle for Hong Kong , which followed five young pro-democracy protesters. “We want to choose our future by ourselves,” activist Agnes Chow told FRONTLINE in the film. Chow, 24, was sentenced to 10 months in prison in December for her involvement in a June 2019 protest. Another protester, part of a hardline segment who call themselves “the braves,” was filmed shooting arrows at police and argued that violence was necessary for the protest movement to survive. “What we’re doing now will be seen by society as f—ing violent,” he told FRONTLINE in the film. “But if it wasn’t for the ‘braves,’ the movement wouldn’t have lasted as long.” The Chinese government, which passed a new security law covering Hong Kong in June 2020 after protests derailed the local government’s efforts to do so, has described demonstrators as “radicals,” “thugs” and “separatists.” In January, Hong Kong police arrested 53 activists and former legislators under the law, accusing them of illegally participating in the electoral process. And last month, the Hong Kong government announced a broad set of regulations for schools, including the launch of “national security education” and measures to promote Chinese national identity among the city’s children. Teachers are required to tell students that “as far as national security is concerned, there is no room for debate or compromise,” according to rules published by Hong Kong’s Education Bureau.

Eight people were reported dead in Wuhan, in Hubei province, with 280 injured after Friday's tornado ripped through the district of Caidian at 8:39 p.m., the agency said. The tornado toppled 27 houses and damaged 130 more, as well as two tower cranes and 8,000 sq. m. (86,111 sq. ft) of sheds at construction sites, it added. \"I've grown up in Wuhan and I've never seen anything like it,\" one resident of the city posted on China's Weibo app. \"There's been so much extreme weather recently.\" Another tornado struck the town of Shengze, in the Suzhou area of tornado-prone Jiangsu province, killing four people and injuring 149, Xinhua said. Fire officials said the winds damaged electricity facilities  and toppled several factory buildings, it added. Tornadoes often hit Jiangsu in the late spring and early summer. China's commercial hub of Shanghai, 100 km (62 miles) from Suzhou, was also hit by powerful thunderstorms, prompting weather officials to declare an alert. More heavy storms were expected in Shanghai and other parts of the Yangtze river delta region later on Saturday, the state weather forecaster said. China faces more extreme weather as a result of climate change, Jia Xiaolong, an official of the forecaster, told reporters late in April, adding that the risk of disasters such as heat waves and floods was expected to rise in coming years.

Photograph: Reuters China This article is more than 3 years old An ultramarathon ends in tragedy: runners describe horror of Gansu race This article is more than 3 years old Twenty-one competitors died in the freezing Chinese mountains, raising major questions about safety in the sport Helen Davidson in Taipei Fri 28 May 2021 10.26 BST Last modified on Fri 28 May 2021 13.59 BST Share A t the starting line of the Gansu ultramarathon, it was cold but the sun was shining. One competitor struggled to warm up, even after jogging a quick 2km, and noticed some of the elite competitors were wearing shorts and shivering. In nearby towns, the temperature was reportedly already dropping and winds increasing, but the 172 runners didn’t know that. In a widely shared account of the horror that followed , published online, the anonymous runner described the conditions that led to the death of 21 competitors and the admission of eight others to hospital, and sparked major questions about the safety of the increasingly popular endurance sport in China. Within hours, the temperature on the mountain in north-western China would drop far below zero. Runners were pelted with rain, hail and gale-force winds. Competitors have described being blindsided by the cold, losing feeling in their extremities, passing people who retired early and were descending the track, and coming across others who were foaming at the mouth or lying motionless. Among those who died during the Huanghe Shilin Mountain Marathon in Gansu’ s Yellow River Stone Forest was record-holder Liang Jing, last photographed leading the pack, wearing shorts and a thin jacket. Nicknamed Liang God, the 31-year-old father of a two-year-old was well known in China as a champion racer. He was experienced, having won – among others – a 250-mile (400km) race through the Gobi desert in 2018. According to China News Weekly, he was one of four competitors who sheltered in a cave, accompanied by two local villagers. By the time rescuers found them, three of the four, including Liang, had died. Paralympian Huang Ganjun also died during the race. Hearing- and speech-impaired, Huang won the men’s hearing-impaired marathon at the 2019 National Paralympic Games. A friend described him as a “sensitive” man whose greatest joy in life was running. Fellow competitor Zhang Xiaotao described seeing Huang between the two checkpoints, alive and continuing but “in bad shape”. The Gansu ultramarathon had been run three times before, but this was a new route, through remote mountain territory. The weather deteriorated between the second and third checkpoints: a five-mile stretch of trail, 15 miles into the route. Competitors have variously described it as a treacherous and technical part of the route with 1,000 metres of elevation, requiring some climbing. “There is nowhere to rest and you can’t stop and the exposed mountains … But on this day, the problems were magnified,” the anonymous competitor said. Wang Jin-ming, 42, was among the runners who ended up in hospital. He told China News the weather turned at about 1pm, after he had run 17 miles. He struggled for 20 minutes to open his emergency blanket, only for it to be ripped out of his hands by the wind. He repeatedly pressed his GPS emergency button. “I lost control of my hands and feet, I could only crawl, keep climbing, keep climbing … I told myself that I can’t stop, must keep up my body temperature, stay alive, and see my family.” View image in fullscreen Rescuers searching for victims. Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock Wang said he found six or seven others, also in dire straits, and he urged them to keep moving but they couldn’t. At some point he lost consciousness and woke up in hospital. Rescuers hadn’t reached him until about 7pm. The inaccessibility of the section meant checkpoint 3 was not a supply drop for food, water or warm clothes, and those caught in the section could only rely on what they were carrying, which for many was very little. Across running forums and articles and media reports, many have questioned the lack of cold weather gear on the mandatory equipment list. A windbreaker or thermal top were only recommended, and the mandatory emergency blankets were ripped to shreds by the winds. But no one raised any objections to the list, wrote the anonymous competitor. “My jacket was packed in a transfer bag and stored at the [checkpoint 6] changing point 62km into the track. Normally, I can get here before dark.” Few made it past checkpoint 3. Estimates say 40 to 50 people took shelter in small cabins or caves along the route, some helped by dozens of locals including a shepherd, Zhu Keming, who has been hailed as a national hero for saving six people. Wang Qinlin, the party secretary of Hu Ma Shui village, said he coordinated with a neighbouring village secretary and marshalled residents to gather winter coats, quilts, steamed buns and hot water for survivors. View image in fullscreen Shepherd Zhu Keming speaks to the media in a cave where he saved the lives of six runners. Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images As the global ultramarathon community mourns its biggest ever tragedy, many are debating the role of personal responsibility. The sport is an ultimate endurance test, often in difficult or treacherous conditions. Races can, and often do, go sideways for competitors at any moment along the trails of 60 miles plus. “Trail running is the same as mountain climbing,” said Chinese mountaineer Luo Jing, who survived the race. “You have to make plans for the worst case every time, and don’t pin your hopes on others.” Luo put her survival partly down to preparation, bringing warm clothes and ensuring she had time to descend when the weather worsened. Commentators have also suggested the explosion in the popularity of endurance running in China has led to thousands of race events, with too few experienced outfits to run them. Often tourism officials see a race as a high-profile way to promote their region and to win favour with their superiors, potentially without enough regard for the danger. 0:48 Runner says she saw 'many with hypothermia' during deadly China ultramarathon – video Accounts in the Chinese media have hinted at inadequate contingency plans, and poor communication to local rescue authorities, who struggled to access the terrain and locate stranded competitors. There is conflicting information about what weather was predicted, and what information was assessed and passed on by organisers. A report published in Esquire , piecing together a timeline of events, revealed shambolic coordination of the rescue effort, with small teams and cars trying to reach checkpoints 2 and 4, while others including local villagers went on foot. There were several hours between the first messages for help and the full deployment of rescue teams. Route map The incident is under investigation, and China’s sports governing body has already ordered improvements, saying there were “problems and deficiencies” in the management model for races, including contingency planning. Numerous scheduled races have been cancelled in the fallout, and families of some of the victims have demanded accountability for the deaths. Media reports of authorities preventing families from talking to each other, or of stopping families from taking the bodies back to their home towns, has only compounded worries. The anonymous runner said it was unheard of that most of the runners had dropped out of the race before organisers finally suspended it, and urged future competitors to be prepared to look after themselves in an emergency. “You can only say you’ve finished if you make it home. Safety always come first.” Explore more on these topics China Asia Pacific Ultrarunning Marathon running Athletics features Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The quake hit at a depth of 8 km (5 miles) and was followed by aftershocks, according to data from China Earthquake Networks Center. CCTV quoted authorities as saying the collapse of some roads along with landslides had cut some transportation lines, but electricity, telephones and internet were working. CCTV said an emergency was declared and rescue operations were launched in Dali, a city of 134,000 people in Yunnan province about 24 km (15 miles) from the epicentre.

REUTERS/Muyu Xu Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab May 20 (Reuters) - China’s main industrial commodities tumbled on Thursday after the government announced stepped-up measures to keep a lid on soaring raw material prices which threaten to undermine the country’s economic recovery. Prices of key steelmaking ingredients iron ore  and coking coal , as well as steel products such as rebar  and hot-rolled coil , all dropped more than 5% as traders offloaded supplies and speculators placed short-sided bets that Beijing's measures will trigger a further pullback in metals markets. China's cabinet announced on Wednesday that it will strengthen management of commodity supply and demand to curb \"unreasonable\" prices and investigate behaviour that bids up commodity costs, spooking China's hoards of metal traders. read more \"Some of the measures could have an immediate impact on the supply demand balance, for example if the government decides to release some state reserve into the market,\" said Wood Mackenzie senior economist Yanting Zhou. \"Other measures will take effect over a longer time frame. However, these measures do have an immediate impact on price as it helps to manage the market expectation for further price increases,\" she added. Analysts at ANZ said steel and iron ore prices remain supported by strong seasonal demand, record high steel production, attractive steel margins and subdued supply. \"China's measures to curb steel production and exports were not much help in containing the price rise. Falling iron ore inventories reflect strong underlying fundamentals,\" ANZ said. PANDEMIC RECOVERY Beijing's warning about overheated markets follows a 30%-40% climb in several critical steel and metal prices so far in 2021, fuelled by a synchronised recovery in China's mammoth construction and manufacturing sectors from last year's pandemic. The world's largest exporter of finished and semi-finished goods gobbled up record amounts of metal since late 2020 to churn out appliances, exercise equipment, shipping containers and other goods that have seen strong demand globally in recent months. However, the broad-based rally in industrial activity - which also propelled thermal coal  prices to record highs this month as power use surged - is now threatening to strangle demand from consumers and ignite inflation. China's factory gate prices rose at their fastest pace in three and a half years last month, raising concerns that consumer prices will follow suit if commodity costs continue to climb. read more Richard Lu, senior analyst at commodity consultant CRU Group's Beijing office, said high steel prices \"will frighten some consumers at some point.\" But he said steel margins “remain good on average”, which will encourage Chinese mills to continue operating intensively unless further restrictions are rolled out.

China's first self-developed space station rivals the International Space Station, which is a co-operative effort between the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. China is not involved. The docking of Tianzhou-2 has paved the way for China to launch astronauts to the space station. A Long March-7 Y3 carrier rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft blasts off from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on May 29, 2021 in Wenchang, Hainan Province of China. Yuan Chen | VCG | Getty Images GUANGZHOU, China — China has completed another major part of its own space station, the latest in a string of ambitious extraterrestrial projects from the world's second-largest economy. The Long March 7 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft took off at 8:55 p.m. local time on Saturday from the Wenchang launch site, according to the China Manned Space agency. In the early hours of Sunday morning, Tianzhou-2 docked with the core module of the space station called Tianhe. China's space station will be made of three modules which includes the Tianhe \"core,\" cargo spacecraft such as Tianzhou-2 and laboratories. China will carry out 11 missions this year and next to complete the construction of the space station, and bring astronauts and supplies up too. The space station is expected to go into operation in 2022. The docking of Tianzhou-2 has paved the way for China to launch astronauts to the space station. The cargo spacecraft carried up astronaut supplies including space suits and food. Shredded pork and kung pao chicken are among the food items transported to space, the official Xinhua news agency reported. China's first self-developed space station will rival the International Space Station, which is a co-operative effort between the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada. China is not involved. Beijing has been putting a lot of emphasis on ambitious space projects. Last year, China completed its global navigation system called Beidou , a rival to the U.S. government-owned Global Positioning System (GPS). After China launched its first major Mars mission last year , an unmanned Chinese spacecraft landed successfully on the Red Planet . However, the Asian giant was criticized this month when the rocket carrying the core module for its space station, re-entered the earth's atmosphere uncontrolled and landed in the Indian Ocean .

REUTERS/Stringer Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING, June 1 (Reuters) - A 41-year-old man in China’s eastern province of Jiangsu has been confirmed as the first human case of infection with a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3, Beijing’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Tuesday. Many different strains of bird flu are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those working with poultry. There is no indication that H10N3 can spread easily in humans. , opens new tab The man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized on April 28 and diagnosed with H10N3 on May 28, the health commission said. It did not give details on how the man was infected. His condition is now stable and he is ready to be discharged. Investigation of his close contacts found no other cases, the NHC said. No other cases of human infection with H10N3 have been reported globally, it added. H10N3 is low pathogenic, which means it causes relatively less severe disease in poultry and is unlikely to cause a large-scale outbreak, the NHC added. The World Health Organization (WHO), in a reply to Reuters in Geneva, said: \"The source of the patient’s exposure to the H10N3 virus is not known at this time, and no other cases were found in emergency surveillance among the local population. At this time, there is no indication of human-to-human transmission. \"As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising, which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent,\" the WHO added. The strain is \"not a very common virus\", said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific. Only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added. Analysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said. There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.

        "text": "After a huge Chinese rocket plummeted apparently into the ocean late Saturday (May 8), NASA's new administrator condemned the country's use of launch technology that makes uncontrolled reentries from orbit.\nThe rocket body that captured headlines around the world for more than a week was used during the April 28 launch of Tianhe, the core module of a new space station China is constructing in orbit.\nThe launch was only the second for the nation's new Long March 5B; the vehicle's first launch, on May 5, 2020, also resulted in an uncontrolled reentry, this time raining pieces down in inhabited villages in Côte d'Ivoire, according to reports at the time, luckily with no casualties.\nThe rocket's first launch lofted an uncrewed test flight of the vehicle that astronauts will ride into orbit in conjunction with the new space station's construction.\nChina plans two more Long March 5B launches in 2022 for experiment modules to join Tianhe, according to Space News; crew and cargo launches associated with the station appear poised to use other rockets in the Long March family.\nIt is unclear whether China plans any modifications in these future launches to avoid space debris.\nRelated: China's huge rocket falling from space highlights orbital debris problem\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson, just days into his leadership of the agency, released a statement Saturday (May 8) after the U.S. Space Command's 18th Space Control Squadron confirmed the Chinese Long March 5B core stage re-entered the atmosphere at 10:14 p.m. EDT (0214 GMT) and fell into the Indian Ocean north of the Maldives.\n\"Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,\" Nelson said in a statement posted on NASA's website.\n\"It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris.\"\nThe China Manned Engineering Office confirmed what the U.S. military posted, according to Al-Jazeera.\n\"The last-stage wreckage of the Long March 5B Yao-2 launch vehicle has reentered the atmosphere\" and most pieces had burned up, the statement noted.\nChinese officials said earlier this week that the risk posed to Earth's population by the 23-ton (21-metric ton) core stage was low.\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\nAs of early Monday (May 10), the White House had not released a statement about the Chinese incident, although earlier in the week, said it was closely monitoring what would happen and encouraged China to follow international standards in space debris.\nU.S. Space Command's first statement about the core stage fall noted the entity \"does not conduct direct notifications to individual governments.\"\nCongress banned NASA from making bilateral agreements or cooperating with China in April 2011, and the agencies have had limited official contact in the decade since, although collaborations still happen.\nFor example, NASA collaborated with China to use the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to monitor the Chang'e-4 lander and Yutu 2 rover that alighted on the far side of the moon in January 2019.\nAt the time, NASA (which said it had certified its work with Congress) told Scientific American the prohibition did not apply to LRO tracking.\nFurther, the agency said that the activity did not \"pose a risk of resulting in the transfer of technology, data or other information with national security or economic security implications to China,\" and that the relevant Chinese space authorities NASA is interacting with \"do not involve knowing interactions with officials who have been determined by the U.S. to have direct involvement with violations of human rights.\"\nIf property damage or casualties occurred due to the rocket body's fall, China is technically responsible under the liability convention of the 1967 United Nations' Outer Space Treaty.\nThat said, one country has successfully gained compensation from this international agreement — Canada, which dealt with radiation in its north following the fall of Soviet nuclear satellite Kosmos 954 in 1977.\nSpace debris expert Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Space.com on Friday (May 7) that the sheer size of China's rocket made this a larger piece of uncontrolled debris to deal with than we've seen in several decades, since the community has adopted more stringent policies about launch debris.\nThe international standard, he said, is not to allow huge rockets to achieve orbit, instead cutting off their engines a little early to force them back into Earth in a predictable location.\nAny payload requiring orbital operations are boosted through another smaller stage.\n\"It is critical that China and all spacefaring nations and commercial entities act responsibly and transparently in space to ensure the safety, stability, security and long-term sustainability of outer space activities,\" Nelson wrote in the NASA statement.",

Videos circulating on Chinese social media showed crowds running from the wobbling building, with some screaming and looking back over their shoulders. The weather was fine at the time and there were no reports of an earthquake in the region. No deaths or injuries were reported. The SEG Plaza in Shenzhen began to shake around 12:30 p.m. local time. Some 15,000 people were inside, according to the official newspaper of the Shenzhen Municipal Communist Party Committee. All those inside were evacuated within 90 minutes, local authorities said. Authorities investigating the cause of the shake said in a statement that no “abnormalities in the main structure and surrounding environment of the building” had been found. The city’s meteorological station reported a maximum wind speed of around 20 mph (32 kph)  at midday Tuesday – a rate of motion described as a “fresh breeze” by the US National Weather Service .

REUTERS/Lam Yik [1/5] Electronic candlelights are displayed at the June 4th Museum, which commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, as it reopens in Hong Kong, China, May 30, 2021. REUTERS/Lam Yik Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab HONG KONG, June 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's June 4th Museum, dedicated to commemorating the victims of China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, said on Wednesday it would temporarily close due to a licensing investigation. The museum said in a statement that officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) entered its premises on Tuesday, claiming it had not obtained a public entertainment venue licence and was potentially in breach of regulations. FEHD said in a statement its probe was launched after it had received a complaint that the venue operated without a licence. The museum, opened a decade ago and run by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, said it would seek legal advice, and close until further notice to protect the safety of staff and visitors. \"Facing the current difficult political situation, the Alliance deeply believes that Hong Kongers will not forget June 4,\" the statement said. The Alliance \"hopes Hong Kongers will continue to be wise, flexible and determined to commemorate June 4 legally, safely, peacefully, rationally in their own way, at a suitable time and place, such that the truth will not be forgotten.\" The inspection raises concerns over freedom of speech in Hong Kong, which traditionally holds the largest June 4 vigil in the world to commemorate the crackdown. Mainland China bans commemorations and heavily censors the topic. After Beijing set the financial hub onto an authoritarian path with its imposition of a sweeping national security law last year, fears have grown that such vigils - which typically draw tens of thousands - would not be allowed any more. Police have cited coronavirus restrictions to ban the vigil for the second consecutive year this year. Authorities have warned the public that taking part in an unauthorised assembly raises the risk of up to five years in prison, while \"advertising or publicising\" illegal rallies may lead to up to 12 months. Commemorations are particularly awkward for Beijing this year, as the Communist Party celebrates its 100th anniversary. Asked whether a vigil would violate the security law, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said only that it was important to show respect to the Party. The museum reopened on Sunday after closing for renovations for several weeks. The Alliance's chairman Lee Cheuk-Yan is in jail accused of participating in an unauthorised assembly. Sign up here.

CNSA/Handout via REUTERS Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING, May 22 (Reuters) - A remote-controlled Chinese motorised rover drove down the ramp of its landing capsule on Saturday and onto the surface of Mars, making China the first nation to orbit, land and deploy a land vehicle on its inaugural mission to the Red Planet. Zhurong, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, drove down to the surface of Mars at 10:40 a.m. Beijing time (0240 GMT), according to the rover's official Chinese social media account. China this month joined the United States as the only nations to deploy land vehicles on Mars. The former Soviet Union landed a craft in 1971, but it lost communication seconds later. The 240-kg (530-pound) Zhurong, which has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera, will study the planet's surface soil and atmosphere. Powered by solar energy, Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any subsurface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar during its 90-day exploration of the Martian surface. Zhurong will move and stop in slow intervals, with each interval estimated to be just 10 metres (33 feet) over three days, according to the official China Space News. \"The slow progress of the rover was due to the limited understanding of the Martian environment, so a relatively conservative working mode was specially designed,\" Jia Yang, an engineer involved in the mission, told China Space News. Jia said he would not rule out a faster pace in the later stage of the rover's mission, depending on its operational state at the time. Jia said the rover was designed to be highly autonomous because the distance to Mars, at 320 million km (200 million miles), means a signal takes 40 minutes to travel both ways, posing a hurdle for real-time control of the rover. Martian temperatures are also a problem, he said: a nighttime drop to minus 130 degrees Celsius (minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit)freezes carbon dioxide, covering the uneven ground with a layer of dry ice - a terrain risk for the rover. Zhurong has an automated suspension system that can lift and lower its chassis by 60 centimetres (2 feet), the only rover with such a capability, according to China Space News. The rover is covered by nano-aerogel plates to protect its body from the cold. Dust storms could also affect the rover's ability to generate power through its solar panels, Jia said. To overcome this, the panel surface is made with a material that cannot be easily stained by dust and can easily shake dust off by vibration, he said. ANCIENT OCEAN China's uncrewed Tianwen-1 spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year. After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached the Red Planet in February where it had been in orbit since. On May 15, the landing capsule carrying the rover separated from Tianwen-1 and touched down on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, believed to be the site of an ancient ocean. The first images taken by the rover were released by the Chinese space agency on Wednesday , opens new tab . The coordinates of the landing site are 109.9 degrees east and 25.1 degrees north, China Space News said. Tianwen-1 was one of three probes that reached Mars in February. U.S. rover Perseverance touched down on Feb. 18 in a huge depression called Jezero Crater, more than 2,000 km (1,240 miles) from Utopia Planitia. Hope - the third spacecraft to arrive in February - is not designed to land. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is orbiting above Mars, gathering data on its weather and atmosphere. Perseverance and Zhurong are among three robotic rovers operating on Mars. The third is NASA's Curiosity, which landed in 2012. NASA’s InSight, which arrived on the surface of the planet in 2018 to study its interior, is a stationary module. Sign up here.

On June 10, 2021, the Data Security Law (DSL) was passed and it became effective on Sept. 1, 2021. This is a broader law applying to data processing activities for personal and non-personal information, both electronic and non-electronic. It addresses many critical gaps present in the country’s 2016 Cybersecurity Law. On Aug. 20, 2021, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) was passed and went into effect on Nov. 1, 2021. This law more closely mirrors the EU’s GDPR and regulates processing personal information. It provides more rights to Chinese consumers like the ability to access, correct, and delete their personal data. Both laws place emphasis on national security and accordingly model principles around data processing , cross-border transfers, and enforcement. Organizations located in the U.S. that handle Chinese data need to understand the sweeping effects that will follow from these laws and make all necessary changes to privacy compliance plans. Key Features of Each Law As noted, the DSL is broader and operates more like catchall legislation because there were many gaps hindering data handling regulation and enforcement under the Cybersecurity Law. Below are some of the DSL’s key provisions: The Cybersecurity Law primarily focuses on managing data and security applying to website and app operators, but the DSL more widely encompasses all organizations that process data (electronic and non-electronic) that could affect national security, public interest, or lawful consumer rights. The definition of public interest is still unclear and could be interpreted broadly when enforcement actions ensue. The DSL also regulates the entire process of obtaining, exporting, and using data to ensure all activities are monitored appropriately. The DSL applies to activities outside of China, which means US companies that handle data falling under this law need to ensure it is protected and used properly. The DSL directs the Chinese government to establish a data classification system that dictates which data is of the utmost importance and requires heavier scrutiny – like information pertaining to national security or key public interests. Guidance on data classification and data processing is expected to be released in the near future. Data processors are required to establish a security policy and system to monitor risk. There are regular reporting requirements for processors that handle data needing higher levels of protection. All other processors are only required to report security breaches. The DSL also endorses the Cybersecurity Law’s safety review requirement when exporting core data – like information pertinent to national security. Penalties are more severe under the DSL with fines up to RMB2 million (almost 310,000 USD) for data breaches. The penalty ceiling increases to RMB10 million (almost 1.6 million USD) if the data affects national interests. An organization that does not maintain compliance with the law may also face potential suspension or closure. It is still unclear which agency will carry out enforcement under this law. The PIPL more narrowly regulates data processing activities related to personal consumer information, like social security numbers and other sensitive identifiers. Below are some of the PIPL’s key provisions: Data processors need to notify consumers of their data rights, like the right to know the purpose for collecting personal information and the right to modify or delete data. Consent is necessary before data collection, sensitive information should only be minimally processed when necessary for a legitimate purpose, and retention should be controlled so consumer data is not just sitting on company servers with no purpose. Data controllers need to appoint a personal information protection officer and conduct continual impact assessments to ensure data is handled appropriately. The presumption of fault rests with the data processors. There are restrictions on data transfers between China and other countries, including a security review mandate or standard data transfer agreement. Organizations that do not maintain compliance will face fines up to five percent of their annual turnover or $7.7 million USD, whichever is a higher amount. Data Privacy Compliance Tips The emerging trend with global privacy laws is that being proactive fosters successful compliance. It can be difficult to keep up with what laws apply to an organization’s activities, as most new privacy laws have an extraterritorial effect similar to China’s new laws. The good news is that this is not the first rodeo for many larger corporations that likely have already implemented a global privacy compliance program or have one in the works. While some of an organization’s data controls will undoubtedly further compliance under the DSL and PIPL, there are some specific considerations requiring policy changes in light of the broadly worded legislation and strict security review standards. When dealing with cross-border data transfers falling under the purview of either law, U.S. organizations need to be prepared for China’s security review. Being proactive with data use and retention policies and tightening security measures can help streamline this process. Also pay close attention to the collection practices of any technology or vendors the organization utilizes to ensure the standards are sufficient. Risk assessments should be conducted periodically, especially when implementing new technology workflows or partnerships. Organizations should also include consent tracking in their privacy compliance plans, monitor further directions from China regarding data classification and enforcement, maintain regular impact assessments, create training manuals for employees handling or exporting Chinese data, and make compliance comparison charts to differentiate between other privacy laws like the GDPR or any applicable U.S. state laws.

The astronauts rode to Tianhe - the module that will be the living quarters of China's completed space station - on Shenzhou-12, or \"Divine Vessel\".

If the ISS - backed mainly by the United States, Russia, Japan, Europe and Canada - is decommissioned, China would be the operator of the only active space station. That would potentially give it greater power in shaping future norms and regulations for near-Earth space, which is already teeming with Chinese satellites , opens new tab . Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"At this current stage, we haven't considered the participation of international astronauts, but their future participation will be guaranteed,\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space programme. \"I'm aware that many countries have expressed their wish in this regard,\" Zhou told foreign reporters at the Shenzhou launch site in northwestern Gansu province. Shenzhou-12 is the third of 11 missions - four of which will be crewed - needed to complete China's first full-fledged space station. Construction began in April with the launch of Tianhe, a cylinder-like module slightly bigger than a city bus. The Shenzhou-12 astronauts Nie Haisheng, 56, Liu Boming, 54, and Tang Hongbo, 45, will test out technologies on Tianhe including its life-support system. They will also be monitored for how they fare in space physically and psychologically. An upcoming mission to the space station will last six months. Barred by U.S. law from working with NASA and by extension on the ISS, China has spent the past decade developing technologies to build its own space station, in addition to planning missions to the moon, Mars and other planets. China plans to allow Hong Kong astronauts to join future missions, Zhou also said. Three Chinese astronauts flew to an unfinished space station in China's first crewed mission since 2016, expanding the country's already growing near-Earth presence and challenging U.S. leadership in orbital space.

The veteran astronaut has been hailed by his team as a bastion of stability and a teacher figure who constantly challenges others with tough questions. \"As long as we have him in our hearts, we have nothing to fear,\" fellow astronaut Wang Yaping, who is part of the Shenzhou-12 backup team, told state media previously. \"In our crew, elder brother Nie is like the needle that stills the sea,\" she said. Liu Boming, like Nie, was from the first batch of astronauts selected in the 1990s for China's space programme. Known for his intellect, Liu is often addressed by his colleagues as \"Little Zhuge\", the renowned military strategist who lived in China two millennia ago. On the Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008, Liu famously used a crowbar to pry open the hatch after it refused to open. Former air force pilot Tang Hongbo, 45, was from a later batch of astronauts, and trained for more than a decade before being selected for his first spaceflight on Shenzhou-12. \"I've waited for 11 years, and finally I'm ready, and I can contribute my strength,\" Tang told reporters on Wednesday. Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first space walk ever on the 2008 Shenzhou mission.

REUTERS/Stringer/Files Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab SHANGHAI, June 28 (Reuters) - The giant Baihetan hydropower plant on the upstream branch of China's Yangtze river has begun generating electricity for the first time on Monday, state broadcaster CCTV reported. The project's first two 1-gigawatt (GW) turbines will start operating after a three-day trial, CCTV said. The project will eventually consist of 16 such units, making its total generation capacity second only to the Three Gorges Dam once it is completed in July next year. Baihetan was built by the China Three Gorges Corporation and is located on the border between the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It is part of a cascade of dams on the Jinsha river, which is the upstream section of the Yangtze. Though the Three Gorges Corporation said it was one of China's biggest and most challenging engineering projects, with a dam height of 289 metres (948 feet), it has taken only four years to build. Coverage of the project in China's state media has been heavy, with CCTV and Xinhua both focusing on the advanced engineering and manufacturing capabilities required. President Xi Jinping also endorsed the dam in a letter published on Monday. \"As a major project in China's west-east power transmission program, Baihetan is the largest and most technically difficult hydropower project currently under construction in the world,\" said Xi, adding the project has marked a major breakthrough in China's high-end equipment manufacturing. The project is part of a national scheme to generate electricity and deliver it to high energy-consuming regions on the eastern coast, and is also designed to strengthen control over water flows during the heavy summer flood season. An ultra-high voltage (UHV) electricity transmission line connecting Baihetan to the eastern province of Jiangsu started construction in late 2020 and is expected to launch in 2022. Another UHV from Baihetan to Zhejiang province, also in eastern China, is waiting for Beijing's approval. Provinces in eastern and central China with larger populations and more developed economies have been experiencing electricity shortages during peak demand periods. read more Additionally, regions that used to rely on coal for electricity generation are scrambling to find clean power sources, mainly from regions in western China, to drive their economies amid pressure from the central government to meet climate change goals. In its latest five-year plan covering the period of 2021-2025, Sichuan province aims to complete the construction of 10 hydropower plants project and start building another seven. The 10.2-GW Wudongde hydro project, built upstream on the Jinsha from Baihetan, was put into full operation in mid-June. read more Environmental group have criticised the large-scale damming of the Yangtze and its tributaries because of concerns the over-engineering of the river has destroyed major habitats and damaged natural flood plains.

Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock China This article is more than 3 years old Fire at martial arts school in China kills 18 children This article is more than 3 years old Local media say victims of the fire in central China were boarding pupils aged between seven and 16 Agence France-Presse Sat 26 Jun 2021 07.02 BST First published on Sat 26 Jun 2021 06.16 BST Share At least 18 people have been killed and 16 injured after a fire broke out at a martial arts school in central China , according to the local government. Official state news agency Xinhua reported that all victims were boarding pupils, while local media said they were aged between seven and 16. The fire that occurred in the early hours of Friday was extinguished and authorities were investigating the cause of the blaze, a statement from the Zhecheng county government in Henan province, said. Four local officials including the county party secretary were fired over the incident, reported the Henan Daily, a local state-backed newspaper, on Saturday. Two more suspects were arrested in addition to the school’s manager Chen Lin, the Henan Daily said. There were 34 boarding students on the premises when the fire broke out, according to government staff quoted by Beijing Toutiao News. Those hurt – four of whom had severe injuries – were rushed to a local hospital, where an unnamed doctor told local media they were “doing everything they could” to save them. The cause of the fire was still unclear. An official said that the school was the Zhenxing Martial Arts Centre. An online listing for the school advertised hour-long classes each day for a range of martial arts disciplines and said the school “recruits boarding students year-round”, but offered no further details. Provincial party chief Lou Yangsheng told local media that the blaze was a “profound lesson”. The school had not gone through the fire safety auditing process required for martial arts training institutions, as the building had originally been a privately built house intended for other purposes, Xinhua reported Friday. Henan is the birthplace of traditional Chinese martial arts and is home to many kung fu academies. Social media users started to call for better fire safety standards online as a hashtag for the fire quickly garnered over 1.5mn views. Fatal fires are common in China , with safety regulations often flouted and patchy enforcement. More than two dozen people were killed in two blazes in Beijing’s migrant neighbourhoods in 2017. The first, which killed 19 people in November that year, prompted authorities to begin tearing down unsafe buildings in the capital, driving hundreds of thousands of residents out in the middle of winter. A huge blaze that swept a 28-storey Shanghai residential block in 2010 killed 58 people. Friday’s blaze comes at a sensitive time for China’s ruling Communist Party as it ramps up security preparations before its 100th anniversary celebrations on 1 July.

An aerial view of Chengdu Tianfu International Airport.  Photo by VCG via Getty Images. Visual China Group/Getty Images CNN — China’s long-awaited Chengdu Tianfu International Airport has officially begun operations, offering travelers a new gateway to the home of giant pandas. Its inaugural flight, operated by Sichuan Airlines, took off at 11:10 a.m. on Sunday, bound for Beijing. Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, is now the third city in the country to have two international airports, joining Shanghai and Beijing. Constructed at a cost of about 70 billion Chinese yuan ($10.8 billion), phase one of the massive aviation hub has the capacity to handle up to 60 million passengers per year, further opening up the country’s southwest region. Three runways and two terminals, covering a total area of 710,000 square meters, are in operation. State media outlet Xinhua reported the airport will eventually house terminals covering 1.4 million square meters, capable of handling 120 million passengers annually. Passengers prepare to board an airplane at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport on June 27. Visual China Group/Getty Images In addition to the famous pandas, Sichuan is famous for its spicy cuisine and beautiful scenery, making it one of China’s most-popular tourist destinations among both domestic and international tourists. For now, however, the new airport will only be catering to the former. China remains closed to most international travelers. “The new airport in Chengdu was needed to accommodate continued rapid growth,” said aviation analyst Brendan Sobie. “China’s domestic market has already fully recovered from the pandemic and will continue to grow rapidly. Given the size of the city and its central location in China, Chengdu is very well-positioned to benefit.” According to the latest figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), China’s domestic traffic was up 6.8% in April 2021, compared to April 2019.  The Baiyun International Airport in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou unseated Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson to become the world’s busiest airport in 2020. Prior to the pandemic, the old Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport was the fourth-largest in the country, by passenger volume. In 2020, “it was actually the second largest as it was less impacted by the pandemic than other major airports due to its high reliance on the domestic market,” adds Sobie. Traveling to China during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go China’s airport ambitions The new Chengdu Tianfu International Airport was designed by a consortium made up of the China Southwest Architectural Design and Research Institute, China Airport Construction Group Corporation and French architectural firm ADP Ingenierie. Phase one took five years to complete and features an array of cutting-edge technologies, including facial recognition software, self-check-in kiosks, smart security systems, self-boarding gates and AI robot concierges. A metro line connects the airport with the city center. Hitting speeds of up to 140 kilometers per hour, the train journey takes from 37 to 44 minutes. A metro line connecting the new facility to the Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is due for completion in 2023. Video Ad Feedback Inside Beijing's new mega-airport 02:52 - Source: CNN Chengdu Tianfu International Airport is just one of many airports China plans to open in the coming years. The country aims to have 400 airports in use by 2035, a huge leap from the current 241, according to the Transportation Network Planning Outline issued by the government in early 2021. Beijing is building hundreds of airports as millions of Chinese take to the skies The most notable facility to open in China in recent years is Beijing’s massive Daxing International Airport, which began operations in 2019 . Designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid and her Chinese partners, it boasts a terminal the size of 97 soccer pitches. Prior to its opening, the city had been in desperate need of a second global gateway. The Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) was the world’s second-busiest aviation hub and hitting full capacity, making it nearly impossible for airlines to add flights at desirable times.

Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images BEIJING — China's ruling Communist Party is throwing itself a party, kicking off a month of celebrations today to memorialize its founding 100 years ago. Across China, newspapers and buildings alike have been blanketed in red party propaganda. Three Chinese astronauts in space beamed back congratulations to the party. And online censors and police have been working overtime for the past month to ensure no disturbances mar the heavily scripted ceremonies held in Beijing today. Asia China's Tough Hong Kong Law Turns 1 Year Old — And It's Already Grown Teeth World U.S. Imposes Severe Travel Restrictions On Chinese Communist Party Members Beijing's celebrations began with a patriotic show in Tiananmen Square. As helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, hundreds of school children, party members, and front-line health care workers sang songs like, \"Socialism Is Good\" and \"Without the Chinese Communist Party, There Would Be No New China.\" But the centerpiece of the celebrations was a fiery speech given by Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping. \"The Chinese people will never allow any foreign forces to bully, oppress or enslave us. Anyone who dares will have their heads cracked and their blood will flow before the steel Great Wall built with the flesh and blood of 1.4 billion Chinese people,\" said Xi, as he stood in front of Beijing's imperial palace on Thursday morning. Sponsor Message Wearing a grey Mao suit and flanked by party leaders past and present, Xi spent more than an hour laying out the Communist Party's achievements over the past century while making the case that it remains the only political force capable of governing China. \"The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, with their bravery and tenacity, solemnly proclaim to the world that the Chinese people are not only good at taking down the old world, but also good at building a new one,\" Xi proclaimed. \"Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China.\" From a secret meeting on a boat to a world superpower China's Communist Party was actually founded on July 23, 1921 by a mixture of Chinese and foreign revolutionaries in Shanghai. Fearful of spies, a group of Chinese-only members reached their final agreements on a boat in nearby Zhejiang province. However, nearly two decades later, party leaders sheltering in the dusty caves of China's northern city of Yan'an decided July 1 would be the official date of commemoration. For Xi and other leaders at the helm of the party, this year's birthday is an important chance to recast an organization originally designed to foment revolution among rural peasants into one that can be seen as a powerful government overseeing an increasingly sophisticated global economy. Sponsor Message Party leaders must do so in a world that is now largely hostile to its global ambitions. The latest Pew Research polling shows negative views on China remain at historic highs around the world, spurred on by China's increasingly aggressive diplomats and nationalistic citizens.

Only a strong army means a safe country,\" Xi said. Asia China Sends A Record 28 Military Planes Into Airspace Controlled By Taiwan He also said Beijing would maintain its iron grip over Hong Kong. By no coincidence, July 1 is also the anniversary for the resumption of Chinese control over Hong Kong. The same date was then chosen to implement a sweeping National Security Law, which already has quieted nearly all dissent in the territory. Key among the achievements Xi listed in the party's centennial celebrations was the elimination of extreme poverty and a series of economic reform that unleashed a commercial boom while also widening social inequality. But the primary raison d'être for the Communist Party always has been pursuing what the party calls the \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" — a nation that, in 1921, remained ravaged by civil war, imperial mismanagement, and foreign colonialism. On this count, China now boasts an economic might that can cripple smaller economics, and a geopolitical heft that has earned it spots in nearly every major multilateral institution. \"Back then we lagged so far behind. We could only look up at Western countries. We were standing at the bottom of the stairs when the West was at the top,\" said Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times , a nationalist government paper. \"Nowadays China has caught up with the rest of the world. China's economy has expanded and with it, its general power.\" Sponsor Message Consolidation of power Xi's message of strength masks any internal divisions that may have emerged in the decades since the party came to power . He has overseen the most thorough purge of Communist party officials since the 1970s on anti-corruption grounds, jailed his high-level political rivals , and brought powerful business tycoons to heel . \"There is no other party in the world like ours, one that has encountered so many challenges and difficulties, experienced so many life-or-death ordeals, or suffered such tragic sacrifices,\" wrote an editorial in China's preeminent Communist Party-run newspaper, People's Daily . This consolidation of his control over the party as well as the party's control over all levels of state governance has sparked pushback. \"The party feels that it can govern forever. But it cannot,\" says Cai Xia , a former Communist Party professor who was expelled from its ranks last year. She now lives in the U.S., where she has become a prominent critic of Xi. But resistance is now quickly stifled by a powerful surveillance and security apparatus. During numerous crises in the past seven decades of its rule, the party decided to retain top-down control of the country's political levers each time. That includes the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989 , in which an untold number of civilians and students were killed as troops put a fatal end to pro-democracy protests in the very square where Xi delivered his speech today. \"The party is like the patriarch of a big, traditional Chinese family. Everything he says goes,\" said Deng Yuwen, a former senior editor at a party-run newspaper who now lives in the U.S. \"If you respect him, he might show you some favors. But if you cross him, then he will banish you from the family.\" Xi himself has emerged as a more ideologically motivated leader than his predecessors, overseeing a resurgence of the party's visibility and role in private business , media , and education . Sponsor Message Few current party leaders can boast socialist credentials that exceed those of Xi. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a senior party leader, and the younger Xi spent his early childhood living in a compound with the families of the other Communist elite. Political turmoil during the 1960s forced Xi, then a teenager, to spend seven years living in a cave home in a remote village, toiling among farmers to better learn the mechanics of socialism. \"[The party's] history is a history in which the party and the people are linked by shared destiny, heart-to-heart, soul-to-soul,\" Xi said at a February speech.

An expert team traveled in May this year to verify China's malaria-free status. It has not had an indigenous case for four years. https://p.dw.com/p/3vnNs China once reported 30 million cases a year Image: picture-alliance/NHPA/A. Bannister Advertisement The World Health Organization (WHO) declared China malaria-free on Wednesday, after a 70 year old effort to eradicate the disease. \"We congratulate the people of China on ridding the country of malaria. Their success was hard-earned and came only after decades of targeted and sustained action. With this announcement, China joins the growing number of countries that are showing the world that a malaria-free future is a viable goal,\" said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 70 years of efforts China used to report around 30 million cases per year in the 1940s. Since then, government efforts and initiatives led to a steady decline in cases. The WHO said China started to distribute medicine to prevent the disease in risk areas decades ago. Mosquito-breeding areas have also been systematically reduced and insect repellents and protective nets have been made widely available. A scientific program in 1967 to find new malaria treatments led to the discovery of artemisinin, which is the core compound of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). In the 1980s, China was among the first countries to extensively test the use of insecticide-treated nets to prevent malaria. In the 1990s, China had come down to 117,000, and deaths had been cut by 95%. From 2003, China ramped up efforts even further. Annual case numbers were brought down to 5,000 per year. To be declared free of the mosquito-borne disease , countries can apply for WHO certification after three years of no indigenous cases. This is followed by presenting evidence, and demonstrating the capacity to prevent an outbreak. China applied for WHO certification in 2020, after four consecutive years of zero indigenous cases. Experts traveled to the country in May this year to verify the malaria-free status, and preparedness to prevent future outbreaks. Malaria around the world Malaria is transmitted by the infected anopheles mosquito. If not treated in time, it has the potential to become life-threatening. Symptoms include high fever, headache, and chills, among others. According to the WHO, around 40 countries have won the fight against malaria. China is the first country in the western Pacific region to achieve this breakthrough in 30 years. Other countries to gain the status recently were El Salvador, Algeria and Argentina, and Paraguay and Uzbekistan. The WHO's last World Malaria Report says there were 229 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2019. The estimated number of deaths was 409,000 in 2019, compared to 411,000 deaths in 2018. Africa accounts for 94% of all malaria cases. tg/aw (dpa, AFP, AP) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Malaria: Infections halved in children in Ivory Coast using new technology Malaria: Infections halved in children in Ivory Coast using new technology Malaria is a leading cause of death for children and is most prevalent in some of the world's poorest countries.

The Hong Kong-listed company's shares plunged about 15% on Tuesday prior to a trading halt. China Gas said it had applied to the stock exchange for its shares to resume trading from Wednesday morning. China Gas added that the operation right for piped gas in that area was originally owned by a gas company under Dongfeng Motor Corp, which in 2015 contributed the gas pipeline network while a China Gas unit contributed cash to jointly establish Shiyan Dongfeng, the unit in question.

CCTV via Reuters TV Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday urged political parties worldwide to oppose any country that engages in \"technology blockades\", an allusion to the United States which views China as its strategic competitor. As U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has sought support from like-minded democracies including the European Union and Japan to coordinate a tougher stance against China, Beijing has doubled down on seeking support and affirmation from friendly nations such as North Korea and Serbia. \"Together, we must oppose all acts of unilateralism in the name of multilateralism, hegemony and power politics,\" Xi told a virtual gathering of representatives of 500 parties from 160 countries such as Russia, Zimbabwe, Cuba and Burkina Faso. \"Looking from the angle of 'My Country First', the world is narrow and crowded, and often full of fierce competition,\" Xi said in apparent reference to former U.S. President Donald Trump's \"America First\" policy. Xi renewed a call to work towards \"building a community with a shared future for mankind\" and said any country that engages in \"technology blockades\" and \"developmental decoupling\" should be rejected. Chinese diplomats have often criticised the United States for allegedly trying to hamper China's development by cutting off its access to U.S. technology. In a speech last week to a domestic audience in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, Xi said foreign forces trying to bully China will \"have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people\". read more Xi, also General Secretary of the Communist Party of China,  was on Tuesday speaking at the CPC and World Political Parties Summit, one of many events held by Beijing to commemorate the centenary of the ruling party. The virtual gathering was meant to help the international community \"adjust more quickly to the rise of China\" and for Beijing to gain more \"understanding, support and companionship,\" said Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the International Department, which organised the event. China is increasingly worried about its international image, tarnished by anger towards its initial handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, its maritime and territorial assertiveness towards neighbours, its clampdown in Hong Kong and treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, and its \"wolf-warrior\" diplomats who engage in a war of words with critics. A survey of 17 advanced economies released last Wednesday by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center showed that views about China have remained broadly negative and confidence in Xi near historic lows. read more Sign up here.

VCG | Visual China Group | Getty Images China's market regulator on Saturday said it would block Tencent Holdings ' plan to merge the country's top two videogame streaming sites, Huya and DouYu , on antitrust grounds. Tencent first announced plans to merge Huya and DouYu last year in a tie-up designed to streamline its stakes in the firms, which were estimated by data firm MobTech to have an 80% slice of a market worth more than $3 billion and growing fast. Tencent is Huya's biggest shareholder with 36.9% and also owns over a third of DouYu, with both firms listed in the United States, and worth a combined $5.3 billion in market value. Reuters first reported the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) plan to block the deal on Monday, which came after the regulator reviewed additional concessions proposed by Tencent for the merger. SAMR said Huya and DouYu's combined market share in the video game live streaming industry would be over 70% and their merger would strengthen Tencent's dominance in this market, given Tencent already has over 40% market share in the online games operations segment. Huya and DouYu are ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, as China's most popular video game streaming sites, where users flock to watch e-sports tournaments and follow professional gamers. Tencent said in a statement it \"will abide by the decision, comply with all regulatory requirements, operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and fulfill our social responsibilities.\" The deal termination comes amid an ongoing crackdown on Chinese tech companies from the government. Earlier this year, the anti-monopoly regulator placed a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. Huya and DouYu did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the SAMR decision. In a memo from SAMR published concurrently with the announcement, Zhang Chenying, a member of the state council's anti-trust committee, argued the deal would prevent fair competition. \"If Huya and DouYu are to merge, the original joint control of Douyu will become Tencent's complete control of a merged entity,\" Zhang wrote. \"Considering factors such as revenue, active users, livestreaming resources and other key indices, we can expect that a merger would eliminate or restrict fair competition.\" Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Supply Chain Values CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Digital Products News Releases Closed Captioning Corrections About CNBC Internships Site Map Ad Choices Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

The International Union for Conservation of Nature removed giant pandas from its list of endangered species in 2016 — a decision that Chinese officials challenged at the time. \"If we downgrade their conservation status, or neglect or relax our conservation work, the populations and habitats of giant pandas could still suffer irreversible loss and our achievements would be quickly lost,\" China's State Forestry Administration told The Associated Press at the time. \"Therefore, we're not being alarmist by continuing to emphasize the panda species' endangered status.\" Enlarge this image Two giant pandas, Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, are seen at the Bifeng Gorge Base of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Yaan city in 2008.

Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images It's not clear that the number of giant pandas living in the wild has changed significantly since 2016, when IUCN first made its decision. At the end of 2015, there were 1,864 pandas living in the wild, according to a Reuters report that cites the Chinese government. That number was a significant increase from the 1,100 giant pandas that were living in the wild and 422 living in captivity in 2000. In a statement to NPR, the World Wildlife Fund called it \"another sign of hope for the species.\" \"Thanks to decades of collaboration between the Chinese government, local communities, companies and NGOs, the giant panda's future is more secure,\" said Colby Loucks, WWF's Vice President for Wildlife Conservation. Sponsor Message \"China's successful conservation of giant pandas shows what can be achieved when political will and science join forces,\" he continued. \"Continuing these conservation efforts is critical, but we need to stay vigilant on the current and future impacts climate change may have on giant pandas and their mountainous forest habitat.\" Still, giant pandas aren't out of the woods just yet. They live in bamboo forests, which are at risk due to climate change.

After 36 hours of search operations, rescue workers found 23 people buried in the rubble - six of whom were found alive. A preliminary investigation found the collapse was caused by the owner altering the structure of the building, according to the Global Times. The building is said to have undergone frequent renovations in recent years. \"The building used to have only three floors, but over the years they have been adding extra floors,\" one resident told news outlet Red Star News. The Jiangsu Provincial Government said an investigations team was looking into the accident, adding that \"relevant individuals\" would face criminal charges. The collapse of the Siji Kaiyuan Hotel in Suzhou happened on Monday afternoon at 15:33 local time (07:33 GMT). More than 600 rescue workers were deployed to the scene. Getty Images Some 23 people were found in the rubble There were initially believed to be 18 people in the 54-room hotel at the time of the collapse, but it was later revealed there were five unregistered guests inside. Out of the six people found alive, five are said to be injured but in stable condition.  One person suffered no injuries. Building collapses in China have in the past been linked to poor construction work. Nearby residents had a lucky escape when a three-storey building collapsed Last year, 29 people died after a hotel collapse in Fujian province.

The typhoon landed in the Putuo district of the city of Zhoushan, a major port in the east coast province of Zhejiang, at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV said, citing the China Meteorological Administration. The storm hit as central China is still reeling from record flooding that killed at least 58, cut off power and forced the relocation of more than 1 million people. “We will make every effort to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property, and do everything to minimize disaster losses, and strive to achieve the goal of no deaths and few injuries and economic losses,” said Yuan Jiajun, the Zhejiang province Communist Party secretary, during an inspection of preparations on Saturday, official media reported.

In-fa’s wind speeds were up to 38 meters per second, the Meteorological Administration said. That is equal to about 137 kph (85 mph), according to Reuters calculations. It was due to travel north along the Zhejiang coast from around noon, passing Shanghai and reaching northeastern Jiangsu province by the evening. The Zhejiang emergency management department upgraded its typhoon response to the highest level on Saturday, closing schools and markets, and suspending road traffic when necessary.

China reported 55 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Monday as an outbreak of the fast-spreading Delta variant reached more than 20 cities and more than a dozen provinces. Local governments in major cities including Beijing have now tested millions of residents, while cordoning off residential compounds and placing close contacts under quarantine. The capital city has cut all rail, bus and air links with areas where coronavirus cases have been found, and closed its doors to tourists during the peak summer holiday travel season. Only “essential travellers” are allowed to enter, if they have a negative nucleic acid test. On Sunday city officials called for residents not to leave Beijing “unless necessary”. The central city of Zhuzhou in Hunan province on Monday ordered more than 1.2 million residents to stay home under strict lockdown for three days as it rolled out a citywide testing and vaccination campaign, according to an official statement. “The situation is still grim and complicated,” the Zhuzhou government said. Beijing has previously boasted of its success in bringing domestic cases down to virtually zero after coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, allowing the economy to rebound. But the latest outbreak, which has been linked to a cluster in Nanjing where nine cleaners at an international airport tested positive on 20 July, is threatening that success with more than 360 domestic cases reported in the past two weeks. In the tourist destination of Zhangjiajie, near Zhuzhou, an outbreak spread last month among theatre patrons who then brought the virus back to their homes around the country. Zhangjiajie locked down all 1.5 million residents on Friday. Officials are urgently seeking people who have recently travelled from Nanjing or Zhangjiajie and have urged tourists not to travel to areas where cases have been found. The country is also battling a separate rise in cases in the flood-ravaged city of Zhengzhou in Henan province after two cleaners at a hospital treating coronavirus patients coming from abroad tested positive. More than 30 cases have been detected and all 10 million residents have been ordered to get tested. The head of the city’s health commission has also been sacked. The capital’s Changping district locked down 41,000 people in nine housing communities last week. New cases were also reported on Monday in the popular tourist destination of Hainan, the national health authorities said.

Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu has been arrested in China on suspicion of rape. VCG/Getty Images Hong Kong CNN — Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu has been formally arrested on suspicion of rape, prosecutors in Beijing said in a statement Monday. The move comes after 30-year-old Wu was first detained on July 31 by police in the Chinese capital, following an online outcry over sexual assault allegation against him in what has become the most high-profile #Metoo case in China. The allegations first emerged last month on Chinese social media platform Weibo, when a woman posting under the verified handle “Du Meizhu” alleged Wu, whose Chinese name is Wu Yifan, had sexually assaulted her while she was drunk at the pop star’s home, where she said she had gone for a casting interview. The woman, a student at the Communication University of China in Beijing, said she was 17 at the time of the alleged assault. Du later alleged that several other women, including two minors, had reached out to her to share similar experiences of being lured into having sex by Wu, who is one of China’s biggest stars. Wu’s representatives did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. The terse statement from the prosecutor’s office in Beijing’s Chaoyang said Wu’s arrest for suspected rape was formally approved Monday, but it did not offer any details on the charges. Before he was detained, Wu had denied the allegations on his personal Weibo account. His company said it was pursuing legal action against his accuser, calling the accusations “malicious rumors.” Supporters of Zhou Xiaoxuan, a feminist figure who rose to prominence during Chinas #MeToo movement two years ago, display posters outside the Haidian District Peoples Court in Beijing on December 2, 2020, in a sexual harassment case against one of China's best-known television hosts. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images Related article China's recent rape scandals are a #MeToo victory, activists say — even if the government won't admit it Wu, who was born in southern China but is a Canadian citizen, rose to fame as a member of popular Korean-Chinese pop group EXO, then as a solo act after he left the band in 2014. He starred in multiple movies and modeled for brands like Burberry, soon becoming one of the country’s top brand ambassadors. But many of his biggest brand partners were quick to distance themselves as the rape allegations spread in July. French fashion house Louis Vuitton, Italian luxury brand Bulgari and Chinese cosmetics brand Kans were among those that suspended or severed ties completely with the star. Wu’s dramatic downfall only accelerated after his detention. His once wildly popular social media accounts, including his Weibo page with more than 51 million followers, were taken down overnight. His songs were also removed from music streaming sites. On Monday evening, Wu’s arrest became the top trending topic on Weibo, with most comments supporting the police action. A related Weibo hashtag has been viewed 1.6 billion times as of Tuesday morning. China’s #MeToo movement Wu’s case is not the only #Metoo scandal that has rocked China in recent weeks. Last Monday,  the e-commerce giant Alibaba said it had fired an employee who was accused of sexually assaulting another employee during a business trip. In both cases, victims had posted their allegations on Chinese social media, which sparked an online furor and prompted police to investigate. The authorities’ swift actions won praise from some online, who pointed to the two cases as an indication of the effective rule of law and criminal justice in China. Yet it raised eyebrows among others, who argued the high-profile nature of the cases served to highlight how rare it is for survivors to speak out and seek justice. “It is unsurprising that both cases have drawn such wide attention, given (Kris Wu) and Alibaba’s high profile,” said Feng Yuan, a feminist scholar and activist. “But this also serves as a reminder that for many other cases of sexual harassment and assault, if the accused are not so famous or influential, (victims) might not have their voices heard at all.” Sexual assault survivors have long faced strong stigma and resistance in China, at the official level as well as among the public. The issue was pushed to the fore in 2018 when the #MeToo movement went global. In China, too, it prompted more women to share their experiences with sexual misconduct and assault – but the movement was quickly quashed, as the government moved to block growing online discussion, including censoring the hashtag and many related posts.

For instance, a government watchdog agency said the Kris Wu case illustrated “the black hand of the capital” and “the wild growth of the entertainment industry.” And in an editorial article, the state-run Global Times tabloid said the Alibaba scandal reflected a need for greater “legal and moral supervision” in the tech world, and for companies to better align their “capital” with societal values. Notably absent from official rhetoric is any emphasis on what activists say are the roots of the problem: lack of support for survivors of gender-based violence and entrenched gender inequality in many aspects of society. Part of the reason the government is so wary of acknowledging public outrage around these underlying issues is because it might encourage greater social organizing and activism, said Lv Pin, a prominent Chinese feminist now based in New York. Neither of the alleged victims who stepped forward in both the Kris Wu and Alibaba cases alluded to #MeToo, which can easily draw censorship on social media, Feng said. However, for many activists, the two cases still offer a ray of hope – and a sign that even if the government doesn’t want to talk about sexual misconduct, the public does. “No matter whether they call it #MeToo or not, the essence is #MeToo,” said Feng. “Although most prominent feminist social media accounts have been censored, the victims can always manage to find their own ways to speak out.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN World Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Chinese military conducted two hypersonic weapons tests over the summer, raising US concerns that Beijing is gaining ground in the race to develop a new generation of arms. On July 27 the Chinese military launched a rocket that used a “fractional orbital bombardment” system to propel a nuclear-capable “hypersonic glide vehicle” around the earth for the first time, according to four people familiar with US intelligence assessments. The Financial Times this week reported that the first test was in August, rather than at the end of July. China subsequently conducted a second hypersonic test on August 13, according to two people familiar with the matter. Three people familiar with the first test in July said it stunned the Pentagon and US intelligence because China managed to demonstrate a brand new weapons capability, although they declined to elaborate on the details. One person said government scientists were struggling to understand the capability, which the US does not currently possess, adding that China’s achievement appeared “to defy the laws of physics”. Space and missile experts have been debating the Chinese test since the FT revealed the event at the weekend. Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons expert at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said China appeared to have developed a new innovation, but stressed the need to maintain a degree of scepticism. “We should be open to the reality that China is also capable of technological innovation,” he said. “But I would be careful about exaggerated characterisations that may help excuse a mundane intelligence failure. If we say some innovation is impossible to imagine, then no one is really responsible for missing it.” Recommended Global Insight Kathrin Hille China’s bellicose behaviour is the driver of tensions in Asian waters The White House on Wednesday declined to comment. US government officials, including the defence secretary Lloyd Austin, have refused to confirm or deny the existence of the test, which remains classified. President Joe Biden on Wednesday expressed concern about hypersonic weapons. Asked as he departed Washington for Pennsylvania whether he was worried about the development of the high-speed manoeuvrable weapons, he responded, “yes”. The Chinese foreign ministry this week denied the FT story, saying it had only launched a space plane, but that test was conducted on July 16. The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on Wednesday. Speaking to the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes in Germany this week, Admiral Charles Richard, the head of Strategic Command who oversees US nuclear forces, said he was “not surprised” by the FT report. He added he also would not be surprised if more reports emerge next month. Richard, who has ramped up warnings about Chinese nuclear forces this year, told the newspaper that the “breathtaking expansion” meant China could “now execute any possible nuclear employment strategy”. Over the summer satellite images emerged that showed China was building several hundred silos to house intercontinental ballistic missiles. Ned Price, state department spokesperson, this week said the Biden administration was very concerned about the rapid expansion of China’s nuclear forces, including its development of “novel delivery systems”.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo [1/2] The Chinese national flag is seen in Beijing, China April 29, 2020. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab SHANGHAI, Aug 20 (Reuters) - China's National People's Congress on Friday passed a law designed to protect online user data privacy and will implement the policy from Nov. 1, according to state media outlet Xinhua. The law's passage completes another pillar in the country's efforts to regulate cyberspace and is expected to add more compliance requirements for companies in the country. China has instructed its tech giants to ensure better secure storage of user data, amid public complaints about mismanagement and misuse which have resulted in user privacy violations. The law states that handling of personal information must have clear and reasonable purpose and shall be limited to the \"minimum scope necessary to achieve the goals of handling\" data. It also lays out conditions for which companies can collect personal data, including obtaining an individual's consent, as well as laying out guidelines for ensuring data protection when data is transferred outside the country. The law further calls for handlers of personal information to designate an individual in charge of personal information protection, and for handlers to conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the law. The second draft of the Personal Information Protection law was released publicly in late April. The Personal Information Protection Law, along with the Data Security Law，mark two major regulations set to govern China's internet in the future. The Data Security law, to be implemented on Sept. 1, sets a framework for companies to classify data based on its economic value and relevance to China's national security. The Personal Information Protection Law, meanwhile, recalls Europe's GDPR in setting a framework to ensure user privacy. Both laws will require companies in China to examine their data storage and processing practices to ensure they are compliant, according to experts. RATTLED COMPANIES The laws arrive amid a broader regulatory tightening on industry from Chinese regulators, which have rattled companies large and small. In July, China's Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), its top cyberspace regulator, announced it would launch an investigation into Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc (DIDI.N) , opens new tab for allegedly violating user privacy. On Tuesday, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) passed a sweeping set of rules aimed at improving fair competition, banning practices such as fake online reviews. In January, the government-backed China Consumers Association issued a statement criticizing tech companies for \"bullying\" consumers into making purchases and promotions. read more . Since then, regulators have routinely reprimanded companies and apps for violating user privacy. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology accused 43 apps of illegally transferring user data and called on them to make rectifications before Aug. 24 read more . On the same day of Xinhua's announcement of the data privacy law's passage, the National People's Congress published an op-ed from state media outlet People's Court Daily praising the legislation. It called for entities that use algorithms for \"personalized decision making\" such as recommendations to first obtain user consent. \"Personalization is the result of a user's choice, and true personalized recommendations must ensure the user's freedom to choose, without compulsion,\" the op-ed read. \"Therefore, users must be given the right to not make use of personalized recommendation functions.\" Sign up here.

Companies and the public are under increasing pressure to align with its vision for a more powerful China and healthier society.\nThe party has reduced children’s access to online games and is trying to discourage what it sees as unhealthy attention to celebrities.\nBroadcasters must “resolutely put an end to sissy men and other abnormal aesthetics,” the National Radio and TV Administration said, using an insulting slang term for effeminate men — “niang pao,” or literally, “girlie guns.”\nThat reflects official concern that Chinese pop stars, influenced by the sleek, fashionable look of some South Korean and Japanese singers and actors, are failing to encourage China’s young men to be masculine enough.\nBroadcasters should avoid promoting “vulgar internet celebrities” and admiration of wealth and celebrity, the regulator said.\nInstead, programs should “vigorously promote excellent Chinese traditional culture, revolutionary culture, and advanced socialist culture.”\nXi’s government also is tightening control over Chinese internet industries.\n\nIt has launched anti-monopoly, data security, and other enforcement actions at companies including games and social media provider Tencent Holding and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group that the ruling party worries are too big and independent.\nRules that took effect Wednesday limit anyone under 18 to three hours per week of online games and prohibit play on school days.\nGame developers already were required to submit new titles for government approval before they could be released. Officials have called on them to add nationalistic themes.\nThe party also is tightening control over celebrities.\nBroadcasters should avoid performers who “violate public order” or have “lost morality,” the regulator said.\nPrograms about the children of celebrities also are banned.\nOn Saturday, microblog platform Weibo Corp. suspended thousands of accounts for fan clubs and entertainment news.\nA popular actress, Zhao Wei, has disappeared from streaming platforms without explanation. Her name has been removed from credits of movies and TV programs.\nThursday’s order told broadcasters to limit pay for performers and to avoid contract terms that might help them evade taxes.\nAnother actress, Zheng Shuang, was fined 299 million yuan ($46 million) last week on tax evasion charges in a warning to celebrities to be positive role models.",

(Photo: AFP) By AFP Published: September 13, 2021 06:13 AM GMT Updated: September 13, 2021 06:24 AM GMT Macau's pro-democracy camp lost further ground in the Chinese gambling hub's legislature, according to preliminary results Monday from an election marred by low turnout and a ban on \"disloyal\" candidates. Macau, like neighbouring Hong Kong, is a \"semi-autonomous\" Chinese territory, and the central government in Beijing has been tightening control in both with a more direct role in recent years. Authorities in Macau had disqualified 21 candidates -- most of them from the pro-democracy camp -- from Sunday's election on national security grounds. They were accused of disloyalty to China after they commemorated the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and honoured rights activist and Beijing critic Liu Xiaobo. Of the 33 seats in Macau's legislature, 14 are directly elected and a preliminary count on Monday showed the pro-democracy camp won just two -- half of what it got in the last vote in 2017. The other 19 lawmakers include 12 indirectly chosen from professional sectors and seven appointed by Macau's chief executive. The general turnout of just over 42 percent was the lowest since the former Portuguese colony was handed over to China in 1999, but authorities dismissed suggestions that it was caused by the disqualification of pro-democracy candidates. The president of Macau's Electoral Affairs Committee, Tong Hio Fong, blamed the low level of participation on coronavirus restrictions, hot weather and heavy rain on Sunday. The disqualification of pro-democracy candidates in Macau follows similar rulings in Hong Kong, where Chinese authorities have moved to crush dissent and the city's pro-democracy movement with a sweeping national security law and a radical electoral overhaul.

Too many people who should have led in mitigating, if not preventing, global disaster found it easier to deny the findings of the experts. And so, the planet continued to overheat and now the disastrous effects of that selfishness and shortsightedness are upon us.

Commerce Minister Wang Wentao submitted China's application to join the free trade agreement in a letter to New Zealand's trade minister, Damien O'Connor, the Chinese ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The CPTPP was signed by 11 countries including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and New Zealand in 2018. Before that, it was known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and seen as an important economic counterweight to China's regional influence. Japan, the CPTPP's chair this year, said it would consult with member countries to respond to China's request, but stopped short of signalling a timeline for doing so. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"Japan believes that it's necessary to determine whether China, which submitted a request to join the TPP-11, is ready to meet its extremely high standards,\" Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters on Friday. The TPP was central to former U.S. President Barack Obama's strategic pivot to Asia but his successor, Donald Trump, withdrew the United States from the pact in 2017. Asked to comment on China's bid, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said it deferred to CPTPP, given that the United States was not a member, but added: \"That said, we would expect that China’s non-market trade practices and China’s use of economic coercion against other countries would factor into CPTPP parties’ evaluation of China as a potential candidate for accession.\" CPTPP accession would be a major boost for China following the signing of the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership free trade agreement last year. Beijing has lobbied , opens new tab for its inclusion in the pact, including by highlighting that the Chinese and Australian economies have enormous potential for cooperation. However, relations between the two countries have soured.

China was pushing for regional integration while AUKUS countries were \"promoting war and destruction,\" he said at a briefing in Beijing. Taiwan, which has also been angling to join the trade pact, expressed concern about China's decision to apply. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and would not be pleased if Taipei was allowed to join the grouping before Beijing. Japan's deputy finance minister suggested in a tweet on Friday that China's subsidies of state-owned firms and arbitrary application of the law were likely to make it hard for the country to join the trade pact. \"China ... is far removed from the free, fair and highly transparent world of TPP, chances that it can join are close to zero,\" State Minister of Finance Kenji Nakanishi said in a tweet , opens new tab . \"This can be thought of as a move to prevent Taiwan from joining.\" Britain in June began negotiations to enter the trade pact, while Thailand has also signalled interest in joining it. read more Wang and O'Connor held a telephone conference to discuss the next steps following China's application, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said.

REUTERS/Florence Lo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Universal Studios' Beijing resort opened its doors to the public on Monday after a two-decade wait, including delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The highly anticipated opening takes place amid U.S.-China relations that have deteriorated in recent years. The park will be U.S.-based Universal's largest and its fifth globally. It is also a first for Beijing, which lacks a big branded theme park to rival the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. And, it will be the first Universal park with a section dedicated to the movie \"Kung Fu Panda\" and includes an area based on the Harry Potter franchise, which is popular in China. Amid light rain and tight security on Monday, a public holiday in China to mark the Mid-Autumn Festival, a steady stream of umbrella-wielding visitors entered the resort. \"When it comes to Universal Studios, we're all big fans of Marvel movies,\" said 27-year-old Beijing resident Pi Tiantian, who visited the park on Monday. \"We really want to experience this resort. This one here also really likes Harry Potter,\" she added, pointing to a young male companion. One Universal Studios employee told Reuters that visitor numbers were being capped at around 10,000 for Monday because of the pandemic but the park has the capacity for many more. All 10,000 tickets for the opening, available in a pre-sale on Sept. 14, were sold out in three minutes, according to Trip.com Group. \"This is a rare time in a long while when an America-themed topic has attracted such obvious and widespread praise in China,\" the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, wrote last week. Beijing-based visitors snatched 40% of the tickets for the first month, while the cities of Tianjin and Shanghai were the second- and third-largest sources of patrons, according to travel website qunar.com. Still, many buyers complained on social media about ticket costs, which range from 418 yuan ($64.76) in the low season to 748 yuan during peak periods. The resort was proposed 20 years ago by the Beijing Tourism Group, according to the official China Daily, and is 30% owned by Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) , opens new tab Universal Parks & Resorts and 70% by state-owned Beijing Shouhuan Cultural Tourism Investment.

Universal Studios announced the development of the resort in 2014 at an estimated cost of $3.3 billion.

Pro-democracy candidates are nearly absent from Hong Kong's first election since Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system to ensure that \"only patriots\" rule China's freest city. \"The whole objective of improving the electoral system is to ensure patriots administer Hong Kong,\" Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, said on Sunday morning. \"I doubt very much that another government or country will allow the public election to their local legislature of people whose mission is to undermine the national interest or national security.\" The election committee will select 40 seats in the revamped Legislative Council in December, and choose a chief executive in March. Police have ramped up security across the city, with local media reporting 6,000 officers are expected to be deployed to ensure a smooth vote, in which about 4,900 people are expected to cast ballots. Changes to the political system are the latest in a string of moves - including a national security law that punishes anything Beijing deems as subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces - that have placed the international financial hub on an authoritarian path. Most prominent democratic activists and politicians are now in jail or have fled abroad. China's rubber-stamp parliament in May changed Hong Kong's electoral system, reducing democratic representation in institutions and introducing the vetting mechanism for election candidates and winners. This all but removed any influence the opposition was able to exert.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab The changes also dramatically reduced the influence of the city's powerful tycoons , opens new tab , although groups close to their business interests retain a presence in the 1,500-strong committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive. TYCOONS OUT, SONS REMAIN China promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which also states the city has wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing. Democracy campaigners and Western countries say the political overhaul moves the city in the opposite direction, leaving the democratic opposition with its most limited space since Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997. Committee membership for 117 community-level district councillors, dominated by democrats, was scrapped, while more than 500 seats designated for Chinese business, political and grassroots groups were added. The new electoral list includes community-level organisations such as Modern Mummy Group and Chinese Arts Papercutting Association, Cable TV reported. Representation from professional subsectors that traditionally had a bigger pro-democracy presence was diluted by the addition of ex-officio members, reducing the number of elected seats. About 70% of the nominees did not feature in the last two polls for the committee, which will expand by 300 members to 1,500, Reuters calculations based on the election committee website showed. Many prominent tycoons, including Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, will not be on the election committee for the first time, as Beijing seeks to rebalance power from big conglomerates to small businesses.

REUTERS/Jason Lee Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BEIJING, Sept 22 (Reuters) - China's northeastern city of Harbin, population 10 million, went into semi-shutdown after reporting new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases for the first time since early February. Three of 16 new local cases reported in China for Sept. 21 were in Harbin, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday. The last reported locally transmitted cases in the city were on Feb. 4. Harbin, known for its minus 30 degree Celsius (minus 22 degree Fahrenheit) winters, on Wednesday vowed to complete an initial round of city-wide testing by Thursday, and told its residents to refrain from stepping outside their homes, unless necessary, before their test results are out. The city has already told its residents to avoid leaving town unless for essential reasons, and those who do leave must produce proof of negative test results within 48 hours from departure. Indoors venues such as cinemas, gyms and mah-jong parlours were also shut, and tourist sites were ordered to limit visitor traffic at half of their capacity, state television reported on Tuesday. read more The city would also suspend offline classes at all kindergartens, primary schools and high schools for a week from Wednesday, state television said late on Tuesday. It was unclear if the three new Harbin cases were linked to the current outbreak in the eastern province of Fujian. According to state television, one of the cases was found when the person went to a local hospital for testing. The other two, close contacts of the first case, returned to China from the Philippines in late August and were first quarantined in the southern city of Guangzhou before being quarantined again at home in Harbin. Bayan county, where the three cases lived, suspended bus and taxi services and locked down some areas. In Fujian, the cities of Xiamen and Putian reported a total of 13 new cases for Sept. 21, according to the NHC on Wednesday, down from the average daily count last week. Vice premier Sun Chunlan said on Monday that local officials should not be blindly optimistic about the progress made in Fujian, because uncertainties remains and the battle against the virus was still in a \"deadlock\", state media reported. Sun demanded that efforts to seal up communities deemed of virus risk should be stricter, according to Fujian Daily. The four Fujian cities of Putian, Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou that have reported local cases have all told residents not to leave town unless for essential reasons. They have also locked down areas of higher risk, closed various public venues, cut certain long-distance bus services, and halted offline lessons at kindergartens, primary schools and high schools. Zhangzhou has told local authorities to tighten approval for foreigners seeking to enter the city. Sign up here.

The first crew stayed three months.\nThe new crew includes two veterans of space travel — Zhai Zhigang, 55, and Wang. The third member, Ye Guangfu, 41, is making his first trip to space.\nThe mission’s launch was seen off by a military band and supporters singing “Ode to the Motherland,” underscoring national pride in the space program, which has advanced rapidly in recent years.\n\nThe crew will do three spacewalks to install equipment in preparation for expanding the station, assess living conditions in the Tianhe module, and conduct experiments in space medicine and other fields.\nChina’s military-run space program plans to send multiple crews to the station over the next two years to make it fully functional.\nWhen completed with the addition of two more sections — named Mengtian and Wentian — the station will weigh about 66 tons, much smaller than the International Space Station, which launched its first module in 1998 and weighs around 450 tons.\nTwo more Chinese modules are due to be launched before the end of next year during the stay of the yet-to-be-named Shenzhou-14 crew.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry on Friday renewed its commitment to cooperation with other nations in the peaceful use of space.\nSpokesperson Zhao Lijian said sending humans into space was a “common cause of mankind.” China would “continue to extend the depth and breadth of international cooperation and exchanges” in crewed spaceflight and “make positive contributions to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe,” he said.\nChina was excluded from the International Space Station largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese program’s secretive nature and close military ties, prompting it to launch two experimental modules before starting on the permanent station.\nU.S. law requires congressional approval for contact between the American and Chinese space programs, but China is cooperating with space experts from other countries including France, Sweden, Russia, and Italy.\nChinese officials have said they look forward to hosting astronauts from other countries aboard the space station once it becomes fully functional.\nChina has launched seven crewed missions with a total of 14 astronauts aboard — two have flown twice — since 2003, when it became only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to put a person in space on its own.\nChina has also expanded its work on lunar and Mars exploration, including landing a rover on the little-explored far side of the Moon and returning lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s.\nThis year, China also landed its Tianwen-1 space probe on Mars, whose accompanying Zhurong rover has been exploring for evidence of life on the red planet.\nOther Chinese space programs call for collecting soil from an asteroid and bringing back additional lunar samples.\nChina has also expressed an aspiration to land people on the moon and possibly build a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.\nA highly secretive space plane is also reportedly under development.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Andy Brownbill/Associated Press By Steven Lee Myers Published Nov. 3, 2021 Updated Nov. 15, 2021 阅读简体中文版 閱讀繁體中文版 Peng Shuai, the professional tennis star, publicly accused a former vice premier of China of sexual assault, igniting an online firestorm of attention to a #MeToo allegation that for the first time touched the pinnacles of Communist Party power. Ms. Peng made the accusation in a post on Tuesday night on her verified account on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. In it, she described an assault by Zhang Gaoli, who from 2012 to 2017 served on the party’s Politburo Standing Committee , the top ruling body in China. She also described having had an on-and-off consensual relationship with Mr. Zhang. The post was removed within minutes, but the allegations swirled through the country’s heavily controlled internet, fueled by the fame of the accuser and the accused. That kept the censors inside China’s Great Firewall scrambling. Searches of her name and even the word “tennis” appeared to be blocked, reflecting the extraordinary sensitivity within China of discussing misconduct by party leaders. “The impact of #MeToo has been accumulating for three years,” Lü Pin, an activist who founded the now-banned Chinese online forum Feminist Voices, said in a telephone interview from New Jersey, where she now lives. “When the first women began talking about their experiences three years ago, no one could have imagined that it would reach this high level.” Ms. Peng’s accusations could not be corroborated. In her post, she acknowledged that she would be unable to produce evidence of her accusation, suggesting at one point that Mr. Zhang had expressed worries that she might record their encounters.

Beijing imposed strict border controls in the weeks after Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, slowing the number of cases to a trickle and allowing the economy to bounce back. As the rest of the world opens up and tries to find ways to live with the virus, China has maintained a zero-Covid approach that has included harsh local lockdowns imposed over just a handful of cases. Tuesday’s restrictions came as China reported 29 new domestic infections – including six cases in Lanzhou, the provincial capital of the north-western Gansu province. Residents of Lanzhou would be required to stay at home, authorities said in a statement. Officials said the “entry and exit of residents” would be strictly controlled and limited to essential supplies or medical treatment. Bus and taxi services had already been suspended in the city, and state media said on Tuesday that Lanzhou station had suspended more than 70 trains, including key routes to major cities such as Beijing and Xi’an. China: number of new coronavirus cases per day Flights to Lanzhou were also being cancelled, with a Southern Airlines representative telling AFP that all its flights from Beijing’s Daxing airport to Lanzhou were cancelled due to public safety measures, without any date given to resume. China’s latest outbreak has been linked to the Delta variant, with the tally from the latest outbreak hitting 198 cases since 17 October. Health officials have warned that more infections may emerge as testing is ramped up in the coming days to fight the outbreak, which has been linked to a group of domestic tourists who travelled from Shanghai to several other provinces. Strict stay-at-home orders have already been imposed on tens of thousands of people in northern China. In Beijing – which reported three new cases on Tuesday – access to tourist sites has been limited and residents advised not to leave the city unless necessary. About 23,000 residents in one housing compound in Changping district have been ordered to stay indoors after nine cases were found there in recent days, Beijing News reported. Community mahjong and chess rooms have been closed, and residents have been told to reduce large gatherings where possible. Organisers on Sunday indefinitely postponed a marathon at which 30,000 runners were expected. Mass testing is under way in 11 provinces and authorities have suspended many interprovincial tour groups. While the country’s case numbers are extremely low compared with elsewhere in the world, authorities are determined to stamp out the latest outbreak with the Beijing Winter Olympics just over 100 days away. Those deemed to have failed in controlling Covid are often dismissed from their posts or punished. On Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency reported that the party secretary of Ejin Banner in the northern Inner Mongolia region had been sacked “due to poor performance and implementation in epidemic prevention and control”. Six other officials were punished for their “slack response” to the latest flare-up, state media reported, and a local police bureau deputy director was removed from the position. Beijing police have launched three criminal investigations into alleged Covid safety breaches, the deputy director of the city’s public security bureau said on Sunday.

Kevin Mak/Herzog & de Meuron Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here . Hong Kong CNN — When plans for M+ were unveiled over a decade ago, many in China’s art world breathed a sigh of relief. The Hong Kong museum could, they hoped, provide a safe space for the types of risqué, politically charged artworks that were impossible to show in the heavily censored galleries of Beijing and Shanghai. As it finally opens its doors to the public Friday, the multibillion-dollar institution finds itself in a far more complicated position. Since the introduction of last year’s controversial National Security Law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, Hong Kong has undergone a marked cultural and political shift. Critics allege the wide-ranging legislation has been used to stifle dissent and clamp down on free expression, bringing the formerly freewheeling territory in line with other Chinese cities. Inside Hong Kong's brand new museum of visual culture. Keith Tsuji/Getty Images But while the red lines denoting what is tolerated in mainland China are relatively well understood – in the art world, at least – in Hong Kong, they appear to be continually evolving as artists and galleries navigate the new law. Just last month, the University of Hong Kong ordered the removal of its famous “Pillar of Shame” sculpture, memorializing victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, from its campus after several members of the now-disbanded pro-democracy group that owned the work were arrested. In October, a new film censorship law was passed, while reports of galleries and institutions keeping sensitive artworks from display have become commonplace. As a government-backed institution housing a trove of over 1,500 Chinese contemporary artworks, including around two dozen by dissident artist Ai Weiwei, M+ is a high-profile test of the city’s artistic and curatorial freedoms. The question for those visiting the museum this weekend may not only be what is on display, but what is not. Beyond politics, excitement builds While a political cloud hangs over the opening, excitement around M+ is tangible in the art world and beyond. Long touted as the region’s equivalent to London’s Tate Modern or New York’s MoMA, it will showcase items from a vast 8,000-item collection of visual culture (encompassing art, design, architecture, photography and moving images) from the 20th and 21st centuries, with a heavy emphasis on telling stories about Asia, from Asia. “We are part of the first wave of international, transregional and even global institutions that are now arriving in Asia,” said M+ deputy director, curatorial and chief curator Doryun Chong, pointing to the National Gallery of Singapore and the forthcoming Guggenheim Abu Dhabi as other museums offering historically neglected Asian-centric art narratives. When it comes to storytelling, M+’s young, diverse curatorial team – and a wider staff made up of nearly 30 nationalities – offers a certain edge, Chong said. M+'s LED screen will project images of art. Virgile Simon Bertrand/Herzog & de Meuron “Building a museum of this scale, where nothing comparable exists – and we’re not just talking about Hong Kong, we’re talking about greater China and maybe even the rest of Asia – means that it’s necessary to gather diverse work experiences and expertise to produce something that is best for us, that will set the standard of our region and perhaps for the rest of the world.” This ambition is evident in the building itself, an elegant design by Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, in partnership with TFP Farrells and Arup. Its harbor-fronted facade interacts with the city’s urban fabric via a massive LED screen that will display moving art instead of the commercial logos and advertisements peppering the rest of Hong Kong’s iconic skyline. Other details, like the tower’s terracotta cladding, a reference to traditional Chinese roof tiling; the wall-to-ceiling bamboo lining several gallery spaces; and a cavernous basement-level exhibition space that follows the contours of the active railway tunnel below it, help further root the design in its culture and locale. The atrium located on the museum's second floor. Kevin Mak/Courtesy of Herzog & de Meuron What’s shown, what’s not shown M+ has opened with six thematic shows across a sprawling 183,000 square feet of exhibition space. Of them, “M+ Sigg Collection: From Revolution to Globalisation” presents what is arguably the museum’s pièce de résistance: The world’s largest and most comprehensive collection of Chinese contemporary art from the 1970s to the 2000s. A landmark donation and part-sale of 1,500 items, by renowned collector and former ambassador to China Uli Sigg, put M+ on the map in 2012, catapulting it from museum-in-the-making to serious global arts player. But its contents have also raised difficult questions for curators and politicians alike. In particular, a 1997 photograph of Ai Weiwei raising a middle finger to Tiananmen Square was embroiled in controversy earlier this year, when the image was removed from the museum’s website, where users can browse through items in its collections. (Other images from his “Study in Perspectives” series, showing him making the same gesture towards the “Mona Lisa” in the Louvre, the White House and the Federal Palace of Switzerland still appear on the site). The provocative photo contributed to a larger conversation about censorship fears, after a pro-Beijing lawmaker asked Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam whether M+ risked “inciting hatred” towards China. Lam responded by telling culture officials to be “extra cautious” that the museum does not cross an unspecified “red line,” adding that while her government respected “freedom of artistic and cultural expression … all Hong Kong compatriots are required to safeguard national security.” Addressing reporters at a press preview on Thursday, chairman of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, stressed that the museum would “uphold and encourage the freedom of artistic expression and creativity” while ensuring “all exhibitions will comply with the laws … including the National Security Law.” Despite the political pressures, Sigg told CNN that M+ was still the best home for his collection, which he always believed should be displayed in China, if not the mainland. “I still think that’s the way: The Chinese people can now or eventually can see their art, which they’re not so familiar with yet,” he said. “Maybe today we cannot show everything, but one day I am sure that whole collection can be shown. It’s for the long haul, in my view.” Sigg co-curated the opening selection, a list of artworks he said predates the National Security Law. “For me, it was an important test that the list would be respected, and these works would be shown,” he said, adding that none of his original choices were removed. Wang Xingwei's \"New Beijing\" as shown in the museum. Stephy Chung/ CNN The show is expansive, over 200 items charting the emergence of contemporary art in China after the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976. Through movements like the avant-garde ’85 new wave and Cynical Realism, which rose in tandem with crucial points in China’s recent history, the works also reflect the country’s economic rise and breakneck urban development. Wang Xingwei’s “New Beijing,” feels especially confrontational in the current climate – a satirical oil painting showing bloodied emperor penguins lying on a bicycle cart, a thinly veiled allusion to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and the deaths of pro-democracy protesters. Subversive portraits of former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong also appear throughout, as do videos of closed-door art performances and underground exhibitions tackling taboo subjects such as nudity and free speech. A visitor sits in front of \"Rouge 1992\" by artist Li Shan. Keith Tsuji/Getty Images Ai’s middle finger is nowhere to be seen, but two of his works do appear: an installation of his earthenware jars and a 2004 video capturing Beijing’s Chang’an Boulevard, the street running from east to west via rural villages, the capital’s business district and right through the heart of government power. Sigg recalled taking a group of art collectors around the museum ahead of the opening, saying that “some of the patrons were crying, they were so moved by what they saw.” “It was unexpected to see Chinese contemporary art, at this depth and in this width, even when I’m talking about art collectors,” he added. “They made so many new discoveries, they were simply impressed by their own artists. That is what I hope to see again and again. That would be my biggest pleasure.” Beyond the hotly-debated Sigg Collection, large-scale acquisitions offer intrigue outside the political. With its sheer enormity, British sculptor Antony Gormley’s 2003 work “Asian Field” commands its own exhibition: Tens of thousands of clay figurines stare back at the viewer, a mesmerizing display of hand-sized pieces produced by 300 villagers in southern China. The show “Things, Spaces, Interactions,” offers visitors an entire sushi bar to explore. Dismantled in Tokyo and reinstalled inside the museum, “Kiyotomo” is one of the few remaining examples of interior design by the celebrated Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata. It is one of several displays demonstrating the museum’s ambitious efforts to preserve and document design and architecture – not only in greater China, but Asia as a whole. Antony Gormley's 2003 work \"Asian Field.\" Visitors can see the Kiyomoto sushi bar, reinstalled into the museum. Stephy Chung/ CNN And, keeping M+’s local audience firmly in mind, the main hall exhibition, “Hong Kong: Here and Beyond,” presents the city’s visual culture from the 1960s to today. It is a story told through everything from Cantonese pop albums to movies and video games inspired by the city. A framed photograph by photographer Michael Wolf in an exhibition focused on Hong Kong's visual culture. Keith Tsuji/Getty Images Architectural models and images of dense public housing projects meanwhile explore the issue of Hong Kong’s ongoing housing crisis. And while direct references to the 2019 pro-democracy protests that recently rocked the city are conspicuous in their absence, one of the movement’s most prominent artists, Kacey Wong, is represented in absentia (he is now living in self-imposed exile in Taiwan amid concerns he could no longer freely create art). His 2009 work “Paddling Home,” a four-by-four-foot apartment that he once floated in Victoria Harbour, was created in response to skyrocketing rents and cramped living spaces. A museum’s ‘social value’ Hong Kong has in recent years become the region’s arts capital, home to a thriving auction market, international blue-chip galleries and the Art Basel Hong Kong fair. Had M+ opened before the pandemic, a glitzy, international art crowd might have been expected to flock to its opening. But the city’s “zero Covid” strategy, which involves hotel quarantines of up to three weeks and a ban on most non-residents, has stymied travel in and out of the city. Nonetheless, M+ will likely become a popular destination for travel-starved residents, and Chong, M+’s chief curator, hopes the museum can provide “healing” during a period of uncertainty. “What museums can do – what cultural institutions can do – is to really provide healing through empathy, through the richness, through the imagining of different possibilities, looking back on history so they can also nourish their spirits and souls,” he said. “This is the front of our minds. How we want to think about the social value of what museums are … has only become stronger and deepened during this time.” A video sculpture by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is suspended in M+ museum. Kevin Mak/Courtesy of Herzog & de Meuron For Hong Kong based curator Ying Kwok, who has worked extensively with local talent, the museum could help raise the ambition of artists in the city. “In New York, in London, we see what international standards mean – what kind of artists are becoming household names, what is the level, what kind of shows they are doing,” she said. “I think it’s very important in the art scene, if there’s a role model, a target that you can look up to.” This article has been updated to reflect Ying Kwok’s title.

The draft resolution on “the major achievements and historical experience of the CPC’s 100 years of endeavors,” a key focus of the Sixth Party Plenum meeting, downplays CCP past atrocities while lionizing Xi for steering China toward superpower status. The four-day meeting ends today in Beijing. The Plenum should pave Xi’s path to an indefinite extension of his role as China’s leader at next year’s 20th Party Congress. The effect will be deepening a hawkish and insular foreign engagement style that may hamper effective U.S.-China relations for years. “Xi has increasingly surrounded himself in a cocoon of very favorable facts and he is not going to have very good understanding of what’s happening in the rest of the world,” said VICTOR SHIH , the Ho Miu Lam chair in China and Pacific Relations at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy. “He may become so surrounded in the cocoon that he doesn’t take very seriously what other countries do or say about China … so misunderstandings and misperceptions may become more serious over time.” The Sixth Plenum — which convenes the CCP Central Committee — is political theater that rubber stamps prewritten and preapproved Party initiatives. But that doesn’t mean the total of seven Plenum meetings that occur over the five-year period between party Congresses don’t matter. They’re responsible for discussions on matters ranging from Five-Year Plan drafts and ideology to Congress preparation. Plenums provide guideposts for CCP priorities for the 20th Party Congress next year at which Xi is likely to take advantage of his abolition of presidential term limits in 2018 and remain in power indefinitely . The Sixth Plenum’s history resolution places Xi on par with former leaders MAO ZEDONG , the People’s Republic of China’s founding leader, and DENG XIAOPING , who masterminded China’s four decades of meteoric economic growth . Deng and Mao are the only previous CCP leaders to issue resolutions on CCP history. Chinese state media has described the resolution as “needed for upholding General Secretary Xi Jinping’s core position at the CPC Central Committee and in the whole Party.” The two previous CCP history resolutions acknowledged a measure of ideologically driven bloodshed and chaos linked to its rule, while carefully insulating it from culpability for those excesses. And while Mao’s history resolution in 1945 urged the CCP to “‘learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones” and Deng’s 1981 resolution allocated blame to Mao for the disastrous 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution , Xi’s version of history is expected to provide a much sunnier assessment of CCP governance since the party’s founding in 1921. “He’s rewriting history because he believes in a lot of it … [and] the notion that China is now center stage so that other countries have to kowtow to China and not the other way around,” Shih said. The resolution will likely include a further revisionist blurring of the CCP’s worst past disasters, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution . And look for a greater emphasis on the benefits of CCP rule and initiatives Xi has led since taking office in 2013. “It may well be that this new resolution stresses the upward trajectory of the Communist Party since its foundation in 1921 [and] in this new version of history, the sheer destruction of the Cultural Revolution would be smoothed out of historical visibility,” said RANA MITTER , director of the University China Center at Oxford. A 5,000-word glowing Chinese state-media profile published Saturday provides a four-category blueprint for Xi’s new historical relevance: Xi the compassionate: He’s lifted “about 100 million people out of extreme poverty” over the past nine years. Xi the just: His ongoing anti-corruption campaign has resulted in “more than 400 officials at ministerial level or above [who] have been punished or investigated … [and] over 8,300 fugitives were repatriated from more than 120 countries and regions.” Xi the internationalist: His signature Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure development program “could help lift 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million people out of moderate poverty globally.” Xi the wise: His “Xi Jinping thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era ” has been enshrined in the CCP and China’s constitutions. Highlighting these achievements in a history resolution will lend Xi an aura of benign infallibility that state propaganda organs will funnel into everything from state media reporting to school textbooks. “Xi already oversees the most powerful secret police and information gathering apparatus in human history and it is those tools that are the keys to his rule in China, but this [resolution] is the icing on the cake,” Shih said. Xi’s perspective of historical narrative control as a lever of power dates to 2010 when, as vice president, he urged CCP members to “resolutely combat the wrong tendency to distort and smear the party’s history.” He has backed that rhetoric by criminalizing as “ historical nihilism ” any public challenges to the CCP’s historical narrative. China’s Supreme Court took that one step further in February by making any perceived insult to CCP “ heroes and martyrs ” a prosecutable offense. But Xi’s drive to force-feed a public perception of his equivalence to Mao and Deng may signal insecurity rather than strength. “On the surface, Xi’s this juggernaut that is flying the new China and ‘ the China dream, ’” said PERRY LINK , who teaches at the University of California at Riverside and is an authority on contemporary Chinese politics and intellectual life. “But really he’s reaching into the only intellectual bag he has and that is to go back to Mao because he really doesn’t know about the outside world or other alternatives.” Xi’s elevation to the CCP’s pantheon of revolutionary heroes through the Sixth Plenum’s history resolution will be a potent deterrent to possible challenges to his rule by party rivals. And it will intensify state propaganda messaging — and likely Chinese public acceptance — of the necessity of Xi’s leadership and the wisdom of his policies. “The Biden administration may very well be dealing with a Chinese leader who has solidified his place in history and a galvanized Chinese citizenry more convinced than ever that the West is determined to keep China down,” said DIANA FU , associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. TRANSLATING WASHINGTON — BIDEN-XI VIRTUAL SUMMIT ON MONDAY: The much-anticipated virtual summit between Biden and Xi is tentatively set for Monday evening, a U.S. official told POLITICO on Wednesday . A second non-administration source familiar with the summit’s planning also confirmed that the summit will occur Monday. The confirmation of the summit’s date follows days of White House refusals to provide any details on the agenda or its timing besides “ before the end of the year.” White House officials this week have sought to lower public expectations for the summit’s results. “This is part of our ongoing efforts to responsibly manage the competition between our countries, not only ... about seeking specific deliverables,” White House principal deputy press secretary KARINE JEAN-PIERRE told reporters at Monday’s White House press briefing. Jean-Pierre added that “working-level discussions are underway to confirm details,” without elaborating. — U.S.-CHINA SURPRISE COP26 JOINT PLEDGE: The U.S. and China pledged to take “enhanced climate actions” in an unexpected joint statement on Wednesday, POLITICO’s STUART LAU and KARL MATHIESEN reported from Glasgow, Scotland. The two countries promised to “pursue efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius — the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. They also committed “to strengthen and accelerate climate action and cooperation.” The joint pledge provides Biden and Xi a symbolically important example of bilateral cooperation ahead of their Monday virtual summit. But its emphasis on ambiguous — rather than binding, benchmark-driven — bilateral cooperation suggests that either side’s failure to make substantive emissions reductions will continue to be a focus of future climate conferences. —'FREE KAI LI': BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL LETTER: A bipartisan group of 15 congressional representatives, including four senators and 11 House members, sent a joint letter to Biden last week requesting he seek the release of U.S. citizen KAI LI from a Chinese prison . The letter, co-signed by congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.) and Rep. CHRIS SMITH (R-N.J.), states that Li was the victim of an “opaque judicial process” and has been tortured in custody since his arrest for “espionage” in September 2016. Li might make it onto a list of prisoners of concern that Biden administration officials could share with their Chinese counterparts ahead of Monday’s virtual summit, said JOHN KAMM , the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, which seeks to win the release of prisoners in China. Kamm estimated there are between 150 and 200 U.S. citizens in China who are either in arbitrary detention or subject to coercive exit bans. “I don’t think it’ll be a big list and the big question is whether it includes non-U.S. citizens like [imprisoned Wuhan citizen journalist] Zhang Zhan ,” said Kamm. A U.S. official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government will submit a list of prisoners of concern to Chinese officials ahead of the summit. — CONGRESSIONAL MYSTERY FLIGHT TO TAIWAN: China’s Defense Ministry protested Tuesday that “On November 9, U.S. congressmen flew to Taiwan on military aircraft [and therefore] ... grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs.” Taiwanese media also reported the congressional visit and described their aircraft as a “Boeing C-40A registered to the U.S. military.” A Taiwan Foreign Affairs Ministry statement reported “the arrival of U.S. Senators and Representatives in Taiwan” on a trip organized by the American Institute in Taiwan but didn’t elaborate. AIT’s D.C. office referred press queries to the State Department. The State Department and the National Security Council referred all queries to congressional offices. It took the South China Morning Post to reveal that the delegation included Sen. JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas), Sen. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-Ala), Sen. MIKE CRAPO (R-Idaho), Sen. MIKE LEE (R-Utah) and Rep. JAKE ELLZEY (R-Texas). Pentagon spokesperson JOHN KIRBY confirmed that U.S. congressional representatives had indeed flown to Taiwan and that it was the second such trip in 2021. Sen. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D- Ill.), Sen. CHRISTOPHER COONS (D-Del.) and Sen. DAN SULLIVAN (R-Alaska) visited Taiwan in June with a U.S. government commitment to provide the self-governing island 750,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine. Hot from the China Watchersphere — REPORT: UYGHUR DIASPORA FACES CHINESE HARASSMENT: Uyghur Muslims outside of China are facing online harassment and intimidation by suspected Chinese state agents, notes a report released Wednesday by the nonprofit Uyghur Human Rights Project. The report reveals that 72 percent of 66 Uyghurs surveyed by UHRP in countries, including the U.S., Australia and Japan, had been targeted by a Chinese government “campaign of transnational repression.” The spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in D.C., LIU PENGYU , issued a written response which dismissed the report’s allegations as “not worth refuting [and] completely groundless.” — DOJ ‘CHINA INITIATIVE’ FUELS ACADEMIC CONCERN: A national campaign is gathering steam to persuade Attorney General MERRICK GARLAND to cancel the controversial “China Initiative” program that investigates alleged Chinese state-sponsored intellectual property theft in U.S. universities. A total of 841 “faculty members, scholars, and administrators” from 202 universities across the U.S. sent a letter to Garland demanding an end to the program. The China Initiative’s future is in the hands of MATTHEW OLSEN , who became the assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s National Security Division on Nov. 1, but he has yet to signal his views on the program. — CHINA COVID QUARANTINE SURVIVAL TIPS: Despite an outbreak that has now spread to 20 provinces , the Chinese government is sticking with its zero-Covid strategy that imposes mandatory three-week quarantines for visitors from abroad. KER GIBBS , the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, recently emerged from quarantine with some survival tips. His short list: good books (he recommends ORVILLE SCHELL ’s “ My Old Home ”), a yoga mat for in-room workouts, and a microfiber towel because “there’s no way to dry [a cotton towel] properly and after a day or two it will stink.” Gibbs said quarantine is a balance between “creating time to think things through and have conversations with yourself” and intense FOMO (fear of missing out). “Even though you can be quite productive in isolation, there’s still a feeling that you’ve wasted weeks of your life that you’ll never get back,” said Gibbs. — POLITICO PARSES THE PLA’S RECEIPTS: China’s People’s Liberation Army AI development programs have an unhealthy reliance on U.S. technology and funding. That’s one of the disturbing revelations of a months-long probe that RYAN FEDASIUK unpacks in POLITICO Magazine . The report highlights the critical role of U.S. firms in supplying China with data, software and capital accessible to the PLA and underscores serious shortcomings in the U.S. export control system. Translating China — WEIBO SLAMS TAIWAN’S ‘DIEHARD INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS’: Chinese authorities designated three of Taiwan’s top elected officials Friday on a list of “ diehard independence activists ” barred for life from entering the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. The listed officials — Premier SU TSENG-CHANG , legislative Speaker YU SHYI-KUN and Foreign Affairs Minister JOSEPH WU — are also subject to unspecified “criminal liability.” Wu tweeted that the listing was “ a rare honor ” while Su deadpanned Chinese Foreign Ministry-speak by dismissing the listing as “foreigners [who] are meddling in Taiwan’s domestic affairs.” Weibo users sensed an official green light to voice expressions of nationalist rage and rose to the occasion with the hashtag “ State Taiwan Office says it will pursue criminal responsibility for stubborn Taiwanese independence elements!” garnering 210 million shares by Wednesday. Invective aimed at the three Taiwanese politicians included “scum” and “high risk criminals,” and references to “ lapdogs of the U.S .” being “ crushed to pieces by the wheel of history .” —HONG KONG’S FALTERING MEDIA FREEDOM: The Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong released results of a survey of its media members Friday that revealed a grim outlook. Fear of the National Security Law imposed in July 2021 resulted in 86 percent of respondents reporting that sources “were less willing to be quoted or to discuss sensitive subjects” while more than half admitted they had self-censored to avoid potential prosecution. Some 46 percent of journalists surveyed are “considering or already had plans to leave Hong Kong because of the decline in press freedom in the city.” The New York Times announced in July that it would move some of its Hong Kong-based staff to Seoul due to “uncertainty about what the [law] will mean to our operation and our journalism.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson WANG WENBIN pushed back with data indicating an 18.5 percent year on year rise in the number of foreign media work visas issued in Hong Kong by the end of April.

By Wednesday, authorities had imposed strict lockdown measures on its estimated 13 million residents. The sweeping restrictions, which prevent people from leaving their homes, come as the country braces for the Lunar New Year travel rush, followed by the 2022 Winter Olympics, due to begin in the capital Beijing on February 4. Xi’an, an ancient city known internationally as the home of the 2,000-year-old Terracotta warriors sculptures, detected its first case connected to the latest outbreak at a quarantine hotel on December 9. The virus is believed to have then spread into the community via an infected hotel worker. Officials believe the cluster is linked to an inbound flight from Pakistan on December 4, where at least six passengers were found to have the Delta variant. So far, there have been no reported cases of the Omicron variant in Xi’an. Authorities moved swiftly, suspending schools and conducting mass testing for the entire city. Cases have continued to climb, however. Since December 9, the city has recorded a total of 206 cases. On Wednesday, authorities recorded 63 new locally transmitted cases, Xi’an’s highest daily figure this month. Residents queue up for Covid tests at a testing site in Xi'an, China, on December 21. Li Yibo/Xinhua/Getty Images By noon on Wednesday, more than 30,000 people who were believed to have come into contact with a confirmed case were placed in government quarantine, according to state-run newspaper China Daily . That same day, the city imposed a strict lockdown until further notice for all residents. Xi’an is now designated a “controlled area,” China’s second-highest category of lockdown – meaning residents are banned from leaving their homes except for urgent cases like medical emergencies. Each household is only allowed to send one designated person out of the house to buy groceries every two days. After the new restrictions were announced, families rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies before the lockdown went into effect at midnight, according to state-run tabloid the Global Times. Schools, public facilities and transport systems are also closed except for essential service providers like hospitals and supermarkets, according to the local government’s announcement.

STR/AFP/Getty Images Xi’an is one level away from the highest lockdown category of “sealed area,” in which residents are completely banned from leaving their homes, and groceries are delivered to their door. This is only the fourth time a major Chinese city has been placed under the “controlled area” lockdown. Though previous outbreaks have seen similar restrictions, they are typically only applied to specific areas where infections are most prevalent – not an entire city. The emergence of yet another outbreak has raised questions over the long-term viability of China’s ambitious “zero-Covid” policy, which aims to eliminate the virus completely within the country’s borders. Despite administering more than 2.7 billion doses of its homegrown vaccines, authorities have struggled with a number of fast-spreading outbreaks. The outbreak in Xi’an follows a Delta-driven outbreak in the summer; a September outbreak in Fujian province ; an October outbreak that spread to more than half the country ; then several clusters in Inner Mongolia in November, which have spread to Zhejiang province in recent weeks. In the past week alone, in addition to Xi’an, cases have also been recorded in Henan province, Zhejiang province, Guangdong province, Guangxi autonomous region, and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin.

Beijing has launched a PR blitz seeking to undermine the United States' claim to democratic leadership [File: Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters] By Erin Hale Published On 7 Dec 2021 7 Dec 2021 China has embarked on a PR campaign intent on flipping the global narrative on what constitutes democracy in an attempt to attack the United States political system, as US President Joe Biden prepares to open his US Summit for Democracy later this week. China and Russia were left off the guest list for the event, which will be held virtually on December 9 and 10. But after protesting their exclusion together in a rare OpEd, Beijing now appears to have gone on the offensive. On Saturday, China held a similarly-themed International Forum on Democracy as the powerful State Council issued a white paper called China: Democracy That Works, which described how China had developed its model of democracy. While China is best known as a one-party state led by the Chinese Communist Party, the country does have its own legislature. The National People’s Congress has nearly 3,000 members chosen from across China’s regions and provinces and even the armed forces, the vast majority of whom are party members. Dismissed as a “rubber stamp parliament” by critics, all members of the NPC meet once a year, with most decisions made by a far smaller standing committee. The country doesn’t have a free media or an independent judiciary — both of which are generally seen as crucial to a properly functioning democracy. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index ranked China, which it described as an “authoritarian regime”, 151 out of 167 countries and territories for 2020. The semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong was termed a “hybrid regime”. The ranking assesses a country’s democracy based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation and political culture. The ranking termed the US a “flawed democracy”. China’s democracy summit included a lengthy list of attendees including José L. Centella Gómez, the president of Spain’s Communist Party, and former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who spoke about shared common values between different social systems, according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. “The motivation, from their perception and viewpoint, is to present what they consider as an alternative interpretation of democracy. It complements their narrative of capacity-building for connectivity and economic development,” said Tai Wei-lim, a research fellow adjunct at the National University of Singapore East Asian Institute, citing major infrastructure projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative. The summit and an accompanying social media blitz on Twitter by Chinese media and officials is just one way that China is trying to push back against Biden’s narrative about democracy as China tries to present itself as a true multilateral player, says Wen-ti Sung, a lecturer at the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Programme. Oh we had both participation and satisfaction rates like this in Soviet Union times! But at least they did not call it democracy back then… https://t.co/0zdRf9QDtS — Diana Mickeviciene (@DMickeviciene) December 5, 2021 #GTGraphic : Why Chinese #democracy is more extensive, more genuine and more effective than American democracy? Check out the graphic for more: pic.twitter.com/Zmh3RznsgL — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) December 4, 2021 During the Trump administration, as the White House pulled out of major global initiatives , such as the Paris agreement on climate change, and threatened to leave the World Health Organisation , China painted itself as a global, multilateral leader, unlike the US. ‘Big tent approach’ In contrast, Biden, who took office in January, has spoken frequently about the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism — a major theme at this week’s democracy summit. Representatives from 111 countries have been invited, including Norway, New Zealand and Canada, all of which were among the top five in the EIU’s Democracy Index. The guest list also includes “several states with authoritarian characteristics”, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted. Three countries attending — Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Iraq — are considered “Not Free” in the 2021 Freedom in the World report by Freedom House, while a further 31 are considered “partly free”. “Rather than limit participation to a core group of committed democracies, Biden’s team opted for a big tent approach,” Carnegie said. By holding its own event, China is attempting to “dilute, redefine and weaken Biden’s efforts” to use US ideology as a rallying point for global dialogue, Sung said. “It’s not directly confronting the West or its narrative as well, but it’s trying to make room for its own definition and plausible deniability” that China can interpret concepts as it sees fit. Not all of China’s signalling about Western democracy has been so subtle, however. Shortly after the US Summit For Democracy was announced in late November, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin called US democracy a “disastrous state” that has “privatised” democratic values. On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a critical report about the state of democracy in the US, which also said a single “yardstick” should not be used to “measure diverse political systems in the world”. pic.twitter.com/Gq2WoejgZi — Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) December 6, 2021 With the release of the report and a renewed string of criticism of the US model, China was probably signalling to other countries attending the US summit on Thursday that they should push back against US ideology – and could even be at risk from it, as China claims. The US Summit is to be accompanied by a new round of sanctions from the US Treasury on institutions and individuals who “undermine democracy” and carry out human rights abuses, according to Reuters news agency. Officials accused of involvement in the crackdowns in the far western region of Xinjiang and Hong Kong have already been subjected to sanctions to which China has responded with fury . “We know many participants at the upcoming summit are democracy with an asterisk, so to speak, and so China is trying to remind these outlier democracies that there may be a lot more you have in common with China than you do with the US,” ANU’s Sung said. He said that China’s message to the rest of the world is this: “When the summit for democracy is trying to come out with any accusatory language that tries to make China look unfavourable, maybe you shouldn’t sign on too much because it might hurt you too, or try to soften language because it’s not just in China’s interest, but in your own interest.” Source : Al Jazeera aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo Sponsored Content Advertisement About Show more About Us Code of Ethics Terms and Conditions EU/EEA Regulatory Notice Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences Sitemap Work for us Connect Show more Contact Us User Accounts Help Advertise with us Apps Newsletters Channel Finder TV Schedule Podcasts Submit a Tip Our Channels Show more Al Jazeera Arabic Al Jazeera English Al Jazeera Investigative Unit Al Jazeera Mubasher Al Jazeera Documentary Al Jazeera Balkans AJ+ Our Network Show more Al Jazeera Centre for Studies Al Jazeera Media Institute Learn Arabic Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights Al Jazeera Forum Al Jazeera Hotel Partners Follow Al Jazeera English: facebook twitter youtube instagram-colored-outline rss © 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network",

The Women's Tennis Association says they are canceling all tournaments in China after Peng Shuai was silenced after revealing her sexual assault. Michael Owens/AP The Women's Tennis Association is suspending all tournaments in China, including Hong Kong, WTA Chairman and CEO Steve Simon said in a statement released Wednesday. The decision from the WTA comes after Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai alleged that she was sexually assaulted by China's former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli. The Chinese government deleted her post on the social media site Weibo, as well as her account. For weeks, there was concern over Peng's safety. Sponsor Message Goats and Soda Chinese tennis athlete accuses former top Communist Party official of sexual assault \"Unfortunately, the leadership in China has not addressed this very serious issue in any credible way. While we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe and not subject to censorship, coercion and intimidation,\" Simon said in the statement. \"The WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation – without censorship – into Peng Shuai's sexual assault accusation.\" The WTA did not note how many tournaments this decision will affect. But Simon said he is \"greatly concerned\" of the risks all players and staff would face if they were to hold events in China. Sports In a video call, Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai told Olympics officials she's safe On Nov. 21, officials from the International Olympic Committee held a 30-minute video call with Peng, who told them she was safe in her home in Beijing and asked for privacy at the time. Earlier, Chinese state media had posted a copy of an email it said that Peng sent to Simon, the WTA chairman, saying she was safe. But Simon questioned the authenticity of the email. \"I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her,\" Simon said in a statement at the time. \"The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe.\" Sponsor Message The Sport & Rights Alliance praised the WTA's decision and has called on the International Olympic Committee to take a similar stance on the matter, especially considering there are just two months to go until the Winter Olympic games in Beijing in February 2022. \"The IOC's eagerness to ignore the voice of an Olympian who may be in danger and to support claims of state-sponsored media in China shows the urgent and critical need for an IOC human rights strategy in close consultation with affected stakeholders, placing athletes at the center,\" Andrea Florence, the acting director of the Sport & Rights Alliance, said in a statement . tennis tennis star weibo China human rights womens tennis Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

The People’s Bank of China on Monday lowered its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 5 basis points to 3.8%. TheLPR is the rate at which commercial banks lend to their best customers and it serves as the benchmark rate for other loans. While Monday’s rate cut issmall, it’s the first such move since April 2020, when China slashed the rate to boost its Covid-hit economy, which hadjust contracted for the first time in more than 40 years. “The cut reinforces our view that authorities are increasingly open to cutting interest rates amid looming economic headwinds,” said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ, in a research note on Monday. A cut to the lending rate can help reduce borrowing costs for households and firms and in turn encourage consumerspending and investment. Unlike the West, Beijing had refrained from flooding the economy with stimulus packages during the pandemic, focusing instead on offering targeted support to smaller businesses. Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng attend the sixth plenary session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee in Beijing, capital of China. The session was held in Beijing from Nov. 8 to 11. Xie Huanchi/Xinhua/Getty Images Related article Xi Jinping has been taking on China's capitalists. Here's why that will change in 2022 China was the only major economy to record growth in 2020, but this year the country’s expansion has been hit by several factors, forcing it to consider ways to provide support even as other major central banks withdraw stimulus and raise interest rates to fight inflation. An energy shortage hobbled industrial output for much of this year, as the country struggled to balance its need for electricity with efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Government data from last week showed that housing prices fell for a third consecutive month in November, a sign that an ongoing property crisis continues to deepen. Retail sales also struggled, suggesting that coronavirus outbreaks, and the government’s “zero-Covid” approach of locking down areas where infections flare up, are taking their toll on the economy. China’s top leaders have already expressed concerns about growth prospects. At a key economic meeting earlier this month, they said “ensuring stability” would be a top priority in the coming year. That’s a huge pivot from last year’s meeting, when “curbing the disorderly expansion of capital” ruled the day. To counter rising economic risks, policymakers pledged at this year’s meeting to “front load” policies, including keeping the monetary stance “flexible.” Last week, the central bank lowered the reserve requirement ratio for most banks by half a percentage point. That move, which reduces the amount of money that banks have to keep in reserve, is expected to unleash some 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) for business and household loans, according to the PBOC.

CNN — An unprecedented fossil of a baby dinosaur curled up perfectly inside its egg is shedding more light on the links between dinosaurs and birds. The 70-million-year-old fossil preserves the embryonic skeleton of an oviraptorid dinosaur, which has been nicknamed Baby Yingliang after the name of the Chinese museum which houses the fossil.  Baby dinosaur bones are small and fragile and are only very rarely preserved as fossils, making this a very lucky find, said Darla Zelenitsky, an associate professor in the department of geoscience at the University of Calgary in Canada. A photo of the 70-million-year-old embryonic oviraptorid fossil. Wang Yi “It is an amazing specimen … I have been working on dinosaur eggs for 25 years and have yet to see anything like it,” said Zelenitsky, a coauthor of the research that published in the journal iScience on Tuesday. “Up until now, little has been known of what was going on inside a dinosaur’s egg prior to hatching, as there are so few embryonic skeletons, particularly those that are complete and preserved in a life pose,” she said in an email. The egg is around 17 centimeters (7 inches) long and the dinosaur was estimated to be 27 centimeters (11 inches) long from head to tail. The researchers believe as an adult, had it lived, it would have been about two to three meters long. Dinosaurs rediscovered The messy origin and evolution of flight What we’ve been getting wrong about dinosaurs The mystery of dinosaur sex What dinosaur illnesses reveal about how they lived – and died Why dinosaurs capture kids’ hearts The researchers from China, the UK and Canada studied the positions of Baby Yingliang and other previously found oviraptorid embryos. They concluded that the dinosaurs were moving and changing poses before hatching in a way similar to baby birds. In modern birds, such movements are associated with a behavior called tucking, which is controlled by the central nervous system and is critical for hatching success. Wang Yi “Most known non-avian dinosaur embryos are incomplete with skeletons disarticulated(bones separated at the joints),” said Waisum Ma, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK, in a statement. “We were surprised to see this embryo beautifully preserved inside a dinosaur egg, lying in a bird-like posture. This posture had not been recognized in non-avian dinosaurs before.” A reconstruction of a soon-to-hatch baby dinosaur based on the fossil. Courtesy Darla Zelenitsky All birds directly evolved from a group of two-legged dinosaurs known as theropods, whose members include the towering Tyrannosaurus rex and the smaller velociraptors. The pre-hatching behavior isn’t the only behavior modern birds inherited from their dinosaur ancestors. The same kind of dinosaurs are also known to have sat on top of their eggs to incubate them in a way similar to birds, Zelenitsky said. The fossil was found in China’s Jiangxi province and acquired in 2000 by Liang Liu, a director of a Chinese stone company called Yingliang Group.

Landslides and collapsed buildings in China's east Zhejiang province on Sunday, as well as additional destruction in Shandong province on Monday, left at least 44 people dead and 16 others missing, Reuters said, citing official data. \nThe storm on Sunday battered the coast south of Shanghai, the nation's financial capital, which is home to more than 20 million people. The strongest typhoon of the year then headed further north along the east coast and brought torrential rains and heavy winds to the Shandong Province, state media said. \nAs of Monday, the storm had caused an estimated $2.55 billion in damages, Reuters said. \nTake a look at the devastation thus far.\nTyphoon Lekima started out as a tropical depression on August 2, then quickly picked up speed as it headed northwest.\nThe tropical depression (essentially a group of thunderstorms) originated in the Philippine Sea. Five days later, on August 7, it morphed into a super typhoon, with a wind speed of at least 150 miles per hour.\nBefore making its way to China, the storm passed through the Philippines, where it caused flooding in more than 400 areas.\nThe Red Cross estimated that more than 17,000 households in the Philippines were affected by the disaster.\nThe storm prompted the cancellation of hundreds of flights across major airports in China.\nChina uses a color-coded system to inform citizens about weather conditions. Before the storm made landfall, China's weather bureau issued a \"red alert\" — the most severe type of warning.\nShanghai Disneyland was also closed due to inclement weather.\nIn 2017, the theme park became the most-visited site in China, with more than 11 million annual visitors.\nA million people were evacuated from their homes ahead of the storm's arrival.\nEvacuees included more than 250,000 residents in Shanghai and 800,000 residents in China's Zhejiang province.\nLekima made landfall in Eastern China on the morning of August 10.\nBy that time, Lekima had weakened to the equivalent of a Category 3 storm, with wind speeds of 116 miles per hour.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration classifies Category 3 storms as capable of causing \"devastating damage.\"\nThe storm's arrival triggered a landslide in the port city of Wenzhou, where a natural dam collapsed under pressure from heavy rain.\nChina typhoon 1\nCars are damaged in the Zhejiang province after Typhoon Lekima made landfall. Wang Gang/CNS/Reuters\nAn estimated 200 homes in the Zhejiang province also collapsed due the storm. \nAround 2.7 million of the province's households endured blackouts as the storm ravaged electricity lines.\nShandong Province, located in the country's east, experienced torrential rains and heavy winds on Sunday.\nChina typhoon 3.JPG\nPeople wade through floodwaters on a street in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. Stringer/Reuters\nLekima is the third-largest typhoon on record in China. \nAs of Sunday evening, more than 6.5 million people were impacted by the storm, according to state media. \nThe death toll from the storm rose to 44 on Monday, and 16 others were presumed missing.\nAs of Monday, the storm was expected to weaken as it headed off the coast of Shandong, Reuters said.

Flights appeared to be operating normally.\nRiot police clashed briefly with the demonstrators, who said they planned to return to the airport early Wednesday local time.\nThe airport says it has an injunction to restrain protesters.\nProtesters restrain a man on a luggage trolley, who protesters claimed was a Chinese undercover agent.\nHong Kong police tweeted that a visitor was “besieged” by protesters, who they believed was an undercover cop.\nProtesters cable-tied the man’s hands and claimed to have found his name on an online list of police officers in southern Guangdong province. Police used pepper spray to get past the protesters and get the man to hospital.\nProtesters also detained a second man who they suspected of being an undercover agent.\nAfter emptying out his belongings, they found a blue T-shirt that has been worn by pro-Beijing supporters that they said was evidence he was a spy.\nAs with the first man, some protesters tied his wrists together and poured water over his head, inciting laughter from some in the crowd.\nAirport security appeared unable to control the crowd.\nAn injured man who was suspected by protesters of being a Chinese spy is taken away by paramedics.\nHu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese tabloid, said the man was one of his reporters.\n“Fu Guohao, reporter of GT website is being seized by demonstrators at HK airport,” Hu wrote on his widely followed Twitter account.\n“I affirm this man being tied in this video is the reporter himself. He has no other task except for reporting.”\nOne protester used a US flag to beat Fu as he lay on the floor in a foetal position.\nOther protesters and first aid workers attempted to stop some who tried to trample the man, while pro-democracy politician Kwok Ka-ki crouched beside him and tried to calm the attackers.\nAfter a heated argument, protesters eventually allowed ambulance workers to take the man away on a stretcher.\nMORE: How Hong Kong protests will hurt Australia\nAn injured man, who was suspected by protesters of being an undercover police officer, is taken away by paramedics.\nHong Kong police said they arrested five people for unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers and possessing weapons.\nPolice have acknowledged using “decoy” officers, and the violence followed weekend sightings of men dressed like demonstrators — in black and wearing face masks — appearing to arrest protesters.\nThe airport closed check-in for remaining flights late Tuesday afternoon as protesters swarmed the terminal and blocked access to immigration for departing passengers.\nMore than 100 flights were cancelled on Tuesday, the fifth consecutive day that protesters occupied the airport.\nAirlines were still working through a backlog of more than 200 flights from Monday when the airport announced in the afternoon that check-in processes would once again be suspended.\n“Democracy is a good thing,” said signs that appeared to be aimed at mainland Chinese and foreign travellers.\nMORE: Why Hong Kong could go down path of no return\nPolicemen in riot gear arrest a protester during a demonstration at Hong Kong’s international airport.\nMany signs also contained apologies for the disruption to travellers: “We stand here to obstruct, only for one single reason. We love and care for Hong Kong. We hope you will understand. Sorry.”\nOfficials said in a statement that some protesters detained, harassed and assaulted a traveller and a journalist, and obstructed ambulance workers from taking the two men to the hospital. They said other protesters attacked a police officer and snatched a baton from him.\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump has claimed that his intelligence sources have told him that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the border with Hong Kong.\n“Everyone should be calm and safe!” he wrote on Twitter.\n“Many are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong.

I am one of the flag guards.,” he said.\nJackie Chan has pledged allegiance to China.\n“Hong Kong is my birthplace and my hometown. China is my home country,” he said. “I love my country.

The nationalistic Chinese tabloid the Global Times tweeted footage of one irate Australian passenger who confronted young demonstrators and told them to “go get a job”.\nStranded travellers gather at the departure hall of the Airport in Hong Kong.\nOthers told AFP they were angry at having their travel plans frustrated. “I don’t mind what they [the protesters] do but they made us five hours delayed,” said 50-year-old Wing Au-yeung, who had stopped off in the city to collect his aged mother before travelling to South Korea with his family.\n“They can do what they want but it should not affect other people.”\nAs the crisis worsened, there were fears “something extraordinarily bad is about to happen” after a convoy of military-style vehicles was filmed amassing across the border from Hong Kong.\nVideo posted on Twitter by senior political Adviser at Renew Europe, Alexandre Krauss, purports to show dozens of trucks in Shenzhen, China.\nEarlier Krauss posted another video describing the situation.\n“The Chinese military, believing in the intel and these videos, have set in place a comprehensive military operation targeting the situation in #HongKong,” he said.\nThe footage was released by the Chinese government.\nThe state-run People’s Daily did not comment on the purpose of the vehicles, but noted that the People’s Armed Police are in charge of “handling riots, turmoil, seriously violent, criminal activities, terrorist attacks and other societal security incidents”.\nThe footage was aired on Chinese state TV and came hours after Beijing authorities slammed Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, linking them to “terrorism”.\n“Hong Kong’s radical demonstrators have repeatedly used extremely dangerous tools to attack police officers, which already constitutes a serious violent crime, and also shows the first signs of terrorism emerging,” said Yang Guang, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.\n“This wantonly tramples on Hong Kong’s rule of law and social order.”\nSome Hong Kong legal experts say the official description of terrorism could lead to the use of anti-terror laws.",

The controversial extradition bill would allow suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China for trial. Organisers say there were one million people, which would make it the biggest march in more than 20 years. Police say there were 240,000 at its peak. After it ended, clashes erupted between hundreds of demonstrators and police. Protesters, some wearing surgical masks, tried to break into the Legislative Council complex, throwing crowd control barriers around, and police in riot gear used batons and pepper spray. Some of the protesters and policemen were later seen with faces covered in blood. Fears over Hong Kong-China extradition plans Hong Kong independence 'a non-starter' Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Timeline of Hong Kong's history Critics to the bill say those in the former British colony would be exposed to China's deeply flawed justice system, and it would lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. But supporters say safeguards are in place to prevent anyone facing religious or political persecution from being extradited to mainland China, and that the proposal will plug loopholes. How did the protest unfold? For several hours on Sunday, protesters marched in the sweltering heat dressed in white, in a mainly peaceful demonstration that included a wide range of people - from businesspeople and lawyers to students, pro-democracy figures and religious groups. Many carried banners saying \"Scrap the evil law!\" and \"Oppose China extradition!\". Clashes erupted at night after a mostly peaceful march during the day The figures given by organisers and police vary because of the different methods they use to calculate the crowds: while organisers estimate overall numbers, police look at how many people were gathered at one peak. If the organisers' estimate is confirmed as correct, it would be the largest demonstration in Hong Kong since the territory was handed to China in 1997. The march was seen as a major rebuke of Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who has pushed for the amendments to be passed before July. \"This is the end game for Hong Kong, it is a matter of life or death. That's why I come,\" Rocky Chang, a 59-year-old professor, told Reuters news agency. EPA Hundreds of thousands of people joined the mainly peaceful march \"The people's voices are not being heard,\" 18-year-old student Ivan Wong told AFP news agency. \"This bill will not just affect Hong Kong's reputation as an international finance centre, but also our judicial system. That has an impact on my future.\" Reacting to the protest, a government spokesman said in a statement the proposals were \"firmly grounded in the rule of law\" and that the second reading of the bill at the Legislative Council would resume on Wednesday. What are the proposed changes? The changes will allow for extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoing such as murder and rape. The requests will then be decided on a case-by-case basis. Hong Kong officials have said Hong Kong courts will have the final say over whether to grant such extradition requests, and suspects accused of political and religious crimes will not be extradited. Tensions flare up with lawmakers jumping over tables The government has sought to reassure the public with some concessions, including promising to only hand over fugitives for offences carrying maximum sentences of at least seven years. There has been a lot of public opposition, and critics say people would be subject to arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture under China's judicial system. Why the change now? The latest proposal has come after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend while they were holidaying in Taiwan together in February last year. The man fled Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong last year. Taiwanese officials have sought help from Hong Kong authorities to extradite the man, but Hong Kong officials say they cannot comply because of the lack of an extradition agreement with Taiwan. But the Taiwanese government has said it will not seek to extradite the murder suspect under the proposed changes, and has urged Hong Kong to handle the case separately. Isn't Hong Kong under Chinese rule anyway? A former British colony, Hong Kong is semi-autonomous under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The city has its own laws and its residents enjoy civil liberties unavailable to their mainland counterparts. Getty Images Under Xi Jinping, Beijing is seeking increasing control over Hong Kong Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US, but no such agreements have been reached with mainland China despite ongoing negotiations in the past two decades. Critics have attributed such failures to poor legal protection for defendants under Chinese law.

Chinese actress Liu Yifei, a naturalised US citizen, reposted a viral pro-police comment on Chinese social media platform Weibo. The territory has been convulsed by sometimes violent pro-democracy protests over the past 10 weeks. Rights groups and the UN have accused the police of a heavy handed response. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet What is mainland China hearing about Hong Kong? Ms Liu had shared a Weibo post from the government-run Beijing newspaper People's Daily that read (in Chinese): \"I also support Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now.\" The post adds in English: \"What a shame for Hong Kong.\" Disney The film is a remake of the 1998 animation The quote referred to what are said to be the words of a reporter for the state newspaper Global Times, who was attacked by protesters at Hong Kong's airport earlier this week after being accused of being an undercover police agent. Ms Liu shared the post and echoed the comment by saying: \"I also support Hong Kong police.\" How Disney aims to win over China with Mulan She received widespread support on the platform, which is subject to censorship. But on Twitter, which is banned in China, the hashtag #BoycottMulan began gaining traction. Twitter users accused the actress of supporting police brutality, and also pointed to the freedoms she enjoys as an American citizen. Allow Twitter content?

[Photo: Xinhua] The earthquake hit Changning County of Yibin City at 10:55 p.m. Monday (Beijing Time). The epicenter, with a depth of 16 km, was monitored at 28.34 degrees north latitude and 104.90 degrees east longitude, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. Nine people died in Changning and four more in neighboring Gongxian County, Li Tinggen, secretary-general of the municipal government of Yibin, said at the press conference. As of Tuesday afternoon, nearly 200 people were injured. Among them, six are in critical conditions and another 16 are severely injured. At around 6:30 p.m., a severely injured victim was transported by a helicopter to the Sichuan provincial people's hospital for further treatment. Nie Taimin, deputy director of the municipal bureau of emergency management, said the number of injured has increased as the conditions of some remote areas with poor communications were updated during the day. The quake affected more than 140,000 people and damaged over 12,700 houses. Some 8,447 residents have been evacuated in quake-hit areas so far.

[Photo: Xinhua] RESCUE CONTINUES AMID AFTERSHOCKS In a temporary shelter in Shuanghe Township, dozens of relief tents had been set up. Each tent was about 12 square meters, with five simple beds inside and two dry powder fire extinguishers outside. Outside the tents, people were provided with free water, instant noodles, bread and other food, and power workers were offering charging services. Luo Lian, 30, was still shaken when she recalled last night's earthquake. \"We were scared to death and rushed out having no shoes on. Our legs were shaking even after we were safe,\" Luo said. On Monday evening, Luo stayed on the third floor with her two children when the quake struck. At the beginning, she thought the shake was just an illusion. However, a stronger tremor was felt soon, as the whole house clanged and the kids began to cry. When Luo realized it was a quake, the electricity was cut off at her home. The mother had to run downstairs with her children in the dark. Luo was grateful that the workers in the shelter took good care of her and her children. \"Now we don't worry about the food supply. We're just afraid of the aftershocks and can't go home.\" As of 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, a total of 17 aftershocks measuring 3-magnitude or above have been recorded in the areas. Statistics showed that more than 3,000 people joined the rescue work.

[Photo: Xinhua] The Ministry of Emergency Management has activated an emergency response and sent a working team to the stricken areas to provide guidance in rescue and disaster relief. The ministry and the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration have dispatched 5,000 tents, 10,000 folding beds and 20,000 quilts to the quake-hit areas. Li said 15 medical teams with about 60 members from Yibin's hospitals have reached the quake-hit areas. China's armed police forces were also dispatched for rescue soon after the earthquake. Meanwhile, more than 1,800 militia members have been mobilized overnight to offer emergency relief, including on-the-spot rescue, disaster detection, and duties of vigilance, in the quake-stricken areas. Seven main roads connecting Changning and Gongxian counties with the epicenter have been cleared and reopened by Tuesday afternoon, according to Li. As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, State Grid Sichuan Electric Power Company has mobilized 294 emergency rescue personnel and 70 vehicles to the quake areas for the power repair and temporary power supply. More than 24,000 households have regained power.

[Photo: Xinhua] EARLY WARNING SYSTEM On Monday night, Yibin residents received alarms 10 seconds before the quake hit, while citizens in the provincial capital Chengdu, more than 200 km away from the epicenter, got alarms about a minute before the seismic waves hit the city. Early warnings were issued through a variety of channels, including public broadcasting system, local television stations, mobile apps and the Internet. The early warning system was jointly built by the Institute of Care-Life, an organization that studies earthquakes in Chengdu, and local emergency management authorities. Preliminary statistics showed that 79 county-level areas in 13 cities and prefectures issued early warnings via television stations. A total of 212 schools in several cities and 101 residential communities in Chengdu received alarms in advance. \"The system was not designed to predict earthquakes,\" said Wang Tun, director of Care-Life. \"It uses the theory that radio waves travel faster than seismic waves and provides automatic warnings seconds before quake waves arrive.\" Earthquake research has found that being aware of an earthquake three seconds beforehand can save 14 percent of casualties, 10 seconds can save 39 percent of casualties and 20 seconds can save 63 percent of casualties. The early warning system has covered an area of 2.2 million square km, providing services to about 90 percent of the population in China's quake-prone regions, according to Wang.

The temporary licence lasts until Aug. 19.\n\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWashington claims Huawei poses a national security threat, and its placement on the so-called Entity List by the Trump administration last week is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.\n\nThis is major crisis for Huawei. How competitive is a smartphone without the most well-known and popular apps?\n- Roger Entner of Recon Analytics\n\n\"This is major crisis for Huawei. Instead of being the world's largest handset manufacturer this year, it will struggle to stay two, but probably fall behind,\" analyst Roger Entner said. \"How competitive is a smartphone without the most well-known and popular apps?\"\n\nHuawei will likely use its own, stripped-down version of Android, whose basic code is provided free of charge by Google. But it's not yet clear what other Google software and services — such as maps, Gmail or search — it will be able to use.\n\nEntner, founder of Recon Analytics, said Google itself won't have a large direct impact, \"as consumers will shift to other Android devices. The biggest concern is not to be caught in the crossfire of two governments.\"\n\nConsumers will pay the price for Google cutting ties with Huawei, says cyber policy expert\n\nGartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said 48 per cent of Huawei's phone shipments last year were outside of China and the company will need to scramble not to lose market share.\n\nSamsung led global smartphone sales in the first quarter of this year with a 23.1-per-cent share. Huawei was second with 19 per cent, followed by Apple at 11.7 per cent, according to tech consulting firm IDC.\n\nU.S. adds Huawei to trade blacklist\n\nCBC ExplainsWhat's the U.S.-China trade war all about?\n\nHuawei's smartphone sales in the U.S. are tiny — and the Chinese company's footprint in telecommunications networks is limited to smaller wireless and internet providers — so any impact on U.S. consumers of a Google services cutoff would be slight.\n\nHardware suppliers led by Qualcomm, Broadcom and Intel would also be forced to halt shipments to Huawei under the Commerce Department rule, which requires all U.S. technology sales to the company to obtain U.S. government approval unless exceptions are made.\n\nIn a report, the global risk assessment consultancy Eurasia Group said that if the Commerce Department sanction process helps persuade European carriers to shun Huawei equipment, a full ban on purchases of U.S. technology products and services could be avoided.\n\nGoogle, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said in a statement late Sunday that it was complying with and \"reviewing the implications\" of the requirement for export licences for technology sales to Huawei, which took effect Thursday.\n\n\"For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,\" it added.\n\n'Considerable implications' for device sales\n\nThe U.S. government says Chinese suppliers including Huawei and its smaller rival, ZTE Corp., pose an espionage threat because they are beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing.\n\nTrump signs executive order clearing the way to ban Huawei from U.S. networks\n\nBanning Huawei from Canada's 5G networks could be costly for taxpayers\n\nHuawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, reported earlier that its worldwide sales rose 19.5 per cent last year over 2017 to 721.2 billion yuan ($105.2 billion US). Profit rose 25.1 per cent to 59.3 billion yuan ($8.6 billion).\n\nHuawei smartphone shipments rose 50 per cent in the first three months of 2019 to 59.1 million, compared with a year earlier, while the global industry's total fell 6.6 per cent, according to IDC. Shipments from Samsung and Apple both declined.\n\nHuawei promises 'safe and sustainable software'\n\nHuawei defended itself Monday as \"one of Android's key global partners.\" The company said it helped to develop a system that \"benefited both users and the industry.\"\n\n\"We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally,\" the company said.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson, Lu Kang, said China will \"monitor the development of the situation\" but gave no indication how Beijing might respond.\n\nHuawei's devices in China do not have Google apps, but the U.S. move to block the sale to Huawei of crucial components could hugely damage the brand's appeal to consumers in markets outside China. (Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. order took effect last Thursday and requires government approval for all purchases of American microchips, software and other components globally by Huawei and 68 affiliated businesses. Huawei says that amounted to $11 billion in goods last year.\n\nThat could certainly create some collateral damage for U.S. companies.\n\nThe California chipmaker Xilinx Inc. tumbled four per cent Monday.\n\nDavid Wong, an analyst with Nomura, said Xilinx has benefited from demand in next-generation, 5G technologies and \"action against a major maker of communications infrastructure equipment like Huawei likely poses risk for Xilinx.\"",

Commentary in Chinese state media Sunday signaled that Beijing is losing patience with protesters . State-run media outlet Xinhua said the central government had the “authority” and “responsibility” to intervene and prevent riots in Hong Kong – reiterating comments made by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw Hong Kong’s return to China from British rule under a dual governance setup, which gives the city a separate legal system with more democratic freedoms until 2047. Sunday’s pro-democracy protests had begun peacefully. Thousands braved a thunderstorm to march from Kwai Chung to Tseun Wan district, in the city’s New Territories. They showed up dressed in plastic ponchos and rain coats, and huddled under a sea of umbrellas.

Kwok/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images But the violence returned Sunday evening, when a smaller group of protesters broke away from the day’s main police-approved march – now a familiar feature of the protests. They used traffic cones and street railings to build makeshift barricades in the street, and threw bricks, metal poles, and petrol bombs at police. Twenty-one police officers were injured, police said Monday. Tear gas was initially deployed but failed to disperse the group. Later, a water cannon was used against a makeshift barricade, marking the first time water cannon vans had ever been used in the city. Protesters were pushed back, but again the crowd didn’t disperse. As the violence escalated, six officers drew their pistols after being surrounded by armed protesters and one officer fired a live shot into the air, police said. The Hong Kong police said in a statement that the officers were “surrounded, under attacks and facing threats to life” and one officer fired “a warning shot to the sky without any other choices.” Riot police fire tear gas at protesters during a clash at an anti-government rally in Tsuen Wan district on August 25, 2019 in Hong Kong. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images In a statement, police said protesters’ actions were “outrageous and have overstepped the bottom line of a civilized society,” and added that they “will take relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice.” In total, 86 people were arrested over the weekend for unlawful assembly, including a 12-year-old boy and a 51-year-old. The 12-year-old’s arrest highlights the presence of young children at some violent scenes of the protest movement, days before the school semester begins. A Hong Kong spokesperson told CNN that it is possible for the child to be charged under Hong Kong laws. Police said that arrestees’ offenses on Sunday included unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers. According to organizers on the messaging platform Telegram, the march was intended to reiterate protesters’ core demands – withdrawal of an extradition bill, the dropping of riot charges of those arrested, an independent inquiry into police and greater democratic reforms – as well as express opposition to alleged police brutality.

Anthony Kwan/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images Week of calm shattered Violence also broke out Saturday , after thousands in the city’s east Kwun Tong district marched for the movement’s five demands, and against the government’s installation of “smart” environmental monitoring lampposts, which have sparked privacy concerns. Demonstrators attempted to tear down or dismantle some of the city’s 50 newly-installed so-called “smart lampposts” – which have cameras and sensors – in a protest against perceived government surveillance. The Hong Kong government said the lamp posts, which are intended to track data such as air quality and traffic flow, are not equipped with facial recognition software and “would not infringe upon personal privacy.” Police arrested 32 people on Saturday – 22 men and 10 women between the ages of 15 and 22 – on suspicion of weapons possession, assault of police and unlawful assembly. The stand off brought an end to a week of relative calm in Hong Kong, which had seen numerous clashes between protesters and police since early summer. After tear gas was fired nearly every weekend in July, last weekend saw an estimated 1.7 million people brave the heavy rain and heat to march peacefully. The calm continued through the week, with protesters peacefully creating a human chain across the city on Friday – the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way human chain. Thousands of protesters gathered in Hong Kong's Tsuen Wan district on August 25, 2019. Rebecca Wright However, senior police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said this week that officers had been targeted and exposed online even while there was temporary peace on the streets. The police said officers’ personal data, contact information, home addresses and more had been shared online, and accused protesters of threatening officers’ families. They called the doxxing tactic “a kind of psychological war,” and said they had arrested 16 people on suspicion of disclosing personal data without consent and causing harm, and unauthorized access to a computer. Police fire tear gas in Tseun Wan in Hong Kong on August 25, 2019 in the latest opposition to a planned extradition law that has since morphed into a wider call for democratic rights in the semi-autonomous city. LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Families of police speak out A group of Hong Kong Police relatives held their own rally on Sunday, calling for a communication platform between the police and the public “to mend the broken relationship,” and asking the police to act “with malice or ill-will toward none,” according to a Facebook post by organizers . The group of about 400 attempted to deliver a letter to Chief Executive Carrie Lam, saying that their relatives in the police force should not be “used as a shield” and that Lam should “settle the political issue with politics.” The group did not denigrate the protest movement, instead said that the police force were “being pushed by political issues to confront the public.” Zach Blas' project \"Facial Weaponization Suite\" comprises of three different types of masks that he claims cannot be detected as human faces facial recognition software. Zach Blas Related article Why protests are becoming increasingly faceless “Moreover, the mismanagement within the HKPF (Hong Kong Police Force ) and malpractices of some frontline police officers all caused the police-civilian relationship to fall into a tragic abyss.” Hong Kong has been protesting now for almost three months. It all began in June, sparked by a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. Although the bill has since been suspended, protesters’ demands have evolved and expanded to include Lam’s resignation, the full withdrawal of the bill, and universal suffrage. Lam has condemned violence and pledged greater communication with the public, but many feel that’s not enough: some protesters say they will continue demonstrating until she responds to their demands. The nonstop protests have taken a toll on everyone involved – on Saturday, Lam had posted a lengthy statement on Facebook appealing for peace and dialogue. “After more than two months, everyone is tired. Can we sit down and talk about it?” she said, acknowledging that there were deeper societal problems beyond the immediate violence that needed to be addressed. Correction: A homepage headline referring to this story and posted briefly on Aug. 25 inaccurately said Hong Kong police had used petrol bombs. In fact, police deployed water cannons and drew guns; protestors threw petrol bombs. The inaccuracy was not reported in this article or on this article page.

        "text": "Alphabet Inc’s Google announced on Thursday that its YouTube streaming video service disabled 210 channels appearing to engage in a coordinated influence operation around the Hong Kong protests, days after Twitter and Facebook said they dismantled a similar campaign originating in mainland China.\n“This discovery was consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter,” said Shane Huntley, one of Google’s security leaders, in a blog post. But he stopped short of identifying the origin of the channels.\nTwitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. on Monday said that channels they had removed had engaged in a state-backed effort by China to undermine the protests in Hong Kong through posts calling participants dangerous and vile extremists.\nThe protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.\n“We are deeply concerned by Chinese attempts to manipulate public opinion by spreading disinformation about the situation in Hong Kong,” a United States State Department spokeswoman told Reuters.\nIn Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on YouTube’s decision, but said the Chinese people’s greatest wish was for the chaos and violence to end in Hong Kong.\n“The will of 1.4 billion people cannot be blocked or controlled, and of course cannot be shut out,” he told reporters.\nThe Chinese mission to the United Nations sent Reuters a link to a story from the ruling Communist Party media outlet People’s Daily that said Twitter and Facebook “abused media freedom” in cracking down on accounts that had revealed violence in the protests.\nTwitter, Facebook and YouTube are all blocked in mainland China by the government but are available in Hong Kong. Each of the services bans deceptive practices and inauthentic accounts.\nThe three companies have also come under fire from users for generating revenue and supporting state media and officials in China.\nSeveral social media users in Hong Kong have posted screenshots over the last two weeks that they said showed anti-protest advertising from outlets such as China Central Television, or CCTV, appearing on Twitter and YouTube. The ads criticized the Hong Kong protesters.\nIn response, Twitter said Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media, a change that had been in the works for months.\nFacebook spokesman Andy Stone said “we continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media.”\nYouTube said it did not plan to change its ads policies. But YouTube told Reuters that it would soon be expanding its labeling of state-backed media outlets in the region.\nYouTube places a disclaimer on its services from government-funded networks around the world, including Chinese broadcasters Xinhua, CCTV and CGTN, but it does not yet include the label for Chinese newspapers People’s Daily, China Daily and Global Times, Reuters found on Wednesday.\nSocial media companies long have courted closer relationships with news outlets and politicians around the world, hoping that getting them to post on their services would in turn attract more users. But relationships with governments such as China, which regularly faces criticism of its human rights record, have drawn scrutiny from users and lawmakers in the United States.\nFacebook’s Stone confirmed the company has conducted training in China for government and state media personnel.\n“We provide a standard set of guidance and best practice training to groups around the world including governments, political parties, media outlets, and non-profits so they can manage their Facebook Pages,” he said.\nTwitter and YouTube did not immediately respond to questions about their support and training for state media outlets, but Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that Twitter has trained Chinese officials on how to use its tools.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Videos purportedly showing hundreds of prisoners in China with their heads shaved, their hands bound behind their back and blindfolds over their faces that were posted online earlier this week appears to be authentic. The videos, posted anonymously on Twitter and YouTube Tuesday, appears to show hundreds of prisoners believed to be from China’s minority Uighur Muslims , Sky News reported. The footage shows the men sitting in lines on the floor or being moved by guards at a station in the city of Korla in Xinjian, northwest China. US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT A European security source told Sky News that they have examined the footage and that they “believe it to be genuine.” “It shows up to 600 prisoners being moved; they’re shackled together, have shaved heads, are blindfolded and have their hands behind their backs. This is typical of the way the Chinese move this type of prisoner,” the source added. The footage starts with images of the alleged detainees next at a train station. The camera then pulls back to show lines of what appear to be large blue containers or cabins in the distance. The alleged detainees are seen wearing purple bibs and black blindfolds, sitting in lines on the ground surrounded by guards. It was not immediately clear when or how the footage was taken. The security source told Sky News they believe the images were taken earlier this year. CHINA'S 'VAST, SECRET SYSTEM' OF AI REPORTEDLY TRACKS AND CONTROLS UIGHURS, A LARGELY MUSLIM MINORITY The account that posted the footage, called War on Fear, wrote: “The people of today’s society always live under the supervision of the government with high technology. Now we use technology to show the modern society of Xingjian. People lose their freedom. No hope for future.” Fox News has not independently verified the footage. Human rights organizations have accused China of holding up to 1 million people – mostly ethnic Uighurs – at sprawling detention centers in Xinjiang province. Beijing has denied the accusations and has said these facilities are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs, and others receive free skills education. However, in February, Turkey called China’s treatment of Uighurs “a great cause of shame for humanity.” CHINA REPORTEDLY CENSORING TEN COMMANDMENTS, REPLACING THEM WITH XI QUOTES INSIDE CHURCHES Earlier this week, five human rights organizations urged United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to condemn the Chinese government’s detention of Uighurs and to call for the immediate closure of government detention camps. FILE - In this May 7, 2019, file photo, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is photographed during an interview at United Nations headquarters. Guterres has strongly rejected claims by five human rights group that he hasn't condemned the Chinese government's detention of more than a million Muslims in the Xinjiang region, saying he has spoken out forcefully. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) In a letter to the U.N. chief released Tuesday, the organizations said these actions would be an important contribution to addressing \"one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time.\" It was signed by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, the International Federation for Human Rights and the World Uyghur Conference. In the letter, they said he had not only refrained from publicly criticizing China but had praised its \"Belt and Road\" initiative in which Xinjiang is a centerpiece, \"despite the human rights concerns it has raised.\" \"The public silence over the mass detention in Xinjiang in the context of such a glowing commentary sends a distressing message of abandonment to the millions of Turkic Muslims who live in constant fear for themselves and their families,\" the rights groups said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Guterres strongly rejected claims that he hasn’t condemned Beijing, saying he has spoken out forcefully. \"I don't think anyone has been more persistent and more clear in talking to the Chinese authorities in relation to this issue than myself,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"It is absolutely not true that I've only done discreet diplomacy.\" Guterres said he told the Chinese \"that it is very important to act in a way that each community feels that their identity is respected and that they belong, at the same time, to the society as a whole.\" \"There couldn't be a more clear message,\" he said. \"So, if there is an area where I believe I've been doing publicly much more than many other leaders around the world (it) is this.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

When is a set of wrist watches not just a set of wrist watches? When is a river crab not just a river crab? Inside the Great Firewall of China of course. Winnie the Pooh has joined a line of crazy, funny internet references to China's top leaders. The Chinese name for and images of the plump, cute cartoon character are being blocked on social media sites here because bloggers have been comparing him to China's president. When Xi Jinping and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe endured one of the more awkward handshakes in history netizens responded with Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore shaking hands. Weibo/AFP And then there was the time President Xi popped his head out of the roof of his special Red Flag limousine to inspect the troops - a photo appeared online of a toy Winnie the Pooh popping out of his own little car. Empics It is not only that China's censors will not tolerate ridicule of the country's leader, they do not want this beloved children's character becoming a kind of online euphemism for the Communist Party's general secretary. In other countries such comparisons might be thought of as harmless enough and some might even think that having Winnie as your mascot could even be quite endearing: not in China. Here the president is Mr Grey. He doesn't do silly things; he has no quirky elements; he makes no mistakes and that is why he is above the population and unable to be questioned. The previous Chinese Leader Hu Jintao had a catchphrase of \"promoting a harmonious society\" or, in Chinese, hexie 和谐. Bloggers started to refer to being censored as having been \"harmonised\" - bei hexie le 被和谐了 - but, by changing the tones in Chinese or changing the characters, you can fudge the meaning. So another hexie is river crab 河蟹。In other words, when you see an image of a river crab on the internet in China, it is likely to be a reference to something having been censored. Another Chinese leader Jiang Zemin came up with a political theory called Three Represents, san ge daibiao 三个代表。If you switch that around a bit it becomes dai san ge biao 带三个表, or wear three watches. So the wearing of three watches became a cheeky way of referring to his contribution to China's socialism \"with Chinese characteristics\".

For example they have been extremely successful at virtually wiping out the existence of the country's number one dissident Liu Xiaobo - the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who died in custody here last week - at least as far as the general public goes. Most Chinese citizens have simply never heard of him. AFP/Getty Images Liu Xiaobo was better known abroad than he was in China If you have anything to do with China at all here is a way of testing the censorship regime for yourself. Everybody in China uses the Wechat (Weixin 微信) App… and I do mean pretty much everybody. Sit down next to a friend who also has Wechat on their phone. Now try and send them a text message using the name \"Liu Xiaobo\". On your phone it will appear as if you have sent the message but your friend will not get it. The Chinese authorities can just punch certain words or phrases into whatever blocking mechanism they use and shut down discussion of a topic. Wechat is a privately owned company but China's tech giants must toe the Party line. Winnie the Pooh has actually fallen foul of the authorities here before. This renewed push against online Pooh is because we are now in the run-up to the Communist Party Congress this autumn. The meeting takes place every five years and, amongst other things, sees the appointment of the new Politburo Standing Committee: the now seven-member group at the top of the Chinese political system. Xi Jinping will also be using the Congress, which marks the beginning of his second term in office, to further solidify his grip on power by promoting allies and sidelining those seen as a threat. It had been thought that China has transformed into a system of two-term governance for the country's supreme leader but this is merely a recent convention rather than a rule. So, because President Xi has made so many enemies within the Party as a result of his widespread anti-corruption crackdown, many have questioned whether he can afford to give up power after the next five-year term. In order to stay on he will believe that he needs to ensure there are no cracks in the absolute loyalty he demands. And, in this climate, there is seen to be no room for even the most frivolous challenges to his supreme authority.
