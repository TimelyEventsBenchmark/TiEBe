Burkina Faso, which is currently battling an Islamist insurgency, says it wants to defend itself. There are currently 400 French special forces in Burkina Faso, who have just one month to leave. On Thursday, France said it would also recall its ambassador to the country for consultations. Burkina Faso's junta had demanded the ambassador's replacement over his comments about the country's deteriorating security situation. Last year French troops also left neighbouring Mali, where they had spent eight years fighting jihadists. France has kept close military links with many of its former colonies in West Africa and has been helping several of them fight jihadists who are active across the region under the now terminated Operation Barkhane. Some 3,000 French soldiers are still deployed in West Africa, mostly in Niger and Chad. Its continued ties, especially economic, have led to some resentment of its influence, which Russia has tapped into. Both Mali and the Central African Republic are now working with the Russian mercenary group, Wagner. Burkina Faso has denied reports it will also engage the Wagner Group against the jihadists but a liaison team from the mercenaries has already visited, according to the AFP news agency. A French foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed that the Burkinabè government had sent a written request for its troops to leave. \"We will respect the terms of the agreement by honouring this request,\" the spokesperson said. Burkina Faso has been hit by a decade-long insurgency that has forced nearly two million people from their homes. Most recently, suspected jihadists kidnapped around 60 women who were foraging for food in the north of the country, and at the start of the month bodies of 28 people who had been shot dead were found in the north-western town of Nouna. The women have since been released. Since Capt Ibrahim Traoré seized power in Burkina Faso in September, there has been widespread speculation that he might start working with Russian mercenaries, which neighbouring Ghana described as \"distressing\". Capt Traoré has promised to win back territory from the jihadists, and to hold democratic elections in July 2024.

Quelques milliers de manifestants, dont 200 à 300 radicaux, composaient un \"pré-cortège\" avançant à quelques centaines de mètres devant le cortège principal, scandant les slogans traditionnels des ultras. \n\nÀ mi-parcours, dans le quartier de Montparnasse, ils se sont retrouvés face aux forces de l'ordre. Quelques dizaines de personnes encagoulées et vêtues de noir ont d'abord lancé des projectiles sur les forces de l'ordre, qui ont répondu par des tirs de gaz lacrymogène. \n\nLe pré-cortège a ensuite repris sa marche, et les incidents ont été limités. La vitrine d'une agence bancaire a été cassée, et une devanture de La Poste a été endommagée. \nQUELLE MOBILISATION CE MARDI ?\n\nCe 2e round de manifestation contre la réforme des retraites a rassemblé 1,27 million de personnes dans toute la France, selon la police. Dans la capitale, ils étaient 87 000 à défiler de la place d'Italie à la place Vauban, près des Invalides.

Jules, 19 ans, explique à Aurélie Sarrot pourquoi il a tenu à venir.\nFORTE MOBILISATION À MARSEILLE\n\nAu moins 40.000 personnes ont manifesté à Marseille, une mobilisation sans précédent depuis 2003  dans la cité phocéenne.\nLACRYMOS AUX INVALIDES\n\nL'envoyée spéciale de TF1info a pu observer des mouvements de foule et des tirs de lacrymogène de la police, à l'arrivée du cortège parisien sur la place Vauban, au bout de l'esplanade des Invalides.\nMANIFS : MOBILISATION EN HAUSSE\nLE CORTÈGE PARISIEN ARRIVE PLACE VAUBAN\n\nParti de la place d'Italie vers 14h, la tête de la manifestation parisienne est arrivée place Vauban, où quelques heurts avec la police  sont observables en marge du cortège.\nRAFFINERIES : DES \"ARRÊTS\" LA SEMAINE PROCHAINE ?\n\nLa CGT a réitéré sa volonté de poursuivre sa mobilisation dans les raffineries les 6, 7 et 8 février, contre le projet de réforme des retraites, ce qui pourrait passer par \"un arrêt\" de certains sites, alors que les vacances scolaires auront juste commencé, a indiqué à l'AFP Eric Sellini, coordinateur pour TotalEnergies. \n\n\"Le moment crucial, ce sera la semaine prochaine\", assure Eric Sellini, interrogé par l'AFP dans le cortège parisien de la deuxième manifestation nationale. Plusieurs fédérations de la CGT, comme dans l'énergie ou la chimie (raffineries), ont déjà affirmé leur volonté d'inscrire le mouvement dans la durée, quitte à le durcir.\nDANS LA MANIF : \"LA RETRAITE NE PASSERA PAS\"\n\nPour Agnès, la réforme des retraites \"ne passera pas\". Cette fonctionnaire de 56 ans fait partie des manifestants rencontrés par la journaliste de TF1info Aurélie Sarrot, dans la manif parisienne.\nLE PEN : \"IL FAUT QUE LE GOUVERNEMENT RETIRE LA REFORME\"\n\nLa présidente du groupe RN commente la mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, depuis l'Assemblée nationale.\nÉCHAUFFOURÉES A PARIS\n\nQuelques échauffourées ont éclaté entre les forces de l'ordre et plusieurs dizaines d'ultras boulevard du Montparnasse à Paris, à mi-parcours de la manifestation partie de la place d'Italie peu après 14h00, ont constaté des journalistes de l'AFP. \n\nUn groupe de perturbateurs présent dans le pré-cortège selon la préfecture de police, s'est retrouvé en face-à-face avec les forces de l'ordre dans le quartier du Montparnasse.

La hausse est particulièrement frappante à Marseille, où la préfecture a compté 40.000 manifestants, contre 26.000 le 19 janvier. Un tel niveau de mobilisation n'avait pas été observé dans la cité phocéenne depuis près de vingt ans. \nLCI DANS LA MANIF PARISIENNE\nREPORTAGE DANS LA MANIF TOULOUSAINE\nJADOT (EELV) : \"LA FRANCE A MIEUX À FAIRE\" \n\nLe candidat EELV à la présidentielle de 2022 manifeste à Paris contre la réforme des retraites. Yannick Jadot affirme que plus celle-ci \"est comprise, moins elle est voulue\", et estime que \"la France a mieux à faire\".\nPARIS : 500.000 MANIFESTANTS, SELON LA CGT\n\nPlus de 500.000 personnes seraient rassemblées à Paris, pour manifester contre le projet de réforme des retraites, selon la CGT. \n\nLors de la précédente journée de mobilisation le 19 janvier, le syndicat avait dénombré 400.000 participants dans la capitale, contre 80.000 selon le ministère de l'Intérieur. \nMARSEILLE : MOBILISATION EN HAUSSE\n\nQuelque 40.000 personnes ont défilé à Marseille contre le projet de réforme des retraites, contre 26.000 le 19 janvier, a annoncé la police, la CGT revendiquant de son côté 205.000 manifestants contre 140.000 il y a 12 jours. \n\nLe nombre de manifestants indiqué par la préfecture de police a atteint un niveau qui n'avait pas été observé depuis une vingtaine d'années à Marseille, selon des décomptes de l'AFP. 50.000 personnes avaient défilé sur la Canebière en 2003 contre la réforme des retraites, et la décentralisation dans l'éducation.   \nEDF : LÉGÈRE ÉROSION DE LA MOBILISATION\n\nLe taux de grévistes chez EDF s'élevait mardi à la mi-journée à 40,3% de l'effectif global, contre 44,5% lors de la première journée de mobilisation contre le projet gouvernemental de réforme des retraites, a annoncé la direction du groupe électricien. \n\nMalgré cette participation en recul, \"la dynamique reste la même\", selon la CGT. \"Il y a plus de colère. Plus le gouvernement se débat, plus il s'enfonce\", a commenté le secrétaire fédéral de la FNME-CGT, Fabrice Coudour. \n\nLe mouvement social entraîne des baisses de production électrique chez EDF, qui atteignaient à 11h 3.210 MW, soit l'équivalent de la capacité totale de trois réacteurs nucléaires.  \nBORNE  : \"LA MAJORITÉ SERA UNIE\"\n\n\"La majorité sera unie\" sur la réforme contestée des retraites, a assuré Elisabeth Borne devant les députés macronistes, au moment où s'élançait la manifestation parisienne contre ce projet, qui suscite des critiques jusqu'au sein du camp présidentiel. \n\n\"Avec cette réforme, on se bat pour sauver le système par répartition. On se bat pour notre modèle social. Alors, je ne doute pas une seconde que la majorité sera unie\", a déclaré la Première ministre, selon un participant à l'intergroupe de la majorité, qui réunit les députés du parti présidentiel Renaissance et des partis alliés Horizons et MoDem. La majorité \"a toujours fait bloc derrière le président de la République et son projet\", a insisté Mme Borne. \nNATHALIE ARTHAUD (LO) : \"ON N'EN VEUT PAS !\"\n\n\"On n'en veut pas de cette énième attaque sur les retraites\", résume la porte-parole de Lutte Ouvrière, Nathalie Arthaud, présente dans la manifestation parisienne. La candidate du parti trotskiste à l'élection présidentielle de 2022 évoque le \"ras-le-bol général\", et souligne la diversité des profils des manifestants, au micro de LCI.\nREPORTAGE : S'ORGANISER UN JOUR DE GRÈVE\nFONCTION PUBLIQUE : MOBILISATION EN BAISSE A LA MI-JOURNÉE\n\nPrès de deux fonctionnaires sur dix (19,4%) étaient en grève en milieu de journée dans la fonction publique d'État, contre 28% lors de la première journée de mobilisation contre le projet gouvernemental de réforme des retraites, selon le ministère de la Fonction publique. \n\nDans la fonction publique territoriale, le taux de grévistes était en baisse également, à 7,9% contre 11,3% le 19 janvier, de même que dans la fonction publique hospitalière (8,5% contre 9,9%), précise le ministère.  \nGALÈRE DANS LES TRANSPORTS\n\nLa mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites entraîne des perturbations dans les transports ce mardi 31 janvier.\nPREMIERS CHIFFRES\n\nLes premières manifestations ont eu lieu ce matin à partir de 10 heures. Les premiers chiffres, selon la police, étaient dans les mêmes ordres de grandeur que ceux du 19 avec, par exemple, 14.000 personnes à Rouen (contre 13.000 le 19), 12.000 au Havre (contre 11.000) ou 28.000 à Nantes (contre 25.000). Une nouvelle fois, les villes moyennes semblaient en pointe  avec 7.000 manifestants à Alès (Gard, 35.000 habitants) ou 8.500 à Angoulême (9.000 le 19).\n\nÀ la Réunion, plus de 10.000 personnes selon les organisateurs, 7.300 selon la préfecture, ont manifesté dans les deux principales villes de l'île. \nQUELLE MOBILISATION ?\n\nAlors que la manifestation parisienne a débuté place d'Italie, la police se préparait en début de journée à 1,2 million de manifestants en fourchette haute, dont 100.000 à Paris. \nUNE MOBILISATION EN BAISSE CHEZ EDF\n\nSelon la direction d'EDF, la mobilisation est en baisse ce mardi 31 janvier par rapport au 19 janvier, ce qui n'empêche pas d'atteindre 40,3% de grévistes. 44,5% des salariés s'étaient déclarés en grève le 19 janvier dernier.\n\"PRÉSENT PAR SOLIDARITÉ\"\n\nJules, 19 ans, est dans le cortège parisien : \"On est présent par solidarité avec les personnes de 50, 60 ans, déjà usées par le travail, à qui on demande de travailler encore\", explique le jeune homme. \"Même si on est pas encore usé par le travail, on sait que plus tard on le fera\", lance-t-il. \"Qui a envie de perdre sa vie à tenter de la gagner ?\", s'interroge son amie.\nTENSIONS À RENNES\n\nDes violences émaillent la mobilisation à Rennes : des affrontements ont lieu entre des \"manifestants radicaux\" et les forces de l'ordre, tandis que le cortège poursuit son itinéraire \"avec une foule toujours dense\", indique Ouest-France. Sur la vidéo partagée par le quotidien régional, on aperçoit une poignée de personnes arborant un gilet jaune, et des jets de fumigènes.\nMANIFESTATIONS À TOULOUSE\n\nPlusieurs dizaines de milliers de manifestants, entre 80.000 selon les syndicats et 34.000 selon la préfecture, ont défilé mardi dans les rues de Toulouse contre la réforme des retraites, marquant \"une vraie montée en puissance\" par rapport à la première mobilisation du 19 janvier, selon la CGT.\n\n\"Il y a une vraie montée en puissance par rapport au 19 (janvier). Il y a des jeunes, des vieux, du public, du privé et beaucoup de primo-manifestants\", s'est félicité Cédric Caubère, chef de file de la CGT Haute-Garonne. Le 19 janvier, les défilés avaient réuni à Toulouse plus de 50.000 manifestants, selon les organisateurs, et 36.000 selon la préfecture.\n36,5% DE GRÉVISTES À LA SNCF\n\nLe taux de gréviste atteint 36,5% à la SNCF mardi pour la deuxième journée de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, contre 46,3% lors de la première le 19 janvier, a appris l'AFP de source syndicale.\n\nLa direction de la SNCF n'a pas souhaité confirmer ces chiffres. Le mouvement entraîne de nombreuses annulations de trains, en particulier régionaux et dans la banlieue parisienne.\nBIENTÔT LE COUP D'ENVOI À PARIS\n\nLe cortège se prépare à Paris, notamment avec des étudiants dans ses rangs, mais aussi des travailleurs sociaux. Les manifestants doivent partir de la place d'Italie à 14h.\n\"PLUS NOMBREUX QUE LE 19\"\n\nSur Twitter, l'Association pour la taxation des transactions financières et pour l'action citoyenne (Attac) affirme que le niveau de mobilisation ce mardi dépasse celui du 19 janvier.\nLE POINT SUR LES TRANSPORTS\n\nLe trafic est perturbé ce mardi sur les lignes de train, dans le métro et dans les aéroports. \n\n- Trains : Le trafic est conforme aux prévisions de la SNCF, à savoir \"très fortement perturbé\", avec environ 2 TER sur 10 en régions, seulement 25 à 30% de TGV selon les axes, quasiment pas de trains Intercités, ni aucun train de nuit. \n\n- Transports en commun : En Ile-de-France, la mobilisation des cheminots gêne la desserte de nombreuses lignes de banlieue. Côté international, Eurostar et Thalys sont censés fonctionner presque normalement, contrairement au Lyria entre la France et la Suisse. Dans le métro parisien, le trafic est conforme aux prévisions de la RATP qui s'attendait à moins de perturbations que le 19 janvier. Seules les lignes 1 et 14 automatiques fonctionnent normalement. Les chauffeurs de bus et de tramways doivent assurer 80% du service.\nÀ Marseille, une des deux lignes de métro (la ligne 1) et une des trois lignes de tramway sont complètement à l'arrêt, et la fréquence est ralentie sur les autres lignes. De même pour une trentaine de lignes de bus sur une centaine. À Nice, les trois lignes de tramway sont à l'arrêt, ainsi qu'au moins 25 lignes de bus de l'agglomération. En Corse, plusieurs traversées maritimes entre l'île et Marseille ont dû être reprogrammées à mercredi. \n\n- Avions : Dans les aéroports, c'est principalement la grève de contrôleurs aériens qui provoque des perturbations et des retards. L'annulation d'un vol sur cinq a été demandée à Paris-Orly par la direction générale de l'aviation civile pour mettre en adéquation les effectifs disponibles et le trafic attendu.\n\"ROBIN DES BOIS\"\n\nCe mardi 31 janvier, deuxième journée de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, la CGT-Mines revendique de nouvelles actions \"Robin des bois\". Dans un communiqué, elle annonce avoir débranché dans le Lot-et-Garonne, dans la nuit de lundi à mardi, 4 radars routiers et 170 concentrateurs, \"soit plusieurs milliers de compteurs Linky\".\nLES PREMIERS CHIFFRES DE LA MOBILISATION\n\nLes premiers chiffres remontés ce mardi étaient dans les mêmes ordres de grandeur que ceux du 19 avec par exemple 14.000 personnes à Rouen (contre 13.000) et 12.000 au Havre (contre 11.000). Une nouvelle fois, les villes moyennes semblaient en pointe avec 7000 manifestants, comme le 19, à Alès (Gard, 35 habitants) ou 8500 à Angoulême (9.000 le 19). À la Réunion, plus de 10.000 personnes selon les organisateurs, 7300 selon la préfecture, ont manifesté dans les deux principales villes de l'île. \n\"PLUS DE MONDE\" QUE LE 19 JANVIER SELON LES SYNDICATS\n\n\"Les premiers chiffres montrent que ça risque d'être mieux que le 19\", a assuré depuis Paris le patron de la CGT Philippe Martinez. Il y a \"plus de monde\" dans la rue que lors du premier rendez-vous, \"la mobilisation est un peu au-delà\", a abondé Laurent Berger, le secrétaire général de la CFDT, saluant \"une immense réussite aujourd'hui\". \"Tout ce qui nous remonte partout en France ce sont de très très gros chiffres, largement aussi bien voire mieux que le 19 janvier dernier\", a-t-il appuyé.\n\nQuant à la suite du mouvement, une réunion intersyndicale est prévue à compter de 18h ce mardi. \"Il y a besoin de grèves plus importantes, plus massives, qui puissent durer\", a argué Philippe Martinez. \"L'unité syndicale est très solide, ce qui donne confiance aux salariés et citoyens. Lorsque les syndicats sont unis, il y a beaucoup de monde dans la rue\", a-t-il ajouté.\n\n\"Si le gouvernement n'écoute pas ce qui est en train de s'exprimer, qui est assez inédit, (...) qu'il y a un refus du monde du travail d'aller  à 64 ans, et bien on continuera et on fera d'autres journées de mobilisation\", a poursuivi Laurent Berger, renvoyant lui aussi à la réunion syndicale en fin de journée.\nMOBILISATION À MARSEILLE\n\nTandis que la mobilisation se poursuit à Marseille, la CGT relève 205.000 manifestants, un chiffre relayé par France 3 Régions  (nouvelle fenêtre). Le cortège prend la direction de la porte d'Aix, près de la Porte Saint-Charles.\nDES CROUS PERTURBÉS\n\nEn lien avec le mouvement de grève, certaines structures des Crous pourraient connaître des fermetures.

Ce chiffre global est en hausse par rapport à mardi : les autorités avaient recensé 757 000 manifestants au niveau national. « Plus de 2,5 millions » de personnes ont manifesté en France, selon la CGT, qui avait évoqué près de 2 millions de participants le 7 février, 2,8 millions le 31 janvier et plus de 2 millions le 19 janvier. Quel que soit le décompte retenu, la participation est en nette hausse dans la capitale . Selon la CGT, la quatrième journée de mobilisation nationale contre la réforme des retraites a réuni quelque 500 000 personnes à Paris. La Préfecture de police de Paris a fait état, de son côté, de 93 000 manifestants samedi, contre 57 000 mardi. Le cabinet Occurrence, enfin, en a dénombré 112 000. Face à l’affluence, un itinéraire bis a été ouvert une heure après le départ du cortège de la place de la République. Des incidents, dont plusieurs feux qui ont nécessité l’intervention des pompiers , ont émaillé la manifestation dans la capitale. Deux incendies ont été allumés sur le boulevard Voltaire. Plusieurs rangées de CRS faisaient face à des dizaines de jeunes, tout de noir vêtus et le visage recouvert d’un foulard. A 16 h 30, la Préfecture de police avait fait état de huit interpellations. Plusieurs manifestations en région samedi rassemblaient un peu plus de monde que celles de mardi, mais moins que celles des deux premières journées de mobilisation, selon les premiers chiffres des autorités. Le sursaut est surtout visible dans les villes moyennes, comme à Roanne, où la police a compté 6 000 manifestants, contre 3 000 mardi. Un rebond lié entre autres à la présence d’un public plus familial, avec davantage de parents accompagnés de leurs enfants dans les cortèges. Dans certaines villes, les écarts entre les chiffres des autorités et des syndicats se creusent . A Toulouse, la préfecture a dénombré 25 000 manifestants mais la CGT en a compté 100 000, soit un écart d’un à quatre, plus marqué que lors des journées précédentes. A Tarbes, la police a annoncé 4 600 manifestants, tandis que les organisateurs en ont compté 10 000. A Saint-Etienne, les chiffres variaient même d’un à six (entre 5 300 à 30 000), comme à Clermont-Ferrand (entre 8 000 et 50 000).

Ces chiffres sont en nette hausse par rapport à la précédente journée de mobilisation, mardi 7 février. Les autorités avaient alors recensé 757 000 manifestants au niveau national. Le 11/02 à 12:26 L’essentiel Partager Twitter Facebook Copier le lien Les syndicats prêts à « mettre la France à l’arrêt » le 7 mars si le gouvernement et le Parlement « restent sourds » Les huit principaux syndicats français se sont dits prêts, dans un communiqué lu par le secrétaire général de Force ouvrière, Frédéric Souillot, samedi, à « mettre la France à l’arrêt dans tous les secteurs le 7 mars » si le gouvernement et le Parlement « restent sourds à la contestation populaire » qu’illustre la mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites. La date du 8 mars, Journée internationale des droits des femmes, est également envisagée « pour mettre en évidence l’injustice sociale majeure de cette réforme envers les femmes » . Alors qu’une quatrième journée de manifestations est en cours, les syndicats ont confirmé, lors d’une conférence de presse, leur appel à un cinquième acte le 16 février, demandant à l’exécutif de « retirer son projet de loi » et aux parlementaires de « rejeter massivement ce texte » . Pour le leader de la CGT, Philippe Martinez, « la balle est dans le camp du président de la République et du gouvernement pour savoir s’il faut que le mouvement s’amplifie, se durcisse, ou s’ils prennent en compte les mobilisations actuelles » . Le numéro un de la CFDT, Laurent Berger, a lui estimé que cette annonce « d’un durcissement le 7 mars, ça laisse un peu de temps s’ils veulent réagir » , et a renvoyé la faute sur « la position ferme et définitive du gouvernement » quant au report de l’âge légal de 62 à 64 ans. « On n’est pas dans la logique de la grève reconductible » et « ce n’est pas un appel à la grève générale » non plus, a-t-il toutefois précisé, expliquant que le 7 mars fera l’objet d’un « appel à la grève de 24 heures mais pas forcément davantage » . Un choix justifié par Philippe Martinez : « La question de la reconduction ne se décide pas au niveau des confédérations syndicales, mais dans les entreprises et les services » .

Le 11/02 à 18:42 Sur le terrain Partager Twitter Facebook Copier le lien Réchauffement climatique et injustices sociales sont étroitement liés, selon les associations écologiques C’est la troisième manifestation contre la réforme des retraites à laquelle participe Jean-François Julliard, le directeur général de Greenpeace France. Une évidence pour lui, résumée par la banderole qui le précède dans sa marche vers la place de la Nation, à Paris : « Alliance écologique et sociale », le nom qui a remplacé celui de « Plus jamais ça », créée en 2020 par huit associations et syndicats. Le responsable associatif explique : « C’est la première fois que Greenpeace rejoint des manifestations pour les retraites, même si nous avons déjà participé à des cortèges sociaux comme le 1 er -Mai. Il y a un impact direct du travail sur les émissions de gaz à effet de serre. On ne peut que combattre ce projet qui vise à faire travailler plus longtemps, à produire plus de biens, plus de consommation, plus de déchets, plus d’émissions et plus de pression sur les ressources naturelles de la planète. » Pour lui, la présence des militants de son organisation, aux côtés d’autres associations comme Les Amis de la Terre, Oxfam ou Alternatiba au sein du cortège n’est pas qu’une simple démonstration de solidarité pour ses partenaires syndicaux. « Si on y va, il faut dire pourquoi. Et c’est pour apporter un éclairage différent sur les conséquences de cette réforme , ajoute Jean-François Julliard. Un élément est rarement abordé : cette réforme ne prend pas en compte les effets du réchauffement climatique. Avec des températures plus élevées, les mêmes métiers vont être de plus en plus pénibles et difficiles à faire si l’on est plus âgé. » Les militants qui ont marché pour le climat et l’écologie font le lien entre leurs causes et les injustices sociales. « Pas de justice climatique sans justice sociale » , répètent-ils. Sur une grande pancarte, à l’encre verte, l’un d’entre eux questionne : « Peut-on respirer avant d’expirer ? » Cécile Duflot, la directrice d’Oxfam, a marché lors des quatre manifestations contre une réforme « profondément inégalitaire » . « Le gouvernement ne combat pas les inégalités pour la même raison qu’il ne lutte pas réellement contre le changement climatique, en laissant se développer et dominer la rente, les intérêts financiers et économiques à court terme » , avance l’ancienne ministre du logement (2012-2014). L’ex-dirigeante des écologistes se dit impressionnée par le caractère massif et pacifique des récentes mobilisations – « un adulte sur vingt dans la rue » . Et en veut au gouvernement : « Il a zéro courage quand il faut prendre des mesures sur la transition écologique, il ne veut rien imposer, mais il se montre autoritaire sur sa réforme des retraites. » Les mêmes arguments sont déclinés d’une association à l’autre. Vincent Drezet, l’un des porte-parole d’Attac, dénonce « une répartition des richesses en faveur des superprofits qui pourraient servir à aider au financement des retraites » , quand la jeune Lucie Chhieng, 23 ans, d’Alternatiba Paris, critique « un gouvernement qui dit qu’il y a urgence à réformer les retraites, ce que ne dit même pas le COR [Conseil d’orientation des retraites]. Mais quand le GIEC [Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat] alerte sur l’urgence d’agir, le gouvernement ne fait rien ». En faisant travailler plus longtemps, la réforme du gouvernement aurait aussi des effets indirects. « Cette réforme priverait aussi les associations d’un grand nombre de retraités, obligés de travailler plus longtemps. Or, ils ont un rôle important dans la vie associative » , argumente Khaled Gaiji, président des Amis de la Terre. Sur le trottoir, des activistes de Dernière Rénovation distribuent des flyers présentant leurs actions. Kiké, 31 ans, commercial dans une entreprise solidaire et sociale, résume son engagement : « Quand tu luttes pour la rénovation énergétique des bâtiments, tu sais que les premières victimes des passoires thermiques et des grands froids sont les plus démunis. » Rémi Barroux Le 11/02 à 18:30 L’essentiel Partager Twitter Facebook Copier le lien Le point sur la mobilisation à 18 h 30 Quelque 963 000 personnes ont défilé samedi en France contre la réforme des retraites , selon le ministère de l’intérieur. Ce chiffre global est en hausse par rapport à mardi : les autorités avaient recensé 757 000 manifestants au niveau national. « Plus de 2,5 millions » de personnes ont manifesté en France, selon la CGT, qui avait évoqué près de 2 millions de participants le 7 février, 2,8 millions le 31 janvier et plus de 2 millions le 19 janvier. Quel que soit le décompte retenu, la participation est en nette hausse dans la capitale . Selon la CGT, la quatrième journée de mobilisation nationale contre la réforme des retraites a réuni quelque 500 000 personnes à Paris. La Préfecture de police de Paris a fait état, de son côté, de 93 000 manifestants samedi, contre 57 000 mardi. Le cabinet Occurrence, enfin, en a dénombré 112 000. Face à l’affluence, un itinéraire bis a été ouvert une heure après le départ du cortège de la place de la République. Des incidents, dont plusieurs feux qui ont nécessité l’intervention des pompiers , ont émaillé la manifestation dans la capitale. Deux incendies ont été allumés sur le boulevard Voltaire. Plusieurs rangées de CRS faisaient face à des dizaines de jeunes, tout de noir vêtus et le visage recouvert d’un foulard. A 16 h 30, la Préfecture de police avait fait état de huit interpellations. Plusieurs manifestations en région samedi rassemblaient un peu plus de monde que celles de mardi, mais moins que celles des deux premières journées de mobilisation, selon les premiers chiffres des autorités. Le sursaut est surtout visible dans les villes moyennes, comme à Roanne, où la police a compté 6 000 manifestants, contre 3 000 mardi. Un rebond lié entre autres à la présence d’un public plus familial, avec davantage de parents accompagnés de leurs enfants dans les cortèges. Dans certaines villes, les écarts entre les chiffres des autorités et des syndicats se creusent . A Toulouse, la préfecture a dénombré 25 000 manifestants mais la CGT en a compté 100 000, soit un écart d’un à quatre, plus marqué que lors des journées précédentes. A Tarbes, la police a annoncé 4 600 manifestants, tandis que les organisateurs en ont compté 10 000. A Saint-Etienne, les chiffres variaient même d’un à six (entre 5 300 à 30 000), comme à Clermont-Ferrand (entre 8 000 et 50 000).

Vers 16 h 50, des manifestants ont lancé des projectiles tels que des bouteilles vers la police, qui a répliqué en faisant usage à de multiples reprises à des gaz lacrymogènes mais aussi en utilisant un canon à eau. Des abribus ont été endommagés, selon un journaliste de l’AFP présent sur place. La police a demandé sur Twitter d’éviter le secteur en raison de « jets de projectiles et de cocktails Molotov sur les forces de l’ordre aux alentours de la place de la République ». « En raison des heurts en cours à l’avant de la manifestation, les organisations syndicales appellent à la dislocation du cortège institutionnel » , poursuit la police d’Ille-et-Vilaine dans un second tweet. La manifestation de samedi a rassemblé 40 000 personnes selon les syndicats (25 500 selon la préfecture), un chiffre en hausse par rapport aux défilés du 31 janvier et du 7 février. A Nantes, où le cortège a réuni 70 000 personnes selon les syndicats, 23 000 selon la police, des échauffourées ont éclaté quand les manifestants ont tenté de rejoindre le point d’arrivée sur l’île de Nantes. Pendant une heure, les forces de l’ordre ont fait usage de gaz lacrymogènes tandis que des projectiles étaient lancés dans leur direction, selon une journaliste de l’AFP.

Les huit principaux syndicats français se sont accordés sur une nouvelle date de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, le 31 janvier, selon plusieurs sources syndicales.      \n      La préfecture de police avait recensé à 18 h 30 un total de 38 interpellations dans la capitale à l'occasion de cette manifestation, partie vers 14 h 15 place de la République à destination de la place de la Nation, via la Bastille. De brèves échauffourées ont également opposé des membres de groupuscules radicalisés et violents aux forces de l'ordre, qui ont lancé la sommation de quitter la place vers 20 h 15. Au total, à Paris, pour prévenir les incidents ou les endiguer, 39 unités de forces mobiles ont été déployées, soit 3 500 policiers et gendarmes, avait annoncé le ministre de l'Intérieur Gérald Darmanin.      \n      Le cortège parisien des manifestants contre la réforme des retraites a rassemblé 400 000 personnes selon les syndicats, 80 000 selon la police. La France est \"vraiment capable d'aller chercher l'argent nécessaire ailleurs que dans deux années de travail supplémentaires pour des millions de travailleurs, surtout les métiers pénibles comme le mien\", argue un jeune homme dans la foule. Notre reportage au cœur de la manifestation à Paris :  « On n'est pas fait que pour travailler » : à Paris, les jeunes en force      \n      Les huit principaux syndicats français se sont accordés sur une nouvelle date de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, le 31 janvier, selon plusieurs sources syndicales. Les représentants des syndicats sont réunis depuis 18 heures au siège de Solidaires.      \n      Élisabeth Borne a salué les \"bonnes conditions\" dans lesquelles se sont déroulées les manifestations ce jeudi en France. La Première ministre a promis de continuer à \"débattre et convaincre\". \"Je salue l'engagement des forces de l'ordre, comme des organisations syndicales, qui ont permis aux manifestations de se dérouler dans de bonnes conditions\", a déclaré la cheffe du gouvernement sur Twitter. \"Permettre que les opinions s'expriment est essentiel pour la démocratie. Continuons à débattre et à convaincre\", a ajouté Élisabeth Borne.      \n      Plus d'un million de personnes (1,12 million) ont défilé jeudi en France, dont 80 000 à Paris, contre le projet de réforme des retraites du gouvernement, selon un décompte diffusé par le ministère de l'Intérieur. Plus de 10 000 policiers et gendarmes ont été mobilisés, dont 3 500 à Paris, pour encadrer les cortèges et endiguer les débordements éventuels lors de cette journée de mobilisation à l'appel de l'ensemble des syndicats. Philippe Martinez (CGT) a évoqué \"plus de 2 millions\" de manifestants dans le pays, dont 400 000 à Paris.      \n      La trafic ferroviaire sera à nouveau perturbé vendredi en Île-de-France sur les lignes C, D, E, H, N et U des RER et trains de la banlieue parisienne, selon SNCF Voyageurs, qui évoque \"des mouvements sociaux locaux\". La compagnie ne prévoit que 1 train sur 2 pour le RER C, 2 trains sur 3 sur les lignes D, H, N et U, et 9 trains sur 10 sur la E. Le service doit en revanche revenir à la normale sur les lignes A, B, J, K, L, P et R. Le trafic a été très perturbé jeudi sur le réseau SNCF de la région parisienne, première journée de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, avec en particulier moins de 1 train sur 10 sur une demi-douzaine de lignes, et de nombreuses gares non desservies. La RATP prévoit de son côté un retour à la normale vendredi. Jeudi, le trafic des métros et RER de la RATP en région parisienne était \"très perturbé\", avec une ligne de métro totalement fermée et douze autres ne fonctionnant, parfois partiellement, qu'en heures de pointe. La situation était meilleure pour les autobus, mais avec tout de même une douzaine de lignes interrompues.      \n      « Plus de deux millions » de personnes ont manifesté, ce jeudi, en France contre la réforme des retraites, a déclaré à l'Agence France-Presse le secrétaire général de la CGT, Philippe Martinez, alors que le chiffre du ministère de l'Intérieur n'était pas immédiatement disponible. Plus de 200 manifestations ont eu lieu à Paris et en régions, très majoritairement dans le calme, pour faire reculer le gouvernement sur son projet de porter l'âge légal de départ à la retraite de 62 à 64 ans. Quelques heurts, tensions ou dégradations ont été signalés à Paris, Lyon et Rennes.      \n      Des heurts sporadiques ont éclaté cet après-midi entre forces de l'ordre et manifestants aux abords de la place de la Bastille. Des membres de groupuscules radicalisés et violents, des black blocs, ont jeté des poubelles, bouteilles, fumigènes et divers objets sur les forces de l'ordre. Les unités mobiles sont intervenues pour disperser le groupe en faisant usage de gaz lacrymogènes. Les incidents se sont concentrés près de la Bastille et il n'y avait pas d'autres points de tensions, selon une source policière. Selon la préfecture de police, à 17 heures, 30 interpellations avaient déjà été opérées lors de cette journée de manifestation parisienne.      \n      Deux coupures volontaires et limitées de courant ont été recensées en France par le gestionnaire du réseau de distribution d'électricité Enedis jeudi, à Massy (Essonne) et Chaumont (Haute-Marne). La CGT avait prévenu de coupures d'électricité ciblées sur des communes d'élus favorables à la réforme, ce que le gouvernement avait condamné, les jugeant \"inacceptables en démocratie\". Ces deux coupures ont touché Massy en début de matinée et Chaumont, préfecture, durant une bonne partie de la matinée, selon Enedis, qui a évoqué des \"actes de malveillance présumés\". À Massy, quelque 1 100 clients ont été touchés, selon Enedis.      \nTous les soirs à partir de 18h\nRecevez l’information analysée et décryptée par la rédaction du Point.\nVotre adresse email n'est pas valide\nVeuillez renseigner votre adresse email\nMerci !Votre inscription a bien été prise en compte avec l'adresse email :\nPour découvrir toutes nos autres newsletters, rendez-vous ici : MonCompte\nEn vous inscrivant, vous acceptez les conditions générales d’utilisations et notre politique de confidentialité.\n      Quelque 400 000 personnes ont manifesté jeudi après-midi à Paris contre la réforme des retraites, selon la CGT. Le chiffre des autorités n'était pas immédiatement disponible. Des centaines de milliers de manifestants ont défilé par ailleurs en région pour faire reculer le gouvernement sur son projet de porter l'âge légal de départ à la retraite de 62 à 64 ans. Quelques heurts ou dégradations ont été signalés à Paris, Lyon et Rennes.      \n      Des heurts ont éclaté entre forces de l'ordre et manifestants autour de la place de la Bastille, avec jets de projectiles et usage de gaz lacrymogènes, lors de la contestation de la réforme des retraites. À l'avant du cortège, des membres de groupuscules radicalisés et violents, des black bloc, ont jeté des poubelles, des bouteilles et des fumigènes sur les forces de l'ordre. Les unités mobiles se sont projetées pour disperser le groupe en faisant usage de gaz lacrymogènes, à quelques pas de la place de la Bastille. Selon la préfecture de police, 20 interpellations ont été opérées lors de la manifestation.         \n      Le leader de LFI a été l'une des attractions de l'imposant cortège contre la réforme des retraites. Un bain de foule que le tribun a visiblement beaucoup apprécié.Lire notre reportage   Mélenchon manifeste à Marseille contre les retraites : « C'est mon kif ! »        \n      Plus de 13 000 manifestants à Pau, 8 000 à Châteauroux ou encore 6 500 à Mulhouse : les manifestations contre la réforme des retraites jeudi ont dépassé celles de 2019 dans de nombreuses villes moyennes, selon les chiffres des autorités. À Angoulême, où la police a dénombré 9 000 participants, près du double de la première mobilisation contre la précédente réforme des retraites. La jauge du 5 décembre 2019 est aussi nettement dépassée dans d'autres préfectures du Sud-Ouest comme Périgueux (6 500), Agen (5 000) et Guéret (3 300). Forte mobilisation également à Chartres (10 000), Alès (7 200), Boulogne-sur-Mer (5 200), Belfort (4 000) ou Auch (3 500), entre autres. Dans les grandes villes, les chiffres étaient souvent supérieurs à ceux du 5 décembre 2019, comme à Toulouse (36 000), Nantes (25 000) ou Lyon (23 000), et parfois légèrement inférieurs comme à Bordeaux (16 000) ou Montpellier (15 000).Notre reportage à Montpellier :  « On devra travailler plus longtemps » : ces jeunes, inquiets, qui manifestent       \n      À Barcelone, à l'occasion d'un sommet franco-espagnol, Emmanuel Macron a dit espérer que les manifestations contre la réforme des retraites se feront « sans trop de désagréments » pour les Français, et « évidemment sans débordements, ni violences, ni dégradations ». La réforme des retraites a été « démocratiquement présentée, validée », et elle est « surtout juste et responsable », a ajouté le président français. L'exécutif poursuivra sa réforme « avec respect, esprit de dialogue, mais détermination et esprit de responsabilité ».      \n      Frédéric, 48 ans et salarié chez L'Oréal : \"On fait partie d'une entreprise du CAC 40, on sait qu'on génère beaucoup de cash qui échappe aux salaires, donc à la cotisation. Pour nous, le principal sujet, c'est d'augmenter les recettes dans les caisses de la Sécu et les cotisations pour les retraites.\" Pour Fatima, 41 ans et également technicienne chez L'Oréal, \"c'est une injustice\". Elle fait grève pour la première fois.      \n      Près de trois fonctionnaires sur dix (28 %) étaient en grève en milieu de journée dans la fonction publique d'État, qui compte 2,5 millions d'agents, selon des chiffres communiqués par le ministère de la Fonction publique, en baisse de cinq points par rapport à 2019. Dans la fonction publique territoriale (près de 2 millions d'agents), le taux de grévistes s'élève à 11,3 % et, dans la fonction publique hospitalière (1,2 million d'agents), il atteint 9,9 %.      \n      Quelque 40 % des effectifs du groupe Engie au statut des électriciens et gaziers sont en grève contre le projet de réforme des retraites, a indiqué l'énergéticien français jeudi après-midi. Pour les autres salariés français du groupe, de droit privé, le taux de grévistes était de 7 %, selon Engie. 55 % des effectifs totaux pour la France sont au statut des industries électriques et gazières et bénéficient d'un régime spécial de retraites. Le projet de réforme des retraites changerait en leur défaveur le mode de calcul des pensions, à ce jour beaucoup plus avantageux que le régime général.      \n      En amont du cortège parisien, le premier secrétaire du PS, Olivier Faure, a réclamé la tenue d'un référendum. « Avec 85 % des Français qui sont hostiles à ce projet, si le chef de l'État avait un peu de logique dans les idées (...), il devrait soumettre maintenant ce projet à référendum », a-t-il soutenu. « La voie (que le président) a choisie est celle du passage en force. Nous, on va démontrer que la force, elle est là », a-t-il déclaré. À Abbeville, l'Insoumis François Ruffin s'est dit convaincu que « la bataille de l'opinion est déjà gagnée, 9 actifs sur 10 sont contre ».      \n      De 25 000 (selon la police) à 50 000 personnes (selon les syndicats) ont manifesté à Nantes contre la réforme des retraites. Un important dispositif policier était présent et la manifestation s'est déroulée dans le calme. La manifestation nantaise a mobilisé bien davantage que lors du précédent grand rassemblement contre la réforme des retraites, le 5 décembre 2019. À l'époque, la police avait dénombré 19 000 manifestants à Nantes, et la CGT 25 000.       \n      L'imposant cortège parisien s'est mis en marche vers 14 h 30 de la place de la République. De nombreuses organisations syndicales sont présentes : transports, santé, étudiants, industrie, éboueurs, il y a de tout. L'ambiance est détendue pour l'instant. Eugénie, 25 ans, est étudiante en droit à Paris : « L'avenir n'est pas radieux pour les jeunes, et repousser l'âge de départ, ça vient s'ajouter à des conditions de travail dégradées pour tous les travailleurs. » Lionel, 65 ans et retraité cheminot : « Je suis déjà à la retraite, mais je manifeste en soutien aux jeunes. Macron veut créer une rupture entre les jeunes et les vieux pour s'assurer son électorat, je veux montrer que nous aussi on est solidaires. »      \n      La participation des salariés d'EDF à la grève contre le projet de réforme des retraites s'élevait à la mi-journée à 44,5 % de l'effectif total, a indiqué la direction de l'énergéticien, un chiffre beaucoup plus important que lors des précédentes manifestations de ce type. Le taux de grévistes lors de la première et la plus suivie des journées de mobilisation contre le précédent projet de réforme des retraites s'élevait à 36,5 % à la mi-journée le 5 décembre 2019.      \n      « On a des chiffres de manifestants en province qui sont considérables, des moyennes qu'on n'a jamais atteintes. On annonçait peut-être un million, on y sera, et bien au-delà aujourd'hui », s'est félicité Laurent Escure (Unsa). Frédéric Souillot (FO) a salué une journée « très réussie » avec une « mobilisation massive ». « Mais on n'est pas là pour se compter, on est là pour peser et (...) faire reculer » le gouvernement. « La seule chose qui pourrait nous faire dire qu'on arrête c'est tout simplement que, ce soir, le gouvernement dise qu'on fait un break et retourne à 62 ans », a plaidé Pascale Cotton (CFTC).      \n      Les premiers chiffres remontés par les autorités attestent d'une mobilisation très importante : au moins 30 000 personnes ont ainsi défilé à Toulouse, 26 000 à Marseille, 15 000 à Montpellier, 14 000 à Tours, 13 600 à Pau, 12 000 à Perpignan et à Orléans, 8 000 à Châteauroux, 9 000 à Angoulême, 6 500 à Mulhouse et à Périgueux... \n\n      \n      La mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites « est au-delà de ce qu'on pensait », a assuré le numéro un de la CFDT, Laurent Berger, au début de la manifestation parisienne. « On est clairement sur une forte mobilisation », a déclaré Laurent Berger. « Cette mobilisation est réussie », s'est pour sa part réjoui Philippe Martinez (CGT), saluant « une union des syndicats, gage de confiance pour les salariés ».      \n      Le président de la République est en Espagne pour un sommet avec le Premier ministre espagnol Pedro Sanchez.  Le 27e sommet franco-espagnol, avec la signature d'un « traité d'amitié et de coopération » entre les deux voisins, « avait été fixé bien en amont », fait valoir son entourage, avant que les syndicats n'annoncent la date de leur première journée de manifestations. L'Espagne étant « la puissance invitante », la présidence française souligne qu'elle n'avait donc « pas de marge de manœuvre » pour décaler la date. Ainsi, Emmanuel Macron se trouve loin de l'Élysée le jour où il vit le premier grand test de son second quinquennat. À LIRE AUSSICoignard – L'exécutif à l'auberge espagnole      \n      Le taux de gréviste atteint 46,3 % jeudi à la SNCF pour la première journée de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, qui entraîne de nombreuses annulations de trains, notamment de trains régionaux. Dans le détail, on compte 77,4 % de grévistes chez les conducteurs de trains de voyageurs, 50,8 % chez les contrôleurs ou encore 48,4 % chez SNCF Réseau, où travaillent les aiguilleurs et les agents chargés de la maintenance des voies.      \n      « Je pense que le million (de manifestants) va être dépassé vu les chiffres que j'ai déjà » à cette heure de la journée, a déclaré le secrétaire général de la CGT, Philippe Martinez, peu avant le départ de la manifestation parisienne. Selon le leader syndical, il y a 75 % de manifestants de plus qu'à la manifestation du 5 décembre 2019, point culminant de la mobilisation contre l'ex-projet de réforme des retraites du gouvernement d'Édouard Philippe.      \n      De Nantes à Marseille, les manifestants ont battu le pavé dans la matinée, avant que le cortège parisien ne s'ébranle à 14 heures. Les premiers chiffres remontés par les préfectures attestent d'une mobilisation importante : au moins 30 000 personnes ont ainsi défilé à Toulouse, 6 500 à Mulhouse, 6 000 à Tarbes, 4 000 à Nice comme à Belfort. Des niveaux comparables à ceux du 5 décembre 2019, au démarrage de la contestation contre le précédent projet de réforme des retraites.      \n      \n\nLe rassemblement était fixé à 10 h 30 au pied du château des ducs, devant le miroir d'eau. Un point idoine pour un tsunami humain ! De fait, malgré la pluie fine, plusieurs milliers de personnes (20 000 au bas mot) ont déferlé sur le site pour partir en cortège vers la préfecture. Une affluence telle qu'on ne distingue ni la tête ni la queue du défilé. « On n'avait pas vu cela depuis des années », se félicite un manifestant. La remarque n'est pas anodine ici, à Nantes, où les mouvements sociaux sont généralement déjà très suivis. À la mi-journée, aucun chiffre officiel n'a encore été communiqué, mais les premières estimations évoquent déjà la présence de plus de 20 000 personnes à Nantes, tandis que 10 000 ont battu le pavé à Saint-Nazaire en matinée. Ils étaient 4 000 à Ancenis et près d'un millier à Châteaubriant. Agents hospitaliers, enseignants, fonction publique et même secteur privé : le spectre est particulièrement large sur les représentations professionnelles. Même constat sur la composition de la foule, avec des jeunes comme des retraités, tous venus exprimer leur rejet de la réforme. Des Gilets jaunes profitent également de la mobilisation pour relancer le mouvement. À noter, enfin, un dispositif policier relativement discret (pour l'instant), en comparaison avec les précédentes manifestations, souvent émaillées d'incidents, dans la sixième ville de France.      \n      Le trafic des métros, RER et trains de banlieue en région parisienne est resté « très perturbé » jeudi matin avec de nombreuses lignes fermées, conformément aux prévisions, mais les opérateurs n'ont relevé aucun incident majeur. Une bonne partie des Franciliens ont visiblement opté pour le télétravail, laissant routes et transports publics à ceux qui doivent vraiment se déplacer, d'autant que de nombreuses écoles et garderies sont fermées.      \n      La mobilisation nationale contre la réforme des retraites se traduit par un taux d'enseignants grévistes de 42,35 % dans le primaire et de 34,66 % dans le secondaire (collèges et lycées) selon le ministère, bien en-deçà des chiffres des syndicats.      \n      Le Snes-FSU, premier syndicat du secondaire, a annoncé que 65 % des enseignants de collèges et lycées étaient grévistes jeudi, dans le cadre d'une mobilisation nationale contre la réforme des retraites.  « 65 % des professeurs, CPE, PsyEN, AED et AESH sont en grève jeudi dans les collèges, les lycées et les CIO (centre d'information et d'orientation) », assure le syndicat dans un communiqué. Il évoque « des pics à plus de 80 % de grévistes dans certains établissements » et « des collèges fermés dans plusieurs académies » .      \n      Au milieu du cortège à Marseille, Jean-Luc Mélenchon a estimé que « le gouvernement a perdu la première bataille, celle de convaincre les gens de la nécessité de sa réforme ». L'Insoumis a ensuite ajouté : « Personne ne croit à la valeur des arguments présentés par le gouvernement. »      \n      Moins de 2 % des stations-service françaises étaient jeudi matin à court soit d'essence soit de gazole, un léger mieux par rapport au début de semaine, les Français ayant été appelés à éviter de faire des pleins de précaution. Le gouvernement, par la voix du ministre des Transports Clément Beaune, a appelé les automobilistes redoutant des pénuries provoquées par d'éventuels arrêts de travail dans les raffineries à ne « pas prendre de mesures de précaution ».      \n      Faute de transports en commun, de nombreux Franciliens semblent avoir opté pour la voiture. En heure de pointe, plus de 200 km d'embouteillage ont été recensés.      \n      La députée Insoumise Clémentine Autain se réjouit de l'ampleur de la mobilisation sur Twitter. « 80 % des conducteurs en grève, 60 % des contrôleurs et aiguilleurs.

Quand les syndicats sont d'accord, c'est rare, c'est que le problème est très grave. On est d'accord pour dire que la réforme est injuste » , a-t-il poursuivi.      \n      Le mouvement de grève contre la réforme des retraites était suivi par 70 à 100 % de grévistes dans la plupart des raffineries du groupe TotalEnergies, a indiqué jeudi la CGT du groupe. « Partout, les expéditions ont été suspendues », a indiqué à l'AFP Éric Sellini, coordinateur national du syndicat pour TotalEnergies.      \n      Les matinales du service public, radio et télé, sont en majorité perturbées jeudi par « un appel à la grève de l'ensemble des organisations syndicales » contre la réforme des retraites, selon les messages diffusés. En radio, sur France Info, au lieu de l'information en continu, les bulletins, raccourcis, sont espacés d'une demi-heure par une plage musicale. À intervalle régulier, les auditeurs ont pu entendre le message : « En raison d'un appel à la grève de l'ensemble des organisations syndicales représentatives de Radio France déposé dans le cadre de la journée nationale de mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de diffuser l'intégralité de nos programmes habituels. » En télévision, sur France 2, Télématin, a rediffusé d'anciennes interviews, qu'il s'agisse de thèmes sociétaux ou de séquences culturelles, comme la chanteuse Zazie venue présenter le 14 décembre 2022 son dernier album.      \n      Des centaines de milliers de personnes attendues dans la rue ce jeudi. Plus de 200 points de rassemblement sont prévus en France, les autorités attendant 550 000 à 750 000 manifestants, dont 50 à 80 000 à Paris. Le secrétaire national du Parti communiste français, Fabien Roussel, a même exhorté  « un million » de Français « à déferler dans la rue ».      \n      Les baisses de production d'électricité organisées par des agents EDF pour contester le projet gouvernemental sur les retraites se sont fortement intensifiées jeudi, atteignant au moins l'équivalent de deux fois la consommation de Paris, a-t-on appris auprès de la CGT et du gestionnaire des lignes à haute et très haute tension RTE.  « C'est le début de la lutte jusqu'au retrait ! », écrit la fédération CGT Mines Énergie dans un tract sur les réseaux sociaux, annonçant « plus de 7 000 MW de baisse de production sans aucun impact sur les usagers ».\n  RETRAITESC'est le début de la lutte, jusqu'au retrait‼️✊Mobilisation très massive des grévistes Énergie et Mines dès ce soirPlus de 7⃣0⃣0⃣0⃣ MW de baisse de production d'#électricité sans aucun impact sur les usagers ➡️ C'est énorme : ON LÂCHE RIEN‼️#RetraitRéforme pic.twitter.com/oTQ6rk4T3G— FNME (@FNMECGT) January 18, 2023 \n RETRAITESC'est le début de la lutte, jusqu'au retrait‼️✊Mobilisation très massive des grévistes Énergie et Mines dès ce soirPlus de 7⃣0⃣0⃣0⃣ MW de baisse de production d'#électricité sans aucun impact sur les usagers ➡️ C'est énorme : ON LÂCHE RIEN‼️#RetraitRéforme pic.twitter.com/oTQ6rk4T3G\n      \n      En région parisienne, le trafic des métros et RER de la RATP est lourdement impacté par la mobilisation. Concernant le métro, la ligne 8 est complètement fermée. Les lignes 10 (sur toute sa longueur) et 11 (seulement sur un tronçon) fonctionnent aux heures de pointe matinales, alors qu'elles devaient être initialement fermées. Les lignes 2, 3, 5, 6 et 13 ne sont ouvertes qu'aux heures de pointe – de 7 h 30 à9 h 30 et de 16 h 30 à 19 h 30 – sur certains tronçons, avec des fréquences variant de 1 rame sur 2 à 1 rame sur 5. Les lignes 3bis, 7, 7bis, 9 et 12 fonctionnent également aux heures de pointe, sur toute leur longueur, avec des fréquences variables.La ligne 4, partiellement automatisée, roule toute la journée jusqu'à 22 h 15, avec 1 rame sur 2 aux heures de pointe et 1 rame sur 4 aux heures creuses. Les lignes 1 et 14, automatisées, fonctionnent normalement, la RATP mettant en garde contre un risque de saturation.      \n      Selon notre sondage Ipsos pour Le Point, une grande majorité de Français estime qu'il faut réformer les retraites. Ils sont toutefois nombreux à rejeter le projet de loi du gouvernement. Lire l'article  Réforme des retraites : le « oui, mais » des Français         \n      Dans l'Éducation, 70 % des enseignants du primaire ne feront pas cours et de nombreuses écoles seront fermées, d'après leur principal syndicat, et des grèves sont aussi prévues dans le secteur électrique. La mobilisation serait ainsi de même ampleur qu'en décembre 2019 : lors de la première journée de grève contre la précédente tentative de réforme, les syndicats avaient dénombré 70 % de grévistes, tandis que le ministère en avait recensé 55 %.      \n      Le trafic des métros, RER et trains de banlieue en région parisienne sera « très perturbé » ce jeudi avec trois lignes de métro totalement fermées (8,10 et 11) et dix lignes ne fonctionnant, parfois partiellement, qu'aux heures de pointe, tandis que les trains de la SNCF seront rares ou inexistants. La situation devrait être meilleure pour les autobus RATP, avec 2 passages sur 3 à Paris et en petite couronne, mais tout de même une douzaine de lignes interrompues.      \n      Mercredi soir, à quelques heures de cette journée de grève nationale, Élisabeth Borne a défendu sa réforme des retraites, un projet « porteur de progrès social pour le pays », pendant une heure lors d'une réunion publique organisée par le député Renaissance Mathieu Lefevre à Nogent-sur-Marne.      \n      Les huit syndicats ont appelé à la mobilisation contre la réforme des retraites et leur appel a été entendu. Les manifestations sont attendues nombreuses, à travers tout le pays. À Paris, le rendez-vous a été fixé place de la République à 14 heures. Le cortège prendra ensuite la direction de la place de la Bastille avant d'arriver en fin d'après-midi place de la Nation. 3 500 policiers et gendarmes seront mobilisés dans la capitale. Des sources sécuritaires évoquent un risque de « pré-cortège » potentiellement violent de 1 000 à 2 000 personnes.      \n\n\n\nUn avis, un commentaire ?\nPartagez votre opinion avec les autres membres du Point.\n\n0 / 2000\n\n\nVoir les conditions d'utilisation\nLire la charte de modération\n\nPour beaucoup de français la réforme des retraites symbolise la soupe à la grimace.

Une nouvelle journée nationale d’action est prévue ce mercredi 15 mars, au moment où la commission mixte paritaire réunira – en catimini – députés et sénateurs pour trancher sur la réforme des retraites. Pour la première journée, le 19 janvier, entre 1,12 million et 2 millions de personnes avaient défilé en France. La deuxième journée de mobilisation interprofessionnelle avait abouti sur un record, le 31 janvier, avec entre 1,3 et 2,8 millions de personnes selon les mêmes sources. Entre 757 000 et 2 millions de personnes ont manifesté mardi 7 février contre le projet gouvernemental de réforme des retraites, Le 11 février, premier samedi de mobilisation, entre 963 000 et 2,5 millions de personnes ont marché en France.

Analyse Retraites : face à la contestation, l’exécutif garde les yeux sur l’horloge Politique 7 mars 2023 abonnés La journée nationale d’action contre la réforme des retraites du mardi 7 mars a attiré entre 1,2 million et 3,5 millions de manifestants dans toute la France. Selon qu’on regarde les chiffres du ministère de l’Intérieur ou de la CGT, il s’agissait de toute façon de de l’une des plus fortes contestations sociales depuis plusieurs décennies, et un record depuis le début du mouvement actuel, courant janvier. L’intersyndicale, forte de ce nouveau succès, a mis la pression directement sur Emmanuel Macron dans la foulée, exigeant un rendez-vous et annonçant deux nouvelles journées d’action. Samedi 11 mars, les manifestants ont été moins nombreux, entre 368 000 et 1 million de personnes. Avant celle de ce mercredi, donc. Seront-elles à la hauteur de cette dernière mobilisation record ?

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said a man was stopped by two off-duty police officers who were returning home from a shift. He said the suspected attacker was shot three times and taken to hospital with serious injuries. Authorities are trying to establish if there was a motive for the attack. The attack took place at 06:42 (05:42 GMT) - within one minute all six people were injured and the attacker was stopped. Mr Darmanin thanked for police for their \"brave and effective\" intervention, which he said saved many lives. He added that among the injured was one French border police officer. Police are yet to name the man, who did not have identity documents on him at the time he was taken to hospital. Mr Darmanin told reporters the man attacked people in the station with what looked like a home-made weapon. Police earlier said the man used a knife or blade. Criminal investigators have taken control of the case for now, rather than anti-terror police, Mr Darmanin said. The incident caused major delays to trains at the station in the early morning rush, with police cordoning off the station and setting up large white curtains around the attack scene. Paris Gare du Nord is one of the busiest international railway stations in Europe - with about 700,000 travellers a day.

Accept Manage my choices Protestors hold unions' flags and signs during a demonstration on the fifth day of nationwide rallies organised since the start of the year, against a deeply unpopular pensions overhaul, in Paris, on February 16, 2023. © Emmanuel Dunand, AFP The fifth day of action against President Emmanuel Macron 's reform -- whose headline measure is raising the legal retirement age from 62 to 64 -- aims to keep up the pressure ahead of a wider mass walkout, planned for March 7. But unlike previous strike days, most mainline trains and the Paris metro were running normally, as fewer workers participated during school holidays across most of France . That was reflected in education ministry figures showing fewer than eight percent of teachers on strike, half last week's level. Employees at state-controlled energy giant EDF said they had lowered output by more than 3,000 megawatts, or the equivalent of three nuclear power plants, without affecting supply to end users. On Wednesday, many hydroelectric plants had been disconnected from the grid. On Thursday, 30 percent of flights from Paris's Orly airport were cancelled. Demonstrators turned out across France carrying signs including \"retirement before arthritis\" or \"why not 69 years, if you're going to screw us?\" Unions said some 1.3 million people participated nationwide Thursday, the lowest figure since the protest movement started on January 19. The interior ministry put the national figure at 440,000, down from nearly a million on Saturday. Thursday's actions were meant to \"keep up the mobilisation\" against the reform but \"for today, the numbers aren't so important\", said Philippe Martinez, head of the hard-left CGT union, at a demonstration in Albi in southwestern France. \"After the school holidays, we'll need to turn up the volume,\" he said. 'Block everything' Polling shows around 70 percent of the public reject Macron's pension reform plans. A petition opposing the reforms has gathered more than one million signatures. Left-wing opponents have submitted thousands of amendments to the bill to delay procedures in parliament, which is currently debating the draft law. It is unclear whether the lower house will discuss its Article 7, which lays out the change to the retirement age, before running out of time on Friday. The unions have written directly to lawmakers asking them to throw out the whole bill and especially Article 7. Members of parliament have already rejected one article designed to press companies to employ more older workers. There is \"a possible majority in the chamber to vote against\" the retirement age provision, Socialist member of parliament Philippe Brun said. Aurore Berge, the parliamentary leader of Macron's centrist Renaissance party, said the left was \"afraid of having a vote\", adding she was sure the government would get the support it needed. Macron himself also sought to project confidence on Wednesday, telling a cabinet meeting that opposition parties had \"totally lost their way\" over the pensions fight. But the biggest day of action may still be to come, with unions promising to bring France to a halt on March 7. \"We're going to block everything on March 7. Everything everywhere must stop,\" Jean-Luc Melenchon , former presidential candidate for the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, said at a march in the southern city of Montpellier. Unions are debating whether to shift to rolling strikes after that date, with Paris metro workers and rubbish collectors already in favour.

Media caption, Watch: Bordeaux town hall in flames By Andre Rhoden-Paul in London & Hugh Schofield in Paris BBC News Bordeaux town hall has been set on fire as French protests continued over plans to raise the pension age. More than a million people took to the streets across France on Thursday, with 119,000 in Paris, according to figures from the interior ministry. Police fired tear gas at protesters in the capital and 80 people were arrested across the country. The demonstrations were sparked by legislation raising the retirement age by two years to 64. Unions have called for further protests next Tuesday, which would coincide with King Charles III's state visit to the country. He is scheduled to be in the southwest city of Bordeaux on that day, where fire engulfed the front door of the town hall on Thursday evening after a day of protests and clashes. It was not clear who was responsible for the blaze, which was quickly put out by firefighters. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin sought to quell any concerns ahead of the King's trip, saying on Thursday night that security \"poses no problem\" and the monarch will be \"welcomed and welcomed well\", according to AP. , external Macron defiant as French pension protests escalate France's government survives no-confidence vote In Paris, generally peaceful demonstrations saw occasional clashes between police and masked rioters who smashed shop windows, demolished street furniture and attacked a McDonald's restaurant, according to Reuters news agency. One police officer who lost consciousness was dragged to safety. AP news agency reported that police forces used tear gas and were pelted by objects and fireworks, with 33 people arrested in the capital. France's Prime Minister, Ãlisabeth Borne, tweeted , external : \"Demonstrating and voicing disagreements is a right. The violence and degradation we have witnessed today is unacceptable. All my gratitude to the police and rescue forces mobilized.\" Image source, Reuters Image caption, Firefighters on strike could be seen on the roof of one building in Paris during Thursday's protests \"I oppose this reform and I really oppose the fact that democracy no longer means anything,\" a demonstrator told Reuters. \"We're not being represented, and so we're fed up.\" \"It is by protesting that we will be able to make ourselves heard because all the other ways... have not allowed us to withdraw this reform,\" another told AFP news agency. The unrest also disrupted train travel, oil refineries and saw teachers and workers at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport walk out of work. Popular tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles, where a dinner is planned for King Charles and the French president next week, were also closed on Thursday. In the northern city of Rouen a young woman was seen lying on the ground after sustaining a serious injury to her hand. Witnesses said she lost her thumb after she was hit by a so-called \"flash-ball\" grenade fired by police to disperse demonstrators. There were other clashes in the western cities of Nantes, Rennes and Lorient. \"The street has a legitimacy in France,\" said a protester in Nantes. \"If Mr Macron can't remember this historic reality, I don't know what he is doing here\". Unions and the political left have deemed the day a success, but where the situation goes from here is an open question. The government is hoping that the protests will lose momentum, and that the violence on the streets will turn people away. The opposition says that the protests will not dwindle, but unions will need to devise a strategy going forward, rather than promising more days like Thursday.

Parisian rubbish collectors, who started their strike against the pension reform on 6 March, have renewed it until next Monday. The unrest followed the government's decision to force the legislation to raise the pension age through the lower house of parliament - where it lacks an absolute majority - without a vote. French President Emmanuel Macron defended the move, saying the reform is a necessity.

Officials said two others remained unaccounted for and rescue efforts continued in the La Plaine district. A firefighter told AFP news agency the search for survivors was a \"race against the clock\". The cause remains unclear, but investigators are looking into the possibility of a gas leak. The blast occurred at 00:49 local time on Sunday (22:49 GMT on Saturday). Housing Minister Oliver Klein described the discovery of the bodies as \"gruesome, difficult and dramatic\", and told reporters the government would support the families of the victims. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the explosion and around 200 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Two nearby blocks partially collapsed a few hours later, but there were no further reports of injuries from this. The mayor of Marseille, Benoit Payan, warned there was still a risk that nearby buildings could collapse. Around 100 firefighters attended the scene to tackle a blaze that burned under the rubble throughout Sunday. The fire hampered progress and made it difficult for sniffer dogs to detect survivors or bodies. The building is believed to have had one apartment on each storey. In a brief statement announcing the discovery of the bodies, the fire department said that \"given the difficulties of intervention, the extraction [of the bodies from the site] will take time\". A local gymnasium and two schools have been opened to accommodate the people who have had to leave their homes. Psychological support is also being offered. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter that he was \"thinking of those affected and their loved ones\" and thanked the emergency workers for their efforts. Mayor of Marseille Benoît Payan said rescuers remained \"determined\" to find people alive. \"Hope must hold us,\" he said. 'Unlike anything I've ever heard' One local told French media that they heard an explosion \"unlike anything I've ever heard\". Speaking to AFP, Saveria Mosnier, who lives nearby, said on Sunday: \"I was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming.\" She added: \"We very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\" Deputy Mayor Yannick Ohanessian told reporters at the scene that \"several\" witnesses had described a \"suspicious smell of gas\". Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin visited the scene on Sunday, followed by Housing Minister Olivier Klein on Monday. In 2018, housing standards in Marseille came under scrutiny after two dilapidated buildings in the working class district of Noailles collapsed, killing eight people. Following that incident, charities estimated that 40,000 people in the city were living in poorly-built homes, but on Sunday officials appeared to rule out structural issues as a cause of the latest collapse. Christophe Mirmand, a local authority leader in the Bouches-du-Rhone region, said there was no danger notice on the building and that it was not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing. The comments were echoed by Mr Payan. Additional reporting by Antoinette Radford and Alys Davies.

The disaster happened at the Armancette glacier, near Mont Blanc in south-eastern France, at about midday local time. It was a sunny day and skiing conditions had been described as \"good\" before the avalanche struck. Another injured person was taken to hospital, while eight others swept up were unharmed. Among the victims was a couple in their 20s, a 39-year-old woman and a man in his early 40s who was \"probably\" her partner and two guides, local prosecutor Karline Bouisset said. The avalanche was caused by a slab of snow detaching from the top of the mountain, according to Jean-Luc Mattel, an official of the nearby Contamines-Montjoie village. Mountain rescue teams were joined by search and rescue dogs as they worked on Sunday and Monday morning to reach those who were caught. Mr Mattel said the risk level on Sunday morning was \"reasonable\" and the guides, both of them locals, were highly experienced. The group are all thought to have been back-country skiing - when skiers go on unmarked or unpatrolled areas. \"Today, we are mourning, and there is great sadness among all of us mountaineers, friends of Les Contamines, those who died are people we knew, and all our thoughts go out to their families,\" he said. The mayor of Contamines-Montjoie, Francois Barbier, told the AFP news agency he thought it was the \"most deadly avalanche this season\". France's interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, and French President Emmanuel Macron also expressed their sympathy. Before the incident, a nearby ski resort called Les Contamines-Montjoie posted a video on social media showing a huge wall of snow moving down from the Dômes de Miage, of which the glacier is a part. It is not clear if the video shows the avalanche in which the people died. Watch: Snow and ice cascade down from Dômes de Miage in the French Alps One eyewitness told France Television that she was hiking just in front of the Armancette glacier when she saw the avalanche happening and took out her phone to film it. \"I had put the phone in front of me, but then I was looking with my eyes more than in the lens and suddenly there was a huge, huge, huge cloud that came down to the bottom, it split into two,\" she said. \"I think of the families, I think of the people, of those who got out of it, who had the fright of their life, of those who are still there.\" The nearby resort urged people to be careful if they were venturing off-piste - away from the prepared ski runs. Officials have told AFP that a further avalanche could not be ruled out. Two brothers died in an avalanche on the same glacier in 2014. They were both experienced mountaineers and had been properly equipped.

Tuesday marked the sixth day of strikes and protests since mid-January and trade unions said it would be the biggest yet. Most train and metro services were cancelled and many schools closed. Police estimated between 1.1 million and 1.4 million would taking part in the 260 protests highlighted by unions. The hardline CGT said as many as 700,000 demonstrators had turned out in Paris alone, although police figures were likely to be far lower. With the government showing no sign of backing down on its pension plan, one union leader, Emmanuel Lépine, said last week that the aim of blocking fuel deliveries was to \"bring the French economy to its knees\". It was unclear how long the refinery blockades would last. There are eight refineries in mainland France and the CGT said strikers had blocked the exits to all of them, including those run by TotalEnergies and Esso-ExxonMobil. AFP Refineries around Le Havre in the north were among those blocked, French trade unions said In the days ahead, there will be calls to extend the strikes to include power generation too. So far, for all the noise and sporadic disruption, the campaign has caused little damage to the economy and the bill is proceeding through parliament. Unions and the Left know time is running out before the reform becomes a reality - which is all the more reason for them to up the pressure now. French plan to raise pension age by two years to 64 One million join French retirement age protests French protests intensify against pension age rise President Emmanuel Macron has called the reform \"essential\" because of deficits forecast for France's pension system over the next 25 years, according to analysis by the independent Pensions Advisory Council. As well as raising the pension age by two years, the government says workers would have to contribute for 43 years into France's shared pension fund before earning a full pension. Very few French workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments. Neighbouring European economies have already raised the retirement age in recent years to reflect longer life expectancy. Italy, Germany and Spain have moved towards raising the official retirement age to 67, while in the UK it is currently 66. The majority of French citizens back the continuing strikes, a poll by French survey group Elabe suggests. According to the opinion poll, 56% of people support rolling strikes and 59% back the call to bring the country to a standstill. Two-thirds of people support the protest movement against the government's planned pension reforms in general, the poll indicates. However, the number of protesters taking to the streets began to fall last month and union leaders now believe rolling strikes are their best hope of success. \"If the refineries are blocked, we could run out of petrol by the end of the week,\" warned Thierry Cotillard, head of French supermarket group Les Mousquetaires.

The portrait issue has been seized upon by Macron’s critics as he travels around France in an attempt to counter accusations of arrogance and haughtiness, amid saucepan banging and street protests against the rise in the pension age. France’s lower house of parliament passed proposals on Thursday that would require town halls in municipalities with more than 1,500 inhabitants to fly both the French and European flags, as most already do. But, as part of a series of amendments to the bill, two centrist lawmakers from Macron’s Renaissance party, Denis Masséglia and Nicole Dubré-Chirat, succeeded in adding a provision that all town halls must by law display a presidential portrait. The amendment referred to portraits of any serving presidents, not specifically Macron, who was re-elected to a second term last year. The proposal will have to be debated in the senate before returning to the lower house. Town halls across France currently display portraits of serving presidents, but it is a tradition not a legal obligation. Masséglia, a lawmaker in Maine-et-Loire, told parliament: “Town halls are like the house of the French people. So the portrait of the president – whoever it is – should be displayed there, out of respect for the democratic vote.” View image in fullscreen French climate activists hold inverted portraits of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in 2019. Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images The left immediately seized on the proposed amendment to attack Macron’s party. Antoine Léaument from the radical left party, La France Insoumise, accused Macron’s centrists of “a cult of the leader” and called on mayors to take down Macron’s picture as a protest both against the portrait proposal and Macron’s new law raising the minimum eligible pension age from 62 to 64 . Another MP on the radical left, Raquel Garrido, accused Macron’s party of wanting to push things through “by force”. In 2019, a civil disobedience movement by climate protesters resulted in more than 100 framed portraits of Macron being taken down from town halls across the country to highlight what demonstrators described as France’s inaction on the climate emergency. It led to a police crackdown and several court cases for “group theft” of the portraits.

The children, aged between one and three, are being treated in hospital. Police overpowered and arrested the knifeman after he entered a children's playground to carry out the attack. A three-year-old British child is among the injured, another is Dutch. Two adults were also hurt, with one in a critical condition. Follow live coverage Police have confirmed that the suspect is a 31-year-old Syrian, who had refugee status in Sweden. This story contains details some readers may find distressing. Regional deputy Antoine Armand described the attack as \"abominable\" and said authorities were investigating, but knew \"very little\". Video footage of the attack uploaded to social media - too graphic for broadcast - shows a little playground, with life going on as normal. Children are running around, and their parents and minders are there. Then a man comes in with a knife, and very quickly there are screams. He's clearly looking for children to attack - and he attacks one in a pushchair. French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne and Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin went to the scene of the attack. Ms Borne told a news conference that the attacker has \"no criminal or psychiatric record\". Annecy prosecutor Line Bonnet-Mathis told reporters that the young victims ranged from 22 months old to three years. There \"doesn't seem to be any kind of terrorist motivation\", she said. Police say the suspect has refugee status in Sweden and recently came to France, leaving behind a wife and three-year-old daughter. In an unsuccessful asylum application last year for refugee status in France, he said he was a Syrian Christian. During the incident, the attacker invoked the name of Jesus Christ. A woman identified as his ex-wife told BFM TV that her former partner was a Christian. \"He does not call me for four months. [Our relationship] stopped because we lived in Sweden and he did not want to live in Sweden anymore,\" she said, adding that he had not previously shown a violent streak. In recent years, France has become accustomed to knife attacks, often carried out by solitary young men with backgrounds in petty crime and some Islamist connection. It is clear that this attack is of a different nature. So far, most politicians are being careful not to leap to conclusions, but it is inevitable that the attack will feed into the debate on immigration. Tributes come in as questions grow In Annecy tonight, the darkening sky throws shadows across tributes of white roses laid out on the playground wall. A children's drawing, covered with hearts, flutters in the wind. A note, addressed to the four children who were stabbed here, reads: \"horror passes; love remains\". And as the flowers began appearing here this afternoon, the children began returning too. By early evening, the playground was once again full of their excitement, the rows of television cameras lined up nearby ignored. But those who witnessed the attack here, and the dramatic intervention of emergency services, told us they were still shaken and tearful. This attack on toddlers in a popular tourist spot has shaken France: the horror felt well beyond this town - the motive still a mystery. As here in Annecy, the tributes and the questions grow. Reuters White roses are seen at the children's playground The suspect is said to have attacked the children - some in pushchairs - as they visited the park, before fleeing the scene and stabbing an elderly man nearby. Police intervened and the perpetrator was shot in the legs. France's National Assembly has observed a minute of silence and roads are blocked around the scene of the attack. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the nation was in \"shock\" over the \"act of cowardice\". UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is on a trip to the US, said: \"All our thoughts are with those affected by this unfathomable attack, including a British child - and with their families. \"I've been in touch with President Macron, and we stand ready to offer any assistance that we can.\" A witness, Eleanor Vincent, told the BBC she \"knew something horrible had happened\" as she approached the lake. \"People were going about their business or on their holiday, as I was, and it's just shocking. I have no other way of describing it.\" Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident? You can share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk .

Firefighters were called to a building in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, on June 21, 2023. Abdulmonam Eassa/AFP/Getty Images Paris CNN — Six people remain in a critical condition and one person is missing after a gas explosion in central Paris on Wednesday, the Paris prosecutor’s office told CNN on Thursday. Some 50 people were injured in the incident, although the Paris prosecutor’s office, which is investigating the blast, said the number may not be final. Some 270 firefighters were deployed to the scene near Rue Saint Jacques in the city’s fifth arrondissement, and have contained the fire, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told reporters. Francois Braun, France’s health minister, told CNN affiliate BFMTV Thursday that some of those injured are suffering from “extremely significant burns,” while others have suffered “significant traumatic injuries” due to the blast. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin visited the site of the explosion on Wednesday. He said it was unclear how exactly the explosion occurred, adding there was no warning before the incident. The Paris prosecutor, who is probing the incident, said that early signs indicate that the gas explosion came from within the building that houses the Paris American Academy, according to CNN affiliate, BFMTV. A part of the building collapsed following the blast and fire, videos show.  Smoke was seen billowing from the rubble earlier on Wednesday as rescue workers attempted to tackle the blaze. Paris American Academy, a fashion and design school, describes itself on its website as the “first bilingual design school” in the French capital Kent State University, in the US state of Ohio, said all its students at the Paris American Academy are safe and accounted following the blast. Locals were also stopped from returning to their homes in surrounding streets by authorities in the aftermath of the explosion. Smoke rises above rooftops with the Pantheon in the background. Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters One woman, Anne, told a CNN producer at the scene that she was inside her flat, around 500 meters (1,640 feet) from the site, when the explosion happened. “It felt like an earthquake, the windows banged against each other,” she said. Another woman who didn’t want to give her name and lives in a neighboring avenue told CNN that her doors slammed shut from the explosion. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo visited the scene later on Wednesday, writing in a tweet, “My thoughts go first of all to the victims and their close ones.” French President Emmanuel Macron briefly addressed the disaster later on Wednesday, thanking the first responders for their work. “In celebrating music today, we are also thinking of [the victims] and all those who are going through a difficult time,” Macron added before launching a performance Wednesday night at Élysée for the Music Day.

The quake, believed to have been between magnitude 5.2 and 5.8 was felt from Rennes in the north-west to Bordeaux in the south-west. Homes, schools and churches were damaged, with hundreds of buildings declared uninhabitable. Earthquakes above magnitude five are unusual in France, with the last affecting the country in November 2019. Two people were injured in Deux-Sevres following Friday's tremor. The Charente-Maritime region just north of Bordeaux was particularly affected. In La Laigne, the local fire service chief Didier Marcaillou warned the church had become \"completely unusable\" and a top government regional official said that most of the houses in the town centre were affected. \"The school will have to be closed as a precaution,\" Nicolas Basselier said.

France’s elite police force, the RAID, were deployed to the cities of Bordeaux, Lyon, Roubaix, Marseille and Lille, to help contain the protests. Confrontations flared up between protesters and police in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre – where the 17-year-old named Nahel was killed days before – and in the southern port city of Marseille. Amid burning debris, “vengeance pour Nael” appeared to be spray painted on a wall in Nanterre, which translates to “revenge for Nael” in reference to the slain teenager and using an alternative spelling of his name, according to footage from the suburb. A bank was set on fire in Nanterre, according to photographs from the scene, and 15 people have been taken in for questioning by police after a march held in memory of the teenager turned violent. Protesters threw fireworks at police officers in Marseille, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, while footage from the northern city of Lille showed fires burning on streets and running riot police officers. Six people were taken in for questioning after participating in a protest banned by authorities in Lille, the regional authority said in a Facebook post. At least 421 people were arrested in the protests across France from Thursday night into Friday morning, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told BFMTV. More than half of those arrests took place in the Paris region, in the departments of Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, BFMTV reported, citing Paris police. Earlier, Darmanin said police were instructed to “intervene systematically” and expressed support for the police officers and firefighters who “are doing a courageous job.” President Emmanuel Macron will hold a crisis meeting Friday for the second day in a row following Thursday night’s violence, BFMTV reported. Authorities had hoped to avoid a repeat of the scenes that played out Wednesday night, when police stations, town halls and schools were set alight in various cities and about 150 people were arrested. The Interior Ministry earlier said it planned on deploying 40,000 police officers across the country Thursday – including 5,000 in Paris – to quell any potential unrest . The unrest broke out Tuesday, hours after a police traffic stop in Nanterre resulted in the killing of Nahel. Over the course of a chaotic night, 40 cars were burned and 24 police officers injured, French authorities claimed. The police officer was put under formal investigation for voluntary homicide and placed in preliminary detention, BFMTV reported Thursday. On Thursday, an estimated 6,000 people, according to BFMTV, joined a march to honor Nahel led by his mother in Nanterre. Many wore shirts emblazoned with “justice for Nahel,” while others shouted the slogan. Some were seen holding signs saying “the police kill.” A lawyer for the family on Thursday confirmed the spelling of the boy’s name as Nahel; he was initially identified as Naël. Buses and tramways in Lille shut down after 8 p.m. local time, according to BFMTV, and a couple of Parisian suburbs have installed curfews. The mother of 17-year-old Nahel, seen at left on a truck, gestures during a march on Thursday. Michel Euler/AP Bus and tram services were also suspended in the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris, from Thursday night, the local transport authority said. Government ministers were asked to postpone non-urgent travel and remain in Paris due to the protests, a government source told CNN on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity citing French professional norms. The violent scenes seen over the past two days have raised concerns that Nahel’s death could lead to a level of unrest and rioting not seen since 2005 , when the deaths of two teenage boys hiding from police sparked three weeks of rioting and prompted the government to call a state of emergency. Anger at police brutality The video of Nahel’s killing has sparked a similar level of shock and anger across France, touching a particular nerve among young men and women of color who feel that they have been discriminated against by police. A 2017 study by the Rights Defenders, an independent human rights watchdog in France, found that young men perceived to be Black or Arab were 20 times more likely to be stopped by police than their peers. Many of these individuals are simply “tired,” journalist and racial equality activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. “People know and have been speaking about police brutality and have not been heard,” she said. The Algerian Foreign Ministry on Thursday extended its condolences to Nahel’s family, saying in a statement their “grief and sorrow are widely shared in our country” and that it will “closely follow the developments of this tragic case.” The ministry said it trusts the French government to “carry out their duty to protect, assure peace of mind and security which Algerian nationals are entitled to in their host country.” French media have reported that the teenager was of Algerian descent. Video of the shooting in Nanterre surfaced on social media shortly after the incident took place Tuesday morning. The clip shows two police officers standing on the driver’s side of a yellow Mercedes AMG, one near the door and another near the left front fender. As the car attempts to drive away, one officer is seen firing his sidearm. The bullet that hit Nahel pierced his arm and chest. After fleeing the scene, the car crashed into a stationary object at a nearby plaza. Nahel was in the car with two others at the time of the incident. One passenger in the vehicle was taken into custody and later released, while another, who is believed to have fled the scene, is missing, authorities said. This screengrab from video posted on Twitter shows the moment when police interacted with a 17-year-old teen during a traffic stop in a Paris suburb. From @Ohana_Fgn/Twitter The local Nanterre prosecutor, Pascal Prache, said Thursday that the officers testified both drew their weapons and pointed them at the driver to dissuade him from restarting the engine. The officer who fired his weapon said, according to the prosecutor, that he was scared the boy would run someone over with the car. However, Prache said it is believed the officer accused of shooting and killing Nahel may have acted illegally in doing so. Lawyers for Nahel’s family slammed the decision not to pursue charges over alleged false statements, claiming the officer said in his initial declaration that “young Nahel had tried to run him over with the vehicle.” CNN has asked the French national police for a response to the allegations against the unnamed officer. Police officers face protesters during clashes that broke out in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre on June 29. Zakaria Abdelkafi/AFP/Getty Images Prache said that Nahel had been known to authorities for a previous “breach of rules,” but it is not clear what law or orders that pertains to. The teen was expected to appear before a juvenile court in September. Laurent-Franck Lienard, the lawyer of the officer accused of shooting Nahel, told French radio station RTL that his client acted in “compliance of the law.” In another interview with BFMTV, he said that any accusations his client lied in a statement were false as he had never made a written statement and that his verbal testimony did not contradict the facts. He claimed his client’s prosecution was “political” and being used as a way to calm the violent tensions. As to the deadly incident, Lienard said police officers had “struggled for 30 seconds” to detain the driver while the car had stopped. He added that his client feared for the safety of the public as the car had nearly hit pedestrians before the start of the video. Lienard said his client was not the person in the video who shouted, “I’ll put a bullet in your head,” while also suggesting that might not have been what was said. He added that his client was “devastated” by Nahel’s death and he did not want to kill him. “He committed an act in a second, in a fraction of a second. Perhaps he made a mistake, justice will tell,” Liénard said. Protesters burn garbage bins and block a street during a protest in Paris on June 29.

Acknowledging the government’s massive unpopularity, Macron gave himself 100 days to heal and unite the country. That deadline is up on July 14, France’s national day.

Zakaria Abdelkafi/AFP/Getty Images Addressing allegations of institutional racism in France is particularly challenging given the country’s unique brand of secularism, which seeks to ensure equality for all by removing markers of difference, rendering all citizens French first. In practice, however, the vigorous adherence to French Republicanism often prevents the government from doing anything that would appear to differentiate French citizens on the basis of race, including collecting statistics. Racial and religious data, where available, typically comes from private institutions, and extra care is typically taken by politicians to avoid circumscribing racial motives to state institutions. A protester climbs on a building during clashes that broke out in Nanterre. Zakaria Abdelkafi/AFP/Getty Images “On a general level, people tend to think there is no racism in France. And it’s one of the reasons people are so angry, because they feel and experience racism on a daily basis,” said Diallo, the anti-racism activist. “Despite that, they still face institutions, public discourse, and media which still say that there is no racism and that the race debate does not belong in France. And that’s the reason people are so angry and so outraged.” Government officials have so far not broached questions of racism in the police. Leaders of opposition left-wing parties have focused their criticisms on police violence rather than racism. Government spokesman Olivier Veran told BFMTV that anger against the state itself, however, is unjustified. “It is not the republic that killed this young man,” Veran said. “It is one man who must be judged if the justice system deems it necessary.” CNN’s Aurore Laborie, Teele Rebane, Isaac Yee, Hira Humayun and Helen Regan contributed reporting.

The 17-year-old, named as Nahel M, was shot at point-blank range as he drove off and crashed soon afterwards. Anger at his killing has sparked violence across the country. A march led by the boy's mother was marred by clashes on Thursday afternoon. In a third night of unrest, 667 people were arrested, French officials say. In Paris, shops were ransacked and cars set on fire overnight despite a heavy police presence. Across France, 40,000 police officers were deployed, with 249 of them injured in Wednesday night's clashes, according to the interior ministry. Earlier, bus and tram services in Paris and the wider region stopped operating at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Thursday. Night-time curfews were in place in some suburbs. In the town of Nanterre, where the teenager was killed, a huge fire engulfed the ground floor of a building where a bank is located. Video and pictures on social media also appear to show piles of rubbish ablaze in several places. Officers were injured on Thursday afternoon as well, during violence in Nanterre that followed a largely peaceful march calling for justice. It was attended by more than 6,000 people. Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne said she understood the outpouring of emotion following the 17-year-old's death, but condemned the riots. \"Nothing justifies the violence that's occurred,\" she said. The teenager's death has sparked a wider conversation about the power of the police and the relationship between the authorities and people from France's suburbs, who feel segregated from the country's prosperous city centres. \"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" Nahel's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme. But Nahel's mother said she did not blame the police in general, or the system, for the killing - just the officer who fired the lethal shot that killed her son. The officer accused of killing him said he had fired because he felt his life was in danger. His lawyer told French radio station RTL that his client discharged his firearm \"in full compliance of the law\". Speaking to the BBC on Friday morning, Thierry Clair, deputy secretary general of Unsad-Police trade union, said an investigation would \"determine whether this is a case of a legal or illegal use of a weapon\". He said that by law, police officers may use their weapons in certain circumstances. \"The key thing is the principle of proportionality with the nature of the threat,\" Mr Clair said. \"For instance, one of the cases refers to stopping a vehicle whose occupants refuse to comply and present a risk for someone else if they attempt to escape. \"And the incident we're talking about - in which a weapon was used - might fall into that category.\" Watch: 'They've taken my baby' - Mother of teen shot by police Unrest spreads in France over police killing of teen Fresh unrest in France over police killing of teen Anger in Paris after police kill teen in traffic stop France France riots 2023 Paris Related Mbappe 'down but motivated' at Real Madrid - Ancelotti 2 days ago Football Mbappe left out of France squad as 'one-off' 3 days ago Football 'Merchants of death' people-smuggling gang jailed 5 days ago Europe More 28 Oct 2024 Gérard Depardieu's sexual assault trial postponed A Paris court orders a medical examination of the French actor accused by two women of sexual assault in 2021. 28 Oct 2024 World 14 Oct 2024 Marine Le Pen hits back in EU funds misuse trial Far-right politician Marine Le Pen denies misusing European parliamentary funds in her National Rally party. 14 Oct 2024 Europe 8 Oct 2024 Cyclists raise £50,000 for charity in ride to Paris The 50 riders raise the sum for a homelessness charity though their journey from Northampton. 8 Oct 2024 Northamptonshire 27 Sep 2024 Al Fayed’s victims in France call for investigation One woman says the owner of Harrods and the Paris Ritz ran his companies like a cult or a mafia. 27 Sep 2024 Europe 25 Sep 2024 Murder of Paris student fuels anger at failed deportation The Moroccan suspect was released from detention after serving five years for raping a student. 25 Sep 2024 Europe British Broadcasting Corporation Home News US Election Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Video Live Audio Weather BBC Shop BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info Contact technical support Copyright 2024 BBC.

Violent protests spread throughout the country after a 17-year-old, named as Nahel Merzouk, was shot by police during a traffic stop in the Paris suburb of Nanterre on Tuesday. In the aftermath, people have taken to the streets on four consecutive nights to protest, setting cars alight, throwing stones and fireworks, and ransacking shops. The French interior ministry said 1,311 people were arrested and 79 police officers were injured overnight. However, they say last night's violence was \"of a lower intensity in comparison with the night before\". Police said looters broke into a shop selling guns in the city and ran off with several hunting rifles. One person was arrested nearby with one of the weapons, officers said. Social media images showed an explosion rocking Marseille's old port area. City authorities said they were investigating the cause but did not believe there were any casualties. The mayor of the city, Benoit Payan, has called for the national government to send additional troops to the city, describing scenes of unacceptable \"pillaging and violence\". In a message to fire and police forces, interior minister Darmanin said: \"The next hours will be decisive and I know I can count on your flawless efforts.\" Advertisement He added that 45,000 extra police officers, including paramilitary gendarmes, had been deployed across France on Friday - 5,000 more than the previous night and that though the level of violence was \"unacceptable\" the country was not yet at the point where the government felt it needed to declare a state of emergency. Clashes were reported in several other cities, including Lyon in the southeast.

A police source claimed the man plunged from the building, in the suburb of Petit-Quevilly in the Bruyeres shopping centre, while it was being looted overnight on Thursday. President Emmanuel Macron has urged parents to keep teenagers at home to limit potential rioting in the coming days. He also blamed social media for fuelling copycat violence and said it had played a \"significant role in the events of the past few days\".

On Friday, following a second crisis meeting, Mr Darmanin issued an order to stop buses and tram services at night. When asked on French TV if the government might declare a state of emergency, the minister said: \"Quite simply, we're not ruling out any hypothesis and we'll see after tonight what the President of the Republic chooses.\" Foreign Office advice warns of disruption \"Since June 27, riots have taken place across France. Many have turned violent. Shops, public buildings and parked cars have been targeted. \"There may be disruptions to road travel and local transport provision may be reduced. Some local authorities may impose curfews. \"Locations and timing of riots are unpredictable. \"You should monitor the media, avoid areas where riots are taking place, check the latest advice with operators when travelling and follow the advice of the authorities.\" Read more: Mbappe speaks out after teen's killing Analysis: Tear gas and stun grenades won't stop riots Why are people protesting in France? Authorities in the Paris region had already announced a transport shutdown to protect staff and passengers. The city's Metro system will also shut an hour earlier this weekend following a request from local police. Concerts by Canadian-born French pop star Mylène Farmer - scheduled to have been held at Paris' Stade de France stadium on Friday and Saturday night - have been cancelled due to the riots, according to an official from the Seine-Saint-Denis district. Tour de France organisers said they were ready to adapt to any situation when the bicycle race enters the country on Monday after starting in the Spanish city of Bilbao. On Thursday, 40,000 police officers were deployed across France - nearly four times the number mobilised on Wednesday.

In Nanterre, where the police shooting took place, protesters torched cars, barricaded streets and hurled projectiles at police following a vigil. Armoured police vehicles rammed through the charred remains of cars that had been flipped and set ablaze in the Paris suburb. Meanwhile, the police officer who shot and killed the teenager asked the family of the boy for forgiveness. His lawyer Laurent-Franck Lienard told BFMTV: \"The first words he pronounced were to say sorry and the last words he said were to say sorry to the family. \"He is devastated, he doesn't get up in the morning to kill people. He didn't want to kill him.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:26 France protests: Car smashes into Lidl Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Mr Lienard added that his client's detention was being used to try to calm rioters. The teenager's burial is scheduled for Saturday, according to Nanterre Mayor Patrick Jarry, who said the country needs to \"push for changes\" in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. \"There's a feeling of injustice in many residents' minds, whether it's about school achievement, getting a job, access to culture, housing and other life issues,\" he said. \"I believe we are in that moment when we need to face the urgency [of the situation].\" Related Topics France France protests Paris Sky News footer YouTube Facebook X TikTok Instagram LinkedIn WhatsApp About Sky News About Us Sky News Profiles Sky News International Sky News Library Sales Site Map Editorial Guidelines Sky News Board Sky News Services Sky News RSS Sky News For Your Phone Sky News Radio Sky Channels Sky Witness Sky Atlantic Sky Arts Sky Cinema Sky Sports More Sky Sites NOW Sky Zero Sky Academy Studios Bigger Picture Sky Group Sky Bet Sky.com Sky News Arabia Advertise With Us Terms & Conditions Privacy & Cookies Privacy Options Accessibility Contact Us © 2024 Sky UK",

Underscoring the gravity of the crisis, President Emmanuel Macron scrapped an official trip to Germany after nights of unrest across France. French police officers charge forward during protests in Paris on July 2, 2023, five days after a 17-year-old man was killed by police in Nanterre, a western suburb of Paris. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Images The government deployed 45,000 police to city streets across the nation to head off a fifth night of violence. Overnight, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin tweeted that the night had been calmer than previous ones, thanks to \"the resolute action of security forces.\" He put the night's arrest toll at 427. Some 2,800 people have been arrested overall since the teen's death on Tuesday. Darmanin tweeted late Saturday that 200 riot police had been mobilized in the port city of Marseille, where TV showed footage of police using tear gas as night fell. Near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, hundreds of police with batons and shields stood restlessly along the Champs-Elysées, several in front of the shuttered Cartier boutique. Posts on social media had called for protests on the grand boulevard but the police presence appeared to discourage any large gatherings. Protesters run from launched tear gas canisters during clashes with police in Marseille, in southern France, on July 1, 2023, after a fourth consecutive night of rioting in France over the killing of a teenager by police. CLEMENT MAHOUDEAU/AFP via Getty Images Earlier in the day at a hilltop cemetery in Nanterre, the Paris suburb where the teen, identified only as Nahel, was killed, hundreds stood along the road to pay tribute as mourners carried his white casket from a mosque to the burial site. Journalists were barred from the ceremony and in some cases even chased away. Some of the men carried folded prayer rugs. \"Men first,\" an official told dozens of women waiting to enter the cemetery. But Nahel's mother, dressed in white, walked inside to applause and headed toward the grave. Many of the men were young and Arab or Black, coming to mourn a boy who could have been them. Inside the cemetery gate, the casket was lifted above the crowd and carried toward the grave. The men followed, some holding little boys by the hand. As they left, some wiped their eyes. Police were nowhere to be seen. A woman pays her respects at the site where Nahel M. died, shortly after his funeral, on July 1, 2023 in Nanterre, France. Nahel M.,  a French teenager of North African origin, was fatally shot by police on June 27, 2023, causing nationwide unrest and clashes with police forces. Sam Tarling / Getty Images The unrest was taking a toll on Macron's diplomatic profile. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's office said Macron phoned Saturday to request a postponement of what would have been the first state visit by a French president to Germany in 23 years. Macron had been scheduled to fly to Germany on Sunday evening for the visit to Berlin and two other German cities. Macron's office said he spoke with Steinmeier and, \"given the internal security situation, the president (Macron) said he wishes to stay in France over the coming days.\" Nahel was shot during a traffic stop. Video showed two officers at the window of the car, one with his gun pointed at the driver. As the teenager pulled forward, the officer fired once through the windshield. This week, Nahel's mother told France 5 television that she was angry at the officer who shot her son, but not at the police in general. \"He saw a little Arab-looking kid, he wanted to take his life,\" she said. Nahel's family has roots in Algeria. Race was a taboo topic for decades in France, which is officially committed to a doctrine of colorblind universalism. Critics say that doctrine has masked generations of systemic racism. The officer accused of killing Nahel was given a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide, meaning that investigating magistrates strongly suspect wrongdoing, but need to investigate more before sending a case to trial. Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache said his initial investigation led him to conclude that the officer's use of his weapon wasn't legally justified. Hundreds of police and firefighters have been injured in the violence that erupted after the killing. Authorities haven't released injury tallies for protesters. In French Guiana, an overseas territory, a 54-year-old died after being hit by a stray bullet. The soccer star Kylian Mbappé, captain of France's national team, posted a message on social media Friday calling for an end to the violence. The team was \"shocked by the brutal death of young Nahel,\" Mbappé's statement read, but \"the time of violence must end to make way for that of mourning, dialogue and reconstruction.\" The reaction to the killing was a potent reminder of the persistent poverty, discrimination, unemployment and other lack of opportunity in neighborhoods around France where many residents trace their roots to former French colonies — like where Nahel grew up. \"Nahel's story is the lighter that ignited the gas. Hopeless young people were waiting for it. We lack housing and jobs, and when we have (jobs), our wages are too low,\" said Samba Seck, a 39-year-old transportation worker in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. Clichy was the birthplace of weeks of riots in 2005 that shook France, prompted by the deaths of two teenagers electrocuted in a power substation while fleeing from police. One of the boys lived in the same housing project as Seck. Like many Clichy residents, he lamented the violence targeting his town, where the remains of a burned car stood beneath his apartment building, and the town hall entrance was set alight in rioting this week. \"Young people break everything, but we are already poor, we have nothing,\" he said, adding that \"young people are afraid to die at the hands of police.\" Despite the escalating crisis, Macron held off on declaring a state of emergency, an option used in 2005. But government ratcheted up its law enforcement response, with the mass deployment of police officers, including some who were called back from vacation. France's justice minister, Dupond-Moretti, on Saturday warned that young people who share calls for violence on Snapchat or other apps could face legal prosecution. Macron has blamed social media for fueling violence. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised government support for shop owners. \"There is no nation without order, without common rules,\" he said. Darmanin has ordered a nationwide nighttime shutdown of all public buses and trams, which have been among rioters' targets. He also said he warned social networks not to allow themselves to be used as channels for calls to violence. The violence comes just over a year before Paris and other French cities are due to host Olympic athletes and millions of visitors for the summer Olympics, whose organizers were closely monitoring the situation as preparations for the competition continue. Thirteen people who didn't comply with traffic stops were fatally shot by French police last year. This year, three more people, including Nahel, died under similar circumstances. The deaths have prompted demands for more accountability in France, which also saw racial justice protests after George Floyd's killing by police in Minnesota.

Achttien mensen raakten gewond, van wie een ernstig. Het vuur brak rond 03.00 uur uit in het trappenhuis van een gebouw van vijf verdiepingen in het centrum van de stad. Mensen hingen schreeuwend om hulp uit hun ramen, schrijven lokale media. De brandweer zette zeventien auto's en vijftig mensen in om de vlammen te bestrijden. Het vuur was rond 06.00 uur geblust.

Présente à ses côtés pour exprimer « toute [sa] tristesse et [sa] solidarité » après ce « drame épouvantable » , la première ministre, Elisabeth Borne, a elle distingué « huit personnes décédées et trois toujours portées disparues ». Jugeant qu’il était « trop tôt » pour déterminer les causes du sinistre, Nathalie Kielwasser a tout de même décrit un « incendie qui vraisemblablement a couvé, au regard de l’embrasement de ce bâtiment en partie en colombage » . La magistrate a aussi confirmé que le gîte était occupé par « deux groupes différents de personnes handicapées mentales légères » , accompagnées par deux associations originaires de Nancy et de Besançon. L’enquête pour « recherche des causes de la mort » a été confiée à la section de recherche de la gendarmerie de Strasbourg. Parmi les vingt-huit personnes qui logeaient sur le site, dix-sept autres personnes ont été évacuées et une, en urgence relative, a été évacuée vers l’hôpital. Les personnes manquantes sont un encadrant et dix adultes handicapés mentaux légers, a précisé à l’Agence France-Presse M. Marot, disant n’avoir « aucun élément » sur les causes du sinistre. L’incendie s’est déclaré vers 6 h 30. Le bâtiment à colombages de style alsacien a été le théâtre d’un « embrasement généralisé » , selon les pompiers, arrivés sur place « moins d’un quart d’heure » après le début du sinistre. « 300 mètres carrés ont été embrasés, sur un bâtiment de 500 mètres carrés » , décrit la préfecture, confirmant que « l’incendie a été rapidement maîtrisé en dépit de la violence des flammes ». Soixante-seize sapeurs-pompiers ont été mobilisés. « Tout a brûlé » Les victimes ont été retrouvées à l’étage ainsi que dans une mezzanine effondrée. Certaines personnes présentes à l’étage ont pu sortir, mais pas toutes, selon le sapeur-pompier Philippe Hauwiller. Le sinistre est le plus meurtrier enregistré en France depuis l’incendie d’un bar à Rouen en 2016, où treize personnes avaient péri . Le bâtiment est une ancienne grange rénovée en gîte, avec deux étages et des combles, selon les pompiers, qui ont précisé que l’incendie a pris au rez-de-chaussée. « Le bâtiment est entièrement détruit , a rapporté sur BFM-TV Daniel Leroy , adjoint au maire de la commune alsacienne . Il reste le rez-de-chaussée, un peu moins atteint. Mais l’étage d’hébergement, il n’y a plus rien, tout a brûlé. » L’élu a aussi dit que les personnes disparues étaient « tous des adultes, il n’y a pas d’enfants » . « Le bâtiment accueillait pour les vacances, deux groupes d’adultes en situation de handicap, encadrés par deux associations » , a écrit la préfecture du Haut-Rhin dans un communiqué. Selon les informations du Monde , le séjour a été en partie organisé par une agence de voyages spécialisée, Oxygène vacances adaptées. Les résidents soutenus tout au long de l’année par des associations d’aide aux personnes handicapées, se sont inscrits à ce séjour de façon individuelle, explique-t-on la mairie de Nancy, d’où sont originaires plusieurs participants. « C’est une agence avec laquelle ces associations travaillent depuis longtemps, reconnue pour son sérieux » , soutient Mathieu Klein, le maire de Nancy.

Back in 2020, SÃ£o Paulo, where Larissa is from, became the first state to issue body cameras to police officers. Rio de Janeiro followed suit last year. Although France has also implemented the use of body cameras, Larissa believes that more stringent use and monitoring could help bring down incidents of police brutality.

The relative says they want \"better training for the French police, weapons regulation for police, and reviewing the law that allows police to use lethal force if a young person refuses to traffic at a traffic stop\". France's penal code was changed in 2017 to allow for a broader use of firearms after police said they were facing increased levels of violence. But critics argue the increase in traffic related shootings is a direct result of that change, which they say is much too vague because it leaves officers to determine whether the driver's refusal to comply poses a risk.

Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun waved to supporters during the march. Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images CNN — Hundreds of people marched on Monday in support of a French mayor whose house was attacked by a burning car, as the country entered a second week gripped by violent protests and riots. A large crowd in L’Haÿ-les-Roses, a suburb of Paris, showed solidarity with Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun, whose house was rammed by the vehicle early on Sunday morning. The gathering came after a calmer night in the country, which has been racked by angry protests since a police office shot and killed a 17-year-old boy at a traffic stop last Tuesday. Jeanbrun’s address was well known in the community before the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. The incident injured his wife and one of his children, Jeanbrun said earlier, calling it an assassination attempt. Locals and officials held up a banner at the march reading “Together for the republic!” Jeanbrun, dressed in the sash of the French tricolore, told supporters: “I have only one word: thank you. “Democracy was attacked,” he said. “More than ever, our republic and its servants are threatened and attacked,” he added. Jeanbrun told the crowd that \"democracy was attacked.\" Stephanie Lecocq/Reuters In a previous statement on Sunday, the mayor said that while he was at city hall, “individuals rammed their car upon my residence before setting fire to it to burn my house, inside which my wife and my two young children slept.” “While trying to protect the children and escape the attackers, my wife and one of my children were injured,” he said, adding that he had “no words strong enough to describe his emotion towards the horror of this night.” France’s Ministry of Interior said 157 people were detained overnight into Monday morning, down from more than 700 the night before. Three police officers were injured, a police station was attacked and 352 public roads were set on fire, but BFMTV reported that “no major incident was reported” overnight. French President Emmanuel Macron will launch a procedure to “understand deeply” the cause of unrest that has been rocking France over the past week, a source present at the meeting between Macron and his top officials on Sunday told CNN.

Merzouk’s grandmother appealed to protesters on Sunday, telling BFMTV: “They should not damage the schools, not break the buses, it was the moms who take the buses. “I’m tired,” the grandmother, identified by BMFTV as Nadia, said, adding that Nahel’s mother “doesn’t have a life anymore.” The teenager’s funeral took place on Saturday at a mosque in Nanterre, the Paris suburb where he was killed.

Vincent Jeanbrun, 39, the centre-right mayor of the southern suburb of L'Hay-les-Roses, was at the town hall when his house was attacked with his wife Melanie and children asleep inside. The aggressors drove their vehicle at the suburban house but were halted by a low wall ringing the property's outdoor terrace, the local public prosecutor said. They then torched their vehicle. As Jeanbrun's wife and children, aged 5 and 7, took flight through the back yard, they were targeted with fireworks. Jeanbrun told Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne his wife had had surgery to a broken leg and faced a three-month rehabilitation. \"While attempting to shield them and fleeing the attackers, my wife and one of my children were hurt,\" the mayor said.

Photograph: Yaroslav Litun/Getty Images/iStockphoto France France planning to ban disposable vapes in effort to combat smoking Ban follows similar measures in Germany, Australia and New Zealand amid concern over health effects Lisa O'Carroll in Brussels Sun 3 Sep 2023 12.31 BST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email 1 year old Disposable vapes will be banned in France as part of a national plan to combat smoking, the prime minister said on Sunday. Élisabeth Borne told the broadcaster RTL that the government would “soon present a new national plan to fight against smoking with, in particular, the prohibition of disposable electronic cigarettes, the famous ‘puffs’ which give bad habits to young people”. The French government is putting the final touches to its 2024 budget with a wider plan to reduce smoking, which Borne said was the cause of 75,000 deaths a year in the country. She said the plan did not include another tax rise on cigarettes, adding: “But that does not mean we are not vigilant about tobacco consumption.” Her main concern is disposable vapes, known as “puffs” in France, which she says are a gateway to smoking. She is worried that the cigarettes with flavours such as ice candy, marshmallow and bubblegum reminiscent of childhood sweets and priced at €8 (£6.85) to €12 for 500 “puffs” are targeting teenagers. Several European countries are also looking at banning them. Online sales are banned in Belgium and a national consultation on prohibition is under way in Ireland. In Germany the government has banned flavoured heated tobacco products, with the drugs tsar warning this can only be a start. Australia has taken the toughest response , making vapes prescription only, reducing their nicotine content and restricting flavours. In New Zealand, similar steps have been taken with a ban on most disposable vapes and curbs on marketing to children, including a prohibition on vape shops near schools and rules that require generic flavouring descriptions. The rules, which came into effect in August, were designed to continue the sale of disposable cigarettes for those who use them as a transition to giving up smoking. Irish research shows that teenagers who use e-cigarettes are up to five times more likely to start smoking compared with those who do not. According to data released last year , New Zealand’s smoking prevalence had dropped to 8% – one of the lowest in the world – but the rise in daily vape users was larger than the drop in daily smokers. The number of year 10 students – about 14 years old – in New Zealand who vaped daily had tripled, from 3.1% in 2019 to 9.6% in 2021. This year France’s then health minister said that although Emmanuel Macron’s government had no majority in parliament, ministers would “work with lawmakers” to reach a deal on a ban. François Braun said the law could be enacted “before the end of this year” . • This article was amended on 4 October 2023. The German government has banned flavoured heated tobacco products, rather than flavoured e-cigarettes as an earlier version said.

The attack took place in the northeastern town of Arras, home to large Jewish and Muslim populations. Police arrested the suspected attacker, Mohammed Moguchkov, who had cried the Arabic phrase “Allahu akbar!” (God is greatest), according to the preliminary elements of the investigation. Authorities have suggested a probable link to the ongoing violence in the Middle East, with President Emmanuel Macron denouncing the incident as an act of “Islamist terror”. The deployment of the soldiers from Operation Sentinelle will be completed by Monday evening, according to the Elysee presidential palace. Sentinelle is a French military operation with 10,000 soldiers and 4,700 police and gendarmes deployed since the aftermath of the January 2015 attacks to protect parts of the country deemed sensitive from terrorism. “This school was struck by the barbarity of Islamist terrorism,” Mr Macron said after visiting the school, adding that the victim had “probably saved many lives” with his courage in blocking the attacker. Mr Macron said another attempted attack in another region had been foiled by security forces. According to the interior ministry, the president was referring to the arrest of a “radicalised” man who was arrested leaving a prayer hall in the Yvelines region of Paris for carrying a prohibited weapon. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin later said there was “probably a link between what’s happening in the Middle East and this incident” in Arras. France upped its alert level to the highest position following a crunch security meeting chaired by Mr Macron on Friday, the prime minister’s office told AFP. A total of eight people were in police custody on Friday, a police source said. In addition to the attacker, several members of his family were arrested “for the purposes of the investigation”, including one of his brothers and his sister, other police sources said. The national anti-terrorist prosecutor announced that it has opened an investigation. Moguchkov, who is in his 20s, is from Russia’s mainly Muslim southern Caucasus region of Chechnya. He was already on a French national register known as “Fiche S” as a potential security threat, a police source told AFP, and under electronic and physical surveillance by France’s domestic intelligence agency, the DGSI. ‘Terrorism has struck’ The victim, a French teacher, was stabbed in the throat and chest. Among those wounded were a school security guard who was stabbed multiple times and is fighting for his life, and a teacher in a less serious condition, the source added. A cleaner was also hurt, according to anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard. A police cordon restricts access to the Gambetta-Carnot high school in Arras, in north of France, on Oct 13. PHOTO: EPA-EFE No pupils at the school were hurt, another police source said. The attack comes almost three years to the day after the October 16, 2020 beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, also by a Chechen, near his school in a Paris suburb. “Three years after the assassination of Samuel Paty, terrorism has struck a school again and in a context that we all know,” Mr Macron said. Police say Moguchkov’s 17-year-old brother was detained close to another school. Panic in school The pupils and teachers were confined to the school premises before being allowed out in the afternoon. A large security cordon was set up around the school where parents had gathered, and police, firefighters and emergency services were deployed, AFP journalists reported. Mr Martin Dousseau, a philosophy teacher who witnessed the attack, described a moment of panic during break-time, when schoolchildren found themselves face-to-face with the armed man. “He attacked canteen staff. I wanted to go down to intervene, he turned to me, chased me and asked me if I was a history and geography teacher,” Mr Dousseau said. “We barricaded ourselves in, then the police arrived and immobilised him.” France has suffered a series of attacks by Islamist extremists since 2015 including the suicide and gun attacks in November 2015, claimed by the Islamic State group (IS), on targets in Paris where 130 people were killed. There has been a relative lull in recent years, though officials have warned that the threat remains. More On This Topic Supporters of Palestinians and Israel rally as war intensifies Reuters journalist killed in Lebanon in missile fire from direction of Israel Stepped-up-protection Mr Macron said in an address to the nation on Thursday that 582 religious and cultural facilities in France were receiving stepped-up police protection after the attack by Hamas on Israel. Speaking in Arras, he reaffirmed his message from that address for the French to “stand shoulder to shoulder” and “stay united”. French Education Minister Gabriel Attal said in a message to regional education officials security should be reinforced at schools “without delay”. Mr Darmanin on Thursday had banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations in France until further notice, on the grounds they “are likely to generate disturbances to public order”. In defiance of his order, several hundred people gathered in Paris and other French cities on Thursday shouting pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli slogans, AFP correspondents said. Police in Paris used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and said they had arrested 10 out of around 3,000 people present.

The rule will be applied as soon as the new school year starts on 4 September. France has a strict ban on religious signs in state schools and government buildings, arguing that they violate secular laws. Wearing a headscarf has been banned since 2004 in state-run schools. \"When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn't be able to identify the pupils' religion just by looking at them,\" Education Minister Gabriel Attal told France's TF1 TV, adding: \"I have decided that the abaya could no longer be worn in schools.\" The move comes after months of debate over the wearing of abayas in French schools. The garment is being increasingly worn in schools, leading to a political divide over them, with right-wing parties pushing for a ban while those on the left have voiced concerns for the rights of Muslim women and girls. \"Secularism means the freedom to emancipate oneself through school,\" Mr Attal told TF1, arguing the abaya is \"a religious gesture, aimed at testing the resistance of the republic toward the secular sanctuary that school must constitute.\" He said that he would give clear rules at the national level before schools open after the summer break. Hijab campaign tweets pulled after French backlash The Islamic veil across Europe In 2010, France banned the wearing of full face veils in public which provoked anger in France's five million-strong Muslim community. France has enforced a strict ban on religious signs at schools since the 19th Century, including Christian symbols such as large crosses, in an effort to curb any Catholic influence from public education. It has been updating the law over the years to reflect its changing population, which now includes the Muslim headscarf and Jewish kippa, but abayas have not been banned outright. Dominique Schnapper on state secularism in France The debate on Islamic symbols has intensified since a Chechen refugee beheaded teacher Samuel Paty, who had shown students caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed, near his school in a Paris suburb in 2020. The announcement is the first major policy decision by Mr Attal, who was appointed France's education minister by President Emmanuel Macron this summer at the age of 34. The CFCM, a national body representing many Muslim associations, has said items of clothing alone were not \"a religious sign\".

Le financement de la campagne électorale Pour aller plus loin précédentes élections Élections 2020 Élections 2017 Élections 2014 Élections 2011 Élections 2008 Élections 2004 Élections 2001 Élections 1998 Le Sénat est le représentant des collectivités de métropole et d'outre-mer, et des Français établis hors de France Les 348 sénateurs sont élus au suffrage universel indirect par environ 162 000 grands électeurs. Dans chaque département, les sénateurs sont élus par un collège électoral de grands électeurs formé d'élus de cette circonscription : députés et sénateurs, conseillers régionaux, conseillers départementaux, conseillers municipaux, élus à leur poste au suffrage universel*. Depuis 2008, les sénateurs sont élus pour un mandat de 6 ans, le Sénat se renouvelant par moitié tous les 3 ans depuis 2011. Le nombre de sénateurs élus dans chaque circonscription varie en fonction de la population : 1 sénateur pour la Lozère, 5 dans le Bas-Rhin et 12 à Paris. Chaque renouvellement permet d'élire environ la moitié des sénateurs répartis en deux séries. La série 2 qui comporte 178 sièges a été renouvelée lors des élections sénatoriales de septembre 2020. Les 170 sièges de la série 1 seront renouvelés en septembre 2023. Selon le nombre de sièges à pourvoir, les sénateurs sont élus au scrutin majoritaire à deux tours (circonscriptions désignant 1 ou 2 sénateurs) ou au scrutin de liste à la représentation proportionnelle (circonscriptions désignant 3 sénateurs ou plus.) * La composition du collège électoral des sénateurs a été modifiée par la loi du 2 août 2013 . La composition du Sénat La \"Haute assemblée\" est composée de 348 sénateurs depuis le  1er octobre 2011. Le dernier renouvellement a eu lieu le dimanche 11 septembre 2020 . La loi organique n° 2003-696 du 30 juillet 2003 ( JO n° 175 du 31 juillet 2003 ) a réduit la durée du mandat des sénateurs et a réformé la composition du Sénat afin de mieux représenter la réalité démographique et les collectivités territoriales. En 2007, la loi n° 2007-224 du 21 février 2007 ( JO n° 45 du 22 février 2007 ) a créé deux nouvelles collectivités d'outre-mer (COM), les îles de Saint-Barthélemy et de Saint-Martin, désormais indépendantes de la Guadeloupe. Lire le dossier Pour tenir compte de ces modifications, la loi organique n° 2007-223 du 21 février 2007 ( JO n° 45 du 22 février 2007 ) a créé deux sièges de sénateurs (à Saint-Barthélemy et à Saint-Martin). Lire le dossier La réforme de 2003 (complétée par celle de 2007) a prévu un accroissement graduel de l’effectif sénatorial, qui est passé de 321 avant la réforme de 2003 à : 331 sièges au renouvellement 2004 ; 343 sièges au renouvellement 2008 ; 348 sièges au renouvellement 2011. Les élections devaient initialement se tenir en 2007 et 2010, mais en raison de la modification du calendrier électoral des élections municipales et cantonales et afin que les sénateurs soient élus désormais et dans les années à venir par des grands électeurs en début de mandat, les élections sénatoriales ont été décalées d'une année soit septembre 2008, 2011 et 2014. Il a été procédé pour la première fois à l'élection des sénateurs de Saint-Barthélemy et de Saint-Martin le 21 septembre 2008. Depuis 2011 , le Sénat est composé de 348 sénateurs : 326 élus dans les départements de métropole et d'outre-mer ; 2 en Polynésie française ; 1 dans les iles Wallis et Futuna ; 1 à Saint-Barthélemy ; 1 à Saint-Martin ; 2 en Nouvelle Calédonie ; 2 à Mayotte ; 1 à Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon ; 12 représentent les Français de l'étranger. Le mandat sénatorial Conformément à la réforme adoptée en juillet 2003 ( loi organique n°2003-696 du 30 juillet 2003 ), les sénateurs, investis par le suffrage universel indirect de tous les droits et obligations attachés à la fonction parlementaire, sont élus pour six ans par un collège électoral de plus de 160 000 élus. L'âge minimum d'éligibilité est fixé à 24 ans ( loi n° 2011-410 du 14 avril 2011 ). Le renouvellement partiel du Sénat continue d'être triennal (tous les 3 ans), et porte désormais sur la moitié des sièges. Le chapitre VIII du Titre IV du Code électoral détermine les règles applicables au remplacement des sénateurs . Les sénateurs élus au scrutin majoritaire , dont le siège devient vacant pour cause de décès, d'acceptation des fonctions de membre du Conseil constitutionnel ou de Défenseur des droits ou de prolongation au-delà du délai de six mois d'une mission temporaire confiée par le Gouvernement sont remplacés par les personnes élues en même temps qu'eux à cet effet. Les sénateurs élus au scrutin majoritaire qui acceptent des fonctions gouvernementales sont remplacés, jusqu'à l'expiration d'un délai d'un mois suivant la cessation de ces fonctions, par les personnes élues en même temps qu'eux à cet effet ( la loi organique n°2014-125 du 14 février 2014 modifie, à compter du renouvellement de septembre 2017 , les dispositions ci-dessus). Le sénateur élu à la représentation proportionnelle dont le siège devient vacant pour toute autre cause que l'acceptation de fonctions gouvernementales est remplacé par le candidat figurant sur la même liste immédiatement après le dernier candidat devenu sénateur conformément à l'ordre de cette liste. Le sénateur élu à la représentation proportionnelle qui accepte des fonctions gouvernementales est remplacé, jusqu'à l'expiration d'un délai d'un mois suivant la cessation de ces fonctions, par le candidat figurant sur la même liste immédiatement après le dernier candidat devenu sénateur conformément à l'ordre de la liste. A l'expiration du délai d'un mois, le sénateur reprend l'exercice de son mandat. Le caractère temporaire du remplacement pour cause d'acceptation de fonctions gouvernementales s'applique au dernier candidat devenu sénateur conformément à l'ordre de la liste. Celui-ci est replacé en tête des candidats non élus de cette liste. Qui élit les sénateurs ? La composition du collège électoral des sénateurs a été modifiée par la loi du 2 août 2013 relative à l'élection des sénateurs. 1 - Les grands électeurs Il s’agit : des députés et des sénateurs ; des conseillers régionaux élus dans le département, des conseillers généraux, et des délégués des conseils municipaux qui représentent 95 % des quelque 162 000 grands électeurs au total*. * L'article L.285 du code électoral permet désormais, à partir de 30 000 habitants, la désignation par le conseil municipal d'un délégué supplémentaire par tranche de 800 et non plus de 1 000 habitants. Le nombre des délégués des conseils municipaux dépend de la population municipale authentifiée au 1er janvier 2014 par les recensements. Les délégués doivent avoir la nationalité française et être inscrits sur la liste électorale de la commune intéressée. Le vote est obligatoire pour les grands électeurs ( Art. L. 318 du code électoral ). S'ils ne peuvent voter pour un motif légitime, ils sont remplacés par un autre grand électeur. Si la non participation au scrutin n'est pas justifiée, le grand électeur encourt une amende de 100 euros. Les sénateurs représentant les Français établis hors de France sont élus par un collège électoral de 534 grands électeurs. Il est composé : 1° des 11 députés élus par les Français établis hors de France et des 12 sénateurs représentant les Français établis hors de France, 2° des 443 conseillers des Français de l'étranger, 3° des 68 délégués consulaires. En savoir plus sur la loi du 22 juillet 2013 relative à la représentation des Français de l'étranger 2 - Le nombre d’électeurs au sein des communes On compte dans les communes de moins de 9 000 habitants 1 délégué pour les conseils municipaux de 7 et 11 membres, 3 délégués pour les conseils municipaux de 15 membres, 5 délégués pour les conseils municipaux de 19 membres, 7 délégués pour les conseils municipaux de 23 membres, 15 délégués pour les conseils municipaux de 27 et 29 membres. Dans les communes de 9 000 habitants et plus , tous les conseillers municipaux sont délégués de droit. Dans les communes de plus de 30 000 habitants, les conseillers municipaux élisent des délégués supplémentaires à raison de 1 pour 800 habitants** au-dessus de 30 000 . Un arrêté préfectoral indique pour chaque commune le mode de scrutin ainsi que le nombre des délégués et suppléants à élire (article R. 131 du code électoral). Le cadre législatif de ces élections est fixé par les articles L. 283 à L. 293 du code électoral. ** Cette disposition a été modifiée par l’article 7 de la loi n° 2013-702 du 2 août 2013. 3 - L'élection des grands électeurs au sein des communes Dans les communes de moins de 1 000 habitants , les électeurs des sénateurs sont élus au scrutin majoritaire à deux tours. Dans les communes de plus de 1 000 habitants , ils sont élus au scrutin de liste à la représentation proportionnelle , avec application de la règle de la plus forte moyenne. 4 - Le calcul du quotient électoral dans le cas d'un élection à la représentation proportionnelle Exemple d’un département où 5 sièges sont à pourvoir et où 3 listes sont en compétition. Hypothèse : 1532 suffrages exprimés : la liste A obtenant 1023 voix, la liste B obtenant 258 voix, et la liste C obtenant 253 voix. Nombre de suffrages exprimés/nombre de sièges soit 1532/5 = 306,4 Attribution des sièges au quotient Nombre de sièges obtenus = nombre de suffrages recueillis/quotient électoral. Le résultat est arrondi au nombre entier inférieur, ce qui donne : pour la liste A : 1023/306,4 soit 3 sièges ; pour la liste B : 258/306,4 soit 0 siège ; et pour la liste C : 253/306,4 soit 0 siège également. Attribution des sièges restants à la plus forte moyenne Dans cet exemple, il reste deux sièges à attribuer. On attribue fictivement à chaque liste le siège suivant et on divise le nombre de voix obtenues par chaque liste par ce nombre fictif de sièges. La liste qui obtient le nombre le plus élevé se voit attribuer le siège. On répète l’opération pour les sièges suivants. Ainsi, pour l’attribution du 4ème siège, on fait les calculs suivants : pour la liste A : 1023/(3+1) = 255,75 ; pour la liste B : 258/(0+1) = 258 ; pour la liste C : 253/(0+1) = 253. La liste B se voit donc attribuer le 4ème siège. Pour l’attribution du 5ème siège, les calculs sont les suivants : pour la liste A : 1023/(3+1) = 255,75 ; pour la liste B : 258/(1+1) = 129 ; pour la liste C : 253/(0+1) = 253. La liste A se voit donc attribuer le 5ème siège. L'ordre des élus en premier lieu les candidats élus au quotient, d'après l'ordre de présentation sur les listes et en commençant par la liste qui aura obtenu le plus de suffrages ; ensuite, les candidats élus à la plus forte moyenne, toujours d'après l'ordre de présentation sur les listes, et en commençant par les moyennes les plus élevées. Le financement de la campagne électorale Depuis les élections sénatoriales de septembre 2014, les candidats doivent présenter des comptes de campagne ( art. L. 308-1 du code électoral ). Cette nouvelle obligation en faveur de la transparence du financement de la vie politique a été créée, à l’initiative des sénateurs, par la loi n° 2011-412 du 14 avril 2011 . Durant la campagne, un mandataire financier doit être désigné pour acquitter les dépenses électorales. À l’issue de l’élection, un compte de campagne retraçant l’ensemble des recettes (que ce soit des dons des partis politiques ou de particuliers) et des dépenses électorales est déposé auprès de la Commission nationale des comptes de campagne et des financements politiques qui en contrôlera la véracité. Le montant des dépenses électorales est plafonné, sous réserve d’aménagements pour les circonscriptions particulières (collectivités d’outre-mer et Français établis hors de France). Un candidat a droit au remboursement d’une partie de ses dépenses de campagne seulement si le compte de campagne est approuvé par la Commission nationale des comptes de campagne et des financements politiques.

REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - France will send dozens of armoured vehicles to the Lebanese army so it can properly carry out patrol missions in the country, France's defence minister said in remarks published on Monday. Speaking to Lebanon's L'Orient Le Jour newspaper after a trip to the country, Sebastien Lecornu said it was vital to beef up the Lebanese national army so that it could coordinate well with the United Nations peacekeeping force as tensions mount between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. \"We will pursue our partnership with military equipment, notably for the transport of troops protected by armour, which is key to maintain patrols,\" he said, adding that several dozen armoured vehicles would be given to the Lebanese army soon. \"Our support for the Lebanese army is for the long-term whatever the current difficulties,\" Lecornu added. Paris will also provide medicines and is setting up a joint programme to purchase medical supplies at reasonable prices for the Lebanese army in the future, he said. France has sought to use its historical relationship with Lebanon to try to defuse tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, but violence has spiked. Some 700 French soldiers are part of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) established in 1978 following violence on the Israel-Lebanon border. Hezbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim armed group classed by the United States and others as a terrorist organisation, wields enormous power in Lebanon, whose economy is in ruins and whose state is barely functioning. Lebanese leaders fear clashes between Hezbollah and Israel could flare into a major conflict. Sign up here.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPARIS (AP) — The Palace of Versailles and three airports in cities across France were evacuated for security reasons and temporarily closed Wednesday, the latest in a spate of evacuations in the past five days around France. \nThe former royal chateau of Versailles apologized to visitors for forcing them to evacuate from the sumptuous 17th-century palace “for security reasons.” The tourist attraction said on X, formerly Twitter, that it reopened hours later after checks. It was the third time since the weekend that the palace had to evacuate visitors. \nMeanwhile three airports in the cities of Lyon, Toulouse and Lille received emailed threats Wednesday, police said, without elaborating on the nature of the threats. The airports all reopened to passengers and staff after security checks. \nThe evacuations were the latest in a series around France that included another popular tourist attraction, the Louvre Museum in Paris. They followed the killing of a teacher in the northern city of Arras on Friday by a suspected Islamist extremist. The threats have so far proved false. \nThe Louvre Museum and the Chateau of Versailles were both evacuated Saturday, and the former royal palace was again evacuated Tuesday. \nGovernment spokesman Olivier Veran said that the multiple security alerts and evacuations must not grip France with fear. \n“This is what the terrorists are waiting for, to terrorize us ... We can be vigilant and I prefer to speak about a vigilant society,” Veran said in answer to a question after the weekly Cabinet meeting.\n\n\n“Vigilance, yes. Fear, no,” he added. “And even less so terror, and not psychosis.” \nSecurity alerts are evaluated on a case by case basis in coordination with the police, he added.\nThe prefecture for the Lyon region reminded the public that communicating false information can lead to prison and a heavy fine.\nIn the Riviera city of Nice, an abandoned piece of luggage also briefly disrupted operations at the airport.\nThe high school in Arras, where the teacher was murdered by a former student suspected to be an Islamist terrorist, was evacuated on Monday after a security alert, ahead of a moment of silence in schools across France.\nIt was not clear whether the spate of security threats was linked to the fatal stabbing of the teacher or whether France might be a victim of fallout from the war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. \nFrance has heightened its threat alert level, allowing authorities to add 7,000 soldiers to the 3,000 already in French streets. They are tasked with guarding Jewish places of worship, schools, train stations and other sensitive areas. \nThe anti-terrorism prosecutor said on Tuesday that the suspect declared his allegiance to the so-called Islamic State group before the fatal stabbing.\n—-\nJeffrey Schaeffer in Paris contributed.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The attack happened at Gambetta high school in the northern city of Arras at about 11:00 local time (09:00 GMT). The attacker has been arrested and is now in custody. Witnesses say he shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", or \"God is greatest\", during the attack. Visiting the school, President Emmanuel Macron condemned the \"barbarity of Islamist terrorism\". Mr Macron called on French people to stay \"united\" in the face of the attack, to \"not give in to terror or let anything divide us\". He said police had averted another attempted attack in another part of France. The man killed was a French language teacher. Those injured were another teacher and a security guard. Mr Macron said the teacher had \"come forward to protect others and had without doubt saved many lives\". The attacker, named as 20-year-old Russian national Mohamed Mogouchkov, is of Chechen origin and known to the security services for his involvement with Islamist extremism, according to police. As a former pupil at the school, he alarmed teachers with his views. The French anti-terror prosecutor's office says it has opened an investigation following the attack for \"murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise\" and \"attempted murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise\". News channel BFMTV has reported that the brother of the attacker has also been apprehended by police. Police say the situation is now under control. The attack comes amid rising tensions in France's sizeable Muslim and Jewish communities due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. However, police have said there is nothing to indicate a link with the Middle East. The attack comes nearly three years since the murder and beheading of another teacher, Samuel Paty , at his school outside Paris. The perpetrator of that attack, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, a Russian Muslim refugee, was shot dead by police shortly afterwards.

Portraits of hostages seized in the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7 are displayed during a march through the streets against antisemitism on Sunday in Paris, France. Antoine Gyori/Corbis/Getty Images CNN — Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across France on Sunday to call out a sharp rise in antisemitic acts since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. In Paris, an estimated 105,000 demonstrators joined the march, making it the largest mobilization against antisemitism since the protest against the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Carpentras in 1990, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Protesters were joined in the French capital by political figures including Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Together they held a banner with the words, “For the Republic, against antisemitism.” Demonstrators came out in smaller numbers in cities including Nice, Lyon and Marseille, according to BFM TV. More than 182,000 people took part in marches across the country, BFM TV reported, citing the interior ministry. Tensions have been rising in France, and particularly in the capital, over the Israel-Hamas war, resulting in a surge in antisemitic incidents, according to French President Emmanual Macron. In a letter published in French newspaper Le Parisien on Saturday, Macron condemned “the unbearable resurgence of unbridled antisemitism.” He said more than 1,000 antisemitic acts were committed in France in one month alone – three times more than over the course of the entire previous year. Macron did not join the Sunday march but said in a social media post that “a France where our Jewish fellow citizens are afraid is not France.” “A France where French people are afraid because of their religion or their origin is not France,” he wrote. “No tolerance for the intolerable.” Later Sunday, Macron reiterated France’s solidarity with Israel, after he was criticized by prominent figures in Israel over comments he made in an earlier interview with the BBC. On Friday, Macron told the BBC that a ceasefire is “the only solution” to the situation in Gaza. “We share the pain and we do share a willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France. But I think there is no justification to attack civilians,” Macron said. In a phone call with Israeli President Issac Herzog Sunday, Macron said Israel has the right to defend itself “‘in compliance with international humanitarian law.” “The threat of terrorist groups in Gaza had to be eliminated,” Macron said, according to a statement from the Elysee Palace. “This fight must be conducted in compliance with international humanitarian law and taking into account the protection of civilian populations.” Macron’s calls for a ceasefire resonated as far as Australia, where Foreign Minister Penny Wong noted his comments and said, “We all want to take the next steps towards a ceasefire.” But she added that it cannot be one-sided, pointing out that Palestinian militant group Hamas, who attacked Israel on October 7, still holds Israeli hostages. Pro-Palestinian rallies in Europe The marches against antisemitism in France came as pro-Palestinian demonstrators also rallied in multiple European capitals over the weekend. Around 300,000 people in London turned out for a large pro-Palestinian rally on Saturday, according to police, marching through the streets of the British capital calling for a ceasefire. There was a heavy police presence in central London’s Hyde Park Corner as protesters chanted “free, free Palestine” and the more controversial refrain “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” Police said they had “faced aggression from counter-protesters” who stormed the area “in significant numbers” as the rally was building up. Officers intercepted a group of 150 people who were launching fireworks towards the end of the march, police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said in a statement issued later Saturday. Arrests were made after some of the fireworks struck officers in the face, the statement read. A pro-Palestinian demonstration also took place in Germany’s financial capital Frankfurt on Sunday, as well as in Barcelona and Brussels on Saturday.

Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Law Firms Syria Law Offices Follow PARIS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - French judges have issued arrest warrants for Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, his brother Maher al-Assad, and two other senior officials over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians in Syria, a judicial source said on Wednesday. The arrest warrants -- which refer to charges of complicity in crimes against humanity and complicity in war crimes -- follow a criminal investigation into chemical attacks in the town of Douma and the district of Eastern Ghouta in August 2013, attacks which killed more than 1,000 people. Advertisement · Scroll to continue It is the first international arrest warrant that has been issued for the Syrian head of state, whose forces responded to protests that began in 2011 with a brutal crackdown that U.N. experts have said amounts to war crimes. These are also the first international arrest warrants that have been issued over the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, said Mazen Darwish, lawyer and founder of the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), which filed the case in France. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Syria denies using chemical weapons but a previous joint inquiry of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found that the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 2017 attack and has repeatedly used chlorine as a weapon. The Syrian presidency and information ministry did not immediately reply for comment. \"The president is responsible for many crimes in Syria - but with this type of weapon in particular - sarin gas - it's impossible to jump over the gap (of his involvement),\" Darwish told Reuters, noting that approval from the president as commander of the armed forces would be mandatory. Arrest warrants for sitting heads of state are rare because they generally enjoy immunity from prosecution. However, international law has exceptions to that immunity when a head of state is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity or genocide. The International Criminal Court currently has two arrest warrants against heads of state: one against sitting Russian President Vladimir Putin and another against former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir. Assad was shunned for more than a decade by most countries in the region and the rest of the world, with a few rare trips to Russia and Iran since the war broke out in 2011. His visit to the United Arab Emirates last year signaled a thaw in relations and was followed by a diplomatic flurry following this year's deadly earthquake in Syria. He has since been welcomed back into the Arab League and traveled as far as China. Warrants were issued to Ghassam Abbas, director of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC), the agency that established Syria's chemical weapons programme, and Bassam al-Hassan, chief of security and liaison officer. Assad's brother Maher was deemed complicit in his role as head of the fourth armoured division. Judges from the crimes against humanity unit at the Paris Tribunal have issued a total of 11 arrest warrants for crimes committed by Syrian officials. In October, French judges issued warrants for two former defence ministers over a 2017 bomb that killed a French-Syrian man at his home in Daraa.

The winning song, “Coeur” (Heart), was performed by 13-year-old Zoé Clauzure, giving France their second consecutive win and its 3rd overall – equaling the Contest record set by Georgia in 2016. France has now won the competition 3 times in the last 4 years. EBU Member broadcasters from 16 different countries took part in the annual competition for talented youngsters aged 9 to 14. Zoé stunned the millions watching around the world on TV and online with an incredible performance that topped the scoreboard with an impressive 228 points at the end of a spectacular two and a half hour show. Sandra Valero from Spain, received 201 points to finish in 2nd place with “Loviu”.  Arnenia's Yan Girls singing \"Do It My Way” came 3rd with 180 points.. Arnenia's Yan Girls singing \"Do It My Way” came 3rd with 180 points. Zoé Clauzure is a pianist from Montrouge and has performed with Amir (France’s Eurovision Song Contest 2016 participant) and French singer-songwriter Yseult; recorded several singles; and even made it to the semi-finals of The Voice Kids (France) in 2020. An accomplished songwriter, Zoé writes down lyrics and chords on a notebook, composes with Logic Pro software, and records her covers played on the piano to post to her social networks. The 21st edition of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest was organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and hosted by France Télévisions (FTV) with all artists performing live on stage at the Palais Nikaïa in Nice. The colourful show began with all the competing artists performing the theme song of this year’s show “Heroes”. VOTES FROM 175 COUNTRIES Viewers in the 16 participating countries and a further 159 nations helped decide the winner by voting online. Juries made up of three music industry experts and two children from each participating country provided 50% of the scores. Millions of valid votes were received in the online poll which was split into two rounds; one before the show based on preview clips and a second that opened after the last live performance, allowing viewers to cast their votes based on what they saw on stage. This year’s show was hosted by French TV hosts Olivier Minne and Laury Thilleman.

An ashtray with cigarette butts at the edge of the beach, in Saint Jean de Luz, southwestern France, Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2023. Bob Edme/AP CNN — France will ban smoking on beaches and public parks, the country’s health minister said on Tuesday, presenting a series of measures as the government looks to prevent 75,000 tobacco-related deaths per year. The measures — part of a government plan to combat smoking — aim to create a “tobacco-free generation by 2032.” Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, French health minister Aurélien Rousseau said that smoking on beaches, public parks, forests and some other public spaces, including close to schools, will soon be banned in France. The minister did not give an exact timeline but speaking to CNN-affiliate BFMTV, he hinted that people could face fines as early as next year. Rousseau also announced a gradual price increase for cigarettes, saying that a packet would cost 12 euros ($13) in 2025, and 13 euros ($14) by 2027. France had already said in September it would ban disposable e-cigarettes. “What we want with this plan is to stop trivializing smoking,” Rousseau told BFMTV. “The fun, leisure aspect of smoking has to go,” he continued, adding that “200 preventable tobacco-related deaths per day… is a number we should not get used to.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN World Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

(AP Photo/Nicolas Garriga)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEAUX, France (AP) — Four children between nine months and 10 years old and their mother were killed in their apartment east of Paris, in what local authorities called an exceptionally violent crime. The children’s father was arrested Tuesday and is the primary suspect.\nNeighbors spotted a pool of blood outside the family’s door on Christmas Day and alerted police, who discovered the five bodies, Prosecutor Jean-Baptiste Bladier told reporters in the city of Meaux.\nThe mother and two daughters, ages 7 and 10, were stabbed several times overnight from Sunday to Monday, he said. The couple’s two sons, ages 9 months and 4 years old, were suffocated or drowned. The prosecutor described a small, blood-stained apartment in extreme disarray.\nFlowers, a stuffed toy and a holiday garland adorned a fence outside the apartment building Tuesday, in honor of the victims. The windows of the apartment were shuttered.\nThe motive for the killings was unclear. The suspect, a 33-year-old man born in the Paris suburb of Colombes, was arrested Tuesday outside his father’s home northeast of the French capital, the prosecutor said.\n“The human toll is horrifying, a whole family was killed, stabbed in an atrocious conditions. It’s an absolute horror,″ Meaux Mayor Jean-Francois Cope told The Associated Press.\nThe suspect had stabbed his partner once before, when she was pregnant with their older son in 2019, but the investigation was dropped because he was declared mentally unsound at the time of the attack, the prosecutor said. The suspect had been placed in a psychiatric hospital in 2017, and also attempted suicide that year, the prosecutor said.\n\n\nThe couple had been together for 14 years and had known each other since high school, Bladier said.\nNone of the family members’ names were released, according to French law protecting minors who are victims of crimes.\nAuthorities are opening an investigation into five homicides, and the suspect will undergo psychiatric examination to determine the next steps, the prosecutor said.\nThe killings rekindled public discussion about domestic violence — more than 100 women have been killed by their current or former partners in France so far this year — and about mental health.\nThe mayor called for coordinated action to address violence by people with psychiatric problems and to protect victims before it’s too late.\n“I recognize the feeling of helplessness in such an event, but on a national level we need to have a deep assessment and rethinking of the consequences of psychiatric troubles on the families of these individuals,” he said.\nNeighbors struggled to digest the news.\n“It was simply a mother fighting for her children, she was never complaining,” neighbor Maissa Ketfi said. “We all had a big knot in our stomachs when we learned what happened. ... We cannot even imagine the scene.”\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",

Accept Manage my choices Generation Identity has repeatedly tried to bar migrants from entering the country, conducting high-profile raids in the Alps and the Pyrenees. On February 13, Darmanin announced that he had triggered procedures to ban the group in response to a series of anti-migrant actions. He had already raised the possibility of dissolving the far-right group in late January when it deployed around 30 activists on the Spanish border, with cars bearing the message “Defend Europe” and the use of drones to police the frontier – the latest in a series of stunts Generation Identity has used to attract the French public’s attention. ‘A declaration of war’ The organisation first grabbed French headlines in 2012 with an online video titled “A declaration of war”. A group of young people filmed close-up told the camera they were the generation that had seen an “ethnic divide” and a “bankrupt” experiment in “living together” that included “imposed miscegenation”. A month later, they engaged in direct action for the first time by occupying the roof of a mosque under construction in the central French city of Poitiers, using the building to display anti-immigrant banners. Then-president François Hollande’s government considered shutting down Generation Identity in response to this, but did not do so. The group persisted with shock tactics over the following years – including blocking the road linking the “Calais jungle” migrant camp to the city centre in 2016 and by having one of its members infiltrate the NGO SOS Méditerranée, which helps migrants in danger of death at sea, in 2018. But Generation Identity’s biggest publicity stunt was when it launched a vast operation in the Alps along the Italian border, an open frontier thanks to the EU’s Schengen agreement – and a major crossing point for migrants. The activists dressed in blue jackets, making them look like police officers and fuelling the impression that they were usurping the role of the French state. Three members were sentenced to six months in prison for the Alps stunt in August 2019 – specifically for masquerading as police officers.

But then France shifted gears to take a decisive advantage at 20-16 in the 43rd minute of a tight contest in which the lead had not crossed more than three points up until then. The ROC had won their previous meeting with France by a solitary goal in the group stage at Tokyo despite trailing at halftime but their efforts were in vain in the final. The victory meant France emulated their male counterparts in bagging the gold medal, marking the first time since Los Angeles 1984 that both men’s and women’s handball teams from the same country have triumphed at the Games . The Soviet Union first managed the feat in 1976 before Yugoslavia nearly four decades ago. Norway took bronze after thrashing Sweden 36-19 earlier on Sunday, dominating the clash as their fast attacks overwhelmed the Swedish defence. Norway also won bronze in women’s handball at the 2016 Rio Olympics after taking the title at the 2012 and 2008 Games. Sweden, playing their first Olympic medal match in women’s handball, struggled throughout the game and missed many shots. On Sunday, Nora Moerk led Norway’s assault on the Swedish goal, netting eight balls to grab the top-scorer spot for women in handball at the Tokyo Games with 52 goals. An outstanding performance by Norway goalie Silje Solberg, who had a superb 44% saving efficiency rate and even scored a goal, kept Sweden in check. “It’s my first Olympic medal and it means a lot for me,” Solberg said. “To finish this way is a good feeling for me and the whole team.

Led by Jean-Pierre Fabre-Bernadac, a retired Gendarmerie general, and signed by 80 other retired officers, the open letter to Mr Macron was published in Valeurs Actuelles, a right-wing news magazine, last week. Strongly supported by Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally and presidential candidate, the text was this week dismissed by Mr Macron’s government as a diatribe from a bunch of military pensioners who “only represent themselves”. It was, it said, sadly reminiscent of the Algiers putsch - an attempt to oust Charles de Gaulle 60 years ago by retired generals who opposed moves towards granting Algeria, then a French colony, independence after a bloody civil war. However, the appeal has gained traction just days after a woman police employee had her throat slashed by an Islamist who had entered France illegally from Tunisia before eventually being granted residency. It also comes a year before presidential elections in which key themes are expected to be security and immigration - issues which the Right and far-Right see as Mr Macron’s Achilles heel, despite him introducing a string of tough laws including one against Islamist “separation”. “France is in danger. Several mortal perils are threatening her,” the generals wrote. “Even in retirement, we remain soldiers of France and cannot in the current circumstances remain indifferent to the fate of our beautiful country.” Under the influence of Left-wing dogma France was “disintegrating with the Islamists of the hordes of the banlieue [suburbs] who are detaching swathes of the nation and turning them into territory subject to dogmas contrary to our constitution,” they warned. Failure to act now could see “an explosion and then intervention by our comrades on active service in the dangerous mission of protecting our civilised values and the safety of our compatriots”. “There is no time to waffle, or tomorrow civil war will put an end to this growing chaos and the dead, for whom you will bear responsibility, will be counted in the thousands.” Without citing any political figures, the generals said that they were “ready to support politicians who take into account the safety of the nation”. Marine Le Pen has backed the retired generals' appeal and called on them to join her Credit : THOMAS COEX/AFP Ms Le Pen promptly said she wholeheartedly agreed with their analysis and called on them to support her. “I invite you to join our action and take part in the battle which is opening and which is above all the battle of France,” she wrote on the Valeurs Actuelles site. “As a citizen and as a woman politician, I subscribe to your analysis and share your suffering.” After days of silence, Florence Parly, the defence minister, dismissed the text on Sunday as the “irresponsible” work of “retired soldiers who no longer have any role in our armed forces and only represent themselves”. “Ms Le Pen's comments reflect a serious ignorance of the institution of the army, which is worrying for someone who wants to become commander-in-chief,” she added. Ms Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the industry ministry, also lashed out at Ms Le Pen. “Sixty years to the day after the putsch by the generals against General de Gaulle ... the mask is falling and the varnish is cracking. Marine Le Pen is far-Right and it’s exactly the same story as 60 years ago.” Ms Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the far-Right party she now leads with support from those who backed the army’s efforts to stop de Gaulle granting independence to Algeria. However, Ms Le Pen's call for the retired generals to back her got a frosty reception. “It is clumsy, to say the least, to launch an electoral touting operation,” responded Gen Fabre-Bernadac, who accused Ms Le Pen of “total ignorance of the military world”. Mr Macron has come under a barrage of criticism for his perceived “lax” approach to immigration and security in recent days, buoyed by polls suggesting 65 per cent of the French do not think his government has a handle on crime. After last Friday’s Islamist murder, several opposition figures, including Right-wing head of the Paris region Valérie Pécresse, this week accused him of failing to concede that there is a link between “immigration and terrorism”. The Macron camp branded such criticism so soon after the murder as the work of \"vultures\".

The accident occurred on Sunday evening in Normandy where he had a holiday home, according to police sources. In his tribute, President Emmanuel Macron said Dassault, 69, loved France and his death would be \"a great loss\". Dassault was the son of industrialist Serge Dassault, whose group builds Rafale war planes and owns Le Figaro newspaper. He was elected to the National Assembly - France's lower house of parliament - in 2002 and represented the Oise area of northern France. The MP, from the centre-right Republicans, was considered the 361st richest man in the world - worth an estimated €6.3bn ($7.3bn; £5.2bn) according to Forbes. \"Olivier Dassault loved France. Captain of industry, lawmaker, local elected official, reserve commander in the air force: during his life, he never ceased to serve our country, to value its assets. His sudden death is a great loss,\" Mr Macron said on Twitter. The helicopter carrying Dassault crashed near Deauville at about 18:00 (1700 GMT), sources told AFP news agency. The pilot was also killed, the sources added. No-one else was on board. AFP Police and investigators sealed off the scene of the crash Investigators with France's civil aviation authority said in a tweet that the helicopter, an AS350 Écureuil, had crashed \"on take-off\" from private land. Dassault was the father of three children. Richard Ferrand, president of the National Assembly, said: \"I am thinking of his family and loved ones who must feel terrible pain.\" Valerie Pecresse, a conservative politician, tweeted: \"Great sadness at the news of the sudden passing of Olivier Dassault. A businessman, but also a renowned photographer, he had a passion for politics in his blood.\" Dassault's grandfather, Marcel Dassault, founded Dassault Aviation which made aircraft propellers in World War One. On Marcel's death in 1986, Serge Dassault appointed Olivier director of civil aircraft strategy at the company. In 2011 he was appointed chairman of the supervisory board of Groupe Dassault. Dassault later stepped down from his role on the board to avoid any conflict of interest in his political career.

REUTERS/Gustau Nacarino Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren. Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board. One of the plane's black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France's interior minister said. In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation. Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines. \"We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,\" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter. Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard. Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said. Barcelona's Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner's Siegfried at the theater. French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms. Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. \"We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,\" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters. In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: \"A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.\" It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets. It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December. SHARP DESCENT Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes. \"The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,\" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference. Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday. Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky. France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus. \"The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,\" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground. The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in. “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a \"dark day for Lufthansa\". \"My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,\" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there. Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff. In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. \"The families knew each other,\" he told Reuters. \"The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.\" King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened. In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the \"awful tragedy\". Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

Pierre-Marie Bourniquel came under Kalashnikov fire upon entering the housing estate of Castellane, in the north of the Mediterranean port, after locals reported gunshots. Mr Bourniquel was travelling with a police commando and seeking to reach a high point overlooking the estate where Zinedine Zidane, the international French footballer was brought up, when his vehicle came under attack. He had sounded the police siren while approaching the area where armed clashes had reportedly erupted between at least two groups of “between five to ten people” in what is thought to be a drug-related dispute. \"It’s a real Western,\" one police unionist told Le Figaro newspaper. Report: #French special units are in a standoff with the Gunman.unclear if there are more then on gunman #Marseille pic.twitter.com/F7fQif3bH5 — Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) February 9, 2015 Undaunted, the gunmen trained their fire on the police chief, who had to duck down on the car floor to avoid being hit. The bullets passed within two or three metres of the vehicle, according to Le Figaro. According to police sources cited by AFP, the initial shots were fired \"in the air\" and there are no victims. Witnesses said the gunmen were \"masked\" and were \"dressed in blue, like the police\". The violence comes after a 25-year old man was shot dead in the estate on January 15 in an apparent drug-related killing. A local school and nursery were shut and the estate’s 7,000 residents told to stay indoors. A police helicopter flew overhead. France has been tense since the Paris attacks in January in which Islamist gunmen killed 17 people, but there was no suggestion the Marseille incident had any religious connection. Rather it is though the violence was part of a drug dealing turf war. “The drugs trade in Marseille – for cannabis and cocaine – can bring in 100,000 euros (£75,000) per month just for one housing estate,” a police source told Le Figaro. According to France Info radio, the neighbourhood was calm in the early afternoon. The violence comes as Manuel Valls, the prime minister, was due in the Mediterranean port city on Monday afternoon to laud “excellent” progress in fighting crime, which has seen dozens of gangland murders and led to one prosecutor dubbing parts of Marseille “like the favelas of Rio”. Several local politicians have called for the army to be sent to the city’s toughest housing estates to tackle gangland violence. Mr Valls was due to announce extra means for local schools.

Ian Langsdon/European Pressphoto Agency By Dan Bilefsky and Maïa de la Baume Jan. 7, 2015 PARIS — The police organized an enormous manhunt across the Paris region on Wednesday for three suspects they said were involved in a brazen and methodical midday slaughter at a satirical newspaper that had lampooned Islam. The terrorist attack by masked gunmen on the newspaper, Charlie Hebdo , left 12 people dead — including the top editor, prominent cartoonists and police officers — and was among the deadliest in postwar France. The killers escaped, traumatizing the city and sending shock waves through Europe and beyond. Officials said late Wednesday that two of the suspects were brothers. They were identified as Said and Chérif Kouachi, 34 and 32 . The third suspect is Hamyd Mourad, 18. News reports said the brothers, known to intelligence services, had been born in Paris, raising the prospect that homegrown Muslim extremists were responsible.

Anne-Christine Poujoulat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Early Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said that Mr. Mourad had walked into a police station in Charleville-Mézières, about 145 miles northeast of Paris, and surrendered. “He introduced himself and was put in custody,” said the spokeswoman, Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre. The assault threatened to deepen the distrust of France’s large Muslim population , coming at a time when Islamic radicalism has become a central concern of security officials throughout Europe. In the space of a few minutes, the assault also crystallized the culture clash between religious extremism and the West’s devotion to free expression. Spontaneous rallies expressing support for Charlie Hebdo sprung up later in the day in Paris, throughout Europe and in Union Square in New York.

They took 32% of the vote, while the far-right National Front (FN) came second with 25%. President Francois Hollande's governing Socialists came third with 22%. The results mean the second round on 29 March will see a run-off between the UMP and the FN in many constituencies. Voters are electing representatives in 101 departments, or counties, charged with issues like schools and welfare. UMP leader Nicolas Sarkozy said the outcome of the first round demonstrated \"the French people's profound desire for change\". \"The conditions for a massive swing back to the right and the centre are in place,\" he added. Mr Sarkozy also ruled out any \"local or national\" deals with the FN in constituencies where one of the two parties is involved in run-offs with the Socialists. In the past, voters for rival parties have rallied against the far-right group in the second round of voting. Image source, AFP Image caption, Mr Hollande, pictured here leaving a polling booth, has seen support for his Socialists fading Image source, AFP Image caption, Ms Le Pen, who cast her ballot in Henin-Beaumont in northern France, is expected to run for president Analysis: Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris It's another big vote for the French far right, following the municipal and European elections last year. In this first round of departmental or county council elections, nationwide 24.5% of voters chose the National Front, according to one poll. It is a figure that shows yet again how Marine Le Pen's strategy of building a system of local organisation and shutting down the party's overtly racist elements is paying off. However, opinion polls had suggested the far-right could have done better - even emerging as the most popular party in the election. That didn't happen, which has given some cheer to the mainstream opposition here, led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy. The poor results for the Socialists follows on from their defeats in municipal and EU elections last year. However, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the party had \"resisted better than expected\". Some polls had indicated that Marine Le Pen's FN could come top in the first round. She had been hoping the elections would build momentum ahead of her expected bid for the presidency in 2017. However, Ms Le Pen, insisted the result was a \"very big success\" for her party, exceeding its performance in the European Parliament elections. In the Var department, in the south-east corner of France, the FN got more than 30% in all constituencies, according to LCI TV. And in Nord department, near the Belgian border in the north-east, the FN will fight the second round in 37 constituencies out of 41. For the first time in these elections, voters are not choosing single candidates - but pairs of candidates - one man and one woman - in order to enforce strict gender equality in local politics.

In a statement on their website, French national police ask for information on the whereabouts of suspects Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi, warning that both could be armed and dangerous. Police released photos of the two men, who Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman told CNN are brothers in their 30s. Cherif Kouachi, left, and Said Kouachi, right, are suspects in the Paris attack. passport photos Police found an ID document of Said Kouachi at the scene of the shooting, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. “It was their only mistake,” said Dominique Rizet, BFMTV’s police and justice consultant, reporting that the discovery helped the investigation. Citing sources, the Agence France Presse news agency reported that an 18-year-old suspect in the attack had surrendered to police. CNN has not independently confirmed whether the suspect has surrendered. Police fanned out across France in an intense manhunt for the suspects, who were masked and dressed in black when they burst into the satirical magazine’s office Wednesday, killing 12 people. A tactical unit was deployed in an operation about a 144 kilometers (about 90 miles) from Paris in Reims, France, following the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Authorities haven’t revealed details about the target of the operation, but speculation surged in French media that investigators could be closing in on the suspects. French authorities vowed to step up security and apprehend those responsible. “Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers),” French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night. “… We also have to protect all public places. Security forces will be deployed everywhere there can be the beginning” of a threat. It’s too soon to say whether the suspects were operating alone, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Some experts warned that how well the gunmen wielded their weapons , hid their identities and apparently planned their escape showed a marked difference from previous “lone wolf” attacks – and could be a game changer.

Map: Charlie Hebdo HQ, Paris The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted “Allahu akbar,” which translates to “God is great,” Molins said. A witness who works in the office opposite the magazine’s told BFMTV that he saw two hooded men, dressed in black, enter the building heavily armed. “We then heard them open fire inside, with many shots,” he said. “We were all evacuated to the roof. After several minutes, the men fled, after having continued firing in the middle of the street.” Video Ad Feedback Paris gunmen fire, shout 'Allahu Akbar' 00:29 - Source: TBC The men reportedly spoke fluent French with no accent. One unsettling video, posted to YouTube, shows two men shooting on a Paris street, then walking up to and firing point-blank at a seemingly wounded man as he lay on the ground. Video shows a gunman approaching his getaway car and raising his finger in the air in what appears to be a signal, possibly to another vehicle or other people who might have played a role in the attack, a Western intelligence source briefed on the French investigation told CNN. In addition to the 12 dead , 11 people were wounded, including four in “serious condition,” the prosecutor said. Two police officers were among those killed, the French President said.

At least three other well-known cartoonists – known by the pen names Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous – were also killed. ‘Parisians will not be afraid’ At an event in Paris’ Place de la Republique, demonstrators held up pens in honor of the slain cartoonists and chanted, “We are Charlie!” Pictures posted online showed similar demonstrations in other cities, including Rome, Berlin and Barcelona. “Parisians will not be afraid,” Klugman said. “We will fight terrorism with our common values, freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. … We are at war, but we still want to behave as a leading democracy.” Armed soldiers could be seen standing guard outside monuments, in transit stations and elsewhere in well-trafficked spots around France by Wednesday evening. Prime Minister Manuel Valls raised France’s security to its highest level – “attack alert” – after the Charlie Hebdo bloodshed. That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement. U.S. counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups, including ISIS and al Qaeda, that might be responsible for the attack. Charlie Hebdo has been singled out as a target for Islamist extremists in al Qaeda’s publication, Inspire. Police impounded a black Citroen in northeastern Paris similar to the one purportedly used by the attackers as a getaway car. Video from CNN affiliate BFMTV shows the vehicle being towed from Porte de Pantin, in Paris’ 19th district. Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN. The same source said that French authorities are searching all travel records from the past 17 days to see whether any of the attackers entered the European nation over the holidays. This includes checks at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as whatever limited information is available from train stations. Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said. He asked for a moment of reflection Thursday and said flags will be at half-staff for three days. Satirical magazine has drawn anger Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects, including Christianity. But what it’s done on Islam has gotten the most attention and garnered the most vitriol. Its last tweet before Wednesday’s attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The magazine has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world . sot charlie hedbo cartoon editor terror attack paris_00001316.jpg BFM video Related video Killed cartoon editor in 2012: 'Disarm them with humor' Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine’s office three years ago. In November 2011, Charlie Hebdo’s office was firebombed the day it was due to publish a cover making fun of Islamic law. A year later, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, Charbonnier gave little indication that he planned to change Charlie Hebdo’s ways. “It may sound pompous,” he said, “but I’d rather die standing than live on my knees.” The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned France that he expected a refund if Paris did not supply the Mistral, which could carry 700 troops, 16 helicopter gunships and 50 armored vehicles. The ship was part of a 1.2-billion-euro ($1.28 billion) deal - the biggest arms sale by a NATO country to Russia. There was still hope for the deal, though.

Accept Manage my choices Gerard Julien, AFP I Qatar will purchase 24 French Rafale fighter jets, the French presidency announced on April 30, 2015 (file photo) Tensions in the Middle East with conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Libya, as well as fears of Iran's growing influence in the area, have fuelled a desire across Sunni Gulf Arab states to modernise their military hardware. The contract, the third this year for Dassault  after deals to sell fighter jets to Egypt and India, also includes MBDA missiles, and the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French army, a French Defence Ministry official said. \"The president spoke to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, who confirmed his desire to buy 24 Rafale combat planes,\" President Francois Hollande's office said in a statement. Hollande will travel to Doha on May 4 to sign the contract before heading to Saudi Arabia as an honorary guest at a summit of Gulf Arab leaders. The Rafale sales have lifted French arms exports this year to about 15 billion euros and have been a welcome boost for Dassault, which had been under increasing pressure to sell the plane overseas after years of failures. Dassault shares were up 2.1 percent at 0912 GMT. The French government said last year that it would slow the pace at which it takes delivery of Rafale jets to just 26 over the next five years instead of 11 every year. Dassault is also in talks aimed at supplying 16 of the multi-role combat jets to Malaysia and has resumed discussions over potential fighter sales to another Gulf Arab state, the United Arab Emirates, the official said.

Read more The surveillance bill, passed by the French parliament with a large majority, gives the intelligence services sweeping powers, while bypassing the judiciary. Those services, by virtue of this bill, would be allowed to tap cellphones, read emails and force internet providers to share their clients’ communications. The government says it would help France fend off possible security threats. But what about personal freedoms and people’s privacy? And will this bill make France safe?

Labelled a “loser” by French officials, Le Guen is the first person tried under an anti-terrorism law passed in 2012. Issued on: 04/05/2015 - 15:02 Modified: 04/05/2015 - 18:04 By: Joseph BAMAT Follow Video screen grab The two-day trial of Le Guen, aka Abden Jelil, will offer insight into the unusual life of a French expat and into leaders’ pressing concern over the radicalisation of French nationals. Le Guen faces charges of criminal association in relation with a terrorist group, and could spend 10 years behind bars if found guilty. While accused of collaborating with Al Qaeda’s north-African branch, some observers say he led a largely reclusive and innocuous life in northern Mali before the desert region was overrun by a motley crew of Islamist and separatist rebels in 2012. A French commando captured Le Guen in a night-time operation near Timbuktu on April 28, 2013, four months into France’s military intervention to retake the control of the West African country. He was transferred to Paris two weeks later, where he has been awaiting trial ever since. ‘Lost in life’ France has been gripped with the fear of young, sometimes bright Frenchmen travelling to the Middle East to join the Islamic State group and other jihadist movements. But Le Guen’s case does not fit neatly into the troubling trend. Defense Minister Jean-Yves le Drian and Prime Minister Manuel Valls have on separate occasions referred to him as “paumé” a derisive term to describe someone who is a loser and lost in life. Born in 1955 in the western city of Nantes, Le Guen worked with France’s merchant marines in his 20s. Eventually he converted to Islam, although his adoption of radical views reportedly came later. He eventually settled in Morocco, then Mauritania and then Mali in the late 2000s, where he lived with his Moroccan wife and five children at the time of his capture by French special forces. French officials say he first showed on foreign intelligence radars in September 2012, appearing in a photo taken at a meeting of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI). At the time, extremist militias had claimed control of around half of Mali and were advancing on the capital of Bamako. Le Guen had his first big moment in the spotlight when he appeared in a video published on the Mauritanian news website Sahara Media in October 2012. Dressed in a khaki-coloured tunic and black turban – the black AQMI banner serving as the backdrop, a Kalashnikov as a prop – he warned Western powers from meddling in Mali. He would be plucked out of the Malian desert five months later. Test case Some French media have reported that Le Guen escapes easy categorisation. He is said to have been imprisoned in Timbuktu in November 2012 by AQMI leaders who suspected him of being a spy. Other sources say he was temporarily detained because he defended a group of women who were being mistreated by militants. “He was not at all in combat mode when French forces intercepted him,” FRANCE 24 journalist Serge Daniel reported shortly after his capture by French soldiers in 2013. “He was not a jihadist on the frontline, he was just a man who was tired. More like a fugitive.” Le Guen’s court case, which will end on Tuesday, is the first to test a law approved in 2012 that allows French prosecutors to go after citizens who are suspected of participating in terrorist acts on foreign soil, or who have left the country to receive terrorist training. Since then, and in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks in January, France has passed a slew of laws aimed at combating Jihadism at home and abroad, with MPs set to approve a bill giving French spies sweeping surveillance powers on Tuesday. In March, French authorities estimated that around 3,000 nationals had left the country to wage jihad abroad.

There are two suspected hostage takers, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, and Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who were previously suspected of shooting a policewoman dead earlier in the week. There were at least sixteen hostages. The standoff ends with Coulibaly dead as well as four hostages. Four additional hostages and two police officers require hospitalization. Boumeddiene remains at large.",
        "text": "Featured Shows\nMSNBC TV\nMore\nFollow msnbc\nMore Brands\nMore Shows\nFour hostages were found dead inside a kosher supermarket in Paris after police stormed the store, killing the gunman who was armed with an AK-47. The assault ended the third deadly attack in a 54-hour string of terror that seized the city beginning on Wednesday. \nOther hostages in the grocery store attack were freed and the gunman was identified as Amedy Coulibaly, a known associate of Chérif and Säid Kouachi. One officer was severely hurt during the assault, three other officers and two civilians were also injured in the assault, French prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday.\nThe Kouachis, suspects in the shooting that took place at the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo earlier in the week, were killed by police on Friday after being holed up in a printing shop with one hostage, who was safely freed. Officials continued to search for one woman, Hayat Boumedienne, the companion of Coulibaly.\nThe simultaneous raids end a string of attacks -- thought to be related -- that have gripped France since the Kouachis allegedly gunned down eight journalists and four others at the Charlie Hebdo in Paris. 3\nAs night fell on the French capital and the threat appeared to have been neutralized, the city sought to assess the damage and begin the recovery process. On the Arc de Triomphe, a sign at the top read \"Paris est Charlie\" -- or Paris is Charlie. \nPresident François Hollande delivered a live address Friday confirming the deaths, bringing the death toll of innocent Parisians to at least 17. France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve confirmed on television that four police officers were injured at the supermarket, as well.\nHollande called the Paris supermarket attack an \"atrocious anti-Semitic\" act and urged the French to be united. “I assure you that we will come out stronger out of this challenge,” Hollande said. “Vive la France.”\nObama said Friday in Knoxville, Tennessee, that the U.S. is “hopeful that the immediate threat is now resolved” in Paris. “But the French government continues to face the threat of terrorism and has to stay vigilant. The situation is fluid.”\nOn Thursday, as France mourned its dead and police undertook a manhunt for the brothers, a police officer was killed and a street sweeper wounded in the southern end of the city in what later was determined to be the second attack. Two suspects -- Coulibaly, 32, and Boumedienne, 26 -- are wanted for that shooting.\nCoulibaly and Chérif Kouachi had known each other for at least four years; they were charged together in 2010 with a plot to free a terrorist from prison, after he had been convicted of blowing up a French train facility. Officials are still seeking Boumedienne. She has not yet been linked to the supermarket hostage situation, though police had originally said they were looking for two suspects -- one man and one woman.\nThe stunning violence that struck Paris on Wednesday was seen as an attack on freedom of speech. By Friday, Jewish targets appeared to be the focus. Thursday's shooting occurred across the street from a Jewish school while Friday's hostage situation was taking place at a kosher store in a heavily Jewish neighborhood as residents prepared for the Sabbath. Authorities cordoned off the Marais, city's historic Jewish center, which had also been the site of the Goldenberg deli terrorist attack in 1982. Nearly 100,000 security personnel were on alert across France by Friday.\nStand-off in northern Paris: Printing shop\nAfter a three-day manhunt that crisscrossed a 140-mile range around Paris, police spotted the Kouachi brothers Friday in Dammartin-en-Goële, a bedroom community just five miles from the city's international airport. According to officials in the town, there was an exchange of gunfire before the brothers fled into a family-owned printing shop where they held one man hostage.\nThe brothers, French citizens who were both in their 30s, were \"armed and dangerous,\" according to police. Sources told NBC News the suspects told police at the printing shop that they wanted to die as martyrs. Authorities believe one, if not both of the Kouachi brothers had military training. Säid Kouachi, 34, traveled to Yemen in 2011 to be trained by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), two senior U.S. counterterrorism officials told NBC News. AQAP is considered the most violent branch of al Qaida. Molins said on Friday that he had been question in the past, but never charged with a crime.\nChérif Kouachi, 32, was sentenced to prison in 2008 after a Paris court found him and six other men guilty of helping funnel fighters to Iraq. A Homeland Security official told NBC News that the brothers have been on the U.S. no-fly list “for years.”\nDuring the stand-off, Dammartin-en-Goële was completely sealed off, with military-manned checkpoints; helicopters circled overhead while hundreds of heavily armed anti-terror and military personnel surround the town.\nOn Friday, France’s interior minister Cazeneuve, confirmed the major police operation was underway near the airport in Dammartin-en-Goële. Helicopters were circling the town as a cold drizzle fell.\n“We have signs of the presence of the terrorists, whom we want to stop,” Cazeneuve told reporters in Paris.\n“An operation is underway right now in Dammartin-en-Goële, which is mobilizing all services in the area,” Cazeneuve said. After a series of meetings early Friday, President François Hollande called the attack on the newspaper “the worst of the past 50 years.” He said the nation remained “shocked, considering that the perpetrators of these acts have not yet been arrested, and I am speaking before you as operations are ongoing.”\nIn Dammartin-en-Goele, residents and witnesses said the industrial town felt like it was under siege. \nThe nearby Charles de Gaulle School had been locked down, student Marion Genay told NBC News via Twitter.\n“Dammartin is surrounded by the [armed police],” she said. “There is a very tense atmosphere, being locked in the high school.”\nStand-off in eastern Paris: Kosher supermarket\nFour people, including the alleged gunman, were killed Friday after the shooter seized a kosher supermarket in Paris and held people captive inside, Hollande said. At least five hostages were freed after dozens of heavily armed French police officers stormed the store, Hyper Cacher. \nThe alleged gunman, Coulibaly, was killed in the raid. Le Monde reported Boumedienne, 26, who remains at large, has been identified as a companion of Coulibaly, and is also a suspect in the Thursday killing. \nIt was unclear how many shoppers were held inside Hyper Cacher, though the supermarket siege took place during a busy period when Jewish shoppers were preparing for the Sabbath. Coulibaly is believed to have carried an AK-47 with him.\nOfficers were dressed in full riot gear with rifles, sidearms, and shields outside of the supermarket. Rows of police vehicles were parked behind the store, and ambulances were on scene. Authorities ordered all shops to be closed in the area around the supermarket.\nFrom Tel Aviv, Israel, Kelly Peretz told msnbc’s Jose Diaz-Balart that her niece and her niece’s 6-month-old baby were among the hostages inside the supermarket. “We’re waiting to hear something or see something,” she said.\n© 2024 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C.",

Issued on: 07/05/2015 - 16:30 By: NEWS WIRES AFP archive \"The little girl spent seven and a half hours in water that was 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit)\" before she and her father were recovered by a Spanish hospital ship, Portuguese navy spokesman Commander Paulo Vicente told AFP. The girl's mother and nine-year-old brother had managed to climb onto a lifeboat after their vessel capsized, and were rescued during the night. All the little girl and her father had to keep them afloat were life jackets, and rescue only came after a Portuguese air force plane spotted them in the water. The family's boat sank about 550 nautical miles (1,000 kilometres) to the southwest of the Portuguese islands. Weather conditions were very rough in this part of the Atlantic on Wednesday, and although they were starting to improve on Thursday, some waves were still five metres (16 feet) high. Eight people sailing on three other boats have been rescued in the area since Wednesday, the Portuguese navy said.

Sid Ahmed Ghlam, a 24-year-old Algerian national, was detained on Sunday in Paris after he apparently shot himself by accident and called an ambulance. He is also being questioned over the murder of a woman on Sunday. France has stepped up security in the wake of recent attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and a Jewish supermarket. Ghlam was known to security services as having expressed a wish to travel to Syria to fight with Islamist militants, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.

Documents linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State were also found at his apartment, the Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. A contact in Syria had advised Ghlam to target churches, he added.

Here’s how it works.\n\nAndré Greipel (Lotto Soudal) secured his fourth stage win of this year’s Tour de France with a comprehensive sprint win in Paris on Sunday. The German edged out Bryan Coquard (Europcar) and Alexander Kristoff (Katusha) on the Champs-Élysées in a thrilling finale to this year’s race.\nKristoff led with 200 metres to go having been delivered through the final corner by his team. However, the Norwegian ran out of gas with Greipel timing his sprint perfectly from a fast-finishing Coquard. Mark Cavendish (Etixx-QuickStep), who has won on the Champs-Élysées several times, could not find his way through the crowd.\nFurther back in the peloton, Chris Froome crossed the line arm in arm with his Team Sky teammates and celebrated his second Tour de France title in three years.\nPeter Sagan (Tinkoff-Saxo) finished seventh on the stage, one place behind Cavendish, but safely came over the line to claim his fourth Green Jersey in a row. There was further celebrations for Froome, who picked up the King of the Mountains jersey, becoming the first man since Eddy Merckx to claim both yellow and polka-dot in a single Tour.\nNairo Quintana (Movistar) rode into Paris to secure his second place and his second white jersey in three seasons. There was still time for French celebrations with Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale) winning the combativity prize, while Movistar ran away with the teams’ prize courtesy of their second place with Quintana and third with Alejandro Valverde.\nThe stage, though, belonged to Greipel who has established himself as the prominent sprinter thanks to his four stage wins this year. The German has not just been the fastest but also the smartest, most complete sprinter in the race, displaying a number of qualities throughout the last three weeks. Today marked his first stage win in Paris and it was a significant victory for a rider who has spent the last few seasons in the shadows of Cavendish and Marcel Kittel (Giant-Alpecin).\nThe German had to fight for his win, though, with Cavendish looking for a much needed win, and a gaggle of other sprinters still waiting to open their accounts in this year's race. Coquard exemplified this, the young Frenchman unable to match the best in this race but desperately hoping to win for his team, that are struggling to find a sponsor for next year.\nKristoff, who had a phenomenal spring campaign, has not been able to find his winning touch and he again hit the front too soon today, allowing for Greipel to ghost around his rivals on the outside before opening up for the line. However, this win also belonged to Lotto Soudal, that set the pace when the race entered Paris under grey, wet skies.\nIt was veteran rider Sylvain Chavanel - possibly riding his final Tour – who opened up the attacks as the peloton reached the Champs-Élysées. The race was neutralized at that point, due to the conditions, with Froome safe in the knowledge that the Tour was secure.\nWhen Chavanel was caught with 42km remaining a three-man group moved clear but it was Lotto Soudal that held them at 30 seconds, and even when the front of the peloton was engulfed with lead-out trains Lotto Soudal kept their composure. All Greipel had to do was finish the job.\nFull Results\nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\nSuperprestige Niel: Laurens Sweeck wins Monday mudfest\nSuperprestige Niel: Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado dominates from start to finish\nVolta a la Valenciana 'up in the air' after floods destroy infrastructure\nCyclingnews is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Issued on: 07/05/2015 - 09:59 Modified: 07/05/2015 - 11:08 By: FRANCE 24 Follow FRANCE 24 Emmanuel Dunand, AFP | Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy Sarkozy , now head of the opposition UMP , is accused of discussing the idea of giving a magistrate a lucrative job in exchange for inside information on another corruption investigation related to his campaign financing. The ruling is another blow to Sarkozy, who returned to frontline politics last year ahead of an expected run for the presidency in 2017. \"Contrary to our legitimate hopes, the court has not upheld our calls for dismissal (of these recordings),\" said Paul-Albert Iweins, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, adding that he planned to appeal the decision. Investigators first bugged Sarkozy's phones over allegations that he accepted illicit payments from L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign, much of it in cash-filled envelopes. He was cleared in 2013 of taking advantage of the elderly woman while she was too frail to understand what she was doing. But during the investigation, fresh allegations surfaced that he had discussed the possibility of giving a magistrate from a top appeals court, Gilbert Azibert, a juicy job in Monaco in return for information on the Bettencourt case. Sarkozy was put under formal investigation in July for corruption, influence peddling and violation of legal secrecy over the case. Azibert never got the posting in Monaco but has also been charged along with Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog. The former president's legal team has attempted to suppress the recordings, saying they were a breach of lawyer-client privacy rules. The crimes Sarkozy is accused of carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison but legal experts say a custodial sentence is unlikely even in the event of a conviction. The investigation is one of several cases threatening to derail Sarkozy’s recent political comeback . Just last month, he was named as an “ assisting witness ” in connection with an inquiry into fines paid by the UMP after he exceeded legal spending limits during his failed 2012 presidential campaign.

The abuse reportedly took place at a centre for displaced people near the airport of the Central African capital Bangui between December 2013 -- when the French operation began -- and June 2014. The announcement came a day after the Central African Republic government said it would launch its own legal action against the French soldiers. \"We regret the fact we were not brought into these investigations despite the cooperation agreements we have with France,\" said Justice Minister Aristide Sokambi. Devastating sex scandal France's defence ministry has said it immediately launched a probe into the rape allegations when they were first received in July, sending police investigators to the former French colony on August 1. But the damning allegations only became public after The Guardian newspaper broke the story last month. The allegations were first collated in an internal United Nations report and only reached French authorities when it was leaked by a senior UN official. Both the French government and UN have denied trying to cover up the potentially devastating scandal, but the UN official was suspended from his job over the leak. If proven, the allegations will not only affect the French army but also the Central African Republic, which is trying to find a way out of a conflict that has killed thousands and displaced nearly 900,000 people.

REUTERS/Emmanuel Foudrot Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS (Reuters) - The suspected Islamist who attempted to blow up a French chemical plant on Friday has admitted killing his manager beforehand, a source close to the investigation said on Sunday, as police linked the suspect to a militant now in Syria. Yassin Salhi, 35, told detectives he had killed Hervé Cornara in a parking area before arriving at the plant in Saint Quentin-Fallavier, 30 km (20 miles) south of Lyon, where he tried in vain to cause a major explosion. Police found the 54-year-old victim's decapitated body and head, framed by Islamic inscriptions, at the plant, which is owned by the U.S. firm Air Products. There were no other casualties. Examination of one of Salhi's mobile phones revealed that he had taken a picture of himself with the severed head before his arrest and sent the image to a Canadian phone number. Canadian authorities said on Sunday they were assisting the investigation. The phone number belongs to a French national, known by his first name Sebastien-Younes, who has been in Syria since last year, the same source said, confirming media reports. His last known location was the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa. According to other French media reports, Salhi told police he had argued with Cornara and with his own wife before the killing. One of their work colleagues, quoted on the website of the television station i-Tele, also said the two men had clashed days earlier after Salhi dropped a pallet of fragile equipment. The suspect, whose wife and sister were released on Sunday after two days of questioning, is said by French security services to have associated with hardline Islamists over more than a decade, and had previously been flagged by them as a potential risk. Flanked by heavily armed police in masks and flak jackets, Salhi was taken on Sunday to the car park where he said he had killed Cornara, before retracing the route he had followed to the chemical plant. He was then escorted to the apartment he shared with his wife and three children in the quiet Lyon suburb of Saint-Priest, where further searches were carried out. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the government was increasing resources in law enforcement and domestic intelligence to combat Islamic extremism. \"We cannot lose this war, because it is essentially a war of civilization,\" Valls said in an interview broadcast on Europe 1 radio and i-Tele. \"It is our society, our civilization and our values that we must defend.\" Reporting by Gregory Blachier, Writing by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Ralph Boulton and Kevin Liffey Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Ukraine attacks Moscow with 34 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital 10:06 AM UTC ANALYSIS Kamala Harris' Michigan loss highlights Democrats' weak spots 11:56 AM UTC · Updated  ago Middle East category Dozens killed and wounded in Israeli strike on northern Gaza's Jabalia, medics say 10:51 AM UTC United States category Republicans on brink of clinching US House control after taking Senate 7:31 AM UTC World Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 turns back to Rome after engine fire World category · November 10, 2024 · 12:26 PM UTC ·  ago The right engine of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner operated by Chinese carrier Hainan Airlines caught fire shortly after take-off from Rome's Fiumicino airport this morning, an Italian airport official said.

The Swiss eighth seed played magnificently in a 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-4 victory at Roland Garros. Wawrinka, 30, brought an end to Djokovic's 28-match winning streak as he claimed his second Grand Slam title. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Shorts won French Open - Wawrinka Djokovic had been hoping to become the eighth man to complete the set of all four major titles. But the Serb will have to wait at least another 12 months before attempting to match the full set of major titles collected by Andre Agassi, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Roger Federer, Rod Laver, Rafael Nadal and Fred Perry. The 28-year-old had been a strong favourite to finally get his hands on the Coupe des Mousquetaires after beating nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and third seed Andy Murray, but he was outplayed by Wawrinka. \"It was an incredible atmosphere on court and I felt emotion like I never have before,\" said Wawrinka. Analysis, BBC Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller \"Stan Wawrinka knew he would have to produce his very finest tennis for at least three sets, and he did just that - in only his second experience of a Grand Slam final. \"The backhand down the line winner to seal the decisive break in the fourth set was the most breathtaking of all, but only one example of the array of glorious attacking shots that made even Djokovic look flustered. \"The world number one played well enough to have beaten almost anyone, but for 3 hours and 12 minutes, Wawrinka didn't play like just anyone.\" \"I would like to thank my coach Magnus Norman. You played in the final without winning but this victory is yours as well as mine.\" Djokovic was effusive in his praise for the new champion: \"There are things that are more important in life than victories and that is character and respect - Stan you are a great champion with big heart.\" Their last four matches in Grand Slams had gone to five sets and this was every bit as good in terms of quality, with Wawrinka hitting 60 winners as his aggression broke down the seemingly invincible Djokovic defence. The victory makes him only the second Swiss to win at Roland Garros after Roger Federer, the man he beat in the quarter-finals. Having lost the first set of the final following a poor service game at 3-3, Wawrinka came storming back with a barrage of winners that left Djokovic looking lost for a response. Four break points came and went in the second set before the fifth arrived in the shape of a set point, and Wawrinka finally converted to level the match. Image source, @schulerst Image caption, 2009 champion and Wawrinka's countryman Roger Federer watched the match on his mobile while at a Basle football match (left) before tweeting his congratulations (right) It was merely a sign of things to come as the eighth seed tore into the Djokovic serve in the third, and despite seeing off three break points for 1-1, there was little the top seed could do four games later. A brilliant forehand winner was followed by an equally breathtaking backhand to earn three break points, and the first was converted as Wawrinka moved forward and hammered a short ball. The crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier roared as the Swiss hit an outrageous winner around the net post on his way to securing the set. Djokovic was now facing a third French Open final defeat and he dug in, taking advantage of a lull at the opposite end of the court to fashion a 3-0 lead in the fourth. The match was now on Wawrinka's racquet, however, and he came storming back to level at 3-3 after some brilliant defence earned him the break. Djokovic called on everything he had to stay in touch, finding two volleys - the second a lunging effort reminiscent of his coach Boris Becker - to save break points with the score level in the set. Match stats Djokovic Wawrinka 6 Aces 9 65 First serve % 67 0 Double faults 3 63 % pts won on first serve 76 53 % pts won on second serve 50 30 Winners 59 41 Unforced errors 45 2/10 Break points/converted 4/15 Moments later it looked as though Djokovic would force the fifth set that had seemed inevitable as he moved 0-40 up, but there was another burst of brilliance to come from Wawrinka. A volley, a backhand and a serve got him out of trouble, and he rode the wave of five successive points into the next game as two screaming backhand passes at 4-4 gave him the chance to serve out for the title. It was never likely to be easy and, after a possible ace was overruled by the umpire on his first match point, the Swiss had to face a break point as Djokovic clung on to his career Slam hopes. The Serb could only send a forehand wide under pressure, and given a second opportunity to take the championship, Wawrinka steered another of those trademark backhands down the line and raised his arms in triumph.

Eighty people were reported killed after gunmen burst into the Bataclan concert hall and took hostages before security forces stormed the hall. People were shot dead at restaurants and bars at five other sites in Paris. At least 180 people were injured. These are the deadliest attacks in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings . French President Francois Hollande, visibly shaken, called Friday night's almost simultaneous attacks \"a horror\" and vowed to wage a \"merciless\" fight against terrorism. Paris saw three days of attacks in early January, when Islamist gunmen murdered 18 people after attacking satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a Jewish supermarket and a policewoman on patrol. Live: Follow the latest developments here In pictures: Paris shootings Eyewitness accounts from the scene The attack on the 1,500-seat Bataclan hall was by far the deadliest of Friday night's attacks.

The event had been sold out. \"At first we thought it was part of the show but we quickly understood,\" Pierre Janaszak, a radio presenter, told Agence France Presse. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaking outside the Bataclan concert hall President Hollande said the attacks were \"an abomination and a barbaric act\" \"They didn't stop firing. There was blood everywhere, corpses everywhere. We heard screaming. Everyone was trying to flee.\" He said the gunmen took 20 hostages, and he heard one of them tell their captives: \"It's the fault of Hollande, it's the fault of your president, he should not have intervened in Syria\". Within an hour, security forces had stormed the concert hall and all four attackers there were dead. Three had blown themselves up and a fourth was shot dead by police. Attack sites: La Belle Equipe ,  92 rue de Charonne, 11th district - at least 19 dead in gun attacks Le Carillon bar and Le Petit Cambodge restaurant at rue Alibert, 10th district - at least 12 dead in gun attacks La Casa Nostra restaurant , 92 rue de la Fontaine au Roi, 11th district - at least 5 dead in gun attacks Stade de France , St Denis, just north of Paris - explosions heard outside venue, three attackers dead Bataclan concert venue, 50 boulevard Voltaire, 11th district - stormed by several gunmen, at least 80 dead Image caption The attacks took place at six sites across Paris, mainly in the centre of the city What we know #Paris: Power, horror, and lies Meanwhile, not far from the Place de la Republique and the Place de la Bastille, three busy restaurants and a bar were targeted by gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs. Around 40 people were killed as customers were singled out at venues including a pizza restaurant and a Cambodian restaurant, Le Petit Cambodge. \"We heard the sound of guns, 30-second bursts. It was endless. We thought it was fireworks,\" Pierre Montfort, a resident living close to Le Petit Cambodge said.

The president was whisked to safety after the first of at least two explosions just outside the venue to convene an emergency cabinet meeting. Three attackers were reportedly killed there. As the extent of the bloodshed became clear, Mr Hollande went on national TV to announce a state of emergency for the first time in France since 2005. The decree enables the authorities to close public places and impose curfews and restrictions on the movement of traffic and people. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Eyewitness Ben Grant: \"There were a lot of dead people... it was horrific\" Paris residents have been asked to stay indoors and about 1,500 military personnel are being deployed across the city. All schools, museums, libraries, gyms, swimming pools and markets will be shut on Saturday as well as Disneyland Paris. All sporting fixtures in the affected area of Paris have also been cancelled, AFP reports. Police believe all of the gunmen are dead - seven killed themselves with explosives vests and one was shot dead by the security forces - but it is unclear if any accomplices are still on the run. US President Barack Obama spoke of \"an outrageous attempt to terrorise innocent civilians\". UK PM David Cameron said he was shocked and pledged to do \"whatever we can to help\". The Vatican called it \"an attack on peace for all humanity\" and said \"a decisive, supportive response\" was needed \"on the part of all of us as we counter the spread of homicidal hatred in all its forms\".

What happened in Paris on Friday night is exactly what Europe's security services have long feared, and tried to foil. Simultaneous, rolling attacks, with automatic weapons and suicide bombers in the heart of a major European city, targeting multiple, crowded public locations. The tactics have been used before, in Mumbai and elsewhere. But how they've come to Europe is one of many questions that will have to be answered. Were the attackers French citizens? If so, how they were radicalised, armed and organised - was it in France, in Syria, and by whom? Why weren't they detected? Is France, after two major attacks this year, uniquely vulnerable or does the carnage in Paris mean all of Europe faces new threats to our public places and events? And if a Syrian link is proven, will France recoil from that conflict or will it redouble its commitment to the fight against radical groups there?

Officials say a small group of protesters also tried to burn copies of the Koran in the capital, Ajaccio. Overall, several hundred people gathered in the city to express support for two firefighters and a police officer injured on Thursday. The government condemned both acts, pledging to punish the perpetrators. 'Unacceptable desecration' On Friday, the crowd gathered in front of the prefecture in Ajaccio to show their solidarity with the firefighters. Some protesters later marched to the scene of the attack on Thursday night - a poor neighbourhood in the capital. They chanted \"Arabs get out!\" and \"This is our home!\", AFP news agency reports. The demonstrators then attacked the local Muslim prayer room, ransacking it and partially burning books - including copies of the Koran. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the attack was \"an unacceptable desecration\". The French Council of the Muslim Faith also denounced the violence. In Thursday's incident, the firefighters were ambushed by \"several hooded youths\", French media report. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve pledged that the perpetrators of both the attack on the emergency services and the Muslim prayer hall would be identified and arrested. Mr Cazeneuve also stressed that there was no place for \"racism and xenophobia\" in France. France has beefed up security measures for the Christmas holidays, following the 13 November attacks in Paris by Islamic militants that left 130 people dead.

I was born in France, I am a French MP,\" he added.\nA member of Macron's entourage said the president was \"hurt\" by the \"intolerable\" comments, while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne urged the assembly to sanction the far-right MP, adding that \"racism has no place in our democracy\".\nThe far-right leader of RN, Marine Le Pen, backed her MP on Twitter by saying, \"the controversy created by our political opponents is obvious and will not fool the French people\".\nLe Pen challenged Macron in this year's presidential vote and then led her party to its best-ever performance in subsequent legislative elections, with 89 MPs.\nThe far-right party was founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, but his daughter claims to have overhauled the former National Front into a mainstream force, despite critics who say the changes are only cosmetic.\nDe Fournas later defended his comment, telling BFM television that the National Rally wants a halt to all illegal immigration after a surge in the number of people trying to reach France from Africa in recent years.\nHe accused France Unbowed opponents of \"manipulation\", and his party also denied any personal attack against Bilongo, a teacher of Congolese heritage who was born in Paris.\nDe Fournas later apologised to Bilongo for \"the misunderstanding my comments caused,\" and in case Bilongo was hurt by them.\nJordan Bardella — a favourite to take over officially from Le Pen at this weekend's RN congress — insisted the MP had meant the return of boats to African ports and accused LFI and the government of \"extreme dishonesty\".\nLFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon tweeted that the comments were \"beyond intolerable\" and that the deputy should be kicked out of the National Assembly.\nA parliamentary committee will meet Friday to discuss the incident, which could see de Fournas punished with a temporary exclusion from the Assembly.\nMacron's centrist Renaissance party will refuse to attend further sessions unless the council issues a \"heavy penalty\", its vice-president in parliament Sylvain Maillard said on Twitter.\nThe ruling party failed to win an overall majority in the legislative elections, leading to tensions as Macron's government seeks to push key bills through the legislature.\nRN MPs have been involved in earlier controversies during the latest term. First, the oldest member of the National Assembly José Gonzales praised French Algeria and its colonial rule on 28 June. \nDuring a recent session, two RN deputies lashed out at the government, calling the Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire a \"coward\" and the Minister of Education Pap Ndiaye a \"communitarian\".\nThese invectives led to sanctions by the President of the National Assembly, which are also to be debated by the institution's bureau.\nDe Fournas, a wine grower in the Nord Médoc, is in his first term of office at the age of 37. He had not participated in any rows until now in the Palais Bourbon, where he sits on the Economic Affairs Committee.",

He takes over from Marine Le Pen, who stepped down from the leadership ahead of her unsuccessful 2022 run for the presidency. https://p.dw.com/p/4J6cp Jordan Bardella has been elected leader of the far-right French party National Rally Image: Berzane Nasser/ABACA/picture alliance Advertisement France's far-right National Rally (RN) party on Saturday chose 27-year-old Jordan Bardella to succeed longtime leader Marine Le Pen . Bardella, who had been serving as interim party chief, garnered around 85% of party members' votes. His rival for the job was Louis Aliot, the mayor of Perpignan and former partner of Le Pen, who got 15%. Le Pen stepped down from the party leadership in 2021 ahead of her unsuccessful bid for the presidency in this year's elections. Who is Jordan Bardella? Raised by his Italian-born mother in a social housing block in the outskirts of Paris, Bardella has risen quickly through the party ranks. He promotes an elegant image, is rarely seen out of a suit, and has made an impact with sharp performances in this year's election debates. However, he has faced criticism from party veteran Aliot, who has accused him of encouraging white supremacist groups that should be unacceptable for a party trying to prove it can unite the country. Bardella accused Aliot of \"bitterness and bad faith,\" insisting his goal is to win over more supporters from traditional parties on the right and left. France: A divided country To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video What will Le Pen do? Marine Le Pen failed to unseat President Emmanuel Macron in last spring's presidential election, but has nonetheless made her party a formidable force after taking over from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen 11 years ago. Since then, she has pursued a policy of cleaning up the image of the party, which has long been overtly far-right, changing its name from the National Front to National Rally in 2018. Efforts to shed their legacy of virulent antisemitic and extremist views helped RN candidates win 89 seats in the National Assembly after Macron's re-election, depriving his centrist party of an absolute majority . With Bardella serving as chairman of the party, Le Pen plans to focus on leading the RN group in parliament, where she will have a powerful platform for a potential fourth run at the presidency in 2027. Bardella's election marks the first time since the party's founding 50 years ago that no one from the Le Pen family will be at the helm. However, Bardella is in a relationship with the daughter of Le Pen's sister. dh/nm (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Related topics Related topics Far-right populism in Europe France About DW Who we are Press DW Global Media Forum DW offers Learn German DW Akademie Service Newsletters Reception FAQ Contact Topics from A to Z Headlines B2B Sales & Distribution Travel Advertising German News Service Follow us on © 2024 Deutsche Welle Privacy Policy Legal notice Digital accessibility Data privacy settings",

There is no electoral college, and no involvement of parliament. A candidate who wins more than 50% of the popular vote is elected. If, as seems likely, no candidate wins that majority in the first round, the top two candidates go through to a run-off election two weeks later, on April 24. Although the French interior ministry reports the results by commune, department and region, only the overall national result counts. The breakdowns are interesting because they often show regional patterns in voting - Le Pen has in the past done well in the south and the north-east. Polls close at 1900CEST in most districts, but at 2000CEST in Paris and other large cities. French departments in the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean voted on Saturday. French citizens living overseas can also vote, and 1.4m of them are on the electoral register this time. The interior ministry said it was expecting some results from rural areas as soon as polls closed in Paris, with a majority of communes reporting by about midnight.

David Lisnard said they are a \"symbol of Islamic extremism\" and might spark scuffles, as France is the target of Islamist attacks. France is on high alert following a series of incidents including July's truck attack in nearby Nice. Anyone caught flouting the new rule could face a fine of â¬38 (Â£33). They will first be asked to change into another swimming costume or leave the beach. Nobody has been apprehended for wearing a burkini in Cannes since the edict came into force at the end of July. What do Muslim women think of the ban? This is not the first time that women's clothing has been restricted in France. In 2011 it became the first country in Europe to ban the full-face Islamic veil , known as the burka, as well as the partial face covering, the niqab. Earlier this week a private waterpark near Marseille cancelled a burkini-only day after being subjected to criticism. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The authorities will need to distinguish between swimmers in burkinis and wetsuits The ruling \"Access to beaches and for swimming is banned to any person wearing improper clothes that are not respectful of good morals and secularism. \"Beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation, when France and places of worship are currently the target of terrorist attacks, is liable to create risks of disrupting public order.\" The reaction in the French press The French media has questioned the legality of the ban. Le Monde points out , external that no French law bans the wearing of full-body swimsuits. \"The law on the full-face veil only bans covering the face in public... The burkini, which covers the body but does not hide the face, is thus a totally legal garment.\" France TV Info's legal blog, Judge Marie, says , external the risk of disturbing public order, invoked by the Cannes mayor, seems rather tenuous. \"The basic freedom to come and go dressed as you please seems to me to be infringed in a way that is disproportionate to this risk,\" the blog says. Meanwhile, a commentary in left-of-centre paper Liberation accuses , external the Cannes mayor of trying to score a political point: \"David Lisnardâ¦ is not responding to a specific issue, but is sending a radical message to his constituents, to his electorate.\" BBC Monitoring Mr Lisnard confirmed to local media that other religious symbols such as the kippah (Jewish skullcap) and the cross would still be permitted, and the ban would not apply to the veil that some Muslim women wear over their hair. He said: \"I simply forbid a uniform that is the symbol of Islamic extremism. \"We live in a common public space, there are rules to follow. \" The League of Human Rights (LDH) said it would challenge the ban in court. \"It is time for politicians in this region to calm their discriminatory ardour and defend the spirit of the Republic,\" local LDH leader Herve Lavisse said. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) is also expected to mount a legal challenge against the decision. Its lawyer Sefen Guez Guez called the ban \"illegal, discriminatory and unconstitutional\".

A car plowed into straw bales that demonstrators had placed across a road, hitting the three people before it came to a stop against a tractor’s semi-trailer, prosecutor Olivier Mouysset said in a statement. The fatal crash in southwest France represented a dramatic turn for the growing protest movement among French farmers for better remuneration and against what they consider to be excessive regulation, mounting costs and other problems. The months of demonstrations have become increasingly vigorous in recent weeks, with traffic barricades, dumps of foul-smelling agricultural waste outside government offices and other protests. Farmers have also been turning road signs upside down to protest what they argue are nonsensical agricultural policies. France is one of Europe’s agricultural powerhouses, with influential farming lobbies but also deep discontent among farmers who say they struggle to make ends meet despite working long hours to feed the country and boost its exports with their produce. RELATED COVERAGE Tesla, hammered by protests and plummeting sales, to report 1st quarter performance Anti-Trump protesters rally in New York, Washington and elsewhere across the country Thousands gather in London to support trans rights following UK ruling over definition of woman French President Emmanuel Macron’s government has been working to assuage farmers’ concerns before their anger blows up into a wider movement, like the yellow vest protests against economic injustice in 2019 that dented Macron’s popularity and saw frequent violence between protesters and riot police. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, newly installed by Macron in a government reshuffle this month , posted Tuesday on social media that “being a farmer means working without respite. It’s working for us, for the French. We are and will remain at their side.” The woman hit and killed by a car in the Ariège region of southwestern France was a farmer, Attal said. French media reported that she raised cows. “All our farmers are in mourning. Our nation is shocked,” Attal said. Macron, in a social media post, described the accident as a tragedy that “upsets us all” and said he ordered his government to find ”concrete solutions” to the difficulties that farmers are highlighting. The death and injuries provoked an outpouring of emotion in parliament, with lawmakers standing solemnly to applaud the victims and the profession more generally. “We can say today that we are all farmers,” said Dominique Potier, a socialist. The car that rammed into the barricade of straw bales in the Ariege town of Pamiers was carrying three people, the prosecutor said in his statement. The woman killed in the pre-dawn collision was in her thirties, the statement said. Her husband was seriously injured and hospitalized and their 14-year-old daughter also was helicoptered for hospital treatment and is in critical condition, the prosecutor said. His statement said the collision did not appear to be intentional. Police detained the three occupants of the car for questioning.",

DDM - NATHALIE SAINT AFFRE Agriculture , Transports , Toulouse Publié le 17/01/2024 à 10:40 , mis à jour à 10:45 Sébastien Girardel l'essentiel Pour la FNSEA, la mobilisation du 16 janvier a été un fiasco. Les agriculteurs n'ont rien obtenu des pouvoirs publics. Ils montent \"d'un cran la mobilisation\" ce jeudi et prévoient de bloquer des autoroutes notamment l'A 64. \"Puisque personne ne nous écoute, on va monter d'un cran la mobilisation et frapper à grand coup\", tempête Laure Serres. La présidente de la FDSEA 31 est particulièrement exaspérée par \"l'absence totale d'avancées\" lors de la réunion avec le préfet qui s'est tenue hier en marge de la manifestation du 16 janvier. \"On pensait qu'il serait attentif à certains points mais il s'est montré indifférent...\", soupire cette agricultrice du Lauragais. Avec ses équipes, elle peaufine actuellement les détails du blocage des autoroutes occitanes dès jeudi matin : \"Si on continue à faire des choses qui ne marquent pas l'esprit des gens on continuera à ne pas être entendus.

D'autres actions pourraient avoir lieu dans l'Aude, les Pyrénées-Orientales et le Tarn.

        "text": "Gabriel Attal: Macron's pick for PM is France's youngest at 34 9 January 2024 Share Save Hugh Schofield BBC News, Paris Share Save Reuters Gabriel Attal succeeded Élisabeth Borne on Tuesday during an official ceremony at the prime minister's residence Gabriel Attal has been named France's next prime minister, as Emmanuel Macron aims to revive his presidency with a new government. At 34, he is the youngest PM in modern French history, outranking even Socialist Laurent Fabius who was 37 when he was appointed by François Mitterrand in 1984. Mr Attal replaces Élisabeth Borne, who resigned after 20 months in office. Throughout that time she struggled with a lack of a majority in parliament. Gabriel Attal, who is currently education minister, certainly makes an eye-catching appointment. He will now have the task of leading the French government into important European Parliament elections in June. His rise has been rapid. Ten years ago he was an obscure adviser in the health ministry, and a card-carrying member of the Socialists. He will also be the first openly gay occupant of Hôtel Matignon. He was previously in a civil partnership with another Macron whizz-kid, the MEP Stéphane Sejourné. Welcoming him to his new role, President Macron wrote on social media: \"I know I can count on your energy and your commitment to implement the project of revitalisation and regeneration that I announced.\" LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP/POOL Gabriel Attal (L) has the task of leading the government into European Parliament elections in June \"France will never rhyme with decline, France rhymes with transformation, France rhymes with audacity,\" Mr Attal declared outside his new residence. But given the difficulties of the president's second term - and the growing challenge from the nationalist right - is \"eye-catching\" alone going to cut it? Handsome, youthful, charming, popular, cogent, Mr Attal certainly comes to office trailing clouds of glory - much, let it be said, like his mentor and role-model the president himself. But like many go-getters of his generation, he was inspired by Emmanuel Macron's idea of breaking apart the old left-right divide and re-writing the codes of French politics. In the wake of Macron's 2017 election, Mr Attal became a member of parliament, and it was there that his brilliance as a debater - easily the best of the neophyte Macronite intake - brought him to the president's attention. At 29, he became the youngest ever minister in the Fifth Republic with a junior post at education; from 2020 he was government spokesman and his face began to register with the voters; after President Macron's re-election, he was briefly budget minister and then took over at education last July. It was in this post that Mr Attal confirmed to the president that he has what it takes, acting with no-nonsense determination to end September's row over Muslim abaya robes by simply banning them in schools. He led a campaign against bullying - he himself was a victim, he says - at the elite École alsacienne in Paris, and took on the education establishment with his proposal to experiment with school uniform. JACQUES DEMARTHON/AFP President Macron's party faces a strong challenge from National Rally and its young leader Jordan Bardella - as well as Marine Le Pen And, all the while, he managed to buck the normal trends by actually becoming popular among the public. Polls show that he is by far the most admired member of the Macron government - competing at the same level as the president's main enemy, the nationalist Marine Le Pen and her youthful colleague Jordan Bardella. And there, of course, is the heart of it. By drawing Gabriel Attal from his pack of ministers, Mr Macron is using an ace to outplay the queen and her jack. But will it work? The drawn-out process of naming him - everyone knew a reshuffle was coming but it took forever - shows that if President Macron is well aware of the weakness of his current position, he has also been in deep uncertainty over how to address it. Reuters Mr Attal replaces Élisabeth Borne but is likely to face the same problems she had without a majority in the National Assembly More than one commentator has made the obvious point that what the public wants above all now is not so much a rearrangement of faces at the top, but a new sense of purpose to the Macron presidency. But as things stand, Mr Attal will face exactly the same problems as did his long-suffering predecessor Élisabeth Borne. These are: a hard-right opposition that is surging in popularity and looks set to win easily in June's European elections; a National Assembly with no in-built majority for the government, making every new law a struggle; and a president who seems unable to define what he wants his second term to achieve. On top of which, the new prime minister will have a problem all of his own - which is establishing his authority over such heavyweights as Gérald Darmanin and Bruno Le Maire. And what is the plan, some are also asking, if as seems likely Mr Macron's party loses heavily in the European elections? Normally that would be the occasion for a prime ministerial replacement, to give a new élan for the second half of the mandate. But, as things stand, that card has already been played, and in the event of a defeat in June Gabriel Attal risks drifting on as a discredited loser. Even opposition figures recognise that he is a class act. He is respected and liked in the National Assembly. But there are also questions about what he actually stands for. The suspicion for many is that he is all smiles and verbiage, much like the man to whom he owes his career. As the president's nominee, he is the wunderkind's wunderkind. But if he is only Macron's mini-me, the marvel could prove a mirage. French PM resigns ahead of expected reshuffle France Emmanuel Macron",

The 16th Century painting by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the world's most famous artworks, and is held at the Louvre in central Paris. The Louvre said the work was behind protective glass and was not damaged. Video shows two female protesters wearing T-shirts that read \"food counterattack\" throwing the liquid. They then stand in front of the painting, saying:  \"What is more important? Art or the right to healthy and sustainable food? \"Your agricultural system is sick. Our farmers are dying at work,\" they add. Museum security are then seen putting black screens in front of them before the room is evacuated. A group called Riposte Alimentaire (Food Counterattack) claimed responsibility for the stunt. In a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, it said the protest was part of efforts to integrate \"food into the general social security system\". It said that the current model for food \"stigmatises the most precarious and does not respect our fundamental right to food\". The group called for a food card worth €150 (£128) to be given to citizens each month to be used on food. The Louvre said that members of Riposte Alimentaire, which it described as an environmental movement, sprayed pumpkin soup on the painting at around 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT), and that there was no damage. It said the Salle des Etats, where the work is displayed, was evacuated, and reopened to visitors at 11:30 after cleaning was carried out. \"The museum will lodge a complaint,\" it added. Rachida Dati, France's Minister for Culture, said \"no cause\" could justify the Mona Lisa being targeted. \"Like our heritage [the painting] belongs to future generations,\" she said on X. The French capital has seen protests by farmers in recent days , calling for an end to rising fuel costs and for regulations to be simplified - on Friday they blocked key roads in and out of Paris. The Mona Lisa has been behind safety glass since the early 1950s, when it was damaged by a visitor who poured acid on it. In 2019, the museum said it had installed a more transparent form of bulletproof glass to protect it. In 2022, an activist threw cake at the painting , urging people to \"think of the Earth\". The painting was stolen from the Louvre in 1911 , causing an international sensation. Vincenzo Peruggia, an employee of the world's most visited museum, hid in a cupboard overnight to take the painting. It was recovered two years later when he tried to sell it to an antiques dealer in Florence, Italy. Man dressed as old woman throws cake at Mona Lisa Real v replica: Can you tell which is which?

ARCHIVES MANOUCHIAN/ROGER-VIOLLET Le président Emmanuel Macron va faire entrer au Panthéon Missak Manouchian, figure de la Résistance d’origine arménienne, saluant ainsi sa « bravoure » et son « héroïsme tranquille » , a annoncé, dimanche 18 juin, l’Elysée dans un communiqué . « Missak Manouchian porte une part de notre grandeur » , il « incarne les valeurs universelles » de liberté, égalité, fraternité au nom desquelles il a « défendu la République » , déclare la présidence de la République.

Il devient le premier résistant étranger et communiste à entrer au Panthéon. Depuis 2017, Emmanuel Macron a déjà panthéonisé Simone Veil, Maurice Genevoix et Joséphine Baker. Missak entrera au Panthéon le 21 février 2024, soit tout juste 80 ans après sa mort, « accompagné de Mélinée » , son épouse, d’origine arménienne et résistante comme lui, qui lui survécut quarante-cinq ans et repose à ses côtés au cimetière d’Ivry-sur-Seine (Val-de-Marne), a précisé la présidence.

Rescapé du génocide arménien, apatride, réfugié en France en 1925, Missak Manouchian rejoignit en 1943 la résistance communiste où il s’illustra à la tête d’un réseau très actif, avant d’être arrêté et fusillé par les Allemands le 21 février 1944. Célébré par Louis Aragon et Léo Ferré, Missak Manouchian est aussi entré dans la mémoire collective avec « l’Affiche rouge », placardée dans tout Paris par la propagande nazie durant son procès pour désigner son groupe à la vindicte. L’Affiche rouge est aussi le titre d’un film sorti en 1976 qui immortalisa l’histoire du groupe Manouchian à l’écran.

L’hommage rendu dimanche s’inscrit dans une longue séquence mémorielle autour du 80 e anniversaire de la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale qui se poursuivra en 2024 avec le Débarquement en Normandie et la Libération de Paris.

SNCTA, the largest union representing air traffic controllers in France, has dropped plans for a 24-hour strike on Thursday after reaching a deal on pay and working conditions. However, the deal came too late to roll back cancellations ordered by France's DGAC civil aviation authority. As a result, 75 per cent of flights remain canceled at Paris Orly Airport on Thursday and 55 per cent at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. In Marseille-Provence, 65 per cent of flights are cancelled along with 45 per cent in other airports in mainland France. Two other unions, UNSA-INCA and Usac-Cgt, had also called a strike. It is not clear whether they will still go ahead with the action. France ’s largest air traffic controllers union had filed a strike notice for this Thursday, protesting the restructuring of workers' services. The SNCTA, which represents over 60 per cent of France’s air traffic controllers, told the French press earlier this week that they expected a \"record turnout\". The national press has dubbed the 25th a “journée noir” (black day) for French airports. \"People should expect major disruption and long delays,\" a spokesperson for the SNCTA union told AFP. It was predicted that the 24-hour strike would lead up to 70 per cent of flights in and out of French airports to be cancelled. Despite the strike being called off, the news came too late for cancellations to be reversed, and they remain at or just slightly below original figures. It is unclear whether 'overflights' that need to enter French airspace will still be affected but budget airline Ryanair warned that over 300 flights would be cancelled due to the threatened strike. Unions were objecting to the restructuring of air navigation services, a debate that has been ongoing for the last 15 months. Air traffic authorities are overhauling work schedules to cope better with predicted increases in flight traffic. Unions were demanding an accompanying rise in salaries and employee numbers. SNTCA was seeking pay increases of 5.04 per cent per year in 2025, 2026 and 2027, as well as the doubling of their “special qualification allowance”. It is not yet known what deal has been reached. The strike threat came despite the agreed ‘Olympic truce’ to suspend industrial action until the end of the games. CGT-RATP union members also announced a seven-month strike notice from 5 February to 9 September that could hit the Ile-de-France bus and metro network - including during this summer's Olympic Games . However, the French Senate adopted a bill on 9 April to allow the state to ban transport strikes for set periods each year to avoid disruption during major events like Paris 2024. It also calls for more advance warning of strikes and increased minimum service obligations. The bill faces opposition and must be adopted by the French National Assembly before it becomes law. Workers at the state-owned public transport company say they are walking out over pay.   Browse today's tags",

Authorities say Kendji Girac's life is no longer considered in danger. Police were called at about 05:30 local time (04:30 GMT) to a traveller site in Biscarrosse, around 50km (31 miles) from Bordeaux. French media reported that in initial talks with investigators, the 27-year-old linked the incident to his own mishandling of a firearm. According to the reports, Mr Girac - who has sold millions of albums since his appearance on The Voice - told first responders he had shot himself accidentally while handling a pistol he had purchased from a junk shop. He was transported to a hospital in Bordeaux following the shooting. A source close to the investigation told the AFP news agency that police had not ruled anything out in their probe. The shooting took place near the reception area of a traveller community camp in Biscarosse, where Mr Girac had been for several days. \"This isn't a gangland shooting. It's an accident. He was playing with the thing and 'bam',\" a man called Emilio, who said he was Mr Girac's uncle, told AFP at the camp. The singer was due to perform in Marseille on Friday to celebrate the approach of the Olympic flame. The event's organiser said he will no longer take part in light of his injury. Kendji Girac is the stage name of Kendji Maille, 27, who grew up in the Catalan Gypsy community. He first rose to fame in 2013, after covering a song by Congolese-French rapper Gims. The following year, he won The Voice France. He has released five studio albums, most recently L'École de la Vie (The School of Life) in 2022. His hits Color Gitano and Andalouse have hundreds of millions of views on YouTube. Around half a million people make up the Gypsy community in France. Many live in the south-west of the country, where Mr Girac was brought up. Like many French Gypsies, Mr Girac has Spanish roots and several of his songs are in Spanish. But Mr Girac's popularity extends well beyond his own community. With his good looks, modern Gypsy and rumba pop music and clean-cut image he has become a \"poster boy\" for the French Gypsy community. Reacting to the news, French TV host Cyril Hanouna said: \"We are all shocked. We love him, he's a great guy, incredibly kind, always smiling, always ready to help.\" The Gypsy mayor planning to tear down Gypsy homes France Travellers",

French authorities in New Caledonia and the interior ministry in Paris said five people, including two police officers, were killed after protests earlier this week over voting reforms pushed by President Emmanuel Macron’s government turned deadly. At least 60 members of the security forces were injured and 214 people were arrested over clashes with police, arson and looting Thursday, the territory’s top French official, High Commissioner Louis Le Franc, said. “Everything is being done to restore order and calm that Caledonians deserve,” French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said after a meeting at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris. AP AUDIO: Violence rages in New Caledonia as France rushes emergency reinforcements to its Pacific territory AP Paris bureau correspondent John Leicester reports it’s unlikely the unrest in France’s Pacific territory of New Caledonia will have an impact on the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris. He said that in addition to 1,700 security forces troops that have already been deployed to help police, 1,000 more are on the way but the situation “remains very tense, with looting, riots, arson and attacks, which are unbearable and unspeakable.” RELATED COVERAGE New Zealand qualifies for the 2026 World Cup with a 3-0 win over New Caledonia in the Oceania final New Zealand qualifies for the 2026 World Cup with a 3-0 win over New Caledonia in the Oceania final Two members of the island’s Indigenous Kanak community were among the five dead, French Interior and Overseas Territories Minister Gerald Darmanin said Thursday as he vowed that France “will regain total control.” He said 10 people, all allegedly from the pro-independence movement known as The Field Acton Coordination Unit, were under house arrest. In April, the group had backed several protests against French authorities on the island. Still, Darmanin claimed the movement is a “small group which calls itself pro-independence, but instead commits looting, murder and violence.” Leaders of a Kanak Workers Union in Paris appealed for calm and said they were deeply saddened by deaths in their faraway homeland. “We wish to see the French government make a strong political statement rather than send troops,” a union leader Rock Haocas told reporters on Thursday. “Starting a conversation would be a strong political statement.” In New Caledonia, The National Council of Chiefs of the Indigenous Kanak people condemned “all acts of vandalism and gun violence,” but rejected the allegations that the pro-independence movement was involved in the deadly violence. Grand Chief Hippolyte Sinewami-Htamumu expressed full support for the pro-independence group, which has mobilized more than a hundred thousand people “of all ages and from all backgrounds” in peaceful protests in recent months in the capital, Nouméa, and throughout the island. “This is not a ‘terrorist group’ or ‘mafia group,’ as certain political leaders want us to believe,” he said in a statement on Thursday. The state of emergency will be in place for at least 12 days as French military forces were being deployed to protect ports and airports and to free up police troops. The curfew has been extended until Friday morning, said Le Franc, the high commissioner. The territory’s political parties also appealed for calm on both sides — those who support independence and those who want the island to remain part of France. The last time France imposed emergency powers on one of its overseas territories was in 1985, also in New Caledonia. The measures enable French and local authorities on the archipelago to tackle unrest, authorizing house detentions for those deemed a threat to public order, allowing for searches, weapons’ seizures and restricting movement, with possible jail time for violators. The Pacific island east of Australia, home to about 270,000 people and 10 time zones ahead of Paris, is known to tourists for its UNESCO World Heritage atolls and reefs. Tensions have simmered for decades between the Indigenous Kanaks seeking independence and colonizers’ descendants who want it to remain part of France. People of European descent in New Caledonia, which has long served as France’s prison colony and now has a French military base, distinguish between descendants of colonizers and descendants of the many prisoners sent to the territory by force. This week’s unrest erupted as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French constitution to make changes to voter lists in New Caledonia. The National Assembly on Wednesday approved a bill that will, among other changes, allow residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years to cast ballots in provincial elections. Opponents say this will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize the Kanaks, who had once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination. Macron said Wednesday that he would convene the Congress, a joint session of lawmakers from both houses of the French parliament, by the end of June to amend the constitution and make the bill law in the absence of a meaningful dialogue and consensus among local representatives. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. A peace deal between rival factions was reached in 1988. A decade later, France promised to grant New Caledonia political power and broad autonomy, and hold up to three successive referendums on the island’s future. The referendums were organized between 2018 to 2021 and a majority of voters chose to have New Caledonia remain part of France, instead of backing independence . The pro-independence Kanak people rejected the results of the last, 2021 referendum , which they had boycotted because it was held at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. ___ Surk reported from Nice, France.

The interior minister said it was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level. The man is accused of planning a ‘’violent action’’ on behalf of the Islamic State group’s jihadist ideology, the national counterterrorism prosecutor’s office said in a statement Friday. The man, who was not identified, is behind held in custody pending further investigation. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne. According to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events “to die and become a martyr,” the statement also said.

Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris’ Stade de France. Darmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats , including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries. The Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. ‘’Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders — and will continue to be fully mobilized,’' it said in a statement. Canada’s women’s soccer team is the defending Olympic champion and is set to open group play on July 25 in Saint-Étienne against New Zealand. Canada will also face France at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard on July 26. Asked about the purported plot, Canada coach Bev Priestman said: “That’s a concern to hear, but I think a little bit like in Tokyo, the Olympic Committee, I would imagine that they’re going to step in and I think our faith and trust will be in making it a secure and safe environment for our players.” Security concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony , which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country’s national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high. Organizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000. The French government also decided that tourists won’t be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead. Extra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily. ___ Associated Press writer Anne Peterson in Portland, Ore. contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP coverage of Paris Olympics https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

Having refused Saturday to confirm that Harry Winston was the target , the Paris prosecutor’s office did so on Sunday, saying the dazzling, by-appointment store on the tony Avenue Montaigne was robbed by a gang of at least three people. They “forced entry to the jewelry store using a two-wheeler. They stole jewelry from several windows, while one of them kept watch,” carrying a long-barreled firearm, the prosecutor’s office said. As they sped away, they pointed the firearm “in the direction of police officers, who had to put an end to their pursuit,” it said. “The damage, currently being assessed, is several million euros,” it said.

A 10-day stream of stars began flowing down the Cannes’ red carpet with the opening night film, “The Second Act,” a French comedy starring Lea Seydoux, Vincent Lindon, Louis Garrel and Raphaël Quenard. They play squabbling actors filming a movie directed by an artificial intelligence. The festival’s first lengthy standing ovation, though, went to Streep , who was awarded an honorary Palme d’Or during Tuesday’s opening ceremony. After Juliette Binoche introduced her, Streep alternatively shook her head, fanned herself and danced while the crowd thunderously cheered. “I’m just so grateful that you haven’t gotten sick of my face and you haven’t gotten off of the train,” said Streep, who soon thereafter declared Cannes officially open with Binoche. “My mother, who is usually right about everything, said to me: ’Meryl, my darling, you’ll see. It all goes so fast. So fast,″ added Streep. “And it has, and it does. Except for my speech, which is too long.” Streep. (Photo by Daniel Cole/Invision/AP) The reception was nearly as rapturous for Gerwig, the first American female filmmaker to serve as president of the Cannes jury that will decide the festival’s top award, the Palme d’Or. Thierry Fremaux, Cannes’ artistic director, on Monday praised her as “the ideal director” for Cannes, given her work across arthouse and studio film and her interest in cinema history. And, Fremaux said, “We very much liked ‘Barbie.’” In the days to come, Cannes will premiere George Miller’s “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” Francis Ford Coppola’s self-financed “Megalopolis” and anticipated new movies from Paolo Sorrentino, Yorgos Lanthimos, Andrea Arnold and Kevin Costner. But much of the drama surrounding this year’s Cannes has been off screen. After French actor Judith Godrèche earlier this year accused two film directors of rape and sexual abuse when she was a teenager, the French film industry has been dealing with arguably its defining #MeToo moment. On Wednesday, Godrèche will premiere her short “Moi Aussi.” Asked about #MeToo expanding in France, Gerwig told reporters in Cannes on Tuesday that it’s progress. “I think people in the community of movies telling us stories and trying to change things for the better is only good,” Gerwig said. “I have seen substantive change in the American film community, and I think it’s important that we continue to expand that conversation. So I think it’s only moving everything in the correct direction. Keep those lines of communication open.” Lily Gladstone,Greta Gerwig, Eva Green, and Pierfrancesco Favino. (Photo by Scott Garfitt/Invision/AP) Gerwig is joined on the jury by Lily Gladstone, star of “Killers of the Flower Moon,” French actor Eva Green, Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona, French actor Omar Sy, Lebanese actor and director Nadine Labaki, Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda, Turkish screenwriter Ebru Ceylan and Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino. “I thought I just got over my imposter syndrome last year,” said the Oscar-nominated Gladstone . “But I’ll start all over again.” The jurors were asked how the many real-world concerns outside the festival might affect their deliberations. One film in competition, Ali Abbasi’s “The Apprentice,” stars Sebastian Stan as a young Donald Trump. Labaki was questioned on the war in Gaza. “I truly believe that one of the tools to really change something in the situation we all live in right now, which is a situation I think is not that great, is really through art and through cinema,” said Labaki. “It may propose a more tolerant way of seeing things and seeing each other as human beings.” Filmmakers, Favino said, play the important role of reminding the world of where it can find beauty. “This is why I decided that I could be here without feeling guilty as a human being,” said Favino. “Because if we look for beauty, then we might look for peace.” Other concerns are also swirling around this year’s Cannes. Festival workers, fed up with short-term contracts that leave them unqualified for unemployment benefits in between festivals, have threatened to strike. During Tuesday’s opening ceremony, two small bands of festival workers protested, including one group that unfurled a banner from the roof of the Palais. On Monday, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammed Rasoulof, whose film “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” is premiering next week in competition in Cannes, said he had fled Iran after being sentenced to eight years in prison and flogging. The film is said to be a critical depiction of the Iranian government. Heidi Klum (Photo by Scott Garfitt/Invision/AP) As Cannes continues, though, many will be focused on the stars parading the festival’s famous red carpet. They’ll include Emma Stone, Anya Taylor-Joy, Demi Moore, Selena Gomez, Nicolas Cage and Barry Keoghan. At the closing ceremony on May 25, George Lucas is to receive an honorary Palme d’Or. Regardless, the 77th Cannes will have a lot to live up to. Last year’s festival, widely celebrated for its robust lineup, produced three Oscar best picture nominees: “Anatomy of a Fall,” “The Zone of Interest” and “Killers of the Flower Moon.” A good Cannes will help France keep the global spotlight through the summer. The festival will be followed by the French Open, the Tour de France and the summer Olympics in Paris. On May 21, the Olympic flame will be carried up the steps to the festival’s hub, the Palais des Festivals. To help rekindle the spirit of last year’s festival, Messi, the canine star of “Anatomy of a Fall,” was the first star to hit the red carpet Tuesday. The border collie, enlisted to film daily snippets for French TV, frolicked up and down the carpet while tuxedo-clad photographers hollered “Messi!

The suspected arsonist was an Algerian national who wasn’t flagged as a potential extremist, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said after inspecting the fire-damaged synagogue. He said the man had sought permission to stay in France for medical treatment and, after it was refused, had been placed on a police wanted list for possible return back to his country. Darmanin praised the 25-year-old police officer for using his service weapon against the “particularly dangerous, particularly violent” assailant who rushed at him with a knife, declaring: “He was right to do so.” The minister said the officer would be decorated for his “extremely courageous, extremely professional” behavior. “This antisemitic act in Rouen affects all of us, deeply,” he said. France is “extremely determined to continue protecting all the Jews of France, wherever they are, who must practice their religion without fear.” Related stories Dialysis patients struggle to get treatment in blockaded Gaza. Officials say hundreds have died Yemen’s Houthi rebels fire a missile at northern Israel, the first time for the group to reach there UN to review the impact of its agency helping Palestinian refugees in Gaza and elsewhere In the wake of the Israel-Hamas war , antisemitic acts have surged in France, which has the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in Western Europe. France has also seen pro-Palestinian protests in major cities and students occupying university campuses in support of Palestinians in Gaza. The main French Jewish umbrella group described the synagogue blaze as “a scandalous message” and “a way of saying that Jews don’t belong in French society.” This week, a Paris memorial honoring people who distinguished themselves by helping to rescue Jews in France during the country’s Nazi occupation in World War II was also attacked , defaced with painted blood-red hands. “It’s unbearable. It’s more and more serious every day. After the antisemitic graffiti we saw in the past few days, antisemitic slogans, antisemitic insults, we now have attempts at setting synagogues on fire,” said Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France. “Everyone is wondering whether they can live a peaceful life in France as a Jew,” he added, speaking in an Associated Press interview. “There’s a climate of fear because it feels like, anywhere in our country and at any time, an antisemitic attack can take place. It aims at intimidating French Jews and we won’t accept this intimidation. We refuse it, and we will continue to fight against this unbridled antisemitism.” Firefighters were alerted early Friday morning to the blaze at the synagogue. Police officers discovered the man on the roof of the building, clutching the metal bar in one hand and the kitchen knife in the other, and smoke rising from the synagogue’s windows, Rouen prosecutor Frédéric Teillet said. He said the man hurled abuse and threw the metal bar at the police before jumping off the roof and then running at one of the officers with his knife raised. The officer fired five shots, hitting the man four times, fatally wounding him, the prosecutor said. Rouen Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said that the man is thought to have climbed onto a trash container and thrown “a sort of Molotov cocktail” inside the synagogue, starting the fire and causing “significant damage.” “When the Jewish community is attacked, it’s an attack on the national community, an attack on France, an attack on all French citizens,” he said. “It’s a fright for the whole nation.” Hours later, the inside of the synagogue still smelled of fire, although the building was largely intact. A couple of walls were charred and damaged and wooden cabinets adorned with the Star of David where the Torah is stored for services were blistered and blackened. “It’s a catastrophe,” said Natacha Ben Haim, head of Rouen’s Jewish community. “The assailant threw an incendiary object inside through a small dormer that he most certainly broke into. The fire started then, very quickly apparently, and the damage is considerable. We managed to save the Sefer Torah, but parts of the wall fell, from the ceiling, too.” The synagogue’s rabbi, Chmouel Lubecki, urged community members to light candles and attend Friday night services for the Jewish sabbath to show strength and unity. “We need to be strong,” he said. “Don’t let the antisemitism take our Judaism.” French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said this month that the sharp spike in antisemitic acts in France that followed the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel has continued into this year. Authorities registered 366 antisemitic acts in the first three months of 2024, a 300% increase over the same period last year, Attal said. More than 1,200 antisemitic acts were reported in the last three months of 2023 — which was three times more than in the whole of 2022, he said. “We are witnessing an explosion of hatred,” he said. ___ John Leicester reported from Paris.

Prisoner Mohamed Amra - known as \"The Fly\" - was being taken from court to a prison when a car rammed the prison van at a toll booth. Gunmen then opened fire at prison officers, with two officers killed and two critically injured. Several hundred police officers and gendarmes have been deployed to carry out a manhunt. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that \"everything is being done to find the perpetrators\". Prosecutors identified the inmate who was freed as Mohamed Amra, born in 1994. Amra was convicted of burglary on 10 May and had been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death. Who is escaped French prisoner Mohamed Amra? AFP / Getty The 30-year-old inmate is said to have ties to a gang in the southern city of Marseille, which has been plagued by drug-related gang violence. At the time of the ambush which led to his escape he was being transported back to jail in the town of Évreux after attending a morning court hearing in Rouen. The ambush took place around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) near a toll booth on the A154 motorway. The officers were shot with \"heavy weapons\" by the prisoner's accomplices, according to French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti. The attackers escaped in a car which police believe they have now recovered, abandoned near the toll gate where the attack happened. Watch: Hooded gunmen seen in footage taken from passing bus Roadblocks have been set up across north-west France, with police following up on every tip-off. Speaking to the media following a crisis unit meeting, Mr Dupond-Moretti confirmed that two officers had died. \"One leaves behind a wife and two children who were meant to celebrate their 21st birthday in two days. The other leaves a wife who is five months pregnant,\" he said. \"Everything - and I mean everything - will be put in place to find the perpetrators of this vile crime,\" Mr Dupond-Moretti said, adding that the perpetrators were \"people for whom life has no value\". They would be found and punished \"in a way that is proportionate to the crime\", he said. France",

Some 16,000 employees would be affected. The new media group would bring together France Télévisions, Radio France, the National Audiovisual Institute and France Médias Monde (FMM).

The status of FMM is the subject of debate within French President Emmanuel Macron’s coalition, with some arguing it should be excluded from the proposed merger.

The arrest was announced just as France hosted world leaders on the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday. Russia wasn’t invited. Russia’s Investigative Committee said the suspect, whom it didn’t identify, is accused of failing to register with authorities as a foreign agent while collecting “information about military and military-technical activities of the Russian Federation.” It added that the information could be used to the detriment of the country’s security. Russia’s state news agency Tass identified the arrested French citizen as Laurent Vinatier, an employee of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), a Geneva-based nongovernment organization. HD confirmed Vinatier’s detention in a statement released to The Associated Press. “We are aware that Laurent Vinatier, an adviser at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), has been detained in Russia,” it said. “We are working to get more details of the circumstances and to secure Laurent’s release.” RELATED COVERAGE Georgian-Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, known for his gigantic and controversial work, dies at 91 Countries shore up their digital defenses as global tensions raise the threat of cyberwarfare How war, money and the quest for discovery entwined the US government and universities French President Emmanuel Macron told French television Thursday night that the French citizen was “in no way...working for France” and that he “works for a Swiss NGO founded by former UN chief Kofi Annan and which carries out diplomacy of working discussions.″ He is receiving consular protection, Macron said. Vinatier’s LinkedIn page, which describes him as a “conversationalist,” says he has worked for the center for over a decade and indicates that he has had a focus mostly on former Soviet republics, Turkey and the Middle East over the years. Russia’s Investigative Committee posted a video showing officers detaining the suspect at a cafe and driving him to the committee’s Moscow offices for interrogation. The charges carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. The arrest comes during a strain in Russian-French ties that followed French President Emmanuel Macron’s statements about the possibility of deploying the country’s troops in Ukraine . Moscow has warned that French soldiers would be legitimate targets for Russia if they are sent to Ukraine. The charges against the French citizen are based on a recently approved law that requires anyone who collects information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other newly endorsed legislation as part of a multi-pronged Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to muzzle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.

Coges did not offer an explanation, but France’s defense ministry released a statement saying that “the conditions are no longer right to host Israeli companies at the Paris show, given that the French president is calling for the cessation of IDF operation in Rafah.” The announcement came days after an Israeli strike targeting two top Hamas terrorists in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah sparked a fire in a complex housing displaced Palestinians, killing dozens of civilians and triggering international outrage and protests in France. An Israel Defense Forces probe into the strike found that a hidden store of weapons may have been the actual cause of the deadly blaze, and that the airstrike that targeted an adjacent area had used small munitions that would not ignite such a fire on their own.

Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza say more than 35,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though only some 24,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The toll, which cannot be verified, includes some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.

The demand has its roots in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a decades-old campaign against Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians. The movement has taken on new strength as Israel’s war against Hamas surpasses the eight-month mark and stories of suffering in Gaza have led to growing international pressure on Israel to end the fighting.

Voters cast ballots in two dozen languages in 27 countries with scores of different campaign issues. So here’s a look at what happened in some key countries in the June 6-9 elections for a new European Parliament . FRANCE This was the biggest bombshell of Europe’s mass election night: President Emmanuel Macron’s moderate pro-business party was so badly trounced by the far-right party of Marine Le Pen in the EU vote that he called a snap legislative election in France. Propelled by her anti-immigration, nationalist ideas , Le Pen’s National Rally party is forecast to win the most of France’s 81 seats in the European Parliament — about twice as many as Macron’s Renaissance movement. FILE - Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, left, speaks with Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni during a round table meeting at an EU Summit in Brussels, on March 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, File) The snap French legislative election is a big gamble for Macron and his party, which risks further losing support while Le Pen’s National Rally could see its influence surge. Many French voters used the EU election to express dissatisfaction with Macron’s management of the economy, farming rules, or security. The result hurts him as he tries to lead Europe-wide efforts to defend Ukraine and boost the EU’s own defenses and industry. RELATED COVERAGE Olazábal named as one of Donald’s vice captains for Ryder Cup in New York Italy’s Olympic committee calls for sports events to be suspended on day of Pope Francis’ funeral The canonization of the first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, is postponed after the pope’s death The National Rally’s lead European Parliament candidate, Jordan Bardella, promises to limit free movement of migrants within the EU’s open borders and dial back EU climate rules. The party no longer wants to leave the EU and the euro, but to weaken it from within. On the left, France’s long-suffering Socialist Party surged behind lead candidate Raphaël Glucksmann, who wants a more ambitious climate policy and protections for European businesses and workers. GERMANY The leader of the EU’s richest and most powerful country, Germany, also suffered a blow. Center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular governing coalition lost badly to the conservative opposition, which benefited from his troubles. The conservative bloc maintained its position as the strongest German party in Brussels as it looks ahead to a national election expected in the fall of next year. And the far-right Alternative for Germany made good gains despite a string of scandals surrounding its top two candidates for the EU legislature. That’s especially sobering to many, given Germany’s Nazi past. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the dominant party in the two-party conservative bloc that won the most votes. Projections showed support for Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats at 14%, their worst post-World War II result in a nationwide vote. Germany’s Greens, central to globally important EU climate policy, saw support slump. Germany will have the largest number of the new European Parliament’s 720 seats at 96.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) HUNGARY Long-serving Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán saw yet another election victory — but a new challenger has upended his grip on Hungarian politics. Orbán’s Fidesz party was expected to win 43% of the vote, according to estimates from the EU Parliament. While Fidesz took a plurality of votes, it was down nearly 10 points from its support in the last EU elections in 2019, and looked set to lose two seats in what was widely seen as a referendum on Orbán’s popularity. A deep economic crisis and a recent series of scandals involving Fidesz politicians have rocked the party which prides itself on upholding family values and Christian conservatism. Challenger Péter Magyar broke ranks with Orbán’s party in February and in a matter of months built up Hungary’s strongest opposition party. That party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA), was expected to take 31% of the vote.

(Sven Hoppe/dpa via AP) Magyar has shot to prominence on public accusations of corruption and mismanagement within Orbán’s government. Magyar’s party has presented itself as a more centrist alternative to Orbán’s brand of illiberal populism. Orbán cast the election as an existential struggle between war and peace, telling voters that casting their ballots for his opposition would draw Hungary directly into the war in neighboring Ukraine and precipitate a global armed conflict. He has been in power since 2010. ITALY Premier Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-fascist roots, is forecast to more than double its number of seats in the European Parliament since the last election. And that will hand her new power to influence policy in the EU. While voters punished moderate leaders in France and Germany, they gave Meloni’s party even more support than in the last national elections in 2022. Her pro-Ukraine and Israel policies have proven reassuring to centrist American and European allies, but she is leading culture wars at home that preserve her far-right credentials. The center-left opposition Democratic Party came in second, followed by the other main opposition party, the 5-Star Movement. In Italy, the vote is not expected to destabilize the government, even if Meloni’s advantage will be at the expense of her partners in the governing coalition, the populist, anti-migrant right-wing Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, and the center-right Forza Italia, led by Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. Italy has 76 European parliamentary seats. SLOVAKIA A liberal, pro-Western group won the EU elections in Slovakia, beating the party of populist, pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico just weeks after he survived an assassination attempt . The attack on Fico sent shockwaves through the nation of 5.4 million and appeared to boost voter turnout, which had been the lowest of the entire bloc in 2014 and 2019 but reached a record 34.4% Sunday. The assassination attempt didn’t help Fico’s leftist Smer (Direction) party, the senior partner in the governing coalition, to win the vote. Smer has been attacking the EU’s support for Ukraine, as well other policies on immigration, climate change and LGBTQ+ rights. Smer was in a close race against the main opposition Progressive Slovakia, which won 27.8%, or six seats in the EU parliament, according to provisional results. Smer follows at 24.8%, or five seats. A far-right opposition party that wants Slovakia out of NATO, the Republic, finished third with 12.53% and will have two seats. __ Follow the AP’s coverage of global elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/",

It was unclear whether the alleged plot was linked to the the war in Ukraine. Relations between Russia and France have become increasingly tense in recent months over the conflict. Prosecutors said the suspect suffered serious burn injuries after an explosive device detonated in his hotel room, and was treated for his injuries before being handed over to France’s domestic intelligence agency for questioning. The statement said the man was presented to an investigating judge on Friday who filed preliminary charges for participation in a terrorist group planning criminal attacks, and for possession of explosives materials aimed at preparing an attack in connection with a terrorist group.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena) Read More By HOWARD FENDRICH Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit PARIS (AP) — As Carlos Alcaraz began constructing his comeback in Sunday’s French Open final, a 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Alexander Zverev for a first championship at Roland Garros and third Grand Slam title in all, there arrived the sort of magical shot the kid is making a regular part of his varied repertoire. It was a running, then sliding, down-the-line, untouchable forehand passing winner that Alcaraz celebrated by thrusting his right index finger overhead in a “No. 1” sign, then throwing an uppercut while screaming, “Vamos!” No, he is not ranked No. 1 at the moment — the man he beat in the semifinals, Jannik Sinner , makes his debut at the top spot on Monday — but Alcaraz has been there before and, although a “2” will be beside his name next week, there is little doubt that he is as good as it gets in men’s tennis right now. And more accomplished than any man ever was at his age. Alcaraz is a 21-year-old from Spain who grew up running home from school to watch on TV as countryman Rafael Nadal was accumulating title after title at Roland Garros — a record 14 — and he eclipsed Nadal as the youngest man to collect major championships on three surfaces. Nadal was about 1½ years older when he did it. RELATED COVERAGE Andre Agassi will play at the US Open Pickleball Championships next week Alcaraz waiting on results from medical tests to see if he will play in Madrid Rising tennis star Eala stays focused at Madrid Open despite more attention on her “Different tournaments, different aura,” Alcaraz said when asked to distinguish among his trio of trophies, “but I’m going to say: same feeling. I mean, winning a Grand Slam is always special,” This one from the clay-court major joins hardware from triumphs on hard courts at the U.S. Open in 2022 and on grass at Wimbledon in 2023 . He is 3-0 in Slam finals. “It’s an amazing career already. You’re already a Hall of Famer. You already achieved so much — and you’re only 21 years old,” said Zverev, who also lost the 2020 U.S. Open final , that one after being two points from winning. “Incredible player. Not the last time you’re going to win this.” Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, exited the French Open in the semifinals each of the past three years, including after tearing ankle ligaments during the second set against Nadal in that round in 2022. Hours before Zverev’s semifinal victory over Casper Ruud began on Friday, a Berlin district court announced that he reached an out-of-court settlement that ended a trial stemming from an ex-girlfriend’s accusation of assault during a 2020 argument. On Sunday against Alcaraz, Zverev faltered after surging in front by reeling off the last five games of the third set. Alcaraz’s level dipped during that stretch and he seemed distracted by a complaint over the condition of the clay, telling chair umpire Renaud Lichtenstein it was “unbelievable.” But Alcaraz reset and ran away with it, taking 12 of the last 15 games while being treated by a trainer at changeovers for some pain and cramping in his left leg. “I know that when I’m playing a fifth set, you have to give everything and you have to give your heart,” Alcaraz said. “I mean, in those moments, it’s where the top players give their best tennis.” No. 3 seed Alcaraz and No. 4 Zverev were making their first appearance in a French Open final. Indeed, this was the first men’s title match at Roland Garros since 2004 without at least one of Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer . Nadal, who is 38 and was limited by injuries over the last two seasons, lost to Zverev in the first round two weeks ago; Djokovic, 37, a three-time champion, withdrew before the quarterfinals with a knee injury that required surgery; Federer, 42, is retired. There were some jitters at the outset. Zverev started with two double-faults — changing rackets after the second, as though the equipment were the culprit — and got broken. Alcaraz lost serve immediately, too. Let’s just say they won’t be putting those initial 10 minutes in the Louvre. Actually, lot of the 4-hour, 19-minute match was patchy, littered with unforced errors. Alcaraz was at his best when it mattered the most — the last two sets. “I lost focus, and on my serve, I didn’t get the power from my legs anymore, which is weird. Because normally I do not get tired. I don’t cramp,” Zverev said. “Against Carlos, it’s a different intensity.” Just like he did against Zverev, Alcaraz overturned a deficit of two sets to one against Sinner, making him the first man to capture the French Open by doing that in each of the last two matches since Manolo Santana — also from Spain — in 1961. Alcaraz showed off all of his skills: the drop shots, the artful half-volleys, the intimidating forehands delivered aggressively and accompanied by a loud grunt. His 27 forehand winners were 20 more than Zverev’s total. Not bad for a guy who arrived in Paris saying he was afraid to hit his forehand at full force because of a forearm injury that sidelined him for nearly all of May. He said Sunday that there were “a lot of doubts” entering the French Open and he was forced to limit his practice time — which is why he considers this victory the proudest moment of his still-nascent career. In the fifth set, under constant pressure from Alcaraz, Zverev got broken to fall behind 2-1. The next game showed the grit and gumption that already are hallmarks of Alcaraz’s style. Zverev — who argued about one line call on a second serve by Alcaraz that the German said afterward was out according to an unofficial video review — would hold four break points. He failed to convert any. Alcaraz didn’t let him, and wrapped up the game with a drop shot. The crowd roared. Alcaraz held his left index finger to his ear while waving his racket. He broke again for 5-2, then served it out and dropped onto his back, caking his shirt with clay — just as Nadal often did after championship point. Alcaraz first learned to play tennis on the rust-colored surface, although he says he prefers hard courts. Alcaraz says he dreamed long ago of adding his own name to the list of Spanish men to win the event, including his coach, 2003 champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. And those red-and-yellow Spanish flags that became such an annual fixture at Court Philippe Chatrier in the era of Nadal were there again Sunday, this time for Alcaraz. The difference?

The arrest was announced just as France hosted world leaders on the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday. Russia wasn’t invited. Russia’s Investigative Committee said the suspect, whom it didn’t identify, is accused of failing to register with authorities as a foreign agent while collecting “information about military and military-technical activities of the Russian Federation.” It added that the information could be used to the detriment of the country’s security. Russia’s state news agency Tass identified the arrested French citizen as Laurent Vinatier, an employee of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), a Geneva-based nongovernment organization. HD confirmed Vinatier’s detention in a statement released to The Associated Press. “We are aware that Laurent Vinatier, an adviser at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), has been detained in Russia,” it said. “We are working to get more details of the circumstances and to secure Laurent’s release.” RELATED COVERAGE Georgian-Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, known for his gigantic and controversial work, dies at 91 Countries shore up their digital defenses as global tensions raise the threat of cyberwarfare How war, money and the quest for discovery entwined the US government and universities French President Emmanuel Macron told French television Thursday night that the French citizen was “in no way...working for France” and that he “works for a Swiss NGO founded by former UN chief Kofi Annan and which carries out diplomacy of working discussions.″ He is receiving consular protection, Macron said. Vinatier’s LinkedIn page, which describes him as a “conversationalist,” says he has worked for the center for over a decade and indicates that he has had a focus mostly on former Soviet republics, Turkey and the Middle East over the years. Russia’s Investigative Committee posted a video showing officers detaining the suspect at a cafe and driving him to the committee’s Moscow offices for interrogation. The charges carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. The arrest comes during a strain in Russian-French ties that followed French President Emmanuel Macron’s statements about the possibility of deploying the country’s troops in Ukraine . Moscow has warned that French soldiers would be legitimate targets for Russia if they are sent to Ukraine. The charges against the French citizen are based on a recently approved law that requires anyone who collects information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other newly endorsed legislation as part of a multi-pronged Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to muzzle criticism of its actions in Ukraine. Arrests on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Recent high-profile arrests include Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested on espionage charges in March 2023, and U.S.-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who was taken into custody in October 2023 for failing to register as a “foreign agent.” __ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.",

The criminals set fire to the ram car before fleeing, but firefighters brought the blaze under control, the police source said. According to a source close to the case, four people are suspected of having taken part in the attack. The value of damage and losses was being assessed, the public prosecutor said. In May, robbers armed with a long weapon snatched jewels from the Harry Winston shop near the Champs-Elysees before making their escape on motorbikes. The suspects are still at large, and the loss is estimated at between six million and 10 million euros ($6.5 million and $10.8 million), according to a source close to the investigation.

        "text": "French right uproar over call for far-right alliance 11 June 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby BBC News Share Save REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier The leader of France's right-wing Republicans party, Eric Ciotti, has sparked an outcry after he backed an alliance with the far-right National Rally in snap elections announced by President Emmanuel Macron. The anti-immigration party of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella scored a dramatic victory in European elections on Sunday, prompting Mr Macron to dissolve parliament and call a first round of elections in 19 days' time. The decision has sent shockwaves through French politics, not least among the Republicans party, which won only 7.25% of the vote and has seen many of its voters move to National Rally (RN). For Republicans leader Eric Ciotti the solution was clear: \"We need to have an alliance while remaining ourselves... an alliance with the National Rally and its candidates.\" The snap election has prompted parties on both left and right to consider forming  alliances to stand a greater chance of winning more seats. Left-wing parties have already agreed to abandon their differences to form a \"popular front\". But never before has the traditional right in French politics made any sort of political accord with the far right and Mr Ciotti's remarks set a party that was already struggling to find a voice \"on the verge of implosion\", as Le Monde put it. Mr Ciotti, who is on the right wing of his party, revealed he had already spoken to Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella. Ms Le Pen immediately praised his \"courageous choice and sense of responsibility\" and looked forward to an end to \"40 years of a pseudo-cordon sanitaire\" disappearing. But his suggestion was immediately greeted with a chorus of derision. Outside party headquarters in Paris, supporters spoke of an act of treachery for a party whose origins lie with the first president of France's current Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle. A clearly furious Republicans vice-president Florence Portelli said the party would fire Mr Ciotti for suggesting an accord with the far right. \"I think there's a chance he can be made to leave, if he doesn't go by himself, and I have no doubt it'll happen,\" she told France Info TV. REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella say they are ready to exercise power Senate Republicans leader Bruno Retailleau accused him of disloyalty: \"The Republicans will never form an alliance with the RN, we have deep ideological differences and we have to maintain our independence and integrity.\" Many of Mr Ciotti's critics said he was driven by local politics in his home city of Nice. One MP, Vincent Descœur, said he was resigning in protest and another, Jean-Yves Bony, said he would too if Mr Ciotti didn't step down in 48 hours. François-Xavier Bellamy, who led the Republicans in the European elections, said working with RN would merely be doing Mr Macron's work for him. President Macron has explained his bombshell decision to call elections, saying he could not carry on after the European elections as if nothing had happened and did not want to come across as powerless. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Pool He ruled out resigning as president \"whatever the result\" of the elections, which take place over two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, less than three weeks before the Paris Olympics. \"It's not the RN who write the constitution, or the spirit of it,\" he told Le Figaro. National Rally won 31.4% of the vote on Sunday, more than double the 14.6% of Mr Macron's Renew alliance, while a resurgent centre left, led by Raphaël Glucksmann, reached 13.8%. Another far-right party, Reconquest, took 5% of the vote, and there had been talk of the two parties forming an alliance for the next election. But Marion Maréchal of Reconquest, who is Marine Le Pen's niece, said RN had decided against an alliance because they wanted nothing to do with her party's leader Eric Zemmour. Macron snap election leaves rivals stunned after EU vote Europe's night of election drama capped by Macron bombshell Macron takes huge risk with surprise election At the last parliamentary election, France's notoriously divided left-wing parties formed a group called Nupes, bringing together the Socialists, far-left France Unbowed (LF), Communists and Greens. Despite Nupes imploding amid even wider divisions over issues such as the war in Gaza, the left parties have agreed to form a pact to fight the new elections. Although Mr Macron won a second term two years ago, his party failed to secure a majority in parliament, making it a struggle to pass legislation. He has often had to rely on support from the Republicans to do so, so his decision to call elections is a big risk, especially when he is facing defeat. The first opinion poll taken since Sunday's elections suggests National Rally would win 34% of the vote, ahead of 19% for Mr Macron's party. But until now the two rounds of a parliamentary election have been tricky for National Rally as they have often struggled to win more than 50% of second-round run-off votes because their opponents tend to coalesce against the far right. It is so far unclear whether their dramatic success on Sunday may have changed that. Europe France Emmanuel Macron Marine Le Pen",

For now, the left is focused on agreeing to avoid the worst, by making the dissolution an opportunity rather than a guaranteed catastrophe in the face of the far right.

The French Interior Ministry said 250,000 people turned out to protest, 75,000 of them in Paris. Despite rainy and windy weather, those who fear that the elections will produce France’s first far-right government since World War II gathered at Place de la Republique before marching through eastern Paris. Up to 21,000 police and gendarmes were deployed. The protesters held placards reading “Liberty for all, Equality for all and Fraternity with all” — a reference to France’s national motto — and “Let’s break frontiers, documents for all, no to the immigration bill.” Some chanted “Free Palestine, viva Palestina,” and wore keffiyeh scarves. Among them was Nour Cekar, a 16 year-old high school student from the Paris region, who has French and Algerian parents and wears the hijab. “To me, the extreme right is a danger because it supports an ideology based on the fear of the other, whereas we are all French citizens despite our differences,” she told The Associated Press.

I am a woman and I should be able to decide what I want to wear. I am a free woman,” she said, adding that she is insulted on social media and in the streets on a daily basis because of her headscarf. Against the backdrop of music of French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, the crowd chanted “Everyone hates racism.” “France is made up of people of different origins. It is its strength. The National Rally wants to break that,” 68-year-old Mohamed Benammar, a French doctor with Tunisian roots who works in a Paris public hospital, told AP. “We provide medical care to everyone, without worrying about their nationality, the color of their skin or their religion, unlike the fascists (extreme-right leaders) that single out Black, Arabs or Muslim people,” he said. Although his son told him that it was useless to protest, Bennamar said he’s convinced that it is important to make his voice heard. “I am here to send a strong signal to politicians. We won’t stay silent in the face of the far right,” he said. Police in Paris reported “numerous attempts at damage” by protesters. They said that nine protesters were arrested and three officers were injured. An AP journalist said police used tear gas against demonstrators who tried to vandalize a bus stop and advertising boards. In the French Riviera city of Nice, protesters marched down Jean Médecin Avenue, the city’s main shopping street, chanting against the National Rally, its leader Jordan Bardella as well as against President Emmanuel Macron. Local police said 2,500 people took part. Nice is traditionally a conservative stronghold, but has over the past decade turned firmly in favor of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally and her far-right rival Eric Zemmour. Crowds have been gathering daily ever since the anti-immigration National Rally made historic gains in the European Parliament elections on Sunday , crushing Macron’s pro-business moderates and prompting him to dissolve the National Assembly. New elections for the lower house of parliament were set in two rounds, for June 30 and July 7. Macron remains president until 2027 and in charge of foreign policy and defense, but his presidency would be weakened if the National Rally wins and takes power of the government and domestic policy. “We need a democratic and social upsurge — if not the extreme right will take power,’' French unions said in a statement Friday. “Our Republic and our democracy are in danger.’' They noted that in Europe and across the world, extreme-right leaders have passed laws detrimental to women, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color. To prevent the National Rally party from winning the upcoming elections, left-wing parties finally agreed Friday to set aside differences over the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and form a coalition . They urged French citizens to defeat the far right. French opinion polls suggest the National Rally — whose founder has been repeatedly convicted of racism and antisemitism — is expected to be ahead in the first round of the parliamentary elections. The party came out on top in the European elections, garnering more than 30% of the vote cast in France, almost twice as many votes as Macron’s party Renaissance. Macron’s term is still on for three more years, and he would retain control over foreign affairs and defense regardless of the result of the French parliamentary elections. But his presidency would be weakened if the National Rally wins, which could put its 28-year-old party leader Bardella on track to become the next prime minister, with authority over domestic and economic affairs. ___ Morton reported from London.

        "text": "Ferrari won the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the second year in a row on Sunday after a battle with Toyota to the finish of the 92nd edition of the endurance race. Almost out of fuel and on a wet track, Denmark's Nicklas Nielsen took the checkered flag in the 499P hypercar shared with Italian Antonio Fuoco and Spaniard Miguel Molina over 311 laps of the Sarthe circuit. The Toyota GR010 hybrid driven by Jose Maria Lopez, Kamui Kobayashi and Nyck de Vries finished 14.221 seconds behind after starting 23rd. Nielsen, Fuoco and Molina were all first-time overall winners, but the outcome remained open right to the end in a race with a safety car period lasting more than four hours during the night. The car's fuel gauge was registering around 2% at the finish. \"The worst for me was when they asked me to go slower because that's usually where the mistakes happen,\" Nielsen said about saving fuel to the finish. \"The last lap was so long. They kept me updated on the gap ... so it was just about managing the gap to the car in P2 [second]. ... But we did it.\" There was drama with more than an hour remaining when the car's right-side door flapped open, forcing a pit stop, which later played into Ferrari's hands with the car now on a different fuel strategy to rivals. The Toyota GR010 hybrid driven by Jose Maria Lopez, Kamui Kobayashi and Nyck de Vries finished 14.221 seconds behind after starting 23rd. Ferrari's winning crew from a year ago -- Alessandro Pier Guidi, Antonio Giovinazzi and James Calado -- finished third on a day of drizzle and overcast skies. Toyota's challenge was slowed by Lopez spinning at the Dunlop Curve, losing precious time. With 30 minutes remaining, and a 30-second gap to the leader, Toyota effectively conceded defeat and told Lopez to bring the car home in second place. Ferrari had looked good from the start, with the two factory cars joined by the AF Corse customer team entry driven by Robert Kubica, Robert Shwartzman and Yifei Ye. That entry, which had led on Saturday, retired four hours from the end with technical issues. Porsche Penske finished fourth with the pole-sitting car driven by Laurens Vanthoor, Kevin Estre and Andre Lotterer. Two-time IndyCar champion Alex Palou finished seventh in a Cadillac.

        "text": "French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at President Emmanuel Macron's press conference in Paris, June 12, 2024. LAURENCE GEAI /MYOP FOR LE MONDE The European Commission on Wednesday, June 19, reprimanded France for breaching the European Union's budget rules under President Emmanuel Macron, in the runup to snap elections marked by lavish spending promises. Alongside France, the EU's executive arm said \"the opening of a deficit-based excessive deficit procedure is warranted\" for Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia. The procedure kickstarts a process forcing a debt-overloaded country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get back on track. The seven countries had deficits – the shortfall between government revenue and spending – above 3% of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules. The news will be a blow to Macron as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017. And it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on June 30 and July 7 – in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend more at a time when France will need to make cuts. Column Subscribers only 'Political instability and the prospect of the RN coming to power are throwing the markets and the business world into disarray' Macron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far right in the EU elections earlier this month. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programs of either the far right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted. Interview Subscribers only French finance minister: 'Reducing state spending by €10 billion is a first step' The political uncertainty has hurt French stocks as Paris, which was Europe's biggest stock market by valuation, lost its crown this week to London. 'No return to austerity' Brussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money. The EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defense. But two sacred goals remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60% of national output, with a public deficit of no more than 3%. \"After almost four years under the General Escape Clause, our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said in a statement. \"This does not mean 'back to normal,' because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity,' because this would be a terrible mistake.\" Editorial Macron's ostrich policy regarding public finances The Commission will formally propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers. It also noted in Wednesday's statement that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data. The EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4%), Hungary (6.7%), Romania (6.6%), France (5.5%) and Poland (5.1%). Break with the past Countries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation. In practice, though, the Commission has never gone as far as levying fines – fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.

Under the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking.

Adopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single currency in 1999, the rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact seek to prevent lax budgetary policies by setting the strict goal of balanced accounts.

Among the injured, two individuals sustained serious wounds, with one reported to be in critical condition, stated a police spokesperson. The perpetrators, described as several masked gunmen armed with firearms, fled the scene. The shooting occurred at the Eden Palace, a venue specializing in weddings, where approximately a hundred people were gathered. \"As reported by a police source, the incident unfolded around 1.15am during a wedding reception. A group of individuals stepped outside to smoke when three heavily armed men arrived and fired multiple shots in their direction,\" the source detailed. The assailants arrived in a 4X4 vehicle, likely a BMW, according to the same source. Authorities are investigating whether the vehicle originated from Germany or Luxembourg, located approximately fifteen kilometers away. \"The incident appears to be linked to settling scores related to drug trafficking rather than a deliberate attack on the wedding event itself,\" the source commented. Investigators were observed collecting samples from a vehicle at the scene by reporters on Sunday morning. At least three bullet holes were visible on a glass door leading into the expansive reception hall. \"Numerous shell casings were recovered from the site,\" noted the local daily Le Républicain lorrain. The Eden Palace, which boasts a capacity to host 600 diners and accommodate 800 guests, is situated in a commercial zone outside Thionville. The case has been assigned to the judicial police in Metz. The border region of Lorraine has been grappling with issues related to drug trafficking. In a separate incident in May 2023 , shootings between rival gangs at a drug distribution point in Villerupt, in the neighboring department of Meurthe-et-Moselle, resulted in injuries to five individuals.

The French interior minister said Thursday that 30,000 police officers will be deployed on voting day, including 5,000 in the Paris region. Tensions are high as left-wing and moderate groups try to prevent the anti-immigration, nationalist National Rally from winning an absolute legislative majority, which would be a first and a major historical shift for France. Candidates have complained of both hate speech and physical violence in the brief and polarizing campaign for the snap elections. Thevenot, a candidate for the centrist Ensemble alliance led by President Emmanuel Macron, said she and a deputy and a party activist were putting up election posters in Meudon near Paris on Wednesday night when a group attacked them. Thevenot’s deputy and the party activist were taken to a hospital. ’’The symbolic violence of words quickly was replaced by physical violence,″ she told reporters while back on the campaign trail Thursday. ‘’We are still a bit shocked ... I remain mobilized.’' RELATED COVERAGE Zelenskyy pushes back on ceding Ukrainian land in potential peace deal ahead of London talks Simone Biles, Mondo Duplantis and Real Madrid win Laureus sports awards Iran seeks Russia’s support for its nuclear talks with US She said the motive for the attack was being investigated. The prosecutor’s office said it opened an investigation into a gang assault with a weapon against a public official. Four people, including three minors, are in custody, prosecutors said. Politicians on all sides condemned the attack and others on candidates from various parties. Marie Dauchy, a National Rally candidate in Savoy, said she was assaulted Wednesday at a food market while campaigning and announced she was abandoning the race. Her party’s leader and three-time presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, said on X that two men had “cowardly” assaulted Dauchy. Nicolas Conquer, a candidate for The Republicans, said on social media that he was assaulted while distributing election flyers in the Atlantic coast city of Cherbourg on Tuesday. He was accompanied by a minor when the incident happened, and reported it to police, he said. In the Alps, 77-year-old local official Bernard Dupre was beaten while hanging campaign posters for former Health Minister Olivier Veran, Veran said Thursday. French media broadcast images of Dupre’s bloodied eye. “Let’s reject the climate of violence and hatred that is taking hold,” Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Thursday on X. “This climate is deplorable,” Le Pen said in a TV interview. A few hours before being targeted, Thevenot had shared her anxiety as a person of color in a “complicated” political situation with French broadcaster TF1. Her parents hail from the African island of Mauritius. “I don’t say this only as spokesperson of the government, but more as the daughter of immigrants and mother of mixed-race children,” she said, citing repeated and intensified racist attacks. “They no longer do it anonymously, but with uncovered faces and even with a certain pride.” Many people have voiced concerns that the surge in voter support for the fiercely anti-immigration National Rally has made people feel more comfortable using racist, xenophobic and antisemitic language in public. A candidate who campaigned in the outskirts of Paris for Macron’s camp was assigned private security guards by her party after she said she was the target of antisemitic abuse. Pamphlets targeting Black people appeared in mailboxes in the Paris suburb of Chatou, shocking residents. Activist group SOS Racisme filed a legal complaint for inciting hatred, and said that its offices around France have seen a rise in reports of racist comments and acts during the campaign. The government agency tallying racist acts did not have recent data since the brief campaign began. French newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported that Fadila Khattabi, the minister for people with disabilities and the daughter of Algerian immigrants, was in tears when she shared a personal story at a ministerial meeting at the Elysée Palace on Monday. “Considering my origins, I am scared of racist speech,” she said, according to the newspaper. “My son, a symbol of republican success, a child of immigration who became a pharmacist, now wants to leave France, out of fear of a National Rally victory.” A group called the Antifascist Action Paris-Suburbs called for a protest outside the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, on Sunday night as results come in to stand up against the far right. Le Pen denounced the call. Macron called a surprise legislative election on June 9 after his centrist alliance suffered a punishing defeat at the hands of the National Rally in French voting for the European Parliament, plunging the country into a chaotic, sudden legislative campaign. ___ Angela Charlton in Paris contributed. ___ Follow AP coverage of global elections at https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/",

        "text": "Pro-independence leader Christian Tein among seven flown to the mainland after last month’s large-scale riots. Seven independence activists linked to a group accused of orchestrating riots last month in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia have been sent to mainland France for pre-trial detention, according to the local prosecutor. “This transfer was organised during the night by means of a plane specially chartered for the mission,” Yves Dupas, the public prosecutor in the territory’s capital, Noumea, said in a statement on Sunday. The seven were sent to France, he added, “due to the sensitivity of the procedure and in order to allow the investigations to continue in a calm manner, free of any pressure”. Among the seven detainees was Christian Tein, head of the pro-independence group Field Action Coordination Cell (CCAT), who has been in custody and was charged on Saturday over the recent violence in which nine people died, including two police. Hundreds of people were wounded and damage estimated at $1.6bn was inflicted during the unrest over controversial voting reforms.    Authorities did not immediately specify what charges Tein faces, but Dupas said his investigation covered armed robbery and complicity in murder or attempted murder, according to French daily Le Monde. Tein’s lawyer Pierre Ortent said on Saturday he was “stupefied” that his client was being sent to France, accusing magistrates of “answering to purely political considerations”. “No one had any idea in advance that they would be sent to mainland France. These are totally exceptional steps” for New Caledonia, Ortent said. Stephane Bonomo, lawyer for another detainee, Gilles Joredie, said the prosecutors’ actions were creating “martyrs for the independence cause”, according to Le Monde. CCAT group’s communications chief Brenda Wanabo was also one of the suspects sent to almost 17,000km (10,563 miles) away, to France, Le Monde added. Riots, street barricades and looting broke out in New Caledonia in May over an electoral reform that would have allowed long-term residents to participate in local polls. Paris deployed troops to the territory in response. The archipelago’s Indigenous Kanaks feared the move would dilute their vote, putting hopes for eventually winning independence definitively out of reach.

Jacquot, 77, has been charged with raping actors Julia Roy, now 34, in 2013 and Isild Le Besco, now 41, between 1998 and 2000, it said. He was to be freed after two days of questioning in custody but remain under judicial supervision, it added. He was held for questioning on Monday after actor Judith Godrèche, 52, filed a complaint against him this year for allegedly raping her during a relationship of several years that started when she was 14. Le Besco, 41, then filed a complaint over alleged rape during a relationship with Jacquot that also started when she was underage, and Roy, 34, accused him of sexual assault.

Snap national elections called by pro-business moderate President Emmanuel Macron have plunged the country into a hasty and disorderly electoral race, in which hate speech is becoming a growing concern. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin announced Wednesday that the government ordered the shutdown of several groups peddling extremist hatred. A series of decrees announcing the shutdown outlined investigations into the groups and said they posed risks of violence. The groups affected include GUD, known for violence and antisemitism. Its members have supported far-right political leader Marine Le Pen in the past. Le Pen’s National Rally party is leading all polls ahead of the two-round elections, June 30 and July 7, while Macron’s centrist alliance is lagging far behind. However, the outcome remains highly uncertain due to the complex, two-stage voting system and potential political alliances.

Another targeted group, called Les Remparts, is accused of inciting hate, discrimination and violence toward foreigners and non-white people, according to Interior Ministry decrees reviewed by The Associated Press. Some members, a decree said, wear a jacket bearing the inscription “White Division’’ and the group has offered self-defense trainings. The ministry cites a 2023 attack in which dozens of hooded far-right militants, armed with iron bars, attacked a civil society group at a conference about Palestinians. Some of the attackers had ties with Les Remparts, the decree said. Another decree targeted a group called Jonas Paris, which it said claims to support France’s Muslim community but instead promotes violence, hate and discrimination toward non-Muslims, women and LGBTQ+ people. Antisemitic and anti-Muslim discourse has also surfaced in the campaign . Activist group SOS Racisme announced Wednesday it filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the spread of a widely shared video that mocks people of African origin and tells them to ‘’go home.’’ The lawsuit is seeking charges of provocation of racial hatred against the video’s creators. Noting similar videos that have appeared in Germany, the group said, ‘’these expressions of unbridled racism reflect a climate of the freeing-up of racist speech, fed by the worrying scores of the far right’’ in recent elections around Europe . Facing the prospect that France could elect its first far-right government since the Nazi occupation during World War II, other parties have been scrambling to form alliances and field candidates . The elections were called by Macron earlier this month after his party suffered a crushing defeat in the European Parliament election . In a TV debate Tuesday night, young and fast-rising National Rally president Jordan Bardella renewed his proposal to abolish free health care for foreigners and toughen regulations around acquiring French nationality. His proposal to prevent dual citizens from accessing certain “strategic” state jobs in particular attracted the ire of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who said it revealed the true objectives of a party that has long been tied to xenophobia and racism. “The message you are sending is that when we are dual citizens, we are half-citizens, we are not real French people,” Attal said. Attal suggested the real targets of this measure are not dual citizens with high-level positions, when he said Bardella’s party had a Franco-Russian representative in the European Parliament. Bardella has softened many of the party’s hard-line positions, and was put on the spot during the debate over another key issue, the age of retirement. Macron’s raised it last year from 62 to 64, prompting months of protests that weakened his government. The National Rally backs the idea of setting back the retirement age to 62, but Bardella said 42 years of work would be needed for entitlement to a full pension, de facto raising the retirement age for those who started working later in their 20s. Eric Bompard, of the France Unbowed party, part of a new left-wing coalition, also came after Bardella’s economic program and his proposal to lift taxes for people under 30. Bompard said the National Rally’s program would contribute to making the rich richer, at the expense of the poorest 30% share of the population, while Attal accused the 28-year-old Bardella of personally benefiting from the measure. “Why would a 31-year-old laborer pay taxes, while a 29-year-old consultant or trader would stop paying?” Attal asked. ___ Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of global elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/",

High drama, for sure, but this was a shock. When the graphics flashed up on all the big French channels, it was not the far right of Marine Le Pen and her young prime minister-in-waiting Jordan Bardella who were on course for victory. It was the left who had clinched it, and Emmanuel Macron's centrists - the Ensemble alliance - had staged an unexpected comeback, pushing the far-right National Rally (RN) into third. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the veteran left-wing firebrand seen by his critics as an extremist, wasted no time in proclaiming victory. \"The president must call on the New Popular Front to govern,\" he told supporters in Stalingrad square, insisting Mr Macron had to recognise that he and his coalition had lost. His alliance, drawn up in a hurry for President Macron's surprise election, includes his own radical France Unbowed, along with Greens, Socialists and Communists and even Trotskyists. But their victory is nowhere big enough to govern. France is going to have a hung parliament. None of the three blocs can form an outright majority by themselves of 289 seats in the 577-seat parliament. Live: France faces hung parliament deadlock after left alliance wins most seats As soon as he had spoken, Mr Mélenchon went off to a much bigger square, Place de la République, to celebrate his success with a crowd of 8,000 people, according to police numbers. For National Rally's supporters the champagne was fast turning flat at their celebration-gone-wrong in the Bois de Vincennes forest to the south-east of Paris. Only a week ago all the talk had been of a possible absolute majority, and Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were still talking up their chances a couple of days before the vote. Marine Le Pen put a brave face on it. \"Two years ago we had just seven MPs. Tonight RN is the first party in France in terms of MP numbers.\" In the last parliament they had 88 MPs and now more than 140, so she was right. And no other party has more than 100 MPs, because the Macronists and the Popular Front are both coalitions. Jordan Bardella complained that his party had been foiled by unnatural \"alliances of dishonour\", forged by a \"single party\" made up of the Macron camp and the left. He wasn't wrong about the unnatural alliance, but it is only a temporary one of convenience. Listen: How France's second round unfolded More than 200 candidates who saw themselves as part of a \"republican front\", pulled out of the second round so that a better-placed rival could stop RN winning. Not even Marine Le Pen's younger sister, Marie-Caroline, was able to offer a glimmer of good news from her own election battle around Le Mans. Her bid to get into parliament failed by just 225 votes, defeated by Mr Mélenchon's candidate, Elise Leboucher, after the Macron candidate dropped out. Turnout, at 66.63%, was the highest in a parliamentary second round since 1997. Even if RN's vote held up, this time it was having to contend with non-RN votes often being used tactically to create a \"barrage\" or block against them. All over France, RN was losing run-offs it needed to win. JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER/AFP Marie-Caroline Le Pen was unable to increase her family's representation in parliament Some of their candidates were less than appealing. There was the woman who promised to stop making racist jokes if she was elected in Puy-de-Dôme; and then there was the ill-equipped young man in Haute-Savoie in the south-east who took part in a TV debate with his centrist rival and made barely any sense on anything. They both lost, but they reflected RN's big advance in rural areas. RN scored 32% of the vote - 37% with their right-wing allies - and for more than 10 million voters a taboo has been broken. In Meaux, east of Paris, RN won but not by much. After casting her vote, Claudine said people she knew tended not to admit to voting RN, unless they were with close friends. Claudine voting in Meaux east of Paris, with her dog Zapie Before the projected result at 8pm, there was fevered speculation about whether President Macron would come out and speak. Word spread that he had gone into a meeting 90 minutes earlier. Gabriel Attal, his beleaguered prime minister, eventually appeared to give the government's response. Four weeks ago, he had sat stony-faced and arms folded opposite the president as Mr Macron revealed his election plan. Now he announced he would be handing his boss his resignation in the morning, but he would stay on as long as duty called. Mr Attal is supposed to fly off on Tuesday evening to a Nato meeting in Washington. It's hard to imagine him being replaced just yet. France has entered a period of political instability with no obvious way out. There had been talk of unrest on the streets, but only a handful of incidents were reported in Paris and cities including Nantes and Lyon, All eyes are now on the president, who will have to navigate a way out of this deadlock. The new National Assembly is due to convene in 10 days' time, but the Paris Olympics starts on 26 July and France could do with a period of calm. Left-leaning newspaper Libération summed up the whole night with the headline C'est Ouf . A relief for them that voters brought RN's bid for power to a halt.

The 2019 fire at Notre-Dame in Paris also started during renovation works and destroyed the cathedral's roof, the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Five years on, restoration of the Paris landmark continues and its reopening to worshippers is scheduled for December. As of April this year the renovation had cost 550 million euros ($599 million). Earlier this year a massive fire hit another historic European building, Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange , toppling its spire. Large parts of the outer walls later collapsed.

We have many, many policies so that these accidents don't happen.\" He added he thought a spark from a weld could have fallen onto a plastic cabin interior at the work site. A local official said they were assessing if any parts of the cathedral or its art works had been damaged by the jets of water used to fight the fire. \"It is one of the most beautiful monuments in the city and we hope that there will not be too much damage,\" said Benjamin Gliksman, 42, who owns a record shop. The 2019 fire at Notre-Dame in Paris also started during renovation works and destroyed the cathedral's roof, the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Five years on, restoration of the Paris landmark continues and its reopening to worshippers is scheduled for December. As of April this year the renovation had cost 550 million euros ($599 million). Earlier this year a massive fire hit another historic European building, Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange , toppling its spire. Large parts of the outer walls later collapsed.

Notre politique de confidentialité Ce devait être une fête, un moment de joie populaire à Espinasse-Vozelle près de Vichy, dans l'Allier. Comme chaque année, de nombreux habitants se sont retrouvés pour les festivités du 13 juillet. Au même moment, une famille fête l'anniversaire de l'un d'entre eux à son domicile. Un jeune homme tire sur plusieurs personnes Pour des raisons encore inconnues, un voisin qui ne faisait pas partie des invités de la soirée d'anniversaire, tire alors sur plusieurs personnes. Il en tue 3 et en blesse 4 autres. Les coups de feu auraient été donnés vers 21h30. L'assaillant a été retrouvé mort. Une enquête criminelle de flagrance est diligentée des chefs d'assassinat et tentative d’assassinat, et confiée à la Section de Recherches de Clermont-Ferrand co-saisie avec la Brigade de Recherches de Vichy, indique le parquet de Cusset. Un jeune homme, son père et son parrain tués Le procureur de la République Eric Neveu indique dans un communiqué : \" Les premières constatations après la mise en place d'un important dispositif d'intervention et de sécurisation, mettaient en évidence le cheminement d'un homme de 57 ans, armé d'un fusil, et se déplaçant en ouvrant le feu sur plusieurs centaines de mètres, de son domicile vers celui de voisins qui fêtaient en famille et avec des amis l’anniversaire d'un jeune homme de 20 ans. Le bilan était le suivant à ce stade : 3 personnes atteintes par les tirs étaient retrouvées décédées (le jeune homme de 20 ans et son père, âgé de 53 ans ; le parrain du jeune homme âgé de 54 ans) ; 4 personnes étaient blessées et hospitalisées ; 15 personnes témoins visuels étaient impactées.\" Le maire d'Espinasse-Vozelle Michel Marien participait aux festivités du 14 juillet organisées dans la commune à l’heure du drame .“On a découvert les éléments au fur et à mesure, puisque la première alerte a été donnée autour de 21h30. Le chef de centre des pompiers a été appelé durant la fête communale. C'était l'heure du repas. Il m'a dit “Il se passe quelque chose de grave”, donc je suis parti avec lui. Les gendarmes étaient déjà en nombre et n'étaient pas encore intervenus. Ils essayaient de localiser les faits.” Les habitants mis en sécurité Immédiatement, il met en sécurité les habitants venus pour la fête, car il ignore où se trouve le tireur et s’il peut menacer participants : \"Ce qui était compliqué, c'est de penser qu'il y avait quelqu'un qui pouvait éventuellement être en train de se déplacer dans la commune, armé, et qu'il pouvait potentiellement tirer sur tous les gens qui se déplaçaient. On a sécurisé la fête communale, en essayant d'éviter de semer de la panique en donnant un minimum d'informations. Cela s’est poursuivi jusqu’à environ 1 heure du matin. C’était perturbant avec une ambiance festive d'un côté et puis le drame qui se déroulait à 2 km de là.” Un homme solitaire Michel Marien a pu se faire une idée du déroulé des évènements grâce aux retours des autorités : “Ce que je sais, c'est que le tireur était chez lui. Il y a une fête qui se déroulait au-dessus son domicile. Ce n'est pas un voisin proche de la maison où avait lieu la fête. C’était l'anniversaire des 20 ans du fils. Je pense que ces gens ont dû sortir de chez eux, et c'est là, à l'extérieur, que les choses ont dégénéré, je ne sais pas pourquoi” . Selon lui, le tireur présumé était un homme solitaire : “C'était un monsieur qui vivait seul, que l'on voyait très peu sur la commune. Je ne le connais pas. Il semblerait qu’il avait une carrière militaire et qu’il était un spécialiste des armes.” Une commune sous le choc Désormais, il souhaite accompagner les habitants choqués par les évènements : “Nous allons mettre en place un groupe de parole pour accompagner les gens qui le souhaitent en début d’après-midi. Une cellule psychologique a été ouverte dans la nuit, et a été fermée un peu plus tard dans la nuit. C'était surtout pour accueillir les gens qui qui étaient sur les lieux et qui avaient vécu le drame, pour les accompagner. On souhaite la rouvrir.” Lui-même explique être sous le choc : “ On est loin de penser qu'un jour on va vivre un tel événement”. Très rapidement, d'importants moyens de secours sont déployés. Les pompiers et le Samu prennent en charge les victimes. Le sous-préfet de Vichy se rend sur place. Le lieu de la fête de ce village de 900 habitants est alors sécurisé, les personnes sont mises à l'abri. Le jeune homme qui fêtait son anniversaire et son père sont tués D'après les premiers élements de l'enquête, le jeune homme qui fêtait son anniversaire, son père et l'un de ses invités font partie des personnes tuées. L'auteur des coups de feu est mort On sait que l'auteur de la fusillade est mort. \"L'hypothèse la plus probable\" est que l'assaillant ait \"retourné l'arme contre lui après avoir tiré\", a déclaré le procureur de Moulins dans des propos recueillis par nos confrères de France Info. ⚠️Espinasse-Vozelle.

The 18-year-old suspected neo-Nazi was the administrator of a group on the Telegram phone application called \"French Aryan division\" where he made threats against the July 26-August 11 Paris Olympics , the source said. He was detained in the eastern Bas-Rhin region, which includes the city of Strasbourg, and was being questioned by anti-terror police. French security services are on high alert ahead of the Paris Games when around 10 million visitors and 10,000 athletes are expected in the French capital. In May, they arrested a Chechen teenager suspected of plotting an \"Islamist-inspired\" attack on an Olympics football game in the southeastern city of Saint-Etienne. Le Parisien newspaper, which first reported the arrest of the far-right suspect on Wednesday, said the young man had followers on Telegram who were prepared to mount attacks and had threatened violence against a Paris-based drag queen who took part in the Olympic torch rally at the weekend.

High drama, for sure, but this was a shock. When the graphics flashed up on all the big French channels, it was not the far right of Marine Le Pen and her young prime minister-in-waiting Jordan Bardella who were on course for victory. It was the left who had clinched it, and Emmanuel Macron's centrists - the Ensemble alliance - had staged an unexpected comeback, pushing the far-right National Rally (RN) into third. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the veteran left-wing firebrand seen by his critics as an extremist, wasted no time in proclaiming victory. \"The president must call on the New Popular Front to govern,\" he told supporters in Stalingrad square, insisting Mr Macron had to recognise that he and his coalition had lost. His alliance, drawn up in a hurry for President Macron's surprise election, includes his own radical France Unbowed, along with Greens, Socialists and Communists and even Trotskyists. But their victory is nowhere big enough to govern. France is going to have a hung parliament. None of the three blocs can form an outright majority by themselves of 289 seats in the 577-seat parliament. Live: France faces hung parliament deadlock after left alliance wins most seats As soon as he had spoken, Mr Mélenchon went off to a much bigger square, Place de la République, to celebrate his success with a crowd of 8,000 people, according to police numbers. For National Rally's supporters the champagne was fast turning flat at their celebration-gone-wrong in the Bois de Vincennes forest to the south-east of Paris. Only a week ago all the talk had been of a possible absolute majority, and Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were still talking up their chances a couple of days before the vote. Marine Le Pen put a brave face on it. \"Two years ago we had just seven MPs. Tonight RN is the first party in France in terms of MP numbers.\" In the last parliament they had 88 MPs and now more than 140, so she was right. And no other party has more than 100 MPs, because the Macronists and the Popular Front are both coalitions. Jordan Bardella complained that his party had been foiled by unnatural \"alliances of dishonour\", forged by a \"single party\" made up of the Macron camp and the left. He wasn't wrong about the unnatural alliance, but it is only a temporary one of convenience. Listen: How France's second round unfolded More than 200 candidates who saw themselves as part of a \"republican front\", pulled out of the second round so that a better-placed rival could stop RN winning. Not even Marine Le Pen's younger sister, Marie-Caroline, was able to offer a glimmer of good news from her own election battle around Le Mans. Her bid to get into parliament failed by just 225 votes, defeated by Mr Mélenchon's candidate, Elise Leboucher, after the Macron candidate dropped out. Turnout, at 66.63%, was the highest in a parliamentary second round since 1997. Even if RN's vote held up, this time it was having to contend with non-RN votes often being used tactically to create a \"barrage\" or block against them. All over France, RN was losing run-offs it needed to win. JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER/AFP Marie-Caroline Le Pen was unable to increase her family's representation in parliament Some of their candidates were less than appealing. There was the woman who promised to stop making racist jokes if she was elected in Puy-de-Dôme; and then there was the ill-equipped young man in Haute-Savoie in the south-east who took part in a TV debate with his centrist rival and made barely any sense on anything. They both lost, but they reflected RN's big advance in rural areas. RN scored 32% of the vote - 37% with their right-wing allies - and for more than 10 million voters a taboo has been broken. In Meaux, east of Paris, RN won but not by much. After casting her vote, Claudine said people she knew tended not to admit to voting RN, unless they were with close friends. Claudine voting in Meaux east of Paris, with her dog Zapie Before the projected result at 8pm, there was fevered speculation about whether President Macron would come out and speak. Word spread that he had gone into a meeting 90 minutes earlier. Gabriel Attal, his beleaguered prime minister, eventually appeared to give the government's response. Four weeks ago, he had sat stony-faced and arms folded opposite the president as Mr Macron revealed his election plan. Now he announced he would be handing his boss his resignation in the morning, but he would stay on as long as duty called. Mr Attal is supposed to fly off on Tuesday evening to a Nato meeting in Washington. It's hard to imagine him being replaced just yet. France has entered a period of political instability with no obvious way out. There had been talk of unrest on the streets, but only a handful of incidents were reported in Paris and cities including Nantes and Lyon, All eyes are now on the president, who will have to navigate a way out of this deadlock. The new National Assembly is due to convene in 10 days' time, but the Paris Olympics starts on 26 July and France could do with a period of calm. Left-leaning newspaper Libération summed up the whole night with the headline C'est Ouf . A relief for them that voters brought RN's bid for power to a halt. But it also means in colloquial French: \"It's crazy.\" Europe France Emmanuel Macron Marine Le Pen",

The local prosecutor said officials were investigating the blaze as a potential arson attack. Flames engulfed the upper floors of an apartment block in the Moulins area of Nice,  close to the city's airport. The mayor of Nice said they had images that clearly showed the fire had been caused by petrol poured into a stairwell by hooded people during the night. Visiting the scene later, caretaker Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said three people were being sought by police. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said three young children were among the victims and that police would \"shed light on the circumstances of this terrible tragedy\". The fire broke out on second floor and spread quickly to the upper floors. Nice prosecutor Damien Martinelli told journalists that in light of initial findings, \"I have opened an inquiry into acts of arson as the cause of death.\" Local reports said the seven victims were all part of the same family. Officials said three adults, a teenager and younger children aged five, seven and 10 had died. Two members of the family are said to have tried to escape through a window - one died and the other is in a critical condition. Prefect Hugues Moutouh said everyone had been affected by the tragedy and \"very determined to provide help and assistance to the survivors\". One man called Iftahou told the Nice Matin website that he had arrived at the scene while the fire was burning and realised there was no hope for those inside. The head of the Comorian community in the south of France, Najim Maecha, said he knew the family and that they had lived in Nice since about 2013. Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said the human toll of the disaster was extremely high. As well as the seven victims, another 30 people have suffered smoke inhalation. \"I've asked the interior minister to deploy security forces to ensure residents' safety and avoid new incidents after this tragedy that's being investigated as potential arson,\" he said. President Emmanuel Macron, on a visit to the UK, said \"our thoughts are with the victims' relatives. We are on their side and on the side of the people of Nice\". France Nice",

Paris police chief Laurent Nunez said the attack did not appear linked to the Olympics and no terrorist motive was suspected. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin posted on X that the attack happened in the 8th arrondissement of Paris while police were “responding to a call from officers securing a store.” Security agents at the flagship Louis Vuitton store on the Champs-Elysees contacted police after noticing “suspicious behavior” by a man outside the store, according to a police official. Speaking in front of the Louis Vuitton store after the stabbing, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez said the assailant ‘’pulled out a knife and threatened them (the officers), tried to stab them multiple times and succeeded in stabbing.’' He defended the police response as “totally proportionate. They were facing an assailant who was threatening their lives.” RELATED COVERAGE Simone Biles, Mondo Duplantis and Real Madrid win Laureus sports awards Iran seeks Russia’s support for its nuclear talks with US Rubio and Witkoff met Ukrainian and European officials for landmark talks on Ukraine’s future The suspect died of his injuries after being shot, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. An investigation was opened into attempted murder of a police officer, the prosecutor’s office said. The police officer was hospitalized but not in life-threatening condition. The area was thronging with tourists and Parisians when the attack happened around the corner from the Louis Vuitton boutique. Some took photos as police cordoned off the area, while others continued their dining in nearby sidewalk cafes. Associated Press journalists saw police reinforcements rushing in after the stabbing. At a luxury hotel nearby, guests arriving in a taxi had to pass under police tape to enter their hotel, as a porter wheeled their baggage under the cordon. The Louis Vuitton store often has long lines outside and is among the biggest draws on an avenue packed with luxury boutiques. Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH did not comment on what happened. Thursday’s knife attack comes just days after a man stabbed and wounded a French soldier patrolling Paris on Monday outside the Gare de l’Est train station in eastern Paris. The man was taken to a psychiatric hospital, according to French prosecutors. France is under its highest security alert before the start of the Paris Games on July 26. Paris police imposed strict new security measures in the center of town starting Thursday to prepare for the exceptional opening ceremony, which will be held in the open all along the Seine River instead of in a closed stadium. Darmanin is staying on in a caretaker role at the interior ministry until a new government is formed in the wake of a legislative election earlier this month. ___ Angela Charlton, David Goldman and Kwiyeon Ha in Paris contributed to this report.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach also visited the Village to the north of the French capital, where thousands of athletes and officials are arriving, with up to 14,500 expected there at the peak of the Games. Comprising 40 different low-rise housing blocks, the complex has been built by employing innovative construction techniques using low-carbon concrete, water recycling and reclaimed building materials. It was also intended to be free of air-conditioning with a natural cooling system, but some Olympic delegations are unconvinced and have ordered around 2,500 portable cooling units for their athletes. Seine-Saint-Denis, where the main athletics stadium for the Olympics is also situated, is the poorest area in France and is hoping to reap benefits from the sports extravaganza. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach speaks to IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior at the Athletes' Village. © David Goldman, AFP Macron promised the area would not be forgotten after the Olympics. \"I will come back after the Games to see the legacy with you and to see how life has changed,\" he said. Israelis 'welcome' Meanwhile, France's foreign minister said Israeli athletes were welcome at the Paris Games after a hard-left member of the French parliament sparked outrage by urging them to stay away because of the conflict in Gaza. \"The Israeli delegation is welcome in France,\" Stephane Sejourne said in Brussels ahead of talks with his Israeli counterpart, adding that the call by France Unbowed (LFI) lawmaker Thomas Portes for the country's exclusion had been \"irresponsible and dangerous\". \"We will ensure the security of the delegation,\" Sejourne added. Portes drew an angry response from French Jewish groups and both political opponents and allies. Yonathan Arfi, head of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (Crif), said the comments were \"putting a target on the backs of Israeli athletes\". Arfi said Israeli athletes were \"already the most in danger at the Olympic Games \", recalling the 11 \"murdered by Palestinian terrorists\" at the 1972 Munich Games. Meanwhile, French security forces were continuing preparations for the unprecedented opening ceremony on Friday, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium. Between 6,000 and 7,000 athletes are to sail down the river on 85 barges and boats, with a backdrop of world-famous monuments including Notre-Dame cathedral, currently being renovated after a devastating fire in 2019. The athletes will disembark for the culmination of a ceremony at the Trocadero opposite the Eiffel Tower that organisers promise will be spectacular. Up to 300,000 ticketed spectators will watch from stands and on the river banks and another 200,000 are expected to watch from the overlooking apartments.

The president’s office said in a statement that Macron “accepted” the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and other ministers on Tuesday. Attal and other government members are “to handle current affairs until a new government is being appointed,” the statement said. There is no firm timeline for when Macron must name a new prime minister, following parliamentary elections this month that left the National Assembly with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France’s modern Republic. The caretaker government led by Attal will focus only on handling day-to-day affairs. “For this period to end as quickly as possible, it is up to all Republican forces to work together” around “projects and actions that serve the French people,” the president’s statement said. The opening session of the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is scheduled for Thursday. RELATED COVERAGE Trump says Ukraine-Russia talks ‘coming to a head’ and ‘no one is playing’ him in push to end war France’s president says that making Haiti pay for its independence was unjust Rubio and Witkoff met Ukrainian and European officials for landmark talks on Ukraine’s future Normally, members of government are barred from being lawmakers, but Tuesday’s move allows Attal to take up his seat as a lawmaker and lead the group of Macron’s centrist allies in the National Assembly. It also insulates him from a no-confidence vote, because he already has resigned and a caretaker government cannot be subject to such a vote. France has been on the brink of government paralysis since elections for the National Assembly earlier this month resulted in a split among three major political groupings: the New Popular Front leftist coalition, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. The New Popular Front won the most seats but fell well short of the outright majority needed to govern on its own. The leftist coalition’s three main parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, the Socialists and the Greens, have urged the president to turn to them to form the new government, yet their internal talks have turned into a harsh dispute over whom to choose as prime minister. France Unbowed suspended the talks on Monday, accusing the Socialists of sabotaging candidacies they have put forward to replace Attal. Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure said Tuesday the leftist coalition needs “to think, talk and resume discussions” if it wants to meet “the expectation of the public” and fulfill its promise that it “is ready to govern.” Faure acknowledged that lengthy discussions, public bickering and occasional angry verbal exchanges among the coalition’s party leaders are “not a good look.” But “the stakes are so high that it’s not unusual for us to talk for a long time and that sometimes, we yell,” Faure said on France Inter radio. National Rally vice president Sebastien Chenu said the quarreling on the left is a sign that the New Popular Front “is not ready to govern.” He also lashed out at Macron on Tuesday, saying the retention of Attal at the helm of government following two recent elections — for the European Parliament and the National Assembly -- was “a denial of democracy.” Keeping him on to manage “current affairs” amounts to “failing” the French people, Chenu said in an interview with Europe 1 and CNews broadcasters. “We cannot make something new out of something old,” Chenu said. “Attal must pack his bags, he and all his ministers.” Politicians from the three main groups are also waging a battle over the presidency and key committees in the National Assembly, France’s influential lower house of parliament. Manuel Bompard, a lawmaker of the France Unbowed said he supported the idea of blocking lawmakers from Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally from holding leading positions in the parliament’s committees, such as finance, defense and others. Despite Le Pen’s party finishing third in the elections, behind Macron’s group of centrists and the leftist alliance, Bompard said in an interview with France 2 TV that there is “no reason for us to help them access positions of responsibility.” Le Pen, a leading figure in the French far right and a National Rally lawmaker, insisted that “all political forces must participate in the functioning” of the parliament. “The people have spoken. There are 577 lawmakers who represent them,” Le Pen said in a post on X. “Even if I am the last one to defend democracy, I insist that the Macronists, the New Popular Front, the National Rally and Eric Ciotti (a National Rally ally) must be represented in the legislative body,” she added. ___ Surk reported from Nice, France. ___ Follow AP’s global election coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/ and AP’s Paris Olympics coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games SYLVIE CORBET Corbet is an Associated Press reporter based in Paris.

The man, born in 1984, was held in custody and placed under judicial investigation on suspicion of “organising events likely to lead to destabilisation during the Olympic Games”, a source in the state prosecution service, who asked not to be named, told AFP. The source said an investigation was opened into “passing intelligence to a foreign power in order to arouse hostilities in France”, adding that the crime was punishable by up to 30 years in jail. Prosecutors said a visit to the man’s home “at the request of the interior ministry” had uncovered evidence of the suspected plans. They did not give any details of the alleged plot, except to say that it was not terrorist in nature, and that specialist anti-terrorist prosecutors were not following the case. Authorities have investigated over a million people, including athletes, coaches, journalists, volunteers, security guards and even local residents near event locations ahead of the Olympics, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told weekly Paris Match on Tuesday. Of those, 4,360 were denied access to the Games, with people close to Darmanin telling AFP on Sunday that 880 were barred over suspicions of foreign interference. In recent months, several high-profile stunts have raised suspicion that foreign actors are trying to influence French public opinion or stoke divisions, notably about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or Israel’s campaign in Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas . They include dummy coffins labelled “French soldiers in Ukraine” left by the Eiffel Tower in June and red hands tagged on Paris’s main Holocaust memorial in May. In October, soon after Hamas’s attack, stars of David were tagged on buildings in the Paris region, with two Moldovans suspected to be working for the Russian FSB security service later arrested.

        "text": "French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal calls attacks ‘acts of sabotage’, says they were ‘prepared and coordinated’. French rail hit by ‘massive attack’ as Olympics begin France’s high-speed TGV rail network has been hit by “malicious acts”, disrupting some of the nation’s busiest lines on the day of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony . “Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities,” state-owned railway operator SNCF said on Friday, adding that the “simultaneous malicious acts” had taken place overnight. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X that France’s intelligence services have been mobilised to find the perpetrators as he characterised the attacks as “acts of sabotage” that were “prepared and coordinated”. Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete called the “massive attack” against the rail network an “outrageous criminal act”. He described people fleeing from the scene of fires and the discovery of incendiary devices at the sites. SNCF said many routes would have to be cancelled “at least all weekend while repairs are conducted” as thousands of rail staff were deployed to repair the damage. CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou said about 800,000 customers had been impacted ahead of a busy weekend for holidaymakers. Arsonists had targeted installations along the lines connecting the capital, Paris, with the country’s west, north and east. The southeastern line was not affected as “a malicious act was foiled”, the railway operator said. It urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations. Trains to neighbouring Belgium and to London under the English Channel were also affected. The attacks occurred against a backdrop of global tensions and heightened security measures as the city prepared for the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics on Friday, an event featuring 7,500 athletes, 300,000 spectators and an audience of VIPs. Reporting from Paris, Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith said: “Security was always a concern at these Olympics, and here you see why.” The apparently coordinated attacks were “a clear indication of the enormous security challenges France is facing”, he said. National police said authorities are investigating what happened. “It’s completely appalling,” Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera told BFMTV. “To target the games is to target France.” “These games are for the athletes who have been dreaming of them for years and fighting for the holy grail of standing on the podium – and someone’s sabotaging that for them,” she said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also weighed in, saying he absolutely condemned the saboteurs and hoped for the quick identification of the perpetrators. “It is unacceptable to disrupt a celebration of peace like the Olympic Games with acts of violence. I hope that the French authorities soon identify the culprits,” he said in a post on X. More than 45,000 police officers, 10,000 soldiers and 2,000 private security agents are being deployed for the opening ceremony with snipers on rooftops and drones keeping watch from the air. Smith said “an unprecedented security operation” was in place. A large area along the Seine has been locked down for the ceremony, which will go along 6km (3.7 miles) of the river and will be “watched by more than 100 global leaders from countries across the world”, he said. It was not immediately clear whether the arson attacks were linked to the international sports event. Smith highlighted the tense geopolitical backdrop against which the games are taking place with Israel continuing its war in Gaza and Russia making territorial gains in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron had called for an “Olympic truce” during a meeting with Xi Jinping when the Chinese president visited France in May. Given the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, there is not much hope for such a truce, Smith said. On the contrary, the event has attracted accusations of double standards given that Russian and Belarusian athletes were banned from participating under their countries’ flags but Israel was still allowed to take part with 88 athletes. “The Palestine Olympic Committee called for Israel to be blocked … because of the war in Gaza, but those calls have fallen on deaf ears,” Smith said.

The International Olympic Committee announced that Salt Lake City was selected to host the 2034 Winter Olympics. This will be Utah's second Olympic Games after hosting the 2022 Olympics. Salt Lake City was the only city in consideration for the 2034 Games. Climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. Salt Lake City was formally awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics following a Wednesday vote by the International Olympic Committee in Paris, which gives Utah its second Games after hosting in 2002. A watch party was planned at 3 a.m. local time — 11 a.m. in Paris — to celebrate the announcement. Large crowds were expected at the event that coincides with a state holiday marking the date Mormon pioneers discovered the Salt Lake Valley in northern Utah . Olympic fanatics were already starting to gather downtown and pitch tents before sunset Tuesday. Salt Lake City was the lone contender the Olympic committee was considering for 2034. Climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. Utah has capitalized on low interest elsewhere, pitching itself to Olympic officials as an enthusiastic repeat host if the committee goes forward with a proposed permanent rotation of Winter Olympic cities. Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi had said Salt Lake City would be a prime candidate for such a plan. CANADA WOMEN'S SOCCER DRONE INCIDENT SPARKS CONTROVERSY AHEAD OF PARIS OLYMPICS Local leaders had their sights set on hosting multiple times even before Salt Lake City welcomed its first Games, bid team spokesperson Tom Kelly said. Remnants of the 2002 Games are nestled throughout the city and have kept the Olympic fever alive for more than two decades. Organizers of the 2034 Games touted that enduring enthusiasm throughout the selection process and showed visiting Olympic officials how they have preserved the venues used in 2002.

The plan requires no new permanent construction, with all 13 venues already in place and each having played a role when the city first hosted. For Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, securing the bid was central to his goal of cementing the state as North America’s winter sports capital. He and other local leaders were in Paris for the bid presentation, while many winter Olympians stayed in town to train and join in the festivities.

Lillis has been training at nearby Utah Olympic Park and said the sports facilities in the area are \"top notch.\" Matthew Lindon, a 45-year resident of the ski resort community of Park City, Utah, where many events would be held, said the city has expanded considerably since he arrived. \"With the 2002 Olympics, the motto was, ‘The world is welcome here.’ And really what happened was we brought Utah to the world, and now we’re a world-class destination skiing resort,\" he said.

The triathlon is the first Olympic event due to be held in the Seine , before marathon swimming in the second week of the Games. A swimming training session slated for Sunday was also cancelled due to the pollution levels . The men's individual triathlon is scheduled to start on Tuesday at 8:00 am (06000 GMT), with the women's individual event to be held on Wednesday. The quality of the Seine's water is dependent on the amount of rain that falls in and around Paris. Heavy downpours of the sort seen on Friday during the sodden opening ceremony of the Games overwhelm the city's sewage system, leading to discharges of untreated effluent into the waterway. The Paris 2024 organisers and World Triathlon, however, said they were \"confident\" that water quality would improve sufficiently before the start of competition on Tuesday, taking into account the weather forecast for the next 48 hours. After downpours on Friday and Saturday, the sun has returned to the French capital since Sunday morning.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - The leftist France Unbowed party announced legislative steps on Tuesday to try to scrap French President Emmanuel Macron's pension changes and reverse a rise in the legal retirement age to 64 from 62. The right-wing National Rally (RN) quickly offered its support for the legislation proposed by France Unbowed (LFI), potentially boosting its chances of winning parliamentary approval. Sign up here. Cancelling the pension reform, signed into law last year and aimed at protecting state finances and boosting productivity, is a key goal of the left-wing camp that emerged last month as the strongest parliamentary force after a snap election . But the left-wing camp fell short of a majority in the election, leaving it dependent on the support of other lawmakers to push through any new legislation. \"We will, today, put down a legal proposition to cancel the pension reforms,\" Mathilde Panot, who heads the group of LFI lawmakers in the National Assembly, told France Inter radio. Macron's decision to use special constitutional powers to increase the retirement age and scrap some beneficial rules for certain job categories resulted in violent street protests last year. Marine Le Pen's RN also campaigned on lowering the retirement age, while Macron's centrist bloc and other centre-right politicians said they would oppose such a move. \"This bill won't pass without the votes of the Rassemblement National. And, in sticking to our programme, we'll be voting for it,\" RN party spokesman and lawmaker Laurent Jacobelli told BFM TV. \"Your bill will pass thanks to us...and you'll have to say it loud and clear,\" he said. Members of the left-wing coalition could, however, face a difficult decision. While left-wing parties have said many times they are united in their determination to reduce the retirement age, LFI's partners in the New Popular Front coalition - which includes the Socialists, Greens and Communists - might shy away from a vote that can pass only with the backing of their right-wing nemesis. The bill, which is unlikely to be voted on before September, would not pass if with only the support of LFI and RN lawmakers. France is in a state of parliamentary deadlock since Macron's decision to call the election, with the current government likely to carry out its functions throughout the summer in a caretaker capacity.

This came after President Emmanuel Macron offered support for a plan for autonomy in the Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty.

Issued on: 30/07/2024 - 16:58 Modified: 30/07/2024 - 18:42 4 min A Moroccan flag in the Western Sahara desert, in a file photo taken on 23 November 2020. AFP - FADEL SENNA By: Melissa Chemam with RFI Advertising Read more France has acknowledged Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara, marking a significant shift in its long-standing position. Meanwhile, the United Nations-mediated peace process remains at a standstill. In a letter to Morocco's King Mohammed VI, President Macron stated, \"For France, autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the framework within which this issue must be resolved.\" He added, \"Our support for the autonomy plan proposed by Morocco in 2007 is clear and unwavering. For France, this plan now represents the only basis for reaching a just, lasting, and negotiated political solution in line with United Nations Security Council resolutions. According to a statement from the Moroccan Royal Cabinet, the French president sent this letter to Mohammed VI on the occasion of the Throne Day which marks the arrival in power of Mohammed VI , in 1999. The Royal Palace in the statement welcomed the announcement and said it was a \"significant development in support of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara.\" Algeria said a few hours later that it is recalling its ambassador to France over Western Sahara rift. \"The Algerian diplomatic representation in France is now the responsibility of a charge d'affaires,\" the Algerian foreign ministry was quoted as saying by the official Algerian news agency APS. The ministry denounced Macron's statement as a \"step that no other French government had taken before.\" Disputed territory The distue originated in 1975 between and involves Morocco ,, which claims the Western Sahara as its territory, and the Polisario Front, backed by Algeria, which advocates for the region's independence. France, as the latest former colonial power in the region has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Rabat and Algiers on the issue, but recently sent good signals to Morocco. France reiterates its support for Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara Most of France's Western allies already back Morocco's plan. Spain, which colonised Western Sahara for decades, publicly recognised the plan for Western Sahara put forward by Morocco in March 2022. Demonstrators wave Western Sahara flags during a protest against the Spanish government support for Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara, in Madrid, on March 26, 2022. © Pierre-Philippe MARCOU / AFP For Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the DAWN think tank (Democracy for the Arab World Now), the recognition by France of Morocco's annexation on Western Sahara undermines the rule of law, not only in North Africa but all over the world, including in Ukraine. \"The only way to resolve the conflict and territorial dispute would be the promised referendum,\" she told RFI English. \"The annexation of Western Sahara is as illegal as the one of Crimea in Ukraine, or the annexation of Jerusalem by Israel. So, any decision from French President Macron to side with Rabat would cause harm with global implications,\" she added. \"This recognition will only encourage the impunity of regimes like Russia and Israel. If even France must fall in line behind US diktat on Western Sahara, France’s own sovereignty has taken a hit.” She thinks that Macron should have ignored the pressure from Morocco, as the country has no major leverage on France. Historical colonial dispute Western Sahara has for long been designated by the UN as a \"non-self-governing territory\" whose people \"have not yet attained a full measure of self-government\". An armed conflict has opposed Morocco to the Sahrawi separatists of the Polisario Front in this vast desert territory bordering the Atlantic since 1975. Polisario has been supported by Algeria , to where most Sahrawi refugees have fled. Sahrawi refugees in Algeria's camps © UNHCR Morocco controls 80 percent of the territory, while an area bordering Mauritania that is almost totally landlocked is run by the Polisario Front. Morocco's interest in the land is in its fish-filled waters and significant phosphate reserves, but also and mostly on its historical claim regarding its  sovereignty over parts of the Sahara desert. The territorial dispute dates back to colonial times, when Spain ruled over the actual Western Sahara and parts of Morocco, while France held the rest of North Africa including today's Algeria and Tunisia. Extension of UN mandate in Western Sahara: the status quo or agreement in sight? In its most recent report , the international Crisis Group said it regretted teh fact that the UN had not been able to bring all actors to the table and to find a peaceful, negotiated and democratic solution for the future of what the Polisario calls the last colonised part of Africa.

It included a ceasefire, a buffer zone that divided Western Sahara along the sand berm and provisions for a referendum on self-determination for the entire territory.

Sven Hoppe/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images CNN — The men’s individual triathlon race at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has been postponed due to poor water quality levels in the River Seine, the sport’s governing body, World Triathlon, announced on Monday. Originally scheduled for Tuesday, World Triathlon, its medical team, the International Olympic Committee and Paris city officials made the decision to postpone the men’s race to Wednesday. “Paris 2024 and World Triathlon reiterate that their priority is the health of the athletes. The tests carried out in Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held,” the press release said. “Despite the improvement on the water quality levels in the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable limits.” CNN video Related video CNN meteorologist explains how extreme weather might affect the Olympics Heavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday’s opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall. Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday’s race would go ahead as planned. French triathlon federation technical director Benjamin Maze told French media on Tuesday that “there was a bit of anger and disappointment on the part of the triathletes,” as they found out today’s event had been canceled. “The events were supposed to take place at 8 a.m., so when we heard the news, they were already at breakfast eating some rice. Well, the pre-race meal as usual,” Maze told French network TF1. “In this kind of situation, you have to, you have to accept your emotions. Once again, this disappointment, this anger and then to leave in a resilient mood, to leave in a much more positive mood. In any case, that’s what we encouraged them to do,” he added. Maze said that that athletes are naturally “disappointed” by the developments since they have been preparing for this moment for years but added that it’s all part of the job. “They know that they are doing an outdoor sport, even more so in triathlon. We knew that we had had problems with water pollution in recent days,” he said.

Michel Euler/AP The best photos of the Paris Olympics Prev Next The decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world’s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024. About $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river’s water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine. One of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin – called the Austerlitz basin – which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Following rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris. But the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 – following rain the previous day – E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin. That’s double the level needed for “good” water quality, as per World Triathlon standards . For much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules , unless the organization’s medical committee decides the race can go ahead. The individual triathlon races will begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race – passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-Élysées – before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes – two men and two women – will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. The women’s triathlon is still scheduled for Wednesday and will take place prior to the men’s race, according to Olympic officials. If the water levels don’t improve by Wednesday, the original contingency date remains in place for Friday, August 2.",

The widely anticipated deal will see Serbia receive nine single-seat and three two-seat jets by 2029 for an undisclosed sum, according to Dassault chief executive Eric Trappier. The dozen multi-role fighter aircrafts will help Serbia modernize its air force and replace aging Soviet-era combat jets. \"We are happy to become part of the Rafale club.

Macron said the deal pointed to a \"long-term alliance between our two countries within a stronger and more sovereign Europe.\" The Rafale is a \"multi-role\" fighter that can be used to hunt enemy planes, strike ground and sea targets and carry out reconnaissance. The deal was just one of several agreements inked during Macron's visit.

The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Durov had arrived from Baku, in Azerbaijan , another source close to the case said. France 's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud , drug trafficking , cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism , one of the sources said. Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. \"Enough of Telegram's impunity,\" said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. France ‘refusing to cooperate’, says Russia The Russian embassy in Paris on Sunday accused French authorities of \"refusing to cooperate\" after Durov’s arrest. \"We immediately asked French authorities to explain the reasons for this detention and demanded that his rights be protected and that consular access be granted. Up to now, the French side is refusing to cooperate on this question,\" the embassy said in a statement reported by Ria Novosti news agency. Responding to the news of Durov’s arrest, Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president on Sunday said Telegram’s founder had “miscalculated” by fleeing Russia and thinking that he would never have to cooperate with the security services abroad. Medvedev related a conversation he had with Durov several years ago in which Medvedev told him that if he did not want to cooperate with law enforcement agencies,  he would have problems in any country. Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Durov wanted to be a 'brilliant \"man of the world who lives wonderfully without a Motherland\". \"He miscalculated,\" Medvedev said. \"For all our common enemies now, he is Russian – and therefore unpredictable and dangerous.\" Platform of 'privacy' The encrypted messaging app, based in Dubai , has positioned itself as an alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data. Telegram has committed to never disclosing any information about its users. In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said he got the idea to launch an encrypted messaging app after coming under pressure from the Russian government when working at VK, a social network he created before selling it and leaving Russia in 2014. He said he then tried to settle in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco before choosing Dubai, which he praised for its business environment and \"neutrality\". People \"love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram\", Durov told Carlson. He said at the time that the platform had more than 900 million active users. By basing itself in the United Arab Emirates , Telegram has been able to shield itself from moderation laws at a time when Western countries are pressuring large platforms to remove illegal content. Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally, as well as for users to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content. Competitor messaging service WhatsApp introduced worldwide limits on message forwarding in 2019 after it was accused of enabling the spread of false information in India that led to lynchings.

The LFI, a hard-left party within the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance that won the most seats in a snap parliamentary election this summer, called for a mass protest against Macron on Sept. 7. NFP leaders have repeatedly asserted that France's next prime minister should come from their ranks, but Macron has ignored their claims. Macron, a pro-business centrist, thinks the balance of power lies more with the centre or centre-right.

It was not the usual sonic boom of a fighter jet breaking the sound barrier, he said. “It was a strange noise, a percussive sound”. “I assumed that two planes had collided, but we didn’t believe it,” he said, adding that a road bordering a nearby forest had been cordoned off. In December 2007, a Rafale jet crashed near Neuvic in southwestern France. Investigators concluded that the pilot had become disoriented. That was believed to be the first crash of a Rafale.

Most of the victims were believed to be women, some under 18, and many of the passengers didn’t have life preservers, officials said, with one calling it the deadliest migrant accident in the channel this year. “Unfortunately, the bottom of the boat ripped open,” said Olivier Barbarin, mayor of Le Portel near Boulogne-sur-Mer, where a first aid post was set up to treat victims. “If people don’t know how to swim in the agitated waters ... it can go very quickly.” Europe’s increasingly strict asylum rules , growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants have been pushing them north. Before Tuesday’s accident, at least 30 migrants had died or gone missing while trying to cross to the U.K. this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. Rescuers pulled a total of 65 people from the English Channel on Tuesday in a search that lasted more than four hours, according to Lt. Etienne Baggio, a spokesman for the French agency that oversees the stretch of sea where the boat ripped apart. Doctors confirmed 12 died, he said.

Adam Beernaert, director of the Civil Protection authority, whose personnel looks after rescued migrants once they reach land, said the people his team attended Tuesday were traumatized. “What needs to be said is that they shouldn’t cross,” Beernaert told the AP. “The sea is not easy. Weather conditions change all the time.” Baggio called it the deadliest migrant boat tragedy in the English Channel this year. In July, four migrants died while attempting the crossing on an inflatable boat that capsized and punctured. Five others, including a child, died in another attempt in April. And five dead were recovered from the seas or found washed up along a beach after a migrant boat ran into difficulties in the dark and winter cold of January. Many of those aboard the vessel that broke up in the English Channel on Tuesday didn’t have life vests, Baggio said. He said the boat was an inflatable. Three helicopters, a plane, two fishing boats and more than six other vessels were involved in the rescue operation. In another sea tragedy Tuesday involving migrants seeking a better life in Europe, a boat carrying migrants capsized in the Mediterranean off the Libyan coast, leaving one person dead and 22 missing, Libyan authorities said. The agency overseeing the rescue operation in the English Channel said the boat got into difficulty off Gris-Nez point between Boulogne-sur-Mer and the port of Calais further north. Sea temperatures off northern France were around 20 degrees C, or about 68 F. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin went to Boulogne-sur-Mer to meet those involved in handling what he described as the “terrible shipwreck.” He said the boat was frail and small — less than 7 meters (23 feet) long — and that smugglers are packing more and more people aboard such vessels. Most of the people on the boat were believed to be from Eritrea, and most of the victims were women, he said. Last week, the leaders of France and the U.K. agreed to deepen cooperation on illegal migration in the channel. “We absolutely must — and this is a very important point — re-establish special relations with our British friends,” Darmanin said on Tuesday. He later told the AP that to successfully tackle smuggling networks, immigration legislation between the U.K. and France should be harmonized. “It has now been 30 years that these problems remain, and it is absolutely necessary that we find solutions,” said Barbarin, the mayor of Le Portel. U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called it “a horrifying and deeply tragic incident” and paid tribute to French rescuers “who undoubtedly saved many lives, but sadly could not save everyone.” “The gangs behind this appalling and callous trade in human lives have been cramming more and more people onto increasingly unseaworthy dinghies, and sending them out into the Channel even in very poor weather,” she said. “They do not care about anything but the profits they make, and that is why — as well as mourning the awful loss of life — the work to dismantle these dangerous and criminal smuggler gangs and to strengthen border security is so vital and must proceed apace.” At least 2,109 migrants have tried to cross the English Channel on small boats in the past seven days, according to U.K. Home Office data updated Tuesday. The data includes people found in the channel or on arrival. ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed. ___ Follow AP coverage of migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

        "text": "French police arrest synagogue blast suspect 25 August 2024 Share Save Malu Cursino & Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save Getty Images CCTV showed a suspected attacker at the synagogue in La Grande-Motte French police say they have arrested a man suspected of setting fires and causing an explosion outside a synagogue in a southern resort. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said \"the alleged perpetrator\" was detained on Saturday. He added that the police had shown \"great professionalism\". French media reported that the suspect was shot and injured by police after he opened fire on the officers who came to arrest him in the city of Nîmes. Earlier on Saturday, a police officer was injured in the blast outside the Beth Yaacov synagogue in the nearby seaside resort of La Grande-Motte. The police officer's injuries are not said to be life-threatening, following the blast between 08:00 and 08:30 local time (07:00-07:30 BST) on Saturday. Five people, including the rabbi, were inside the synagogue at the time, authorities said. The explosion was caused by two cars which were set alight outside Police sources told French media that one of the vehicles contained a hidden gas canister. The suspect - who was seen on CCTV with what French media said was a Palestinian flag around his waist - also set fire to several entrance doors of the synagogue. Jewish community leader Yonathan Arfi said the incident was \"an attempt to kill Jews\" and seemed to have been timed to target Saturday morning worshippers. President Emmanuel Macron said the incident was \"a terrorist act\". One eyewitness, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC: \"Just as we were coming round the last corner, there was a huge explosion - a fireball into the air. \"It was surreal, like a film. We didn’t go any further.\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Mr Darmanin visited the site on Saturday evening. Both had earlier condemned the attack, with Mr Attal calling it \"an antisemitic act\". \"What happened here shocks and scandalises all Republicans in our country,\" Mr Attat said during the visit. \"Because the reality is that once again, French Jews have been targeted, attacked because of their beliefs.\" Mr Attal said an \"absolute tragedy\" had been \"narrowly avoided\" as \"there would have been victims\" if the synagogue had been full of worshippers. Both Mr Attal and Mr Darmanin said security would be strengthened outside synagogues. \"I want to assure our Jewish fellow citizens and the municipality of my full support,\" Mr Darmanin said earlier in the day. \"Absolute tragedy\" avoided in France synagogue attack, says PM The French Jewish community already live under high security, with many synagogues and Jewish schools under police protection. A January 2024 report by the Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) said there had been a nearly threefold increase of antisemitic acts in France between 2022 and 2023. In May, police shot dead a man after a synagogue in the north-western city of Rouen was set on fire . In 2015, two days after the attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, four people were murdered in a hostage attack on a kosher supermarket. The explosion comes amid heightened concerns for Europe's Jewish community, after the latest survey from the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) published last month found that Jewish people in the bloc continue to face high levels of antisemitism . More than 8,000 Jews in 13 EU countries, including Germany and France, were interviewed. Some 96% said they had encountered antisemitism in their daily lives. There has been widespread condemnation of the attempted arson attack across France's political spectrum. Left-wing politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon called it an \"intolerable crime\", while the far-right National Rally's Jordan Bardella said it was \"a criminal and antisemitic act\". France",

Macron named 73-year-old Barnier , a conservative and the former Brexit negotiator for the European Union, as prime minister on Thursday, capping a two-month search following his ill-fated decision to call a legislative election that delivered a hung parliament. Sign up here. \"Democracy is not only the art of knowing how to accept victory, but the humility to accept defeat,\" Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the far-left France Unbowed party (LFI), told protesters at the start of the march in eastern Paris. \"I call on you to undertake a long battle.\" The organisers said about 300,000 people demonstrated peacefully across France, including 160,000 in Paris, although police in the capital said 26,000 people had protested in the city. The Interior Ministry did not immediately give a figure for the entire country, but its numbers are usually much lower than those given by organisers. Barnier meanwhile made his first official visit, meeting staff at a Paris hospital. The worsening condition of the public health sector has been one of the areas that people have demanded action after months of procrastination. \"Without carrying out miracles, we can make improvements,\" Barnier, who lacks a clear majority, told reporters. He said on Friday he wants to include conservatives, members of Macron's camp, and some from the left in his future government. But he faces the daunting task of trying to drive reforms and pass the 2025 budget with the threat of a no-confidence vote hanging over him at the start of October, when he is due to outline his policy objectives to parliament. DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY France is under pressure from the European Commission, the European Union's executive body, and from bond markets to reduce its deficit. The left, led by LFI, has accused Macron of a denial of democracy and stealing the election, after Macron refused to pick the candidate of the New Popular Front (NFP) alliance that came top in the July vote. Barnier's centre-right Les Republicains party is only the fifth bloc in parliament with less than 50 lawmakers, and the left believes he will push wholesale spending cuts and a tougher stance on immigration. Across 130 locations in France, people carried banners attacking Macron for betraying them and called on him to be impeached. \"He (Barnier) has no social conscience and will constitute a government which will be in the same line as the previous ones. So that is enough now,\" civil servant Jeanne Schmitt, 45, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Paris march. Pollster Elabe published a survey on Friday showing that 74% of French people considered Macron had disregarded the results of the elections, with 55% believing he had \"stolen\" them. Barnier continued consultations on Saturday as he looks to form a government, a tricky job given he faces a potential no-confidence vote. NFP and the far-right National Rally (RN) together have a majority and could oust the prime minister through a no-confidence vote should they decide to collaborate. The RN gave its tacit approval for Barnier, citing a number of conditions for it to not back a no-confidence vote, making it the de facto kingmaker for the new government. \"He is a prime minister under surveillance,\" RN party leader Jordan Bardella told BFM TV on Saturday. \"Nothing can be done without us.\" Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and David Holmes Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Europe Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Trump and Zelenskiy clash again and US warns it could abandon Ukraine talks 6:36 PM UTC · Updated  ago World category Pope Francis broke with tradition in choosing St. Mary Major for burial April 22, 2025 Business category Switzerland flexes financial muscle ahead of tariff date in Washington 5:14 AM UTC Europe category Trump envoy heads to Moscow for more Ukraine peace talks with Putin April 22, 2025",

The first major task for Barnier, appointed just over two weeks ago, will be to submit a 2025 budget plan addressing France 's financial situation, which the prime minister this week called \"very serious\".

Try again 06:46 FRENCH CONNECTIONS © FRANCE 24 Tough talks on the distribution of the 39 cabinet posts continued right up to Saturday's official announcement, insiders said, with moments of high tension between the president and his prime minister. Opposition politicians from the left have already announced they will challenge his government with a confidence motion. In the July election, a left-wing bloc called the New Popular Front (NFP) won the most parliamentary seats of any political bloc, but not enough for an overall majority. Macron argued that the left would be unable to muster enough support to form a government that would not immediately be brought down in parliament. He turned instead to Barnier to lead a government drawing mostly on parliamentary support from Macron's allies, as well as from the conservative Republicans (LR) and the centrists groups. 'Government of the general election losers' Macron was counting too, on a neutral stance from the far right – but the leader of the National Rally (RN) Jordan Bardella was quick to condemn the composition of the new government. Bardella said the new government marked 'a return to Macronism' and had 'no future whatsoever'. © Julien de Rosa, AFP/File It marked \"a return to Macronism\" and so had \"no future whatsoever\", he said Saturday. At the other end of the political spectrum, far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon called the new lineup \"a government of the general election losers\". France, he said, should \"get rid\" of the government \"as soon as possible\", while his party threatened to \"increase popular pressure\" on the government. Mélenchon dismissed the new government as made up of 'general election losers'. © Lionel Bonaventure, AFP/File Socialist party chairman Oliver Faure dismissed Barnier's cabinet as \"a reactionary government that gives democracy the finger\". Among the new faces in key cabinet posts are Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, a centrist, while conservative Bruno Retailleau takes over at the interior ministry. His portfolio covers immigration and his right-wing credentials have created unease even in Macron's own camp. Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, a close Macron ally, has kept his job. The difficult job of submitting a budget plan to parliament next month falls to 33-year-old Antoine Armand, the new finance minister. He has previously served as head of parliament's economic affairs commission. The only left-of-centre politician is a little-known former Socialist Didier Migaud who was named justice minister. Street protests Even before the announcement, thousands of people with left-leaning sympathies took to the streets in Paris , the southern port city of Marseille and elsewhere on Saturday to protest. They were objecting to a cabinet they say does not reflect the outcome of the parliamentary election. The new government has nobody from inside the NFP bloc. Barnier is to address parliament with a key policy speech on October 1st. He then has the urgent task of submitting a budget plan to the National Assembly aimed at controlling France's rising budget deficit and debt mountain – the first major test of his administration. France was placed on a formal procedure for violating European Union budgetary rules before Barnier was picked as head of government. France's public-sector deficit is projected to reach around 5.6 percent of GDP this year and go over six percent in 2025, which compares with EU rules calling for a three-percent ceiling on deficits. \"I am discovering that the country's budgetary situation is very serious,\" Barnier said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday, adding that the situation required \"more than just pretty statements\". The new cabinet's first meeting is scheduled for Monday afternoon.

The French and British governments have sought for years to stop the flow of migrants, who pay smugglers thousands of euros per head for the passage on overloaded rubber dinghies. Regional prefect Jacques Billant said the incident happened at around 1:00 am (2300 GMT on Saturday) off the coast of the northern town of Ambleteuse. \"The toll was terrible, with eight people reported dead,\" he told the press near the site of the accident. He said they seemed all to be men. Six survivors were hospitalised, including a 10-month-old baby with hypothermia, he added. The boat had set off from the Slack river that flows into the sea between the towns of Wimereux and Ambleteuse. It had 59 people on board from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Iran, Billant said. \"Only one out of six had a life jacket,\" he said. The dinghy \"quickly got into difficulty and ran aground\", he said. \"The boat was torn apart on the rocks.\" 'Children, tiny babies' Christel Leclair, a volunteer at a local charity, said a second boat had departed at around 7:30 am despite the fatal accident. Departures \"happen the whole time -- winter, day, night, summer... as soon as the sea is calm\", she said. Forty-six migrants have died trying to cross the Channel so far this year, a regional prefect said © Bernard BARRON / AFP \"The boats are more and more overcrowded. They don't have life jackets, just sometimes the inner tube of a tire,\" she added. \"There are children, pregnant women and tiny babies. We're sad and deflated.\" The Auberge des Migrants (Migrant shelter) charity on X called on the French and British states to \"immediately rethink their migration policy\". Billant said that this year French authorities had dismantled 20 people smuggling networks, arresting 77 people of whom 59 have been referred to the courts. But Charlotte Kwantes, of the Utopia 56 charity helping migrants, said departures would only continue. Without enough legal options for migrants wishing to reach the United Kingdom, \"people are continuing and will continue to take the same risks, whatever the quantity of patrols and means deployed at the border\", she said. 'Saw them die' Maritime authorities said Saturday that migrants had made numerous attempts to cross the Channel in recent days, with 200 people rescued in 24 hours over Friday and Saturday alone. The latest incident comes after at least 12 migrants including six minors, mostly from Eritrea, died when their boat capsized off the northern French coast on September 3. More than 22,000 migrants have arrived in England by crossing the Channel since the beginning of this year, according to British officials. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged this summer to strengthen \"cooperation\" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers. Starmer's office on Sunday announced the appointment of Martin Hewitt as chief of the new UK Border Security Command, set up to bolster the fight against illegal migration notably by leading joint investigations with other European countries. Hewitt will accompany Starmer during a trip to Rome on Monday for talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni where tackling illegal migration will be high on the agenda. French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns. © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

She was studying economics and financial management at Paris Dauphine University.\n\nShe was supposed to go to her parents home after having lunch in the area of where she was found but never turned up.\n\nA vigil was held in memory of Philippine on the Wednesday following the discovery of her body outside the Saint-Pierre du Lac church in Montigny-le-Bretonneux where the teenager used to visit regularly to pray, according to Le Parisienne.\n\nA woman who joined the vigil said “I don’t know the family personally but we are part of the same community. It’s absolutely tragic what’s happening,”\n\nHer funeral took place on the 27th of September at Saint-Louis Cathedral in Versailles where Phillipine, who was from a Catholic family, made her Confirmation.\n\nThe woman who was raped by the suspect in 2019 has come forward to express her shock that the man who served five years for his assault on her became the suspect in a murder which took place just three weeks after his release from the detention centre.\n\nTaha O had been sentenced to 7 years for the crime which took place in a park in Paris when the victim was 23-years-old, however he was released early and immediately transferred to the deportation hub.\n\nThe woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has now joined in calls for a parliamentary enquiry into the case.\n\nTaha O was released from the detention centre on the 3rd of September after being informed that Morocco had not responded to French authorities’ requests to authorise his entry into his homeland.\n\nThree days after that date Morocco gave authorisation to send Taha who had by then disappeared.\n\nThe Times reported that the woman who was raped by Taha in 2019 said, “Philippine could have been my sister.”\n\n“I would like the launch of a parliamentary inquiry into the prevention of repeat offending in cases of sexual and sexist crimes.”\n\nShe wrote: “I did everything possible so that what happened to me would not happen again.

I held firm during a two-year investigation and trial, telling myself that this initiative would help to protect other women.”\n\nThe woman said that despite what Taha had done to her, “immediately after being freed, he appears to have offended again and committed an irreparable act.

Authorities in New Caledonia confirmed police intervention in the Saint Louis area near the capital, Nouméa, and the two deaths. They did not provide further details. Last week, French authorities in New Caledonia announced an extended curfew, banning gatherings and travel across the archipelago from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for fear of protests by the Indigenous Kanak people around next week’s anniversary of the French takeover of the Pacific territory. The Kanak people have long sought to break free from France, which first took the Pacific archipelago in 1853 and granted citizenship to all Kanaks in 1957. The latest violence flared on May 13 in response to attempts by President Emmanuel Macron’s government to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia, which Kanaks feared would further marginalize them by granting more rights to recent arrivals from mainland France. Macron declared a state of emergency two days later, rushing in 3,500 troops to help police quell the unrest. Thirteen people, mostly Kanaks, have died in the violence, including two members of the security forces. One of them was killed after his weapon accidentally discharged.

In June, 11 Kanak activists were arrested in a broad police raid targeting the Field Action Coordination Unit. The detentions were part of a police investigation launched on May 17, just days after protests against the Paris-pushed voting reform turned violent. Seven of them, including Christian Tein , a Kanak leader of the pro-independence movement known as The Field Action Coordination Unit, were flown 17,000 kilometers (10,500 miles) away to mainland France for pretrial detention. The charges that they face include complicity in attempted murder, organized theft with a weapon, organized destruction of private property while endangering people, and participation in a criminal group with an intent to plan a crime. Tein’s group accused French authorities of “colonial practices” and demanded the activists’ immediate release and return to their homeland. In a recent statement, posted on social media the group vowed that “the Kanak people will never give up on their desire for independence with peaceful means.” In the past seven months, The Field Action Coordination Unit has organized peaceful marches in New Caledonia against French authorities and the Paris-backed voting reform.

The force arrived this weekend after the local representative of France’s central government in its overseas territory said in a statement that protests were forbidden in the municipalities of Fort-de-France, Le Lamentin, Ducos and Le Robert until Monday. The government also issued a curfew. The restrictions came after violent protests broke out on the island last week over the high cost of living, with gunfire injuring at least six police officers and one civilian. Police launched tear gas and government officials said several stores were also looted. Officials said the bans were meant “to put an end to the violence and damage committed at gatherings, as well as to the numerous obstacles to daily life and freedom of movement that penalize the entire population, particularly at weekends.” But the measure was met by defiance by many on the island, with massive peaceful protests breaking out Saturday night.

Béatrice Bellay, a representative of the socialist party on the island, blasted the move, saying: “Martinique is not in a civil war, it is a social war.” She called for an “open and transparent dialogue” between protesters and the government. “This measure ... only serves to aggravate tensions and distract attention from the legitimate demands of the people of Martinique,” she wrote in a statement Sunday.",

Marine Le Pen's RN party, which holds major political sway over Prime Minister Michel Barnier's newly installed government, has jumped on the murder of the young student, identified by authorities only by her first name, Philippine, as vindication of its calls for tougher immigration and crime laws. Sign up here. She had been reported missing by her family last Friday, and her body was found the following day, in the Bois de Boulogne park, the Paris prosecutor's office said. The suspect, a 22-year-old Moroccan man who had previously been convicted of rape in France and was due to be deported, was on Tuesday arrested in Geneva, from where French authorities would seek his extradition, the Paris prosecutor's office said. Under pressure from the RN, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Wednesday that he would look into changing the law to prevent such a situation from happening again. \"Faced with such a tragedy, preceded by many others, we cannot just condemn it or be outraged,\" Retailleau, a long-time immigration hawk, said in a statement. \"It's up to us, public officials, to ... update our legislation, to protect the French.\" Retailleau, from the conservative Republicans party, had already signalled earlier this week that France was likely to see much tougher immigration and security measures, reflecting a what he said was a growing rightward shift across Europe. RN WIELDS NEW INFLUENCE AFTER SUMMER ELECTION The Philippine case has underlined the power that the RN wields over Barnier's government, particularly in areas such as immigration and crime. The RN, a kingmaker after this summer's legislative election, gave tentative support to Barnier's hard-won premiership. But it has reserved the right to withdraw its support if its concerns are not met. RN party chief Jordan Bardella accused the state of being too soft on security and immigration in a Tuesday post on X. \"It's time for this government to act: our compatriots are angry and will not be content with just words,\" he wrote. \"Philippine's life was stolen from her by a Moroccan migrant targeted by an OQTF (obligation to leave France deportation order).\" Greens lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau warned against the far right using the murder to \"spread its racist hatred\". France deports more non-EU citizens than any other European Union nation, official Eurostat data shows. But it issues so many expulsion orders - two to five times more than Germany in each quarter over the past two years - that its ratio of enforced expulsion orders is low. In the first quarter of 2024, France ordered the expulsion of 34,190 non-EU citizens, or nearly a third of all expulsions ordered across the EU, but only deported 4,205 people. Bureaucracy, diplomatic rows and a reluctance by some countries to accept the return of people holding criminal convictions are amongst the reasons why far fewer expulsions than are ordered are actually enforced.

The territory’s Indigenous Kanak people fear changes to the voting registry would favor recent arrivals to the Pacific archipelago. Tensions in New Caledonia have long been simmering between white settler communities loyal to Paris and pro-independence Kanak people. The adoption of the voter list bill in May by both houses of French parliament led to mass demonstrations by pro-independence groups that turned violent , prompting Macron to declare a state of emergency and fly thousands of police and army reinforcements to the Pacific territory. Thirteen people, mostly Kanaks, and two police officers, have been killed and nearly 3,000 people have been arrested since New Caledonia’s police launched an investigation just days after the unrest started in May.

New Caledonia has been living through an “exceptionally grave crisis,” Barnier said and added that he will tackle the issues early next year when he plans to convene a government committee on France’s overseas territories. Its priority will be addressing and remedying “the high cost of living that affects our compatriots” in the overseas territories that extend from the Indian Ocean and the Pacific to the Caribbean. Last month, violent protests broke out on the French island of Martinique over the high cost of living, with gunfire injuring at least six police officers and one civilian. France sent a group of special anti-riot police to quell the unrest on its Caribbean territory, where protesters have gathered despite the government barring demonstrations in parts of the island. “I am aware of the suffering and anguish felt by the people of New Caledonia and I want to reiterate that the state and my government will be at their side,” Barnier said during Tuesday’s layout of his government’s polices to lawmakers in the National Assembly, France’s influential lower house of parliament. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Kanaks have long sought to break free from France after suffering from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination.",

Peter Cherif, 42, had been on trial in Paris since mid-September for \"belonging to a criminal terrorist association\" while fighting for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen from 2011 to 2018. During that time he is suspected of training his Paris childhood friend Cherif Kouachi, who along with his brother Said perpetrated the January 7, 2015 massacre at Charlie Hebdo's offices in the French capital -- for which AQAP later claimed responsibility. The trial judge sentenced Cherif to life behind bars, with a minimum of 22-years to be served. The president of the court said the decision had been taken \"in view of the seriousness of the acts\" for which Cherif was convicted. Prosecutors had called him the \"architect\" of the first in a string of attacks carried out by radical Islamists that hit France in the late 2010s. The 12 killings at the magazine shocked the world and led to an international outpouring of political and popular support under the motto \"Je suis Charlie\" (\"I am Charlie\"). Cherif also was accused of being part of a criminal gang that held three French aid workers hostage for five months in Yemen in 2011. Calling the accused a \"jihadist through-and-through\" who was the \"cornerstone of planning\" for the Charlie Hebdo attack, prosecutors on Wednesday had requested a life sentence. Cherif declined to answer questions throughout most of the trial. But he admitted standing guard over the aid workers and serving as an interpreter between them and Yemeni Al-Qaeda members. Cherif has consistently denied playing any role in the attack on Charlie Hebdo or knowing it would happen. Prosecutors believe he was in on the plan and remained in contact with Cherif Kouachi once the attacker returned to France. \"I feel like I've taken part in a rigged match,\" Cherif's defence lawyer Nabil El Ouchikli said on Thursday, pointing out that the defendant was not charged with complicity in the Charlie Hebdo attack. He argued that prosecutors had resorted to the catch-all charge of terrorist association because \"they didn't have the proof\" for specific offences. Cherif himself on Thursday said that he had \"nothing to add\" after his representatives' closing arguments.

France issued decrees in 2022 and February 2024 restricting the use of words including \"ham\", \"steak\", \"sausage\" and \"bacon\" to animal-based products. Authorities said the rules were needed to avoid creating confusion for consumers. French livestock farmers had long lobbied for the measure, and their lobbying organisation denounced Friday's ruling. Interbev, which represents France's cattle and livestock industries, said it \"deplores this decision that validates the usurpation of natural products to commercialise ultra-transformed foods\". Makers of vegetable-based proteins had protested the government's decrees, and France's top administrative court had suspended them while it awaited the CJUE's decision. A preliminary ruling had said that banning use of the words \"would seriously and immediately harm the interests of businesses\" involved in the plant-based protein industry. \"This is a very welcome victory,\" said La Vie, a French maker of plant-based meats. The company's lawyer, Guillaume Hannotin, who also represents the wider industry, said terms such as \"plant-based steak\" or \"vegetable steak\" had been in use for 40 years.

The vote was a key test for Barnier, whose Cabinet is forced to rely on the far right’s good will to be able to stay in power, as the nation grapples with economic challenges exacerbated by global inflation. The no-confidence motion was brought by a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, composed of the hard-left France Unbowed, Socialists, Greens and Communists. It received 197 votes, far from the 289 votes needed to pass. Following the June-July parliamentary elections , the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. The far-right National Rally group, which counts 125 lawmakers, abstained from voting the no-confidence motion. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, herself a lawmaker, said she decided to “give a chance” to the government for now. RELATED COVERAGE Olympic organizing team unveiled for 2030 Winter Games in French Alps France’s government survives a no-confidence vote and a budget is finally adopted France’s government is fighting for survival over its 2025 budget. Here’s what to know Barnier’s Cabinet is mostly composed of members of his Republicans party and centrists from French President Emmanuel Macron’s alliance who altogether count just over 210 lawmakers. Left-wing lawmakers denounced the choice of Barnier as prime minister as they were not given a chance to form a minority government, despite securing the most seats at the National Assembly. This government “is a denial of the result of the most recent legislative elections,” the motion read. Olivier Faure, head of the Socialist Party, denounced a “democratic hijacking,” adding that “on July 7, it was the New Popular Front that came out on top.” Barnier strongly rejected Faure’s accusations his government is “illegitimate.” “I don’t need the government to be reminded it’s a minority one,” Barnier said. “Nobody has an absolute majority.” The new government is soon to face its biggest challenge as Barnier made a priority of remedying France’s indebted public finances. “The reality we have to tell the French is that we are spending too much… This cannot go on,” Barnier said. “We must fix the (state) budget, reduce our public spending, and we will indeed be asking for an exceptional tax from companies and the wealthiest French people... It’s always better to seek to be responsible rather than popular.” France is under pressure from the European Union’s executive body to reduce its colossal debt. The country was placed earlier this year by the EU’s executive arm under a formal procedure for running up excessive debt , the first step in a long process before any member state can be hemmed in and moved to take corrective action. In his inaugural speech to parliament last week, Barnier said he will seek to reduce France’s deficit from an estimated 6% of Gross Domestic Product now to 5% next year through a 60 billion ($66 billion) budget squeeze, with the aim to reach 3% by 2029. To do so, he promised to cut state expenses, spend money more “efficiently” and fight tax evasion and other frauds. The government is to formally present its 2025 budget bill on Thursday , ahead of an expected heated debated at parliament, as labor unions and left-wing opposition parties prepare to push back against some austerity measures.

The storm also cut power to more than 300,000 households, said the country's electricity supplier. Weather and civil protection officials, having predicted winds of up to 120 kilometres per hour (75 mph) and heavy rain, put the coast on a yellow alert, as waves reached up to seven metres (23 feet) high. Spanish weather officials issued an orange alert for the north and northwest of the country, warning of winds of up to 140 kilometres per hour in the Asturias region.

Issued on: 17/10/2024 - 19:14 4 min By: Joanna YORK Russian recruits undergo combat assault training at a firing range in the Rostov region, Russia, on October 4, 2024. © Sergey Pivovarov, Reuters The escape route for Russian soldiers wishing to flee the fighting in Ukraine is complex and fraught with danger. Deserters face harsh punishment under Russian law, and it is almost impossible for them to travel to \"safe\" countries outside the Kremlin’s sphere of influence. The six soldiers arrived in France separately in recent months after initially fleeing from Russia to Kazakhstan. It was the first time any EU country has allowed a group of deserters entry without travel documents or foreign passports, the Guardian reported on Thursday. “When I landed in France, it was the first time I could breathe fully. I felt a sense of calmness and freedom … the worst was behind me,” Alexander, a former Russian contract soldier who deserted during the summer of 2023, told the British newspaper. Options other than fighting Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, almost 7,400 soldiers have been tried in military courts for going AWOL, and the number of cases rises each month, Russian independent media site Mediazona reported in April. This figure is thought to be a fraction of the total number of deserters – never mind those who want to desert but are too afraid. “This case in France is really important to show soldiers that they have other options than to go to Ukraine and kill people there,” said Anastasia Burakova, founder of The Ark, an organisation that supports Russians who oppose the war in Ukraine both inside Russia and in exile. The European Union has discussed the prospect of offering asylum to draft evaders and deserters from the Russian army since the start of the invasion, but never made a formal decision.

Go By The Forest is an organisation dedicated to helping Russian soldiers who choose not to participate in the war. In March 2024, it told Mediazona that 30 percent of the 520 soldiers it has helped were hiding in Russia. The rest had fled abroad. Under Russian laws , which President Vladimir Putin strengthened following his Ukraine invasion, desertion during wartime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In Ukraine, there are reports of Russian soldiers who refuse to fight being held in pits and basements for days on end by superior officers. For deserters who do manage to leave Russia, options are limited. As serving troops are not in possession of their passports, deserters can only travel to former Soviet countries that do not require papers, such as Armenia, Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan. But once they arrive, “it's not safe for them”, Burakova said. “It's really difficult to find a job, to have an income,\" she said. \"They can't have any legal status. They can’t leave the country. And also, they're at high risk of being kidnapped.” Russian deserter Dmitri Sedrakov was illegally captured by Russian forces in Armenia on December 7, 2023, before being taken back to Russia. Others have been extradited from Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan . Organisations such as The Ark can help defectors reach these former Soviet states. “But we can’t promise them that they will be not kidnapped from these countries,” Burakova said. Political asylum The six soldiers granted visas intend to apply for political asylum in France. Their temporary visas were issued after lengthy discussions with human rights groups to ensure that they did not pose a security risk and were genuinely opposed to the war in Ukraine. The Ark uses open-source software to carry out such background checks. “We can identify that the people didn't take part in war crimes, or sometimes that they were just stationed in military points in Russia, not in occupied territories of Ukraine,” Burakova said. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU tightened its guidelines on granting visas to Russian nationals. Many countries suspended visas for Russians altogether. At the same time, The Ark was receiving a lot of messages from soldiers. “But it's been really difficult to tell soldiers who don't want to take part in this bloody war what they can do next,” Burakova said. She hopes the French decision to grant visas to deserters will bring hope to other Russian soldiers. Both The Ark and Go By The Forest communicate to the public via their Telegraph channels, which are still not blocked in Russia. Ultimately, she hopes their efforts can have an even larger impact. “Showing that there is a way out from the army is one of the tools to end this war more quickly,” she said. © France Médias Monde graphic studio Read next New memoir from Russian dissident Alexei Navalny reveals he knew he would die in prison Europe Russia jails French researcher Laurent Vinatier for three years in 'foreign agent' case Europe Zelensky says he hopes war with Russia will end 'no later than next year' Europe Today's top stories A trap?

The overnight shutdown backed up flights, and officials at the airport urged stranded passengers to contact their airlines for information after the facility resumed operations by mid-morning. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said French authorities had regained control of the airport, which demonstrators targeted in the latest protest decrying a high cost of living . Retailleau added that reinforcements were being sent. “We will reestablish order,” he said. But he added: “We also have to take into account” local people’s unhappiness about high prices. “We have to do both,” he said. Since Monday night, Martinique has been gripped by bouts of protests over the high cost of living that turned violent, with at least one person killed as demonstrators set fire to a police station, cars and road barricades and clashed with officers. On Thursday night, protesters overran the tarmac on the airport in the island’s capital, Fort-de-France, and tried to force their way into the main entrance, where hundreds of passengers had taken shelter, according to videos posted on social media. Police securing the entrance were seen fending off assaults from the demonstrators and firing what appears to be tear gas in their direction, and the airport later said on Facebook that flights were suspended. Three planes carrying some 1,000 passengers had to be diverted to nearby island of Guadeloupe on Thursday, Martinique local prefecture said in its statement. Another 500 passengers who were supposed to board those flights were stuck at the Fort-de-France airport, it said. The prefecture said the run on the airport came after “rumors” spread on social media about the imminent arrival of hundreds of French police officers by plane. “This completely false information is at the origin of groupings and the invasion of the airport runway,” the statement read. So far this week, nearly a dozen officers were injured as protesters threw bottles and rocks and police responded with tear gas, according to the government. Some demonstrators also opened fire, officials said. The latest round of violence prompted the government to announce another curfew as it stressed that demonstrations on public roads were prohibited. It is the latest in a string of protests that began in early September, prompting France to send special anti-riot police to the island, which has banned demonstrations in certain areas. Martinique has seen similar protests in recent years , many of them fueled by anger over what demonstrators say is economic, social and racial inequality.",

Workers at the territory's thermal power station in the industrial zone of Jarry entered the command room \"and caused an emergency shutdown of all the engines\", the Guadeloupe prefecture said in a statement. Restored electricity supply for the 230,000 affected households was expected at 3.00 PM (1900 GMT) at best. Police intervened and the archipelago's prefect had \"requisitioned\" staff to bring the station back up to speed, it said. The French government has mobilised \"services and operators\" to bring power back as soon as possible, said Energy Minister Olga Givernet. A labour dispute over pay has pitted the energy branch of the hard-left CGT union against the EDF utility since September 15. Power outages have affected daily life in Jarry, the economic powerhouse of the French territory of close to 380,000 inhabitants, over the past week. Some businesses have closed, an AFP correpondent said, and emergency services suffered. Leon Prosper Jimmy, an ambulance driver in Pointe-a-Pitre, said that taking charge of patients in apartment buildings had become difficult because of non-functioning lifts. \"We have to carry them,\" he said, saying he often called the fire brigade or other services for backup. \"We manage as best we can,\" said the 41-year old. The CHUG hospital centre said it had activated backup power generators which would keep \"critical operations\" going for 72 hours. In a supermarket near the capital, inhabitants were stacking up with bottled water as the territory's water supply began to be affected. Many store shelves were empty as supplies were disrupted. Guadeloupe looks after its own electricity needs, having no interconnection agreements with other countries. Its power production is 70 percent thermal, stemming from burning fuel oil or wood pellets.

The IOC took over running the boxing competition at this year's Paris Olympics. IOC president Thomas Bach warned that boxing's national federations needed to find a new and \"reliable\" international partner for the IOC to be sure the sport features on the programme at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. A decision is due early in 2025 on whether or not to keep the sport in the Games. FFBoxe said it planned to join World Boxing. World Boxing, which was founded in 2023 and boasts around 50 members, led by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Brazil, is in discussions with the IOC to take over running the sport at the Games. FFBoxe said the decision to \"disaffiliate\" from the IBA, was \"motivated by the desire to guarantee French boxing its place at the Olympic Games and to reinforce the stability of its clubs\". It said it had been prompted to act by a letter from David Lappartient, President of the French Olympic Committee, and a candidate to replace the departing Bach as IOC president, pointing out that boxing was not, for now, on the 2028 Olympic programme. The IBA is chaired by the Kremlin-linked Russian Umar Kremlev who sparked a damaging gender controversy during the Paris Olympics when he claimed that two women fighters had \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\". The IOC, which leaves gender rules to the sporting bodies, cleared them to compete and expressed doubts about the IBA's testing and motivations. The IBA responded with a chaotic press conference in Paris intended to clarify why it disqualified Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting from its world championships in 2023 but then cited \"medical confidentiality\" as it failed to produce definitive evidence.

Five people were seriously injured in a drive-by shooting at a restaurant in the city, including a 15-year-old boy who was left in critical condition after being shot in the head, police sources told the AFP news agency. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau described the incident as an alarming sign of drug-related violence escalating in the country. It follows a shooting in the north-western city of Rennes last week which killed a five-year-old boy. \"These shootings are not happening in South America, they are happening in Rennes, in Poitiers, in this part of western France once known for its tranquility,\" Retailleau told broadcaster BFMTV. \"We are at a tipping point and the choice we have today is a choice between general mobilisation or the Mexicanisation of the country,\" he said, alluding to Mexico's widespread issues with street crime and violence perpetrated by drug cartels. The mayor of Poitiers called it \"a new episode of violence unacceptable for the neighbourhood\". Shots were fired from a passing car, injuring several young people, police sources said. Two 16-year-olds were treated for minor wounds. Pictures from the scene in Place Coimbra, an area of the city known for drug-related crimes, showed the restaurant's facade riddled with bullet holes. The shooting then triggered fighting between rival gang groups in the area, according to police. \"Tensions between groups broke out, requiring the intervention of the police and the gendarmerie,\" Vienne regional police said in a statement. Retailleau said \"400 to 600\" people were at the scene, though it is not clear how many of those were directly involved. He was scheduled to visit Rennes, the capital of Brittany, on Friday following the shooting on 26 October, in which a five-year-old boy sitting in a car was shot in the head. Authorities confirmed the shooting was also drug-related. The drug trade in France has long been viewed as centred in the southern port city of Marseille, where at least 17 drug-related killings have been reported since the start of the year. But researchers say the influence of drug trafficking in France in recent years has spread beyond the main hubs of Marseille and Paris to medium-sized towns and even rural areas. France",

Issued on: 28/11/2024 - 22:41 2 min Authorities in France and other European countries have vowed to clampdown on migrant smuggling gangs charging huge sums to get undocumented people from South Asia and Africa into the country © Sameer Al-DOUMY / AFP Charging between 15,000 and 26,000 euros per person, the traffickers are suspected of having smuggled several thousand people from India, Sri Lanka and Nepal into France since September 2021, the force said. Authorities estimate the network generated several million euros in illegal profits, which were laundered through construction companies, gold trafficking and informal transfers of money back to South Asia. The arrests took place between March and November 2024, said Julien Gentile, director of the French border force at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport. \"The smugglers facilitated migrants' travel to the European Union via Dubai or African states, while providing them with illegally obtained tourist, work or medical visas,\" said Gentile. The head of the network is still at large, with France's request for his extradition from Dubai yet to be agreed, according to the border force. Of the 26 men arrested, 15 were placed in pre-trial detention with seven under judicial supervision. The remaining four, who were recently arrested, were to be presented on Thursday to the investigating judge. The 11 million euros' worth of assets included properties, luxury cars, jewellery and gold. Those arrested are accused of belonging to different levels of the gang, ranging from smugglers to money launderers and shady finance brokers. \"This is the exceptional nature of the case,\" Gentile added. Details of the investigation by France's Office for the Fight against the Illicit Traffic of Migrants, were released with migration becoming a key issue for French political parties. The conservative government that took office in September has said it will clampdown, while France has also faced pressure over undocumented migrants crossing the Channel to Britain from its northern coast. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was to visit the Calais region on Friday for talks with local mayors on the migrant crisis. At least 72 undocumented migrants have died this year trying to cross the Channel. The mayors have asked for more police and a tougher clampdown on the smuggling gangs. Retailleau is also to go to London on December 8-9 for talks on the migrants. Human trafficking carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in France. In December 2023, a plane carrying hundreds of Indian passengers was grounded for days at Vatry airport east of Paris over concerns it was part of a human trafficking scheme. The plane had taken off from the United Arab Emirates and was detained after an anonymous tipoff. © 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

        "text": "France's new dictionary struggles to keep up with the times 14 November 2024 Share Save Hugh Schofield BBC News Reporting from Paris Share Save EPA Forty years after they began the task – and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission – sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary. The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l’Académie Française was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Collège des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine. This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy – so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature – have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635. Their task at the start was to “give certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent” – to which end they set about writing their first dictionary. However, the job has proved so slow – the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet – that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question. “The effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,” a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday. This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections – up to the letter R – have already been issued. Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete. Getty Images In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a “mirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,” and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version. But many of the “modern” words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in. Thus common words like tiktokeur , vlog , smartphone and émoji – which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries – do not exist in the Académie book.  Conversely its “new” words include such go-ahead concepts as soda , sauna , yuppie and supérette (mini-supermarket). For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur . However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Académie fought a rear-guard action against it. Likewise the third section of the new dictionary – including the letter M – defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is. “How can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?” the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving. Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts. Among the “immortals” is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep). “French needs it, because as every English student of French knows, there is no word for ‘shallow’,” he said.  Sadly, he failed. Discussions - lengthy ones - are already under way for the commencement of edition 10.

        "text": "Reconstruction work after the fire in Paris in 2019 required about 2,000 workers. Notre-Dame Cathedral, situated on an island in the River Seine in Paris, France, is reopening this weekend after more than five years of intense reconstruction work to restore the medieval building to its former glory. After a fire gutted the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019, the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece has now been masterfully restored and will reopen to the public on Sunday following a ceremony on Saturday, which will be attended by a lineup of heads of state and top-level delegates from around the world. French President Emmanuel Macron, who promised to restore the cathedral within five years after the catastrophe, made a preopening visit to the site on November 29 with his wife, first lady Brigitte Macron. The president thanked the thousands of workers who had reconstructed the building. “The inferno of Notre-Dame was a wound for the nation, … and you were its remedy,” the president said. Here is what we know about this weekend’s reopening and what happened to the nearly 900-year-old cultural icon five years ago: The blaze broke out on the evening of April 15, 2019, on the roof of the cathedral. The fire sent tongues of orange flames into the sky as smoke billowed from the building. The fire burned for 15 hours while more than 400 firefighters battled to extinguish it. It is still unclear what caused the blaze, but authorities suspect an electrical fault or a burning cigarette was the likely culprit. No members of the public were hurt because security officials had sounded the alarm and evacuated the cathedral. However, three security officials were injured. By the time the fire was extinguished the following day, the inside and roof of the cathedral had been largely destroyed. Its wooden and metal spire, which had been undergoing reconstruction work, collapsed. Its lead roof melted, and the intricate wooden beams that supported it burned away, leaving a gaping hole over the building. Some religious relics inside the building as well as exposed artwork on the exterior of the building were badly damaged. However, the vaulted stone ceiling acted as a barrier to the fire and prevented serious damage to the cathedral’s interior stone walls. The cathedral’s wooden frame was centuries-old, and authorities had long marked it as a possible fire hazard. Still, it was a painful period for the French nation. Toxic lead dust spread and cast a gloom over a solemn Paris. Macron, in an emotional speech on April 17, 2019, promised to restore the monument within five years and make it more beautiful than ever. Notre-Dame did not hold a Christmas Mass that year – for the first time since 1803. Hundreds of donors, including some of France’s richest businesspeople, contributed more than 840 million euros ($889m) to the medieval building’s restoration campaign, which was launched by Macron. About 150 countries, among them the United States and Saudi Arabia, also contributed. The restoration involved the work of about 2,000 people, including craftspeople, architects and other professionals. Construction workers used powerful vacuum cleaners and cleaning gels to remove the thickened soot, dust and years of accumulated grime from the lower stone walls of the cathedral. Carpenters then hewed giant oak beams by hand to rebuild the intricate roof frame and the spire. About 2,000 oak trees were felled to provide the wood to rebuild the roof. Work has not entirely finished, and scaffolding will cover parts of the exterior for a few more years so decorative features on the facade can be fully restored. Notre-Dame is set to host a high-profile ceremony on Saturday with more than 50 heads of state and government, dignitaries and VIPs attending under tight security. Notable among them will be US President-elect Donald Trump, who has travelled to Paris on his first foreign trip since winning the November presidential election. Also attending are Prince William of the UK and Ukraine’s President Zelensky. “President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so,” the president-elect said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday. “It will be a very special day for all!” About 170 bishops from France are expected to attend the ceremony although Pope Francis will be notably absent. Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will strike the cathedral’s closed doors with a staff, formally opening them to commence the ceremony. First, the great organ, which is France’s largest, will be “awakened”. The organ is made of 8,000 pipes and 115 stops. Some events which had been planned to take place outdoors will now take place inside the cathedral because of the cold weather: A movie will be screened recalling the fire and the reconstruction and paying tribute to those who have participated in restoring the cathedral. The Pope’s message to the French people will be read out, followed by poetry readings and Ulrich will give a final blessing. The choir will sing Te Deum, a Latin hymn, to round off the service. Macron will make a short speech outside the cathedral to guests and heads of state at 6.30pm. At 8pm, a concert will begin. An inaugural Mass for dignitaries will begin at 10:30am (09:30 GMT) on Sunday. Macron is expected to be in the congregation. The public can then attend a second evening Mass on the same day with tickets which were available on a first-come first-served basis. Guests were able to book tickets, which are free of charge, online. Special Masses, twice daily, will be held for the next eight days, and many will be open to the public.

        "text": "France admits colonial 'massacre', says Senegal's leader 29 November 2024 Share Save Damian Zane BBC News Share Save AFP The Tirailleurs Senegalais, seen here at the end of the conflict, were sent to France ahead of an anticipated German invasion during World War Two France has for the first time acknowledged that its soldiers carried out a \"massacre\" in Senegal in which dozens – perhaps hundreds – of West African troops were killed almost exactly 80 years ago, Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has said. Those who died were part of the Tirailleurs Senegalais unit, recruited at the start of World War Two to help defend France, the colonial power. On returning to Senegal in 1944 many protested about their pay, historians say, which led to a brutal response. The killings have been a point of contention between Senegal and France and their reported acknowledgement by Paris comes as Faye is talking about a reassessment of the countries’ relationship. Those who joined the Tirailleurs Senegalais not only came from Senegal but also from across France’s African empire, including what is now Mali, Guinea, Niger, Benin and Chad. They were sent to France and many were captured by Germany during its successful invasion of the country. Liberated in 1944, the soldiers were taken back to Senegal and housed in the Thiaroye military camp, 15km (nine miles) from the capital, Dakar. Even before leaving France, many had been complaining about the pay they were set to receive and the fact that it was not the same as other French troops, historian Armelle Mabon says. Anger over the money grew once at Thiaroye, which the colonial authority viewed as a mutiny. On 1 December, the French violently brought an end to the protests. At the time it was said that 35 of the tirailleurs were killed, but some have put the death toll as high as 400. \"France must recognise that on that day, the confrontation between soldiers and riflemen who demanded their full legitimate wages be paid, triggered a chain of events that resulted in a massacre,\" the AP news agency quotes a letter from French President Emmanuel Macron to Faye as saying. Previously, in 2014, then President François Hollande had called what happened a \"bloody repression\". Senegal is due to mark the 80th anniversary of the shootings on Sunday. In his response to Macron’s letter, Faye is quoted by AP as saying that his French counterpart’s acknowledgement would \"open the door\" so the \"whole truth about this painful event of Thiaroye\" can be discovered. \"We have long sought closure on this story and we believe that, this time, France’s commitment will be full, frank and collaborative,\" he added. He also indicated that he might be asking for an apology. Sixty-four years after Senegal's independence, France still has a military presence in the country, but speaking to the AFP news agency on Thursday, Faye, who was elected in March, said that France should close its base there. \"Senegal is an independent country, it is a sovereign country and sovereignty does not accept the presence of military bases in a sovereign country,\" he is quoted as saying.

The court in Lille, northern France, sentenced one of the ringleaders, Mirkhan Rasoul, a 26-year-old from Iraq, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 200,000 euros ($218,000). Rasoul attended the trial in a secured plexiglass box and under the surveillance of armed police. Other sentences ranged from two years to 10 years in prison. “These sentences are obviously very severe,” said Kamel Abbas, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants already imprisoned in France. “That’s a testimony of the scale of the case, and of the intention to severely punish the smugglers.” Most of the defendants were not in court for the verdicts and sentencing. Some attended the trial remotely from various prisons in northern France, while others are not in custody. Fourteen of the 18 defendants were from Iraq, with the others from Iran, Poland, France and the Netherlands.

Craig Turner, deputy director of the British National Crime Agency (NCA), involved in the arrest of one of the defendants, said the network was one of the most prolific organizers of crossings. “Their sole motive was profit, and they didn’t care about the fate of migrants they were putting to sea in wholly inappropriate and dangerous boats,” Turner said. “We are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before,” Turner said. The criminal network was making approximately €100,000 ($109,035) from each crossing according to a statement from the NCA published on Tuesday. The trial comes in what has been a particularly deadly year for attempted crossings of the English Channel, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in all of 2023 , though fewer than in 2022. At least 56 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to French officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the crossings began surging in 2018. The route, despite French and British efforts to stop it, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties, or perceived easier access to asylum and work. Europe’s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants are also pushing many migrants north . On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for international cooperation against smuggling gangs, likening the issue to a global security threat on par with terrorism. Starmer told a conference of international police organization Interpol that “people-smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism.” He said intelligence and law-enforcement agencies should try to “stop smuggling gangs before they act” in the same way they do in counterterrorism operations. ___ AP journalists John Leicester in Paris and Jill Lawless in London contributed. ___ Follow all AP stories on global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

Try again 02:24 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier attends a debate on two motions of no-confidence against the French government at the National Assembly in Paris, France, December 4, 2024. © Sarah Meyssonnier, Reuters French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, a historic move which plunged the country further into political chaos. For the first time in over sixty years, the National Assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen . Barnier's rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival. President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left. Read more Why the French government is headed for collapse The National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote. With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government. Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to \"submit his resignation\" to Macron and declared the session closed. Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia , an apparent world away from the domestic crisis. He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace. On Tuesday, Macron accused Le Pen's far-right of \"unbearable cynicism\" in backing the motion. No new elections can be called within a year of last summer's vote, narrowing Macron's options. Laurent Wauquiez , the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far right and hard left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will \"plunge the country into instability\". 'His failure' Some have suggested Macron himself should resign to break the impasse. But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to \"political fiction\". \"It's frankly not up to scratch to say these things,\" Macron said during his trip to Saudi. Eric Coquerel, a hard-left MP, said the motion against Barnier sounded the \"death knell of Emmanuel Macron's mandate\". With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes over the threat of cutbacks that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis. The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn. Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president. \"His failure,\" was left-wing daily Liberation's front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027. 'Shattered strategy' But in an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen's move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government. \"In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued,\" the daily said. Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier. Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election. Read more What does the EU embezzlement trial mean for Le Pen and the French far right? But if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial. Candidates for the post of premier are few and far between, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders. On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve , a contender in September. Macron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. The lifespan of Barnier's government is also the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.

        "text": "No-one gets France's difficulty more than me, says Macron's new PM Bayrou 13 December 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save Reuters In his first words François Bayrou singled out reducing France's deficit and debt as a moral priority Centrist leader François Bayrou has become France's latest prime minister, chosen by President Emmanuel Macron in a bid to end months of political turmoil. Bayrou, a 73-year-old mayor from the south-west who leads the MoDem party, said he was fully aware of the \"Himalayan\" task facing France, and he vowed to \"hide nothing, neglect nothing and leave nothing aside\". He is seen by Macron's entourage as a potential consensus candidate and his task will be to avoid the fate of his predecessor. Ex-Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier was ousted by MPs nine days ago and welcomed Bayrou to the prime minister's residence on Friday. Barnier was voted out over a budget aimed at cutting France's budget deficit, which is set to hit 6.1% of economic output (GDP) this year. Bayrou said the deficit and public debt were a moral as well as a financial problem - because \"passing it on to one's children is a terrible thing to do\". Macron is half-way through his second term as president and Bayrou will be his fourth prime minister this year. French politics has been deadlocked ever since Macron called snap parliamentary elections during the summer and an opinion poll for BFMTV on Thursday suggested 61% of French voters were worried by the political situation. Although a succession of allies lined up to praise Bayrou's appointment, Socialist regional leader Carole Delga said the whole process had become a \"bad movie\". Far-left France Unbowed (LFI) leader Manuel Bompard complained of a \"pathetic spectacle\". The centre-left Socialists said they were ready to talk to Bayrou but would not take part in his government. Leader Olivier Faure said because Macron had chosen someone \"from his own camp\", the Socialists would remain in opposition. BERTRAND GUAY/POOL/AFP Friday's handover took place at the prime minister's residence at the Hôtel Matignon President Macron has vowed to remain in office until his second term ends in 2027, despite Barnier's downfall last week. He cut short a trip to Poland on Thursday and had been expected to name his new prime minister on Thursday night, but postponed his announcement until Friday. He then met Bayrou at the Elysée Palace and a final decision was made hours later. But in an indication of the fraught nature of the talks, Le Monde newspaper suggested that Macron had preferred another ally, Roland Lescure, but changed his mind when Bayrou threatened to withdraw his party's support. François Bayrou commands respect - but can he save France from crisis? Bayrou arrived at the prime minister's residence at Hôtel Matignon late on Friday afternoon. A red carpet had been rolled out for the transfer of power even before his name was confirmed. His challenge will be in forming a government that will not be brought down the way his predecessor's was in the National Assembly. The far left France Unbowed (LFI) have already threatened to demand a vote of no confidence as soon as they can. Ahead of his appointment, Macron held round-table talks with leaders from all the main political parties, bar the far left of Jean-Luc Mélenchon and far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. The question is who can be persuaded to join Bayrou's government, or at least agree a pact so they do not oust him. Anne RENAUT/AFP The red carpet was laid out at the prime minister's residence even before Bayrou was named When the only possible means of survival for a minority government is to build bridges on left and right, Bayrou has the advantage of having passable relations with both sides, reports BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. Michel Barnier was appointed only in September and said on Friday he knew from the outset that his government's days were numbered. He was voted out when Le Pen's National Rally joined left-wing MPs in rejecting his plans for €60bn (£50bn) in tax rises and spending cuts. His outgoing government has put forward a bill to enable the provisions of the 2024 budget to continue into next year. But a replacement budget for 2025 will have to be approved once the next government takes office. Bayrou said that reducing France's deficit and debt was a \"moral obligation\". Barnier wished his successor his best wishes, adding that \"our country is in an unprecedented and serious situation\". Under the political system of France's Fifth Republic, the president is elected for five years and names a prime minister whose choice of cabinet is then appointed by the president. Unusually, President Macron called snap elections for parliament over the summer after poor results in the EU elections in June. The outcome left France in political stalemate, with three large political blocs made up of the left, centre and far right. Eventually he chose Barnier to form a minority government reliant on Marine Le Pen's National Rally for its survival. Macron is now hoping to restore stability without depending on her party. Three centre-left parties - the Socialists, Greens and Communists - broke ranks with the more radical left LFI by taking part in talks with Macron. However, they made clear they wanted a prime minister from the left, rather than a centrist. \"I told you I wanted someone from the left and the Greens and I think Mr Bayrou isn't one or the other,\" Greens leader Marine Tondelier told French TV on Thursday. Patrick Kanner of the Socialists said that just because his party was not joining Bayrou's government, \"that doesn't mean we're going to bash it\". Sébastien Chenu, a National Rally MP, said for his party it was less about who Macron picked than the \"political line\" he chose. If Bayrou wanted to tackle immigration and the cost of living crisis then he would \"find an ally in us\". Relations between the centre left and the radical LFI of Jean-Luc Mélenchon appear to have broken down over the three parties' decision to pursue talks with President Macron. After the LFI leader called on his former allies to steer clear of a coalition deal, Olivier Faure of the Socialists told French TV that \"the more Mélenchon shouts the less he's heard\". Meanwhile, Marine Le Pen has called for her party's policies on the cost of living to be taken into account by the incoming government, by building a budget that \"doesn't cross each party's red lines\".

Entire communities were flattened when Cyclone Chido made landfall, causing wind gusts of more than 225km/h (140mph). The last reported death toll stood at 11 but speaking to local media, the island's prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville said it will \"definitely be several hundred\" once the damage is fully assessed, adding it was possible that a \"few thousand people had died\". French President Emmanuel Macron earlier said France would \"be there\" for the people of Mayotte and was sending 250 rescue workers. AFP Destruction in the aftermath of the cyclone that hit Mayotte on 15 December France's interior minister Bruno Retailleau said \"all makeshift homes have been completely destroyed\" and he feared a \"heavy\" death toll. On Saturday, one local news source reported that 11 people were killed and 246 injured, based on a hospital report. AFP had reported a higher death toll - at least 14 - citing a security source. Located north-west of Madagascar, Mayotte is an archipelago comprised of one main island, Grand-Terre, and several smaller ones. Most of the island's 300,000 or so inhabitants live in shacks with sheet metal roofs, and tens of thousands of people have lost their homes. Electricity, water and internet connections are all down. The government in Paris has sent a military transport plane with supplies and emergency workers. The territory's Pamandzi airport \"suffered major damage, especially to the control tower,\" acting French Transport Minister Francois Durovray wrote on X. Air traffic \"will be restored initially with military aid planes. Ships are on the way to ensure resupply,\" he added. Even before the cyclone hit with full force on Saturday morning, there were reports of trees being uprooted, roofs being ripped off buildings and power lines being downed. The head of Mayotte's firefighters' union, Abdoul Karim Ahmed Allaoui, told the BFM news channel on Saturday morning that \"even emergency responders are locked down\". He continued: \"There's no mobile phone service and we can't reach people on the island. Even buildings built to earthquake standards haven't held up. \"The emergency services command centre has been evacuated and is functioning at partial capacity.\" AFP Interior Minister Retailleau wrote in a statement on X: \"I offer my full support to the people of Mayotte. The state and local emergency services are fully mobilized. 110 civil security personnel and firefighters have already been sent and are on site. A second dispatch will be made tomorrow with 140 additional personnel.\" French Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took up the post on Friday, said the cyclone was of \"exceptional severity\" and he was being updated on the situation \"hour by hour\". He has held an emergency meeting in Paris with ministers. Mayotte was initially placed under a purple alert - the highest level - and a \"strict lockdown for the whole population, including emergency services\" was imposed. It has since been lowered to red to allow emergency services to leave their bases. Retailleau said the island had not experienced such severe weather since 1934. After hitting Mayotte, the storm intensified overnight as it crossed the Mozambique Channel. The coastal city of Pemba has been battered by heavy rains and winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). Videos on social media showed parts of Pemba city were flooded, trees uprooted and some homes damaged. The cyclone is now moving inland, with heavy rains reported in neighbouring Nampula province. While the winds are expected to ease, heavy rain and flooding are also predicted for southern Malawi and later Zimbabwe.

Photograph: REX/Shutterstock France This article is more than 3 months old Eight convicted over beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in Paris This article is more than 3 months old Paty, 47, was killed outside his school days after showing his class cartoons of the prophet Muhammad Associated Press in Paris Fri 20 Dec 2024 20.47 GMT Last modified on Fri 20 Dec 2024 21.12 GMT Share Eight people have been convicted in a French anti-terrorism court of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty outside his school four years ago. Paty, 47, was killed outside his school near Paris on 16 October 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression . The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police. Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November are accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organising a hate campaign online before the murder took place. The 540-seat courtroom in central Paris was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. The atmosphere became charged as the lead judge delivered the sentences. Families of the accused, seated on the benches, reacted strongly – there were gasps, cries, shouts, and even ironic clapping erupted, prompting the judge to pause several times and call for silence. Prosecutors requested sentences ranging from 18 months suspended imprisonment to 16 years in prison against the defendants. They include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped buy weapons for the attack and the father of a schoolgirl whose lies started the fatal spiral of events. Samuel Paty murder: how a teenager’s lie sparked a tragic chain of events Read more The national anti-terrorism prosecutor had asked the court to downgrade the offences of four of the eight defendants, prompting ire from Paty’s family. “It’s more than a disappointment,” Paty’s sister Mickaëlle had told broadcaster TF1. “In a moment like this, it feels like one is fighting for nothing.” Also, the public prosecutor dropped the charge of complicity in favour of a lower charge of association with a terrorist enterprise against the two young men accused of providing logistical support to the killer. He asked for 14 years in prison for Naïm Boudaoud and 16 years for Azim Epsirkhanov. The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty’s death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty’s killing reinforced the French state’s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. Much attention at the trial focused on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty’s class when he showed the caricatures on 5 October 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that “this sick man” needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina’s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher’s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed. Chnina is accused of alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. The public prosecutor requested a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment for him. His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty’s school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth was given a sixth-month term with an electronic bracelet. Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty’s family. “It’s something that really shocks the family,” lawyer Virginie Le Roy said. “You get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever. Apologies are pointless, they won’t bring Samuel back, but explanations are precious to us. But, unfortunately, I have to make a more than mixed assessment. We haven’t had many explanations of the facts.” Explore more on these topics France Europe news Share Reuse this content",

Sarkozy, 69, faces a year in prison, but is expected to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet — as is the case for any sentence of two years or less. He was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling by both a Paris court in 2021 and an appeals court in 2023 for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. “The convictions and sentences are therefore final,” a Court of Cassation statement on Wednesday said. Sarkozy, who was France’s president from 2007 to 2012, retired from public life in 2017 though still plays an influential role in French conservative politics. He was among the guests who attended the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral earlier this month. Sarkozy, in a statement posted on X, said “I will assume my responsibilities and face all the consequences.” He added: “I have no intention of complaining. But I am not prepared to accept the profound injustice done to me.” RELATED COVERAGE Trial of former President Sarkozy sheds light on France’s back-channel talks with Libya’s Gadhafi Here’s a look at the election ban on France’s far-right Le Pen and the legal issues Trial of former President Sarkozy sheds light on France’s back-channel talks with Libya’s Gadhafi Sarkozy said he will seek to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights, and hopes those proceedings will result in “France being condemned.” He reiterated his “full innocence.” “My determination is total in this case as in all others,” he concluded. Sarkozy’s lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said his client “will comply” with the ruling. This means the former president will have to wear an electronic bracelet, Spinosi said. It is the first time in France’s modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term. Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Sarkozy has been involved in several other legal cases. He has denied any wrongdoing. He faces another trial next month in Paris over accusations he took millions of dollars from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his successful 2007 campaign. The corruption case that led to Wednesday’s ruling focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014. At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential campaign. During the inquiry, they discovered that Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias “Paul Bismuth.” Wiretapped conversations on those phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising magistrate Gilbert Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case involving Sarkozy. Azibert never got the post and legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the case he was seeking information about. Prosecutors had concluded, however, that the proposal still constitutes corruption under French law, even if the promise wasn’t fulfilled. Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention in his offer to help Azibert. Azibert and Herzog have also been found guilty in the case.

Four people - including two security guards and two men staying in the camp - were fatally shot in Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline near Dunkirk, the city's chief prosecutor Charlotte Huet said in a statement, as reported by French media. The gunman also confessed to an earlier shooting in the nearby town of Wormhout, the prosecutor added. Dunkirk's Mayor Patrice Vergriete said the motive behind the attacks \"remains unknown\". Several firearms were found in the suspect's car and he was previously unknown to police, the prosecutor's statement said. All five murders were reportedly committed within less than two hours in the Dunkirk area. According to the prosecutor, a 29-year-old man was killed with \"several gunshots\" at 15:15 local time (14:15 GMT) outside his house in Wormhout, a village just south of the city. About 45 minutes later, two security guards aged 33 and 37 were killed near a port in Loon-Plage, just west of Dunkirk, Huet added. Minutes later, two other men aged 19 and 30 were also shot dead. They were staying in the nearby migrant camp, the prosecutor said. BBC News has contacted local authorities for comment. Mayor Vergriete described the incident as a \"tragedy\" and said \"an individual coldly murdered several people\" in the area. Xavier Bertrand, head of the region's assembly, confirmed on X that five people had died in a \"tragic event\". French media reported a large emergency services presence close to a migrant camp, though it is unclear if the shootings took place inside a settlement. Loon-Plage is home to several temporary settlements housing migrants. It is near to Calais and the Strait of Dover, which is the narrowest part of the Channel. Similar camps along France's northern coast have been used by people attempting to reach the UK via small boats.

Pelicot’s ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot , and all but one of his co-defendants were convicted of sexually assaulting her over a period of nearly a decade after he’d knocked her unconscious by lacing her food and drink with drugs. The other co-defendant was convicted of drugging and raping his own wife with Dominique Pelicot’s help. Gisele Pelicot arrives at the court house in Avignon for the verdicts.

I never regretted making this decision. I have trust in our capacity to collectively project ourselves toward a future where all, women and men, can live in harmony, with respect and mutual understanding. Thank you.” This courtroom sketch shows Gisèle Pelicot, left, and her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot during the trial on Sept. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Valentin Pasquier, File) Maximum penalty for her ex-husband The court found Dominique Pelicot guilty on all charges and sentenced him to 20 years in prison, which was the maximum possible. At age 72, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He won’t be eligible to request early release until he’s served at least two-thirds of the sentence. Dominique Pelicot and the other defendants stood up, one after the other, as chief judge Roger Arata read out the verdicts and sentences, which took more than an hour. Gisèle Pelicot sometimes nodded her head as verdicts were announced. Dominique Pelicot’s lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, said she would consider an appeal, but she also expressed hope that Gisèle Pelicot would find solace in the rulings. “I wanted Mrs. Pelicot to be able to emerge from these hearings in peace, and I think that the verdicts will contribute to this relief for Mrs. Pelicot,” she said.

(AP Photo/Lewis Joly) Supporters decry some sentences as too low Of the 50 accused of rape, just one was acquitted but was instead convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Another man was also found guilty of the sexual assault charge he was tried for — producing 51 guilty verdicts in all. In a side room where defendants’ family members watched the proceedings on television screens, some burst into tears and gasped as sentences were revealed. Protesters outside the courthouse followed the developments on their phones. Some read out the verdicts and applauded as they were announced inside. But disquiet grew as many of the sentences were lower than campaigners had hoped for, and cries of “shame on the justice system!” rose up from the crowd. In addition to the 20 years they sought for Dominique Pelicot , prosecutors asked for sentences of 10 to 18 years for the others charged with rape. But the court was more lenient, with many defendants getting less than a decade in prison. The five judges voted by secret ballot, by majority for the convictions and sentences. Members of the feminist collective “Les Amazones Avignon” post a message of support for Gisele Pelicot reading “In France in 2024, 94 percent of the rapists are acquitted” near the courthouse, on Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Lewis Joly) For the defendants other than Dominique Pelicot, sentences ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment, with some of the time suspended for some of them. Arata told six defendants they were now free, accounting for time already spent in pretrial detention. Sophie Burtin, 53, who traveled from Lyon to show support for Gisèle Pelicot, said the trial “brought the subject of rape out into open” but expressed disappointment that “the sentences aren’t at all exemplary.” “Some men will think, ‘OK, it’s alright, what they did wasn’t really a rape,’” she said. “The message that’s sent is, ‘Is it really serious?’ — with sentences that are so light. For me, It was meant to be a historic trial, but the feeling I have is that history hasn’t been made.” All 51 men, including Dominique Pelicot, were found guilty on Thursday in the drugging-and-rape trial of Gisèle Pelicot. Here’s what to know. Who is Gisèle Pelicot? Gisèle Pelicot’s courage during the bruising trial and her appalling ordeal, inflicted on the retired power company worker in what she had thought was a loving marriage, galvanized campaigners and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. She waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushed for the hearings and shocking evidence — including her ex-husband’s homemade videos of the rapes — to be heard in open court, insisting that shame should fall on her abusers, not her. Members of the media wait inside the Avignon courthouse, southern France, Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Lewis Joly) The hearings fueled conversations on a national level in France and among families, couples and friends about how to better protect women and the role that men can play. “Men are starting to talk to women — their girlfriends, mothers and friends — in ways they hadn’t before,” said Fanny Foures, 48, who joined other women in gluing messages of support for Gisèle Pelicot on walls around Avignon before the verdict. “It was awkward at first, but now real dialogues are happening,” she said. “Some women are realizing, maybe for the first time, that their ex-husbands violated them, or that someone close to them committed abuse,” Foures added. “And men are starting to reckon with their own behavior or complicity — things they’ve ignored or failed to act on. It’s heavy, but it’s creating change.” A banner that campaigners hung on a city wall opposite the courthouse read, “MERCI GISELE” — thank you Gisèle.

He first came to the attention of police in September 2020 when a supermarket security guard caught him surreptitiously filming up women’s skirts. Police subsequently found his library of images documenting years of abuse — more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, stored on computer drives and catalogued in folders marked “abuse,” “her rapists,” “night alone” and other titles. The abundant evidence led police to the other defendants. In the videos, investigators counted 72 different abusers but weren’t able to identify them all.

(AP Photo/Lewis Joly) Although some of the accused — including Dominique Pelicot — acknowledged that they were guilty of rape, many didn’t. Some argued that Dominique Pelicot’s consent covered his wife, too. Some insisted that they hadn’t intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husband’s invitations to come to their home. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were taking part in consensual kink. ___ Associated Press journalist Alex Turnbull in Paris and Nicolas Vaux-Montagny in Lyon, France, contributed.",

(Julien de Rosa, Pool via AP) Read More Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron’s office announced a new government Monday, after the previous Cabinet collapsed in a historic vote prompted by fighting over the country’s budget. The government, put together by newly named Prime Minister Francois Bayrou , includes members of the outgoing conservative-dominated team and new figures from centrist or left-leaning backgrounds. Coming up with a 2025 budget will be the most urgent order of business. The new government enters office after months of political deadlock and crisis and pressure from financial markets to reduce France’s colossal debt. Macron has vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027, but has struggled to govern since snap elections in the summer left no single party with a majority in the National Assembly. Since his appointment 10 days ago, Bayrou has held talks with political leaders from various parties in search of the right balance for the new government. Some critics on Monday were angry at Bayrou for consulting with Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, and some argue the government looks too much like the old one to win lawmakers’ trust.

Residents want more Global tributes pour in to honor Pope Francis after his death Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned this month following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly , leaving France without a functioning government. Le Pen played a key role in Barnier’s downfall by joining her National Rally party’s forces with the left to pass the no-confidence motion. Bayrou will need support from moderate legislators on the right and left to keep his government alive. Banker Eric Lombard will be finance minister, a crucial post when France is working to fulfill its promises to European Union partners to reduce its deficit, estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product this year. Lombard briefly worked as an adviser to a Socialist finance minister in the 1990s. Bayrou has said he supports tax hikes championed by his predecessor, but it’s not clear how the new government can find the right calculation for a budget that satisfies a majority of lawmakers angry over spending cuts. Hard-right Bruno Retailleau stays on as interior minister, with responsibility for France’s security and migration policy. Sebastien Lecornu, who has been at the forefront of France’s military support for Ukraine, remains defense minister, while Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who has traveled extensively in the Mideast in recent weeks, also retains his post. Among new faces are two former prime ministers. Manuel Valls will be minister for overseas affairs, and Elisabeth Borne takes the education ministry.",

Francis appeared relaxed and energized during the one-day visit, just two days before his 88th birthday, still displaying a faded bruise from a fall a week ago. He frequently deviated from his prepared homily during Mass at the outdoor La Place d’Austerlitz, remarking at one point that he had never seen so many children as in Corsica — except, he added, in East Timor on his recent Asian tour. “Make children,″ he implored. ”They will be your joy and your consolation in the future.” Earlier, at the close of a Mediterranean conference on popular piety, Papa Francescu, as he is called in Corsican, described a concept of secularity “that is not static and fixed, but evolving and dynamic,” that can adapt to “unforeseen situations” and promote cooperation “between civil and ecclesial authorities.” The pontiff said that expressions of popular piety, including processions and communal prayer of the Holy Rosary “can nurture constructive citizenship” on the part of Christians. At the same time, he warned against such manifestations being seen only in terms of folklore, or even superstition. RELATED COVERAGE Iconic photos of Pope Francis’ procession captured by AP photographer Photos: The death of a pope begins a centuries-old ritual to elect his successor Photos: Pope Francis’ body is escorted by cardinals and Swiss Guards as mourners look on The visit to Corsica’s capital Ajaccio, the birthplace of Napoleon, is one of the briefest of his papacy beyond Italy’s borders, just about nine hours on the ground, including a 40-minute visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. Francis met privately with Macron at the airport before flying back to Rome. Francis was joined on the dais by the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo, who organized the conference that brought together some 400 participants from Spain, Sicily, Sardinia and southern France. The two-day meeting examined expressions of faith that often occur outside formal liturgies, such as processions and pilgrimages. Often specific to the places where they are practiced, popular piety in Corsica includes the cult of the Virgin Mary, known locally as the “Madunnuccia,” which protected the island from the plague in 1656 when it was still under Genoa. Corsica stands out from the rest of secularized France as a particularly devout region, with 92 confraternities, or lay associations dedicated to works of charity or piety, with over 4,000 members. “It means that there is a beautiful, mature, adult and responsible collaboration between civil authorities, mayors, deputies, senators, officials and religious authorities,’’ Bustillo told The Associated Press ahead of the visit. “There is no hostility between the two. And that is a very positive aspect because in Corsica there is no ideological hostility.” The visit was awash in signs of popular piety. The pope was greeted by children in traditional garb and was continually serenaded by bands, choruses and singing troupes that are central to Corsican culture from the airport, to the motorcade route, convention center and cathedral. Thousands stood along the roadside to greet the pontiff and more waved from windows. Renè Colombani traveled with 2,000 others by ship from northern Corsica to Ajaccio, on the western coast, to see the pope. “It is an event that we will not see again in several years. It may be the only time that the pope will come to Corsica. And since we wanted to be a part of it, we have come a long way″ Colombani said. The island, which Genoa ceded to France in 1768, is located closer to the Italian mainland than France. From the conference, the pope traveled to the 17th-century cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta to meet with clergy, stopping along the way at the statue of the Madunnuccia where he lit a devotional candle. The pope celebrated Mass beneath a looming statue of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor whose armies in 1808 annexed the papal states and imprisoned two of Francis’ predecessors — Popes Pius VI and VII — before being excommunicated and eventually defeated on the battlefield. Thousands packed the esplanade where Napoleon is said to have played as a child. Francis met with Macron at the airport before departing for the 50-minute flight back to Rome. They discussed Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Middle East and security issues in Africa’s Sahel and Great Lakes regions, Haiti and Sudan, Macron’s office said in a statement. Macron welcomed the pope’s “calls for peace, non-violence and respect for human rights,” the statement said. Both Macron and Francis expressed their “deep concern” regarding the situation in Gaza and called for “an immediate and lasting ceasefire” and “the massive delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid,” according to Macron’s office. On Syria, they reiterated their wish to see a “fair and inclusive political transition,” the statement said. Macron presented the pope with two books about Notre Dame Cathedral. The pontiff pointedly did not make the trip to Paris earlier this month for the pomp surrounding the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral following the devastating 2019 fire. The visit to Corsica seems far more suited to Francis’ priorities than a grand cathedral reopening, emphasizing the “church of the peripheries.” It was Francis’ third trip to France, each time avoiding Paris and the protocols that a state visit entails. He visited the port of Marseille in 2023 , on an overnight visit to participate in an annual summit of Mediterranean bishops, and went to Strasbourg in 2014 to address the European Parliament and Council of Europe . Corsica is home to more than 340,000 people and has been part of France since 1768. But the island has also seen pro-independence violence and has an influential nationalist movement. Last year, Macron proposed granting it limited autonomy. Given the short flight back to Rome, Francis didn’t hold an airborne press conference en route home, the first time he has skipped the traditional briefing in 47 foreign trips as pope. Francis did come to the back of the plane though to greet reporters and receive a pretend birthday cake. __ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The deaths were confirmed after an early morning rescue operation involving French emergency services and the navy’s “Dauphin” helicopter. Around 50 people were stranded in the water and on the beach near Sangatte at around 6 a.m., according to the regional prefecture. Rescuers assisted 45 individuals, including four who were transported to hospitals. Three unconscious people were pulled from the water but could not be revived, despite efforts by medical teams. An investigation has been opened by prosecutors in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Jacques Billant, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said an overcrowded boat may have contributed to the tragedy. “There were more people attempting to board than the boat could hold,” he said during a press conference Sunday. Angela Eagle, the U.K. border security and asylum minister, said the boats were operated by smugglers the government has vowed to stop. “This morning, lives have been lost at sea because ruthless criminals running the small boat trade are overloading people into unseaworthy vessels,” Eagle said. “This government is committed to smashing these gangs.” RELATED COVERAGE Defending migrants was a priority for Pope Francis from the earliest days of his papacy Photos: The people who have lost their businesses as migration in the Darien Gap dries up The EU moves to fast-track asylum claims by migrants from 7 countries to speed deportation Sunday’s tragedy comes during a spike in Channel crossing attempts as 2024 draws to a close. Officials have noted a significant increase in attempted crossings over the past few days. “Since Dec. 24, 23 maritime incidents have been thwarted by internal security forces, saving over 1,000 lives,” said Billant. “But crossing attempts continue, despite extremely dangerous sea conditions. The water is icy, so survival time in the water is very short.” This year has been one of the deadliest for migrants attempting the perilous journey between France and England, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, with at least 76 deaths reported by officials. More than 36,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in 2023, though fewer than in 2022. Billant also blamed human traffickers for putting lives at risk. “These are low-quality boats put into the water solely for profit by these criminal networks, which have no regard for the lives of these children, women and men,” he said. In November, a French court convicted 18 people in a migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people across the English Channel. Despite French and British efforts to stop it, the route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work. __ Associated Press writer Brian Melley contributed to this story —— Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

They were part of a crew of seven who had gone to the aid of another boat which had got into difficulty as Storm Miguel struck the area. Winds of up to 147km/h hit northern Spain earlier, swirling around the Bay of Biscay and moving on to France. The storm is unusual, coming at the start of the summer tourist season. Photographs of the National Society of Sea Rescue rescue boat captured it rolling in large swells in the moments before it capsized, after which the vessel ran ashore upside down. Four of the seven crew aboard the rescue boat managed to swim to shore. Three helicopters and around 60 firefighters were attempting to find the bodies of the three dead.

Down the coast of the VendÃ©e area, off the beach resort of Les Sables-d'Olonne, a crew from the SNSM sea rescue service went to the aid of a fishing boat in trouble and capsized some 800m off shore. \"The sea was quite atrocious,\" mayor Yannick Moreau told news channel BFMTV. \"The boat had a crew of seven and three rescuers have died. It's a big shock for us and a big shock for the whole town.\" Ten French departments were placed on orange alert and warned of potential damage, particularly to trees. Rail travel in the west was disrupted by the storm and forecasters said such images were rare in June. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Media caption, Video showed the aftermath of the explosion, with flames engulfing the ground floor The death toll from a suspected gas explosion in central Paris has risen to four after rescue workers found the body of a woman in the rubble. Two firefighters and a Spanish tourist were also killed in Saturday's blast at a bakery near a popular area. Dozens more people were injured in the blast, which also caused damage in nearby streets. The cause was thought to be accidental, though other explanations have not been excluded, the Paris prosecutor said. Image source, AFP Image caption, Damage from the blast in a corner extended over a large area Some 30 firefighters were involved in the search for a woman who had been declared missing, reports say. The body found on Sunday was in the process of being identified, a spokesman for the Paris fire service said. Search efforts would continue, he said, although rescue workers were no longer looking for anyone reported missing as such, he said. The latest casualty figures were nine people seriously injured, including one firefighter, and another 45 people with lighter injuries, including six firefighters, suffering from hearing or psychological difficulties, he added. Work was going on to reinforce the buildings hit by the blast, and residents \"would have to wait a long time\" before being allowed to return home, he added.

It took sailors on HMS Argyll just eight hours to save every person aboard the 28,000-tonne merchant ship in the Bay of Biscay after the ship's cargo of containers and cars caught fire. The crew aboard the Grande America merchant ship had been trying to fight the flames but were forced to abandon it, climbing into their lifeboat despite the 5m to 6m swirls in the sea at night.

On receiving a mayday message, the Argyll moved 150 miles through difficult sea conditions to launch their small sea boat, which was used to nudge the lifeboat against the safety of the frigate so the crew could be lifted to safety one-by-one.

Police fired tear gas and water cannon as the protests turned violent after weeks of relative calm, during which marches had attracted declining numbers of participants. A Banque Tarneaud branch spewed flames before firefighters arrived and rescued a woman and her infant from the building, with 11 suffering minor injuries, the fire department said. Rioters also set fire to an upmarket handbag store and two news-stands on the Champs Elysees, while scattered bonfires burned on the thoroughfare. Protesters hurled cobblestones at riot police through clouds of tear gas in front of the Arc de Triomphe monument, which was ransacked at the peak of the protests in December. Police arrested nearly 240 protesters as rioters looted stores around the Champs Elysees and wrecked the high-end Fouquet’s restaurant. The canvas awning was later set on fire of the swanky brasserie, known in France as the place where conservative Nicolas Sarkozy celebrated his presidential election victory in 2007. Several hundred meters (yards) down the Champs Elysees, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told journalists the latest violence was unacceptable and all would be done to bring perpetrators to justice. “We are dealing with several hundred, several thousand in some cases, highly determined people who are there to create disorder,” Philippe said. Police said 42 protestors, 17 of their own officers and one firefighter were injured. Protesters clash with French riot police during a demonstration by the \"yellow vests\" movement in Paris, France, March 16, 2019. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer The interior ministry estimated 10,000 people had participated in the protest in Paris, compared with 3,000 on the previous Saturday. Nationwide, protesters were estimated at 32,300, compared with 28,600 last week. ULTRA VIOLENT Macron cut short a weekend ski trip in the Pyrenees to return to the capital on Saturday night after the violence, the Elysees presidential palace said. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that although the protest was relatively small, there had been more than 1,500 “ultra violent” people out looking for trouble. “They decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack - and I use their words - Paris,” Castaner said, adding that more than 1,400 police officers were mobilised. A separate, peaceful march against climate change through central Paris drew as many 36,000 people, police estimated. Some 145,000 people marched nationwide. Yellow vest protesters had promised to draw bigger numbers to mark the fourth month since the movement erupted in mid November over since-scrapped fuel tax hikes and the cost of living. Named after the high-visibility vests French drivers have to keep in their cars and worn by protesters, the revolt swelled into a broader movement against Macron, his reforms and elitism. However, the weekly demonstrations, held every Saturday in Paris and other cities, have been generally getting smaller since December, when Paris saw some of the worst vandalism and looting in decades. Slideshow (19 Images) After the spike in violence, Macron offered a package of concessions worth more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners. His government ordered police to crack down on the protests in January, leading to complaints of police brutality. The 41-year-old former investment banker also launched a series of national debates aimed at determining what policies people want the government to focus on. Saturday’s protests coincided with the end of the debates.

Thousands of Parisians watched in horror from behind police cordons as a ferocious blaze devastated Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday night, destroying its spire and a large part of the roof. An investigation has been opened by the prosecutor’s office, but police said it began accidentally and may be linked to building work at the cathedral. The 850-year-old gothic masterpiece had been undergoing restoration work. Huge fire sweeps through Notre Dame Cathedral – in pictures Read more The French president, Emmanuel Macron, attended the scene and later gave a speech in which he vowed that the cathedral would be rebuilt, as fire crews said the landmark’s rectangular bell towers and structure of the building had been saved.

Video: Notre Dame's spire collapses in huge fire Macron said “the worst had been avoided” thanks to hundreds of brave firefighters who battled for hours and who would continue working through the night. One firefighter was severely injured but no other casualties were reported. Interactive “What happened tonight in Paris, in this cathedral, is a terrible event,” the president said, vowing to raise funds worldwide and bring the best talents from around the world to reconstruct the building in its entirety. “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives ... So I solemnly say tonight: we will rebuild it together.” Macron announced an international fundraising campaign to raise money for the repairs. French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, the chairman and CEO of international luxury group Kering, pledged 100 million euros towards rebuilding Notre Dame. Laurent Nunez, junior minister of the interior said on Tuesday: “Now the fire danger has been dealt with, there is the issue of the building and whether the structure has resisted the very serious fire. A meeting of experts and national architects is taking place this morning to consider whether the building is stable and whether fire-officers can set up inside to continue their work.” Franck Riester, the culture minister, said the situation was still precarious but he was hopeful. “We’re optimistic because the two belfries were saved.” He said it was too early to determine exactly which pieces of priceless art were damaged, saying the organ had been affected and paintings may have suffered from water damage. Thousands of Parisians – many weeping and some praying – watched as vast orange flames soared from the roof for hours, threatening one of the greatest architectural treasures of the western world. There were gasps on the southern bank of the river Seine as locals watched fire sweep across the roof, which slowly caved in.

Photograph: Rafael Yaghobzadeh/AP The 12th-century cathedral is home to priceless works of art and is one of the world’s most famous tourist attractions, immortalised in Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It attracts about 13 million visitors a year from around the world. “We consider the two towers of Notre Dame to have been saved,” the Paris fire-service commander Jean-Claude Galler said at around 11pm, as firefighters were still working to contain flames. The fire service said the fire had been reduced and it was a major accomplishment by hundreds of firefighters that the flames were stopped from spreading to the north tower belfry. However, the roof “had been ravaged”, with around two thirds destroyed. Fire brigade officers, who were preparing to spend the night attempting to cool the building, said the structure of the cathedral was “saved and preserved”. A spokesman said there was still a risk that scaffolding in the heart of the building could collapse. By 7pm, flames had burst through the roof of the cathedral and quickly engulfed the lead and wood structure of the cathedral’s spire, which collapsed.

Photograph: François Guillot/AFP/Getty Images The spire had been added to the building in the 19th century. As part of its renovations, several bronze statues that surrounded the spire had been removed. The wooden frame at the top of the 13th-century landmark was made from so many oak beams that it was known as “the forest”. That wood proved so combustible, the Paris fire service said, that it there was a danger to firefighters. Smoke billowed into the sky, visible from across the city, and ash fell in the surrounding area. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said that most artworks and religious relics were removed from Notre Dame as firefighters worked to control the blaze. France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, posted photos on social media of people loading art on to trucks.

On the left bank of the river Seine, thousands of onlookers gathered at police cordons watching as the flames burned high into the clear blue sky. As part of the roof gradually collapsed in flames, bangs and crackles could be heard from the street. Some people sang Catholic liturgies as they watched. Others sank to their knees. Many were in tears. 0:49 Parisians sing hymns as they watch Notre Dame burning – video Camille, 20, from Normandy, a history student at the Sorbonne, watched as flames blazed through the frame of one of the cathedral’s smaller stained glass windows. “There’s a feeling of total sadness and also anger,” she said. “It’s our heritage. Whether you’re Christian or not, part of our history is going up in smoke.” Alexis, 35, a finance worker, had hurried to the scene after seeing the first images on the television news. “I rushed down. I never thought it would be this depressing,” he said. Over the course of an hour, he watched as the flames spread across the roof and sections of it slowly collapsed. A 55-year-old furniture restorer, who did not wish to give his name, said: “This is a major moment,” he said. “This building is a symbol of Catholicism. It’s a symbol of Paris.” On the north side of the cathedral on the Île Saint-Louis, more crowds had gathered. “It’s a national tragedy,” said Paul Rechter, who lives barely 100 metres from the cathedral. “It’s a symbol of France that is collapsing there, part of our national identity going up in smoke. Part of our history, our culture, our literature ... How on earth could it have happened? Why were there no precautions?” The Guardian view on the Notre Dame fire: we share France’s terrible loss Read more His wife Agnes said her parents and grandparents had lived on the Île Saint Louis and the Île de la Cité. “We have known the cathedral since childhood,” she said. “It’s part of our personal history, too.” She said she thought most of all of “the centuries of work, of craftsmanship, that went into that building ... The number of men who have worked on it down the years.” Pierre Mesnage, 44, who has lived on the Île de la Cité for the past 20 years in an apartment that overlooks the cathedral, said: “I cried when I saw it, honestly. I wept. I see that building every single day, all day if I’m at home. It’s a drama. A personal and a national tragedy. I’m a Catholic, too, so there’s an added significance. I really don’t understand how it could happen. This is an emblem of Paris, an emblem of France. Why wasn’t it protected?” Ruud van der Leij, a computer studies teacher from Rotterdam, said he had been staring at the flames for more than two hours. “You can’t look away,” he said. “It’s awful and fascinating at the same time. A terrible, awful, sad affair. Such a symbol.” Marina Valleix, 42, said she had come specially from her home in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. “I do treasure hunts with clues, for children, round the big Paris monuments,” she said. “I’m here more or less every weekend.

Credit... Benoit/Paris Fire Brigade, via Associated Press By Aurelien Breeden Feb. 4, 2019 PARIS — At least 10 people were killed and 37 injured after a fast-moving fire that may have been intentionally set coursed through an eight-story building in a residential part of western Paris on Tuesday. The fire, which the authorities were treating as a possible case of arson and which appeared to be tied to a neighborhood dispute, was the deadliest in the French capital in over a decade. Footage from the scene provided by the Paris Fire Department to French television showed flames bursting through the upper windows of the building and black smoke swirling around the courtyard, as firefighters climbed up ladders to reach people at their windows. Some were lowered to the ground using harnesses. The police opened a criminal investigation and Rémy Heitz, the Paris prosecutor, told reporters early Tuesday that a 40-year-old woman who lived in the building, on Rue Erlanger, in the 16th Arrondissement, had been taken into custody nearby. “This person was arrested overnight, not far from the scene, not far from the fire,” Mr. Heitz said. He said that the woman had a history of mental health issues but did not provide more details about her identity or the reasons for her arrest. The fire was the deadliest in Paris since 2005, when 24 people, including 11 children, were killed in a hotel near the Paris Opera , a tragedy that was the worst of its kind since World War II. Later that same year, a fire in a dilapidated apartment building in the 13th Arrondissement killed 17 people. In 2015, eight people died in a fire that tore through an apartment building in the 18th Arrondissement of the capital. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Jean-Francois Monier / AFP New tensions on Monday flared in France's eastern city of Dijon after it was rocked by a weekend of unrest blamed on Chechens seeking vengeance for an assault on a teenager. Police sources said the unrest was sparked by an attack on a 16-year-old member of the Chechen community on June 10. Members of the Chechen diaspora then set out on so-called punishment raids seeking to avenge the assault, they said. news Russian TV Channel Appears to Add Footage of US Unrest to Film Read more After three successive nights of violence, early Monday evening some 150 people, some hooded and armed, again assembled in Dijon, setting rubbish bins and a car on fire. Some also shot into the air, police sources told AFP. \"What happened is unprecedented and unacceptable,\" the city's mayor, Francois Rebsamen, told AFP. Attacks had already taken place on three successive nights starting Friday, with many people wielding baseball bats. The local prefect Bernard Schmeltz — the top state official in the region — said in a statement that the violence \"appeared to be part of a settling of scores between members of the Chechen community in France and residents\" of Dijon. Police said that in one incident some 50 Chechens entered the restive district of Gresilles overnight Saturday, and a man who owns a pizzeria was badly wounded by apparent gunfire. Even more people, around 200, also entered Gresilles late on Sunday with violent intent. In an interview with local daily Le Bien Public, a man claiming to be a Chechen said the raids aimed to avenge an assault by local drug dealers on the 16-year-old. \"There were about a hundred of us from all over France but also from Belgium and Germany. We never intended to ransack the city or take it out on the people,\" said the man, who was not identified by name. Dijon prosecutor Eric Mathais said a total of six people had been injured in the three incidents on the successive nights, but no one has yet been arrested. A probe has been opened into attempted murder by a criminal gang, he added. Rebsamen said the police reinforcements were arriving after he spoke by telephone with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Thirty-seven anti-riot police members came on Sunday, while 110 additional gendarmes will be deployed from Monday, he said. Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus. Two wars in the 1990s triggered a wave of emigration, with many Chechens heading for western Europe.

A man, 22, stabbed passers-by in a park in Villejuif, about 8km (5 miles) south of the French capital, on Friday. He was later identified by prosecutors as Nathan C, a 22-year-old with a history of mental illness for which he had been admitted to hospital. According to French media, witnesses heard him say that he was \"out of medication\". Prosecutors said that some religious items were later found in his bag, but that there was \"no evidence at this stage suggesting he was radicalised\". The attack took place at about 14:00 local time (13:00 GMT) at Hautes-Bruyères park, and the targets appeared to have been chosen at random. In a statement posted on Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to the victims. \"I extend my support to the victims of the attack, their families and the police,\" he said. \"We resolutely pursue the fight against indiscriminate violence and our fight for the security of all French people.\" The mayor of Villejuif, Franck Le Bohellec, said the deceased victim was a 56-year-old man who was out walking in the park with his wife at the time of the attack. He died trying to protect her, the mayor said. She was seriously injured. France's Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, who later visited the scene, praised the police response, calling it \"extremely courageous\".

This 26 th edition will take place at Charléty Stadium from 26 to 30 August 2020. Paris will host the European Athletics Championships 2020 thanks to an ambitious and ecological application. From the moment these championships opened to applicants, Paris put everything in place to propose an excellent application. The French Athletics Federation and the Paris 2020 committee made a number of outstanding presentations in front of the various stakeholders. Their application had an even greater impact due to the fact that it benefited from considerable support from the public authorities both in Paris and in France as a whole. “I’m delighted that the European Athletics Council validated the Parisian project to host the European Athletics Championships 2020. It’s an ambitious yet realistic project, which will enable us to return our sport to centre stage again, shortly after the Olympic Games,” said European Athletics President Svein Arne Hansen. André Giraud, President of the French Athletics Federation, said, “Hosting the European Championships in France is a great opportunity for us to unify our clubs and our members around a popular event, which is intended to convey our values: setting new targets, commitment and solidarity…” Paris 2020, a neutral ecological footprint “I’m sure that Paris is capable of organising some fantastic championships, on a par with those organised over recent years in Zurich and Amsterdam, as well as those which are being prepared for next year in Berlin”, said President Hansen. Paris is ready to take up the gauntlet by organising a responsible championships. Indeed, through the Green Inspiration concept, the organisation team for Paris 2020 is keen to reduce the environmental impact of the competition. Firstly, by reducing the distances between the athletes’ village, the University campus and the competition site, Charléty Stadium. Between the two key venues, it’s just 5 minutes’ walk. They’ll also be proposing some special offers, which will encourage spectators to favour public transport. Communication will not be outdone either as the digital and paperless formats will help to reduce the event’s carbon footprint, something to inspire new generations for the foreseeable future. “I’m delighted to be supporting this event,” said Pierre Weiss, President of the organising committee, “as you’re supposed to be federative to promote athletics, and it also shows off France’s expertise in terms of the organisation of environmentally-friendly events.” Athletics at Charléty, a great story Despite the fact that France is one of the oldest European federations, the French public has had just one opportunity to support its athletes on home soil for the European Athletics Championships, back in 1938 at the Olympic Stadium in Colombes. At this time, the championships were reserved for men, with 272 athletes from 23 different nations. Meantime, the women competed in a special championship in Vienna. The stakes will be a lot higher in 2020, since nearly 1,500 athletes, from 51 member federations of the European Athletics will be expected to compete at Sébastien Charléty Stadium, to the south-east of Paris. The stadium, which can accommodate 20,000 people, is a prime venue in the history of athletics as it hosted the Finals of the IAAF Grand Prix in 1994 and 2002. In 2017, the MEETING de PARIS (IAAF Diamond League) will also be held at the Charléty Stadium, on Saturday 1 July. “Charléty Stadium offers a fantastic infrastructure for athletics and the Parisian public has a reputation for being enthusiastic. The stadium’s capacity is perfect for the European Athletics Championships and so it’s likely to attract a big crowd, particularly during the evening sessions,” said President Hansen. “These different factors, combined with its expertise in terms of the French Athletics Federation and local protagonists, as well as the presence of Europe’s top athletes, are a guarantee that these championships will remain etched in people’s minds”. Paris accueillera les Championnats d’Europe d’Athlétisme 2020 European Athletics a officialisé ce vendredi 28 avril la nomination de Paris en tant que ville-hÃ´te des Championnats d’Europe d’Athlétisme 2020. Cette 26 ème édition se déroulera au Stade Charléty du 26 au 30 aoÃ»t 2020. Paris accueillera donc les Championnats d’Europe d’athlétisme en 2020, grÃ¢ce Ã  une candidature ambitieuse et écologique. Dès les premiers jours de l’ouverture aux candidatures pour ces championnats, Paris a tout mis en Å“uvre pour faire valoir sa candidature. La Fédération franÃ§aise d’athlétisme et le comité Paris 2020 ont réalisé de remarquables présentations devant les différentes parties prenantes. La candidature a été d’autant plus impactante qu’elle a bénéficié du soutien considérable des pouvoirs publics parisiens et franÃ§ais. “Je suis ravi que le conseil de European Athletics ait validé le projet parisien pour accueillir les Championnats d’Europe d’Athlétisme 2020. Un projet ambitieux et réaliste qui permettra de remettre notre sport sur le devant de la scène, peu après les Jeux olympiques,” a déclaré le Président de European Athletics, Svein Arne Hansen. “ Accueillir les Championnats d’Europe en France est pour nous une occasion formidable de fédérer nos clubs et nos licenciés autour d’un événement populaire qui se veut vecteur de nos valeurs : dépassement de soi, engagement, solidarité… ” souligne André Giraud, Président de la Fédération franÃ§aise d’athlétisme. Paris 2020, une empreinte écologique neutre “ Je suis certain que Paris saura organiser de formidables championnats, Ã  la hauteur de ceux organisés ces dernières années Ã  Zurich et Amsterdam, ou encore de ceux qui se préparent l’année prochaine Ã  Berlin, “ a souligné le Président Svein Arne Hansen. Paris est prÃªte Ã  relever le défi, en organisant des championnats responsables. Avec le concept Green Inspiration , l’organisation de Paris 2020 souhaite réduire l’impact environnemental de la compétition. D’abord, en réduisant les distances entre le village des athlètes, Ã  la Cité Universitaire, et le site de compétition, le Stade Charléty. Entre les deux, seulement 5 minutes Ã  pied ! Mais également en proposant des offres spécifiques qui pousseront les spectateurs Ã  privilégier les transports en commun. La communication ne sera pas en reste. Le digital et les formats dématérialisés aideront Ã  réduire l’empreinte carbone de cet événement. De quoi inspirer durablement les nouvelles générations ! “ Je suis ravi de porter cet événement , dit Pierre Weiss, Président du comité d’organisation, car il se veut fédérateur pour promouvoir l’athlétisme, mais parce qu’il démontre également l’expertise de la France en matière d’organisation et d’évènements écoresponsables. “ L’athlétisme Ã  Charléty, une belle histoire Malgré que la France soit une des fédérations européennes les plus anciennes, le public franÃ§ais n’a eu qu’une seule occasion de soutenir ses athlètes sur son territoire pour des Championnats d’Europe d’athlétisme. C’était en 1938, au Stade Olympique de Colombes. A cette époque, les championnats étaient réservés aux hommes, avec 272 athlètes de 23 nations différentes. Les femmes, quant Ã  elles, participaient Ã  un championnat spécifique Ã  Vienne. L’enjeu sera bien plus important, en 2020, puisque près de 1 500 athlètes, provenant des 51 Fédérations Membres de European Athletics, seront attendus au Stade Sébastien Charléty, au Sud Est de Paris. Le stade, qui bénéficie d’une capacité d’accueil de 20 000 personnes, est un haut lieu de l’histoire de l’athlétisme, puisqu’il a accueilli les Finales du Grand Prix IAAF en 1994 et 2002. En 2017, le MEETING de PARIS (IAAF Diamond League) se déroulera également au Stade Charléty, le samedi 1 er juillet. “ Le Stade Charléty offre des infrastructures formidables pour l’athlétisme, et le public parisien est connu pour Ãªtre passionné. La capacité du stade est idéale pour les Championnats d’Europe et laisse présager un public très nombreux, notamment lors des sessions nocturnes, a souligné le Président Hansen. “ Ces différents facteurs, combinés Ã  l’expertise en matière d’organisation de la Fédération franÃ§aise d’athlétisme et des acteurs locaux, ainsi que la présence des meilleurs athlètes européens sont l’assurance que ces championnats resteront gravés dans les mémoires. “ Share On : Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email Previous news Next news Follow us Official Partners Official Partners Official Partners Official Partners Official Partners Official Partners Broadcast Partner Broadcast Partner Preferred Suppliers Supporting Hotel Photography Agency Competitions & Calendar Competitions Calendar & Results Competition Regulations Inside European Athletics Organisation Member Federations Event Hosting Medical & Anti Doping Integrity Athletes & Data Athlete Profiles Top Lists European Rankings Records Our Partners Careers Contact Us Address Avenue Louis-Ruchonnet 16 1003 Lausanne, Switzerland Tel: +41 (21) 313 4350 office@european-athletics.org Copyright © 2024.

(Photo by Lucas BARIOULET / AFP) (Photo by LUCAS BARIOULET/AFP via Getty Images) Paris (CNN) Police in Paris were forced to call for backup on Friday as dozens of protesters outside a theater tried to storm the building and reach President Emmanuel Macron . The Elysee presidential palace told CNN that protesters had tried to enter the building, while video on social media shows police tussling with protesters outside the Bouffes du Nord theater's building. Several demonstrators entered the building before being dragged back out by police. Riot police holding up shields formed a line against the protesters, who shouted \"Macron, out,\" in the latest of more than a month of protests against the embattled President's pension reform plans. The President and his wife, Brigitte Macron, \"were secured\" for several minutes but were able to return and finish watching \"The Fly,\" French news agency AFP reported, citing sources from the President's office. French newspaper Le Monde reported online that police called for reinforcement to quell the protests and to escort the President and his wife home. Read More Journalist and political activist Taha Bouhafs posted a video from inside the theater showing the back of the President's head, making comments that allegedly invited activists to come and disrupt the show. Bouhafs has been arrested over the tweet, on suspicion of taking part in a group formed to commit violence or damage, a French judicial source told CNN. Protests across France over pension reforms have hit fuel and power supplies, and cause large-scale transport disruption and the shutdown of schools. Macron says the changes are necessary to make the system fairer and more sustainable, but unions say workers will lose out. CNN's Angela Dewan and Arnaud Siad contributed to this report.

France 2 and M6 followed with 9.55 and 3.74 million viewers, respectively, according to Statista.\nDuring his speech Monday from the Elysée Palace in Paris, Macron apologized for his government “not being prepared enough” for the coronavirus crisis and announced that the shelter at home lockdown, which began on March 17, would extend until May 11. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Oliver Jokes Katy Perry's \"Ill-Advised\" Whitney Houston Cover Is To Blame For Kamala Harris' Election Loss: \"It's OK Not To Have The Range\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We must therefore continue our efforts and continue to apply the rules,” he said, while promising that “joyous days were ahead.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday’s speech drew the highest numbers for a speech by Macron since the 2018 Yellow Vests crisis, which drew 23 million total viewers.

Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP France This article is more than 4 years old Two injured in knife attack outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices in Paris This article is more than 4 years old Two arrested and counter-terrorism investigation launched after incident Jon Henley and Kim Willsher in Paris Fri 25 Sep 2020 18.12 BST First published on Fri 25 Sep 2020 12.08 BST Share A counter-terrorism investigation has been launched in France after two people were seriously injured in a knife attack in front of the former offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Two arrests have been made and the victims’ lives were not in danger, authorities said. A man wearing bloodstained clothing and carrying a large knife or machete was detained near the Place de la Bastille in eastern Paris shortly after the attack, police said. The victims were a man and a woman employed by a TV production company called Premières Lignes based in the same building as the newspaper’s former offices. A member of staff at Premières Ligne said the pair were having a cigarette outside the building when they were attacked. “There was one assailant who had a very big knife. The attack was very violent. I could hear the screams from the second floor,” the unnamed man said. All schools in the area were placed in lockdown as a security measure. A large meat cleaver found near the scene is believed to have been used by the attacker. France’s counter-terrorism prosecutors’ office said it had opened an investigation into attempted murder in relation to a terrorist enterprise. Jean-François Ricard, the head of the anti-terrorism unit, said the principal suspect, aged 18, was arrested at 1.26pm local time (1226 BST). Analysis of blood on his clothing and CCTV cameras suggested he had carried out the knife attack. A second person, aged 33, was arrested at 1.37pm. “We are currently trying to establish his link to the principal subject,” Ricard said. A crisis control centre was opened at the interior ministry. Map Early reports said four people had been wounded, but police later amended the figure to two. It is unclear what motivated the attack on Friday morning. Charlie Hebdo has moved from its previous address on the Rue Nicolas-Appert since an attack by Islamist extremists in 2015 in which several of its editorial staff, including some of France’s best-known cartoonists, were among 12 people killed. The new address is kept secret for security reasons. The trial of 14 suspects accused of involvement in the Charlie Hebdo killings, carried out by brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, and in a subsequent attack on the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket, is currently under way in Paris. The newspaper republished controversial cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, which it first printed in 2006, to mark the start of the trial, saying in an editorial it would “never lie down … We will never give up”. The staff of Charlie Hebdo sent a message of “support and solidarity” in a tweet, describing Friday’s knife attack as odious. A Premières Lignes employee, who asked not to be identified, said she was sitting at her desk when she heard shouting from the street. “At first it didn’t sound like it was anything bad, but it carried on,” the employee said. “One of the journalists went to the window and looked out and said: ‘There’s something going on. Something’s happening.’” Many of the company’s staff had experienced the Charlie Hebdo attack five years ago and were “in shock”, she said. “They said we must lock the office doors and go up on to the roof. That’s where I looked down and saw one of our colleagues, wounded but alive, in the street. He had been wounded in the head and the hand, I believe.” The employee said the building had since been evacuated. Staff had been interviewed by police and were now waiting in a nearby theatre to hear when they could leave. “Everyone is very shaken,” she said. The prime minister, Jean Castex, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, all visited the scene. Castex gave a brief press conference expressing his thoughts for the family and colleagues of those injured and for the forces of law and order and first responders. He added: “I restate our unwavering attachment to freedom of the press, the fight against terrorism and can assure the nation that we are fully mobilised.” Explore more on these topics France Europe Charlie Hebdo Charlie Hebdo attack news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Paris drivers warned of fines as city begins limiting traffic in parts of centre 5d ago Paris mayor sparks row with plan to keep Olympic rings on Eiffel Tower 2 Sept 2024 Paris mayor swims in Seine as river is cleaned up just in time for Olympics 17 Jul 2024 Paris authority slated for hiking cost of Métro and bus trips during Olympics 6 May 2024 Garçons!

As water levels touched 5.2 metres on Wednesday, the capital’s authorities said the river was expected to reach 6.1 metres (20ft) by Saturday. The river last reached that level, which is 4m higher than its normal height, during the June 2016 flooding when several monuments, including the Louvre museum, were closed as a result. Quayside roads and tunnels have been closed and all river traffic, including cruise boats and water taxis, halted as vessels are unable to pass under the bridges. Houseboat residents have been advised to move out and Michel Delpuech, the head of the city police, told residents to take extreme care near the water. Parisians were also warned they were more likely to come across members of the city’s rat population after the rising water swamped the rodents’ dens and forced them to seek drier shelters.

Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images On Wednesday morning, a central section of the RER C urban rail line was shut down, closing several stations, including Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Musée d’Orsay, and Champ de Mars near the Eiffel Tower. The rail operator, SNCF, said it halted services after closing ventilation shafts to prevent further flooding of tunnels, where staff have been pumping out water. With the city on orange alert, the second highest flood warning level, the mayor, Anne Hidalgo , called a crisis meeting with police chiefs. Officials said the situation was serious but not catastrophic. Part of the Louvre museum, which sits on the bank of the Seine, was closed as works of art were moved to higher ground. The Musee d’Orsay and the Orangerie were also preparing for flooding risks, cancelling their weekly evening opening on Thursday in case works need to be moved. View image in fullscreen The flood warnings have hit during Paris Fashion Week. Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images The river overflowed earlier this week because of flood water from upstream where the basin that feeds the Seine has received twice as much rain as normal. Paris suffered the “flood of the century” in 1910 when the Seine reached 8.62 metres. It has been preparing for a similar event for several years. “It’s not a question of if there will be a flood, but when,” Colombe Brossel, the mayor’s assistant, said in 2016 . Twenty-three French departments are on high flooding alert, from the Alps in eastern France to Normandy in the west. This article was amended on 24 January 2018. Because of an editing error, an earlier version switched the locations of the Alps and Normandy with each other.

Lors de sa visite du 26 mars 2014, le président Xi Jinping avait été fasciné par l’escorte, entre les Invalides et l’Elysée, via le pont Alexandre III, de 104 cavaliers de la Garde républicaine, dit-on à l’Elysée. A l’occasion de sa première visite d’Etat en République populaire de Chine, Emmanuel Macron a donc offert “Vésuve de Brekka” et son harnachement (selle et sabre). Les chevaux de la Garde républicaine représentent l’excellence des missions d’honneur de la Présidence lors de l’accueil de chefs d’Etat. Diplomatie du cheval Le Président de la République français initie avec ce geste, précise-t-on à l’Elysée une “diplomatie du cheval” entre la Garde républicaine et les autorités chinoises via un accord de partenariat qui valorise l’excellence de la filière équine française dotée de nombreux atouts pour accompagner le développement de ce secteur en Chine. C’est donc la “diplomatie du cheval” à la française après la “diplomatie du panda” à la chinoise, Pékin ayant prêté un couple de pandas à Paris en 2012. Le fruit des amours de ce couple est né au zoo de Beauval en novembre. Brigitte Macron en est la marraine. “Vésuve de Brekka” avait participé à sa dernière escorte présidentielle le 11 novembre 2017 sur les Champs-Elysées. Hongre (cheval châtré) bai brun, il est né le 10 juin 2009 à Colomby (Manche) à 25 km de Cherbourg, dans l’élevage de Pierre Le Boulanger. Après avoir passé une semaine d’examens par les spécialistes de la Garde républicaine (radios, comportement aux différentes allures, caractère, …), il a été acquis par le régiment de cavalerie en 2012.  L’unité (450 chevaux), dernier régiment monté de l’armée française, achète régulièrement des chevaux – prix moyen 5.000 ou 6.000 euros – pour remplacer ses équidés réformés à la fin de leur service actif (15 ans en moyenne) ou après un accident. Les chevaux de la Garde républicaine – pour la plupart de race selle français – sont achetés à l’âge de trois ans chez des éleveurs privés, dans des régions traditionnelles d’élevage (Normandie, Manche, Vendée). Ils doivent répondre à des critères de taille (minimum 165 cm au garrot à trois ans), de modèle et présenter une robe franche (alezan, bai ou gris). Les jeunes montures sont débourrées au centre d’instruction de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Le cheval est ensuite confié à un cavalier avec lequel il passera son temps de service. “Vésuve de Brekka”  a voyagé jusqu’en Chine accompagné du chef vétérinaire et du cavalier soigneur de la Garde républicaine. Ils sont arrivés le 4 janvier pour prendre soin du cheval dans une ferme de quarantaine jusqu’à sa remise officielle au président chinois. Le général de division Damien Striebig, commandant de la Garde républicaine, fait partie de la délégation officielle française. Alain Resplandy-Bernard, PDG par intérim du PMU, qui a financé le voyage du cheval en Chine, s’est rendu également sur place. L’opération a bénéficié de l’aide du bureau en Chine de l’Union nationale interprofessionnelle du cheval (Unic) représentant la filière équine française (élevage, courses de trot et de galop, paris hippiques). Selle d’armes modèle 1874 Le cheval a été offert avec son harnachement (selle d’armes et sabre d’officier). La selle d’armes date de 1874 et équipait les régiments de cavalerie de l’armée française. Seule la Garde républicaine utilise des selles de ce type de nos jours. Elle est dépositaire d’un savoir-faire ancien transmis par des générations de maître-selliers. Le sabre d’officier de cavalerie légère est celui du modèle 1822. Ce sabre, qui a équipé l’armée française pendant près de 150 ans, est encore en service au sein de la Garde républicaine. Les armuriers de la Garde républicaine, qui comptent des fourbisseurs parmi eux, exercent un savoir-faire ancestral et conservent un matériel unique en son genre. Le sabre a été gravé : “ Par ailleurs, selon l’Elysée, un accord de partenariat entre la France et la Chine prévoit des actions préparatoires et des actions de formation. Ainsi, une délégation composée de responsables chinois effectuera une visite d’études au sein de la Garde républicaine française d’ici mars 2018. Une délégation de la Garde républicaine fera une mission d’expertise auprès des unités spécialisées de la partie chinoise avant juin 2018. Débourrage et dressage Ensuite, la Garde républicaine accueillera des cavaliers chinois dans le cadre de formations (débourrage, dressage, services d’honneur à cheval). Ces actions de formation pourront être complétées dans les domaines suivants : la création et l’animation d’une commission d’achat de chevaux adaptés aux missions d’honneur, la formation de formateurs ayant vocation à assumer un rôle de formateurs-relais au sein des structures de formation équestre de la partie chinoise, l’éthologie du cheval … La Garde républicaine proposera la réalisation de missions de formation et d’expertise en Chine, par des militaires de la Garde républicaine sur ces mêmes thèmes. Le cheval apparait à maintes reprises dans la mythologie chinoise, il est souvent muni d’une paire d’ailes et il est associé la plupart du temps au dragon. La légende de l’empereur Huangdi, qui fut amené au Ciel par un cheval volant en est une parmi tant d’autres. Le cheval ailé revient souvent en peinture et en sculpture. L’une des pièces maîtresses du musée du Gansu, l’un des plus grands musées de Chine, représente un “cheval au galop volant”. Le cheval est aussi le 7ème animal dans l’astrologie chinoise, il symbolise l’esprit vif et la créativité. Aujourd’hui, la Chine commence à développer sa filière équine avec des élevages et des clubs hippiques. Si les paris de toutes sortes, y compris hippiques, sont interdits en Chine, de riches chinois ont fait construire des hippodromes dans lesquels ils commencent à organiser des courses.

Le Monde | 23.02.2018 à 12h48 Le geste donne la mesure du désespoir. Confrontés à l’annonce de la fermeture des urgences la nuit à l’hôpital de Clamecy, dans le nord de la Nièvre, quelque 35 maires de communes voisines et près d’une quarantaine d’adjoints devaient remettre vendredi 23 février leur démission en sous-préfecture. Les urgences de nuit à Clamecy « sont vitales. Elles sont à un quart d’heure de route. Si elles sont fermées, il faut près d’une heure pour arriver à Nevers. En hiver, avec la neige ou le verglas, c’est pire, il faut une heure et demie à deux heures » , a déclaré le maire de Taconnay, commune de 80 habitants, à l’Agence France-Presse. « On a l’impression d’être complètement abandonnés. On a dû se battre pour garder une école il y a quinze jours » dans une commune voisine. « On a l’impression de devoir se battre pour tout. » Jany Siméon, le maire de la Chapelle-Saint-André, a, lui, pris un arrêté symbolique sur sa commune de 300 habitants « interdisant la fermeture de l’accueil des urgences de nuit à l’hôpital de Clamecy » . Le texte dénonce la « mise en danger de la vie d’autrui » , a précisé l’édile, qui a expliqué que le même arrêté avait été pris par de nombreux maires de la région. « On ne s’interdit pas de porter plainte » , a-t-il complété. Des aménagements « indispensables » Les élus devaient rencontrer vendredi des représentants de l’agence régionale de santé (ARS) de Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, alors que plus d’un millier de personnes avaient manifesté le matin devant les urgences pour le maintien du service de nuit. Selon l’ARS, le nouveau projet régional de santé est actuellement « soumis à consultation » et ne sera arrêté et publié que « courant juin 2018 » . Mais « pour les sites comme Clamecy, des analyses de fréquentation sont réalisées pour apporter une réponse au cas par cas, en adaptant les horaires aux besoins de la population réellement constatés » , a précisé une porte-parole de l’agence. « Des aménagements d’organisation deviennent indispensables, compte tenu du manque d’urgentistes dont souffre la région : il est nécessaire de mieux répartir leur présence sur le territoire » , a poursuivi la même source, ajoutant que le SMUR (service mobile d’urgence et de réanimation) « restera effectif vingt-quatre heures sur vingt-quatre » quoi qu’il arrive. Le préfet dispose d’un mois pour accepter ou non les démissions des élus.

Issued on: 10/02/2025 - 16:57 1 min The island is among the most remote of France's possessions © PATRICK HERTZOG / AFP/File After affecting 18 percent of the small 58 square kilometre (22 square mile) Amsterdam Island on January 29, the fire is now hitting 45 percent of its territory, the prefecture for France's French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) told AFP. \"There has been dry weather, and strong, shifting winds, with many changes of direction since January 15,\" said the prefecture, explaining the expansion of the fire. \"The fire is being allowed to burn, because given the isolation of the island, there is no way to extinguish the fire at the moment,\" it added. Located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, approximately 2,800 (1,740 miles) kilometres southeast of the French overseas territory of La Reunion, Amsterdam Island is one of the most isolated islands in the world. The 31 people -- mainly military personnel and scientists -- who were on the island when the fire broke out were all evacuated by boat the following day to Reunion. It is not yet known what caused the fire. Amsterdam Island is home to the Martin-de-Vivies scientific station, an internationally important site for monitoring greenhouse gas concentration worldwide. \"The base has been affected, the buildings are still standing but some water supply and telecommunications infrastructure is no longer operational,\" the prefecture said. A French naval surveillance frigate Floreal was being despatched to the island to examine the current situation with firefighters and other experts on board. They will go to the site to measure the progress of the fire, the extent of the damage and to investigate the causes of the fire, the prefecture said. A haven for wildlife, the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, none of which have any permanent settled population, also include the remote Kerguelen Islands in the Southern Ocean. © 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

A case of the clade 1b variant was confirmed in the western Brittany region and \"the recommended oversight measures have been implemented\", the ministry said in a statement. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox and related to smallpox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly. The WHO declared an emergency over the virus in August and renewed it on November 22 following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). France's health ministry said the case concerned \"a person who had not travelled to central Africa, a region where several clades variants of the virus have been circulating for several months\". \"However this person was in contact with two people who returned from central Africa. Inquiries are underway to find the origin of the infection and identify all people in contact.\" Clade 1b and other mpox strains have been reported across 80 countries -- 19 of them in Africa -- so far this year, WHO has said previously.

Reports said that one tram, which had been stopped, moved backwards down a slope for unknown reasons, colliding with another tram that was stationary. Videos and photos posted on social media showed two trams containing dozens of people inside. One video shows smoke rising and chaotic scenes as an alarm sounds. A spokesman for the prefecture said an investigation into the cause of the accident has been opened and no fatalities have been confirmed. Prosecutors said the collision was not deliberate. One eyewitness named Johan told AFP news agency that he saw one of the trams reversing at speed, adding: \"We heard a big impact, a big bang.\" Another eyewitness told BFM TV that the doors of the tram flew off on impact. The outlet reported that a large security perimeter was set up in front of the station. The Bas-Rhin region's Fire and Rescue Service posted on X urging people to avoid the area to allow emergency services to access the area. The service's director Rene Cellier said some of the non-fatal injuries reported were \"mostly trauma\", but also include scalp wounds, clavicle fractures, and knee sprains. \"There are also around 100 people who have no particular injuries but are being seen by the doctors,\" Cellier said. He added that around 50 vehicles and 130 firefighters were dispatched to the scene and that the situation \"could have been much more serious\". Emmanuel Auneau, the director of the CTS - which is responsible for managing public transport in Strasbourg - said the two tram drivers were \"not physically injured, but are very shocked\".

Try again 01:46 French Prime Minister François Bayrou sets out his policy priorities in a speech at the National Assembly in Paris on January 14, 2025. © Benoit Tessier, Reuters French Prime Minister François Bayrou on Thursday survived his first vote of no confidence in parliament after the motion, brought by the leftist opposition, failed to gain traction on the far right. The challenge in the National Assembly came after Bayrou's statement this week on his government policy agenda, in which he opened the door to fresh talks on a 2023 pension reform \"without taboo\" but also said that France's \"excessive\" deficits needed to be cut in this year's budget. The speech sparked condemnation from most of the opposition in parliament where Bayrou – in the job only since last month – is well short of an absolute majority, making his government highly vulnerable to any no-confidence vote that, if successful, would force it to resign. Jordan Bardella , the leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), dismissed it as \"idle talk\" by \"a man of spineless continuity\". But the backers of the no-confidence motion, submitted by the hard-left LFI party, failed to win the RN's backing. \"We don't think a no-confidence vote should be a gadget to create a buzz,\" RN deputy Jean-Philippe Tanguy said ahead of the vote. The RN's vice-president, Sebastien Chenu, added also before the vote that his party would judge the government \"not by its words, but by its actions\". Tanguy warned, however, that the RN might still come for Bayrou over his budget for 2025 which is overdue after the previous government of Michel Barnier was toppled over its austerity plans. The new government's budget announcement would be a \"moment of truth\", Tanguy said. 'Another path' The near-certainty of defeat as the vote neared did little to diminish LFI's combativity. \"Mr Prime Minister, the days of your government of unhappiness are numbered,\" said LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard as the debate on the no-confidence motion got under way. \"And when it falls, the monarch will follow,\" he said, in a reference to President Emmanuel Macron , who appointed Bayrou as France's fourth prime minister within a year only last month. Bayrou meanwhile accused the hard left of trying to take France down the path of \"infighting\". The prime minister welcomed the decision of the moderately-left Socialists to deny the LFI motion their backing, despite having been allied with the LFI since last year's general election. The Socialists' defection showed that \"another path towards understanding is opening up\", Bayrou said. The no-confidence motion won the backing of 131 deputies, well short of the 288 it needed to pass. French politics was plunged into chaos last year when Macron called an election to break political deadlock but the vote returned a hopelessly divided lower chamber. Macron has acknowledged his decision to dissolve the National Assembly had led to \"divisions\" and \"instability\". Constitutional rules mean new legislative elections cannot be called until July.

In 2015 Serge Atlaoui won a last-minute reprieve from being executed by a 13-member firing squad. The transfer agreement was signed remotely by Indonesia’s senior minister of law Yusril Ihza Mahendra and France’s Minister of Justice Gérald Darmanin, and was witnessed by delegations from both countries in Jakarta and Paris. It came after Atlaoui, 61, made a last-ditch plea to be returned home last month. The father of four, who is reportedly suffering from cancer, wrote to the Indonesian government requesting to serve the rest of his sentence in France. The deal will allow him to return home on Feb. 4, Mahendra said. “The Indonesian government has decided not to execute the prisoner and has agreed to transfer him to France,” Mahendra told a joint news conference attended by France’s ambassador to Indonesia, Fabien Penone. Penone thanked the Indonesian government for granting Atlaoui’s request. “We want to develop our legal cooperation in a much more straightforward way,” Penone said, adding: “We are reinforcing our bilateral relationship, we have a real partnership.” RELATED COVERAGE China and Indonesia agree to boost maritime security cooperation in South China Sea despite tensions Indonesia offers to temporarily shelter wounded and orphaned Palestinians from Gaza Nations puzzle over how to respond to US trade war as global markets gyrate Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 for his alleged involvement in a factory manufacturing the psychedelic drug MDMA, sometimes called ecstasy, on the outskirts of Jakarta. His lawyers say he was employed as a welder at the factory and did not understand what the chemicals on the premises were used for. Atlaoui, from Metz, has maintained his innocence during his 19 years’ incarceration, claiming that he was installing machinery in what he thought was an acrylics plant. Police accused him of being a “chemist” at the site. He was initially sentenced to life, but the Supreme Court in 2007 increased the sentence to death on appeal. His case has drawn attention in France, which vigorously opposes the death penalty “in all places and under all circumstances.” Mahendra said the French government had informed him that the maximum criminal penalty in France was 30 years imprisonment. Once repatriated, “the authority to treat the convict is entirely under French government,” Mahendra said. If the France want to pardon Atlaoui or grant clemency, “that is entirely their authority and which we must also respect,” the minister added. Indonesia executed eight death-row prisoners in May 2015, but Atlaoui was granted a stay of execution because he still had an outstanding court appeal. An Administrative Court in Jakarta denied that appeal the following month. Indonesia’s government last month returned Mary Jane Veloso , a Filipina woman who had been on death row and who was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015, after longstanding requests from her home country. Five Australian who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking also returned to Australia in December under a deal struck between the governments. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including nearly 100 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections’ data showed last month.

Zaheer Mahmood, 29, from Pakistan, attacked and badly wounded two employees of the Premieres Lignes news agency, days after Charlie Hebdo had republished cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. He was unaware Charlie Hebdo had moved offices to a secret location after 12 people were killed there in a gun attack claimed by al-Qaeda following the original publication of the cartoons in 2015. Mahmood was convicted of attempted murder and terrorist conspiracy. He will be banned from France when his sentence is served. Five other Pakistani men, some of whom were under 18 at the time of their crimes, were jailed for between three and 12 years on terrorist conspiracy charges for supporting Mahmood. The trial was held in the juvenile court in Paris due to their ages. The court heard that Mahmood had planned his attack after Charlie Hebdo republished its cartoons of the Prophet in September 2020 to mark the opening of the trial of some of those responsible for the 2015 massacre. The court was told that Mahmood was influenced by radical Pakistani preacher Khadim Hussain Rizvi, who had urged him to \"avenge the Prophet\". Armed with a meat cleaver, he arrived at Hebdo's former offices in the French capital's 11th district, and attacked and seriously wounded two employees of the Premieres Lignes news agency, which has offices nearby. Witnesses at the time described how they saw their colleagues \"bloodied, being chased by a man with a machete\". His victims, a woman named \"Helene\", 32, and a 37-year-old man, were present at the sentencing but did not comment on its outcome. Neither has accepted Mahmood's pleas for forgiveness. \"It broke something within me,\" the 37-year-old said, as he told the court of his lengthy rehabilitation process. Mahmood arrived in France illegally in 2017, although initially claimed to arrive in 2019. He also lied about his age, claiming to be 18. Mahmood's defence lawyer, Alberic de Gayardon, said his client lived and worked with Pakistanis and felt disconnected from France. \"He does not speak French, he lives with Pakistanis, he works for Pakistanis,\" Mr Gayardon added. \"In his head he had never left Pakistan.\" AFP A court sketch from 6 January shows defendant Zaheer Mahmood during his trial Charlie Hebdo marks decade since gun attack with special issue Eight sentenced in France for actions that led to teacher beheading Stabbings suspect 'was targeting Charlie Hebdo' France Paris",

Try again 01:40 French Prime Minister François Bayrou argues that a budget must be passed without delay. © Christophe Archambault, AFP Prime Minister François Bayrou on Monday moved to force through France 's budget without a vote but looked certain to keep his job -- for now -- thanks to support from the Socialists in the bitterly divided parliament. Bayrou, a veteran centrist named by President Emmanuel Macron in December to end months of political crisis following last summer's inconclusive legislative elections , is nowhere near having a parliamentary majority. Bayrou rammed through the budget legislation on Monday using article 49.3 of the constitution, which allows the government to pass laws without a vote. The step immediately prompted a no-confidence motion from the left in the divided parliament. But even if the far-right National Rally (RN ) party decides to back the vote this week, Bayrou appears certain to keep his job for now, after the Socialist Party decided against backing the motion, giving the prime minister a much-needed boost. \"No country can live without a budget,\" Bayrou told the National Assembly lower house. \"We have spared no effort to break this deadlock\", he added, thanking his ministers. The government is under pressure from the European Commission to bring the country's sprawling deficits and growing debt under control. A sustainable budget plan for this year is the priority for Bayrou, after the austerity budget plan of his predecessor, Michel Barnier , was jettisoned along with his government in December. 'Light in the tunnel' The adoption of the budget will make it possible to limit the deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP, Bayrou said, still one of the widest in the eurozone. On Monday, he resorted to the tactic twice, to force through the budget as well as the social security budget, and may need to do this again later this week. The use of article 49.3, while convenient for a minority government, means the opposition has the right to put forward a no-confidence motion to bring the prime minister and his government down. In December, the far-right National Rally party teamed up with a left-wing bloc to topple Barnier's government. Marine Le Pen also holds the key to the government's survival. © Thomas Samson, AFP The hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) on Monday swiftly called for a similar vote towards toppling Bayrou's government, tabling a motion of censure. The motion was due to be put to the vote on Wednesday. The RN said it would make its position clear the same day. Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director at risk analysis firm Eurasia Group, said that Bayrou looked likely to survive the vote and France would have the budget, \"a month late.\" \"Is there light in the tunnel of France's budgetary and political crisis? Yes, probably,\" he said on X. The adoption of the budget and survival of Bayrou's government would be a huge relief for Macron. New legislative elections cannot take place until at least one year after the previous polls, so the toppling of Bayrou's government would plunge France into uncharted political waters. Bayrou is Macron's sixth prime minister since taking office in 2017. The president has faced calls to step down but has repeatedly insisted he will serve out his term in full. French President Emmanuel Macron has been under intense political pressure. © Sebastien Bozon, AFP 'Spirit of responsibility' The Socialist lawmakers said in a statement that despite the concessions the legislation remained \"a right-wing budget\". But they also pointed to a \"spirit of responsibility\" and \"the interests of the country\" as they explained their decision to back Bayrou \"at a time when France is waiting to have a budget.\" Labour Minister Catherine Vautrin defended \"the first step\" towards getting France's finances under control, estimating that the social security deficit will be \"in excess of 22 billion euros\" in 2025. Frederic Valletoux, head of the social affairs committee, said: \"Never in 15 years have the social security accounts seen such a high level of deficit, with the exception of 2020, the peak year of the pandemic.\" The prime minister managed to convince the Socialists not to back a no-confidence motion against him earlier this year in a major victory that heralded the end of the New Popular Front (NFP), a broad left-wing alliance that had endured since the election campaign. But the Socialists broke off talks with Bayrou's administration last week after he referred to migrants \"flooding\" France, borrowing from terminology previously used by the far right.

The motion received just 115 votes out of the 289 needed to topple the government after the far-right National Rally and the centre-left Socialist Party opted not to support the move. Immediately afterwards, the prime minister invoked article 49.3 again to pass the portion of the bill regarding government expenditure by force, likely inviting another no-confidence vote from the leftist opposition this week. The decision of the Socialist Party not to support votes of no-confidence linked to the minority government's attempts to pass a budget has deepened tensions within the leftist New Popular Front alliance, which won the most seats in last year's snap elections while falling far short of a majority in the National Assembly.

The incident happened at the Aksehir bar shortly after 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday evening, leaving two people in critical condition. The motive for the attack is not clear but investigators say it \"may be linked to a settling of scores\". Prosecutor Francois Touret-de-Courcey said eyewitness accounts suggest the suspect, who is as yet unidentified, may also have been carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Speaking to reporters at the scene, he said: \"There's nothing to make us think it's linked to terrorism,\" describing the incident as an \"act of extreme violence\". He added that investigators were looking at possible connections to drug trafficking. Authorities said many people were at the venue, located in the city's Olympic Village neighbourhood, when the suspect briefly entered. Some 80 firefighters and police officers were deployed to the scene with the area remaining cordoned off on Thursday morning, French paper Le Figaro reports.

Serge Atlaoui, 61, is to be transported from the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris to court and then on to jail, said a source close to the case and the prosecutor’s office in the nearby town of Bobigny. Under an agreement last month between both countries for his transfer, Jakarta has left it to the French government to grant him either clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence. France abolished capital punishment in 1981. Atlaoui’s lawyer Richard Sedillot has said he would work to have his client’s sentence “adapted” so that the father of four could be released. Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 at a factory in a Jakarta suburb where dozens of kilogrammes of drugs were discovered, with Indonesian authorities accusing him of being a “chemist”. A welder from Metz in northeastern France, he has always denied being a drug trafficker, saying that he was installing machinery in what he thought was an acrylic factory. His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24. In the agreement, Jakarta said it had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on “humanitarian grounds” because he was ill. Indonesia has some of the world’s toughest drug laws and has executed foreigners in the past. The Southeast Asian country has in recent weeks released half a dozen high-profile detainees, including a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the so-called “Bali Nine” drug ring.

The government has no majority in parliament, and Prime Minister François Bayrou had used special constitutional powers to get the budget bill approved without a vote by lawmakers, which triggered the no-confidence motion. Only 128 lawmakers approved the motion, far from the 289 votes — or half the National Assembly seats — needed for it to pass. Both the Socialists and far-right National Rally lawmakers refused to support it. Under France’s Constitution, the motion’s failure automatically turns the 2025 budget into law. French politics have been in disarray since President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections last year that left no party with a parliamentary majority. Bayrou, a veteran centrist, was appointed in December amid a political crisis prompted by budget disputes that led to the collapse of his predecessor’s government . RELATED COVERAGE Olympic organizing team unveiled for 2030 Winter Games in French Alps France’s government is fighting for survival over its 2025 budget. Here’s what to know France braces for a political showdown as the new prime minister seeks to force a budget through A reassuring move for France and Europe France has been under pressure from the European Union to reduce its huge debt and deficit, which in 2024 reached 6.1% of GDP. The government has argued the country needs an operational budget at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening new tariffs on the EU and Russia is growing more emboldened in Ukraine. Bayrou acknowledged Wednesday an “imperfect budget” but said its adoption was an urgent step “because our country cannot live without a budget.” A budget meant to reduce deficit The budget is meant to reduce France’s deficit to 5.4% of gross domestic product this year, including through spending cuts and tax increases worth a total of 50 billion euros. During discussions meant to seek a compromise in parliament, Bayrou agreed to provide an additional 1 billion euros for hospitals and committed not to cut 4,000 jobs in national education. He also said last month he was open to renegotiating a contested plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The government said it intends to use its special powers next week to pass the social security budget, allowing key financial measures to be implemented by the end of the month. A political victory for Bayrou In December, a no-confidence motion forced conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign as all opposition forces, from the hard-left to the far-right, joined to bring the government down. Barnier had been named to solve the political impasse created by last year’s elections, but his proposed austerity budget deepened divisions. Macron tapped Bayrou in the hope he could bridge divides. Unlike Barnier, Bayrou held intense negotiations with the Socialists aimed at reaching a non-aggression deal over the budget under which they would agree not to undercut each other. In a parliament with no party dominant, all have leverage, and Bayrou needed to convince just one opposition group not to support the motion. The Socialists said this week that “it’s time to give France a budget.” SYLVIE CORBET Corbet is an Associated Press reporter based in Paris.

Updated: Wed 19 Feb 2025 08:50 CET Share Add a comment A technician in the tokamak machine at the CEA in Cadarache, southeastern France. (Photo by BORIS HORVAT / AFP) French scientists have reached a ‘crucial milestone’ in the long road towards nuclear fusion by managing to maintain raging-hot plasma for a record 22 minutes, officials have said. Advertisement Nuclear fusion has the much-vaunted potential to provide the world with clean, safe and nearly inexhaustible energy – but the scientific holy grail has remained stubbornly elusive over decades. The idea is to recreate the process that occurs at the heart of stars by fusing two atomic nuclei. This would be the opposite of fission – which splits the atom – currently used in nuclear power plants. Among other things, the process requires temperatures of more than 100 million degrees Celsius to create and maintain plasma. This hot, electrically charged gas easily becomes unstable, which can lead to lost energy and limit the efficiency of a possible future fusion reactor. The WEST tokamak machine in southern France managed to maintain plasma for 1,337 seconds on February 12th, government-funded research organisation the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA) said in a statement. This ‘smashed’ the previous record set in China last month by 25 percent, said the CEA, which runs the tokamak machine. The CEA’s head of fundamental research Anne-Isabelle Etienvre told AFP that achieving plasma for that long shows, “that we control its production, but also its maintenance”. But there are still many ‘technological barriers’ to overcome before thermonuclear fusion can, “produce more energy than it consumes”, she added. Advertisement In the coming month, the WEST team is aiming to achieve even longer plasma durations – ‘up to several hours combined’ – as well as higher temperatures, according to the CEA. In doing so, the researchers hope to approach the conditions, “expected in fusion plasmas”, the statement said. The scientists will also observe the effect that such intense plasma has on the inside of their tokamak machine, Etienvre said. The goal is to prepare the ground for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) being built in France, she added. First set in motion in 1985, the ITER brings together China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. It had been scheduled to go online this year, but repeated setbacks, delays and spiralling costs have postponed operations until at least 2033.

Pre-filled disposable e-cigarettes, known as \"puffs\", are popular with young people, can have a high nicotine content, come in many flavours including apple, watermelon and cola and are cheap. \"It is a great victory in a two-pronged battle that we were fighting: an environmental battle against the polluting lithium batteries in these 'puffs', and a health battle for our schoolchildren,\" lawmaker Francesca Pasquini, the author of the bill, told AFP. \"A fine piece of cross-party work!\" lawmaker Michel Lauzzana said on X. Addressing President Emmanuel Macron, Lauzzana added: \"We are now awaiting the promulgation of this law and its application throughout the country.\" The legislation was earlier approved by the National Assembly lower house. The measure is part of a wider government anti-smoking campaign. Health authorities in France and Belgium say that chronic nicotine consumption is especially harmful to the adolescent brain and could encourage use of other drugs. In December 2024, Belgium approved legislation to become the first EU country to ban disposable e-cigarettes. The European Union aims to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2040, reducing the 27-country bloc's smoking population from around 25 percent now to less than five percent of the total. © 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The success of the mission means that Europe can now put large satellites into orbit on its own, as Russia pulled its Soyuz rockets after invading Ukraine in 2022.

After several delays including a last-minute postponement on Monday , the heavy-lift rocket blasted off into rainy skies from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana just before 1:30 pm local time (1630 GMT). Around an hour after the launch, the control centre burst into applause as the rocket released the satellite into orbit, marking a successful mission. The high-profile launch comes as Europe seeks to strengthen its defences amid doubts it can still rely on the United States as a security partner under new US President Donald Trump . The success means that Europe can now independently put large satellites into orbit for the first time since Russia pulled its heavy Soyuz rockets after invading Ukraine in 2022. Ariane 6 was initially scheduled to have its first flight in 2020, but repeated delays meant the rocket did not blast off for the first time until July last year. Its first commercial mission put the CSO-3 satellite into orbit at an altitude of around 800 kilometres (500 miles) above Earth. CSO-3 has been waiting since 2022 to complete a network of three French military imaging satellites, with the first two launched in 2018 and 2020 on Soyuz rockets. 'Europe must ensure its own security' Europe has just 10 military satellites – five French and five Italian – compared to \"hundreds\" for the United States and China, French General Philippe Steininger said. \"Europe must ensure its own security,\" the European Space Agency 's space transportation director Toni Tolker-Nielsen said in Kourou earlier this week. He called for the number of annual Ariane 6 launches to increase to 12, compared to the five planned for this year. A previous attempt to launch the mission on Monday was called off just 30 minutes before launching due to a dysfunctional valve on one of the refuelling pipes, Arianespace said. Other planned launches in December and February were also scrubbed. Postponed launches are common for new rockets. The latest test flight of the world's biggest rocket, SpaceX 's Starship, is also scheduled for launch later Thursday after a last-minute postponement on Monday . The European space industry has struggled to remain competitive with Elon Musk 's SpaceX, which has become increasingly dominant when it comes to launching satellites. And SpaceX is only expected to become more central to US space efforts now that the billionaire Musk has become a prominent adviser to Trump. 'Important step' Europe recently found itself without a way to independently launch missions into space due to the Ariane 6 delays. Its predecessor Ariane 5 retired in 2023, Russia pulled its Soyuz rockets and an accident grounded the smaller Vega-C launcher for two years. But with Vega-C resuming flights in December and Ariane 6's first commercial launch, European space efforts are hoping to turn a page on the crisis. Given the military role of the satellite, heavy security was deployed at the spaceport on the northern coast of South America, with French fighter jets deployed to patrol the surrounding skies. Arnaud Prost, a French pilot who is also a reserve astronaut for the European Space Agency, learned that Monday's launch was scrubbed while he was flying a surveillance plane above the launchpad. A successful Ariane 6 launch was \"an important step for the independence of France and Europe's access to space,\" he told AFP. \"At the moment, Europe needs to find projects that bring us together,\" he said. \"Space exploration is a unique opportunity to do this.\" (FRANCE 24 with AFP) Read next Launch of Europe’s Ariane 6 space rocket postponed due to ‘anomaly’ on the ground Europe Second time sideways: US lunar lander ends up tilted in another bumpy moon landing Technology Today's top stories A trap?

The lawmaker, Sébastien Peytavie, argued that his exclusion as a wheelchair user from stand-up votes in parliament’s lower house is part of a bigger picture of France continuing to lag in its obligations to ensure equal rights for people with disabilities. Speaking from his wheelchair to fellow lawmakers, Peytavie said that eliminating the voting method would “show that everyone, regardless of their situation, has the right to a seat in this Assembly.” “This text is admittedly symbolic but it’s a reminder that it is the failure to adapt the environment that creates a disability, not a person’s physical situation,” he said. He noted that the 18th-century parliament building itself, while “beautiful,” also isn’t fully accessible to people with disabilities — a state of affairs that’s true of the Paris Metro and many other public and private services and venues across France.

By 183 votes for and none against, lawmakers unanimously backed his proposed rule-change that clears the way for the National Assembly president, Yaël Braun-Pivet, to eliminate stand-up votes. Although the voting method is infrequently used, Peytavie said it excludes lawmakers who can’t stand up. “This situation isn’t theoretical. I wasn’t able to take part in several votes even though I was present in the chamber,” he said. Other voting methods used by French lawmakers, depending on the circumstances, are a show of hands, with an electronic voting box or with paper ballots dropped into an urn. Peytavie said shows of hands or electronic votes would be used instead of stand-up votes after the change takes effect. Peytavie also reminded colleagues that he’d also been unable to vote twice in July last year when lawmakers were called one-by-one to walk up stairs to the Assembly podium to cast paper ballots in an urn. At the time, Peytavie posted on social media that because parliamentary workers were refusing to bring the urn to him, he’d had to block the stairs until they gave way. “Is it that hard?” he posted back then on X.",

Jean-Pierre Maldera, described by French media as a \"godfather\" of the local mafia in the 1980s, was reportedly chased in his car and shot as he travelled up the A41 motorway on Wednesday morning. The shooters fled the scene and the burnt-out remains of the stolen Renault Megane car they were driving was found in a Grenoble parking lot shortly after. His death comes ten years after the disappearance of his younger brother, Robert Maldera, another mafia boss reportedly nicknamed \"the madman\" by members of Grenoble's criminal underworld. Regional newspaper Le Dauphiné Libéré reported Maldera left the BMW he was driving and attempted to escape on foot across the motorway. He was chased and killed by the assailants in the attack involving three or four gunmen, local media said.

However, this was not the first time Maldera had been convicted. He had a rap sheet stretching back to the 1970s, according to French regional media outlet France 3. But Maldera appeared to opt for a quieter life after his release from prison in the early 2000s, with AFP news agency reporting the authorities did not hear of him again until his shooting this week. It is not clear if Maldera was still involved in criminal activity at the time of his death. His brother Robert disappeared in 2015 at the age of 55. He went missing after attending a meeting on the outskirts of Grenoble. His car was discovered two months later in a parking lot nearby.

        "text": "Le Pen to appeal ban from running for public office, condemning 'political decision' 31 March 2025 Share Save Laura Gozzi & Gabriela Pomeroy BBC News Share Save Getty Images Marine Le Pen has criticised a court ruling that bans her from running for public office as a \"political decision\" and says she will appeal. The French far-right politician was found guilty on Monday of embezzling EU funds and she was barred from standing in an election for five years, with immediate effect. The decision means that, unless she can get her sentence overturned before the 2027 presidential election, Le Pen will likely not be able to stand. \"I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this,\" Le Pen told French TV station TF1. She said she would appeal against the verdict \"as soon as possible\" using \"whatever legal avenues I can\". Shock verdict rocks French far right Le Pen has been given a four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended. The other two can be spent with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She has also been handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine. \"Millions of French people are outraged,\" she said, claiming that judges have \"implemented measures that are reserved for authoritarian regimes\". Le Pen added that she was \"scandalised, indignant, but this indignation, this feeling of injustice, is an additional push to the fight that I fight for them [the voters]\". But the appeal process may take a long time. The appeals trial would probably not happen for another year, and a verdict would come several months after that. Preparing a presidential campaign under these circumstances could prove complicated. The 2027 election would have been her fourth attempt, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old president of the National Rally (RN), said on Monday that Le Pen's sentencing was a \"democratic scandal\". Bardella also called for a \"popular, peaceful mobilisation\". He then posted a link to an online petition which says a \"dictatorship of judges... wished to prevent French people from expressing themselves\". \"Let's show those who want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!\" the petition reads. At the start of the reading of the verdict, the judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" which saw the embezzlement of €2.9m worth of European funds. Two dozen RN figures were also found guilty and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Le Pen was accused, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, of hiring assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them. During the trial last year, Le Pen denied she had committed \"the slightest irregularity\". Before the sentence was issued on Monday, she stormed out of the court, alongside other defendants and headed to the RN's Paris headquarters, where the party held a \"crisis meeting\". At the weekend, Le Pen had told media that while she was \"not nervous\", the judges had \"the power of life or death over the [political] movement\". Shortly before her sentencing, Le Pen received messages of support from the Kremlin, as well as European allies such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini. But some of Le Pen's opponents have also stated they disapprove of the judge's decision. Media reported that centrist Prime Minister François Bayrou was \"troubled\" by the ruling against Marine Le Pen, although he did not intend to make a public statement on the matter. \"The choice to dismiss an elected official should only belong to the people,\" said Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI). And Laurent Wauquiez, of the right-wing Republicans, said that the decision would \"weigh very heavily on the functioning of our democracy\". \"It's undoubtedly not the route that should have been taken.\" The reading of the verdict, which started shortly after 10:00 (09:00 BST), took nearly three hours.

        "text": "Advertising Home Live news Iran frees Frenchman after nearly 900-day prison ordeal Paris (AFP) – French citizen Olivier Grondeau, detained by Iran since October 2022 on security charges but described by his family as an innocent tourist, has returned to France after being released, President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday. Issued on: 20/03/2025 - 07:35 Modified: 20/03/2025 - 14:31 3 min Grondeau was arrested in 2022 © CDCS / MEAE / X account of France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot/AFP Iranian authorities allowed another French national, who was under house arrest in Iran for several months and has requested anonymity, to also leave the country, sources familiar with the case told AFP on Thursday. Macron vowed to do everything to ensure the release of two other French citizens still held by Iran, while several other European nationals remain behind bars in the Islamic republic. The moves come ahead of an approaching critical juncture in the decades-long standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump writing the leadership a letter urging more talks on the issue. Western countries have for years accused Iran of detaining their nationals on trumped-up charges in a policy of state hostage-taking to use them as bargaining chips to extract concessions. He added that \"our mobilisation will not weaken\" to ensure the release of Cecile Kohler, a teacher, and her partner, Jacques Paris, who were detained in May 2022. They are accused of seeking to stir up labour protests, accusations their families have denied. Grondeau arrived in France on Monday evening, the Elysee Palace and a diplomatic source told AFP. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X he had been \"held hostage in Iran for 887 days\". 'Pressure on Iran' No further details on the circumstances of Grondeau's release were made available. There were also no further details in the case of the second national who had been held under house arrest. Exiled Iranian opposition group the People's Mujahedin (MEK), which is outlawed by Tehran, meanwhile alleged that Grondeau's release has been linked to an article that appeared this week in French media accusing its leader Maryam Rajavi of lavish spending at a spa resort. The piece in satirical weekly Canard Enchaine was \"demonisation and character assassination\", Shahin Ghobadi, spokesman of the MEK's political wing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), told AFP. \"There is clearly a quid-pro-quo and this is what Tehran gets in return,\" he said. Jean-Noel Barrot denied any deal with Tehran © Thibaud MORITZ / AFP Speaking to TF1 television, Barrot denied France had given anything in return for the release of Grondeau which he said was the result of \"continued pressure\" on Iran. Grondeau, who is from Montpellier in the south of France, remains in hospital undergoing a battery of tests, having been severely weakened in recent months, particularly psychologically, a government source told AFP, asking not to be named. \"It is a great joy to have Olivier back, since he is innocent of all charges and has always belonged among us,\" his French lawyer, Chirinne Ardakani, told AFP. Grondeau, who turns 35 next week, was arrested in Shiraz, southern Iran, in October 2022 and sentenced to five years in prison for \"conspiracy against the Islamic republic\" including espionage. His family rejected the charges, describing Grondeau as a passionate fan of Persian poetry who went to Iran on a tourist visa as part of a world tour. 'Dying slow death' Until earlier this year, Grondeau had been identified only by his first name but his full identity was revealed by his family in January. In an audio message aired by French media at the time, Grondeau said he and the other two French detainees in Iran were \"exhausted\" and their strength was \"running out\". There has been growing concern over the health of the two other French citizens held by Iran, with Kohler's family warning that they risked dying if they were not freed. \"Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris must be freed from Iranian prisons,\" Macron said in his message. Ardakani, who also represents Kohler, said she was kept in a windowless cell of just eight square metres (86 square feet) \"under continuous video surveillance\" and had to sleep on the floor. Several other Europeans remain held by Tehran © Sébastien DUPUY / AFP They are \"dying a slow death,\" Cecile's sister Noemie Kohler said in early March. Over half a dozen European nationals still known to be held include Iranian-Swedish academic Ahmadreza Djalali, who was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and sentenced to death in 2017 on charges of spying. Around 20 Westerners are held in Iran, a French diplomatic source, asking not to be named, told AFP on Thursday. © 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

        "text": "French prison attacks are 'terrorism' says justice minister 15 April 2025 Share Save Ian Aikman & Jessica Rawnsley BBC News Share Save Getty Images French officials suggested the attacks were linked to the government's crackdown on drug crime France's Justice Minister said the government would not give in to \"acts of intimidation\" after a wave of attacks targeting prisons across the country. On Monday night, vehicles were set alight outside several French prisons and one jail was hit by gunfire, in what Gérald Darmanin described as \"terrorist attacks\". Seven prisons have been targeted, in Toulon, Aix-En-Provence, Marseille, Valence and Nîmes in southern France, and in Villepinte and Nanterre, near Paris. Darmanin suggested the attacks which began on Sunday were a response to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking. France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has launched an investigation. On Tuesday, Darmanin visited Toulon's La Farlede prison where gunmen opened fired on the prison gate with a Kalashnikov. \"I am delighted that the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has taken action because this is extremely serious,\" he told reporters. \"These are terrorist attacks.\" He added that \"significant means\" were being employed to find the perpetrators and they would be given \"extremely severe sentences\". Darmanin indicated that the \"acts of intimidation against prison workers\" were related to government efforts to tackle drug crime. \"It might also be because we hit them where it hurts,\" he said, \"and for the first time in decades, France is taking extremely serious measures against drug trafficking.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the government's response must be \"relentless\". \"Those who attack prisons and officers deserve to be locked up in those prisons and monitored by those officers,\" he posted on X. He added that he had instructed police to immediately strengthen security at prison facilities. The prison guard union, FO Justice, expressed its \"deepest concern and anger\" following the \"extremely serious\" attacks overnight. The union posted updates from the aftermath of several attacks on X, including images of burnt-out vehicles in prison car parks and bullet holes in the Toulon prison entrance gate. It called for urgent government action to protect prison staff. Another union, Ufap-Unsa Justice, said there were not enough officers to secure prison perimeters \"24/7\". Ufap said that staff vehicles were among those set on fire outside the jails in Villepinte, Aix-Luynes, Nanterre and Valence. The union condemned the \"cowardly and heinous attacks [that] aim to terrorise those who embody the authority of the state\". In Nancy, a prison officer was reportedly threatened at their home, while in Marseille, an attempted arson attack targeted prison officers' accommodation. Monday night's attacks come after seven vehicles were set on fire in a similar attack on France's national school of prison administration on Sunday, according to FO Justice. \"It is worrying to note that some people no longer hesitate to directly attack the prison's property, a symbol of state authority,\" it said in a statement. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Parisien reports that the letters DDPF - meaning \"French prisoners' rights\" - were found inscribed on damaged vehicles. The AFP news agency says anarchist slogans were found at some sites. AFP quotes a source close to the case as saying the attacks appeared to be coordinated and \"clearly linked\" to the government's strategy against drug trafficking. Darmanin and Retailleau have vowed to tackle the scourge of drug trafficking and drug-related violence in France amid a rise in gang-related crime. In February, the interior ministry announced a record number of cocaine seizures in the first 11 months of 2024 - 53.5 tonnes, a rise of 130% on the 23.2 tonnes seized in 2023. Retailleau said France had been hit by a \"white tsunami\". Darmanin has proposed a number of measures to tighten prison security, including establishing dedicated high-security prisons to isolate the drug lords who run their empires from behind bars. A law is passing through the French parliament which creates a special prosecutor's office to deal with drugs crime, with new powers for investigators.

Sign in Edition Global WEC Le Mans 24 Hours to clash with F1 Canadian GP in 2025 as WEC calendar announced The 2025 Le Mans 24 Hours will clash with Formula 1's Canadian Grand Prix and Imola has maintained its place on an unchanged World Endurance Championship calendar for next year. Gary Watkins Jun 14, 2024, 9:51 AM Upd: Jun 14, 2024, 1:47 PM Copy link Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on Pinterest Share on Viber Start action Photo by: Emanuele Clivati | AG Photo The Le Mans 24 Hours is scheduled for 14-15 June, with the pre-event Test Day on the preceding Sunday. It means the race will clash with the F1 Canadian GP and IndyCar's St Louis round at Gateway. It is the first time F1 and Le Mans have clashed since 2016. Meanwhile, Imola has renewed what was originally a one-year deal covering 2024 to retain the Italian round of the series for a further four years, with a public signing of the contract at Friday's Le Mans 24 Hours. The WEC switched from Monza to Imola this year because the home of the Italian Grand Prix was undergoing major paddock works. The limited number of garages, one less than the 37 cars on this year’s entry, had been seen as an obstacle to Imola’s continuation as part of the series. The WEC has stressed the importance of the support of the local municipality in making the new deal happen. Mayor Marco Panieri described the agreement between the WEC and the circuit “as a fantastic opportunity for the city of Imola”. “Thanks to this event we will be able to improve infrastructure like [pit] boxes and the fan zone, making visitors and staff experience more enjoyable,” he said. Fans at Imola Photo by: JEP / Motorsport Images The 2025 WEC incorporates the same eight events in the same order as this year. The Le Mans 24 Hours is scheduled for 14-15 June, with the pre-event Test Day on the preceding Sunday. It means the race will clash with the F1 Canadian GP and IndyCar's St Louis round at Gateway. Pierre Fillon president of WEC co-organiser the Automobile Club de l’Ouest told Motorsport.com last month that there were no plans to expand to nine races for “because of costs”. Richard Mille, president of the FIA Endurance Commission, said that the WEC was adopting an “if it ain't broke, don't fix it” mentality. “The eight rounds that we know from this year offer a great mixture of well-established circuits,” he said. “They give the series presence in both Americas, Asia, Europe and in the Middle East, providing the perfect stage for the events of the golden era of endurance racing to unfold.” The WEC’s return to Austin for the first time since 2017 in September of this year will be extended into a second season at least. That always seemed likely once Roger Penske ruled out the series visiting his Indianapolis venue in ’25 as a result of scheduling reasons, a statement he made in March. He has aspirations to bring the WEC to a facility he took over in 2020, a desire he first revealed back in 2022. The 2025 WEC will kick off in Qatar with a late February date, rather than in early March this year, because Ramadan falls earlier in 2025. The race will again be a 1812km event, a nod to Qatar’s national day on 18 December, with a maximum duration of eight hours. The pre-season Prologue test will take place one week in advance of the race at Qatar’s Losail International Circuit. The Le Mans 24 Hours is scheduled for 14/15 June, with the pre-event Test Day on the preceding Sunday. After the three rounds in Europe concluded by the Le Mans 24 Hours in mid-June, Interlagos in Sao Paolo, Austin, Fuji and Bahrain again make up the post-Le Mans swing of the championship. The calendar was ratified by the FIA World Motor Sport Council this week. 2025 WEC Calendar 28 February Qatar 1812Km (QAT) 20 April Imola 6 Hours (ITA) 10 May Spa 6 Hours (BEL) 14-15 June Le Mans 24 Hours (FRA) 13 July Sao Paulo 6 Hours (BRA) 7 September Austin 6 Hours (USA) 28 September Fuji 6 Hous (JPN) 8 November Bahrain 8 Hours (BAH) In this article Gary Watkins Le Mans WEC Be the first to know and subscribe for real-time news email updates on these topics Subscribe to news alerts Share Or Save This Story Copy link Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on Pinterest Share on Viber Previous article Jota, Wayne Taylor teams favourites for Cadillac switch in WEC, IMSA Next article WEC confirms two-car rule for Hypercar manufacturers for 2025 Top Comments There are no comments at the moment.

        "text": "Algeria to expel 12 French embassy officials 14 April 2025 Share Save Jessica Rawnsley, Natasha Booty & Ahmed Rouaba BBC News Share Save AFP The latest rift comes days after tentative steps had been made to mend relations Algeria has asked 12 French embassy staff to leave the country within 48 hours, France's foreign minister has said. Jean-Noël Barrot added that it was linked to the indictment of three Algerians in France on Friday, one of whom is a consular official. They are accused of involvement in the abduction last year of Amir Boukhors, 41, an outspoken critic of Algeria's government with an audience of more than one million people online. He had reportedly been granted asylum in France in 2023. Barrot urged Algeria to \"abandon\" the expulsions and said France was ready to \"respond immediately\" if they went ahead. Never before have French authorities arrested an employee from the Algerian consulate, and the fallout has set back recent attempts to improve relations between the two countries. It also points to a power struggle in French politics, with some right-wing politicians accusing the presidency of pandering to Algeria, and the Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently threatening to quit unless President Emmanuel Macron backs a more hard-line approach. Boukhors, also known as Amir DZ, has lived in France since 2016. He was abducted in April 2024 in the southern suburbs of Paris and released the following day, according to his lawyer Eric Plouvier. Plouvier told the AFP news agency that Boukhors had been \"the subject of two serious attacks, one in 2022 and another on the evening of April 29 2024\". French media reported that he was forced into a car with a flashing light by \"fake police officers\", then released the next day in woodland without explanation. Algerian authorities accuse the influencer of being \"a saboteur linked to terrorist groups\". The North African nation has issued nine international arrest warrants against him, accusing him of fraud and associations with terrorist organisations. He denies the allegations. In 2022, the French courts refused attempts to extradite him to Algeria. The case is the latest in a growing number of incidents to have exacerbated a rift between France and Algeria. They include the arrest and imprisonment in Algeria of French-Algerian author Boualem Sansal , who was accused of undermining Algeria's territorial integrity. Algeria recalled its ambassador from Paris last year after France backed Morocco's claim to the disputed territory of Western Sahara. The 12 French officials asked to leave on Monday include some members of the French interior ministry, a diplomatic source told AFP. On Monday, Barrot said: \"I am asking Algerian authorities to abandon these expulsion measures... if the decision to send back our officials is maintained, we will have no other choice but to respond immediately.\" Barrot claimed that the expulsions were a response to the indictment of three Algerian nationals on Friday in Paris - including the consular official - on charges including abduction, arbitrary detention and illegal confinement and participating in a terrorist organisation. Algeria's foreign ministry said it had summoned French ambassador Stéphane Romatet in response to \"express its strong protest\" and called for the official's immediate release, according to the official Algerian news agency. It added that the individual \"was arrested in public and then taken into custody without notification through the diplomatic channels\". The ministry claimed the move was \"not a coincidence as it happens in a very specific context with the aim of stymying the process of relaunching bilateral relations\". Tentative steps have been made to repair relations between the two nations with a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune taking place in March. \"The two presidents had a long, frank and friendly exchange on the state of bilateral relations and the tensions that have built up in recent months,\" a joint statement read. Following an official visit to Algeria on 6 April where he met with Tebboune, Barrot said he hoped for a \"new phase\" in relations.

Il doit présenter son gouvernement mardi. Le Monde Publié le 15 mai 2017 à 14h54, modifié le 16 mai 2017 à 12h11 Temps de Lecture 3 min.

Edouard Philippe, 46 ans, maire (Les Républicains, LR) du Havre, a été nommé, lundi 15 mai, à Matignon par Emmanuel Macron (En marche !). Invité le soir même au journal télévisé de TF1, le nouveau premier ministre a justifié sa présence à Matignon. « On se sent parfois de gauche, parfois de droite. La valeur cardinale de la vie en société c’est la liberté pas seulement économique, mais de pensée, la liberté d’expression. » M. Philippe a expliqué être « en train de constituer un gouvernement, un gouvernement rassembleur de compétences » , qu’il proposera à Emmanuel Macron. Le nouveau président de la République a compris « très tôt (...) qu’il fallait qu’il poursuive le mouvement audacieux et qu’il fallait qu’il s’inscrive non pas dans une logique d’ouverture mais dans une logique de recomposition de la vie politique » , a-t-il avancé. Evasif quant à la composition de ce gouvernement, dont l’annonce est prévue demain, il ajoute : « La première question qu’on se pose : est-ce qu’on va être capable de donner à la France une majorité de progrès ? » Le premier ministre Edouard Philippe sur le plateau de TF1  quelques heures après sa nomination, à Boulogne le 15 mai. JEAN CLAUDE COUTAUSSE / FRENCH-POLITICS POUR LE MONDE « Honoré de cette propositon » Interrogé sur une éventuelle hésitation avant d’accepter le poste, Edouard Philippe a répondu : « Je ne sais pas si c’est un enfer mais je veux bien croire que la tâche est considérable. On est à la fois honoré de cette proposition et on y réfléchit bien ». Il a également défendu le projet de réformer le code du travail dès l’été par ordonnance, comme l’a proposé Emmanuel Macron lors de la campagne présidentielle : Nous avons un droit du travail très lourd en France, il ne protège pas beaucoup les salariés. Il y a un grand nombre de chômeurs, il faut donc faire quelque chose, on ne peut pas ne rien faire. Ce petit-fils de docker, diplômé de Sciences Po et énarque (promotion Marc-Bloch), a commencé à militer au Parti socialiste (PS), tendance Rocard, durant ses années d’études avant de se rapprocher de la droite. Il y a d’ailleurs côtoyé à cette époque, dans les rangs des jeunes rocardiens, un certain Alexis Kohler, aujourd’hui secrétaire général de l’Elysée. Le premier ministre Edouard Philippe à Boulogne le 15 mai. JEAN CLAUDE COUTAUSSE / FRENCH-POLITICS POUR LE MONDE En 2001, il rejoint l’équipe municipale du maire du Havre, Antoine Rufenacht, qui lui passera le témoin en 2010. Mais c’est dans l’ombre d’Alain Juppé, qui l’a fait venir comme directeur général lorsqu’il prend la présidence de l’UMP à sa création, en 2002, qu’il va prospérer. De là date une fidélité à tous crins. Il était un des piliers de l’équipe de campagne du maire de Bordeaux à la primaire de la droite. Volonté d’élargissement et de rééquilibrage La nomination d’Edouard Philippe au poste de premier ministre prolonge l’opération de renouvellement voulue et incarnée par Emmanuel Macron. Peu connu du grand public, il apparaît comme un visage nouveau. Surtout, elle s’inscrit dans une stratégie qui vise à faire exploser la droite. Depuis son élection, M. Macron n’a cessé d’adresser des messages et de nouer directement le dialogue avec une partie de la droite, avec un traitement particulier pour les juppéistes. Dans le sillage du nouveau premier ministre, le président de la République espère attirer des responsables LR de premier plan, dont certains pourraient intégrer le gouvernement. Dans la foulée, ce mouvement d’une partie de la droite pourrait s’élargir aux investitures pour les élections législatives, volontairement laissées ouvertes après une première liste de 428 candidats, qui devrait être complétée mercredi, le dépôt des candidatures étant clos vendredi à 18 heures. Le choix d’Edouard Philippe marque la volonté d’élargissement et de rééquilibrage de la majorité présidentielle. C’est aux élections législatives des 11 et 18 juin que l’on pourra mesurer les premiers effets de cette opération, alors que les dirigeants de LR, pour leur part, s’accrochent toujours à l’espoir d’une revanche dans les urnes pour imposer à Emmanuel Macron une cohabitation.

Selon ces mêmes estimations, au terme d’un match à quatre serré, le candidat de la France insoumise Jean-Luc Mélenchon et François Fillon sont éliminés, au coude-à-coude pour la troisième place. Très loin derrière vient le candidat socialiste Benoît Hamon, autour de 6–7%. >>> Macron et Le Pen qualifiés : quels sont leurs parcours et leurs programmes ? Aucun des deux grands partis Ce scénario Macron-Le Pen rebat les cartes de la politique française : c’est la première fois sous la Ve République que la droite est absente du second tour, et la première fois qu’aucun des deux grands partis qui ont dominé la vie électorale depuis près d’un demi-siècle , Les Républicains (LR) et le Parti socialiste, n’y est présent. Jamais élu, Emmanuel Macron est désormais en bonne position pour emporter le scrutin suprême le 7 mai et devenir, à 39 ans, le plus jeune président de la République de l’Histoire, devant Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. Face à lui se dresse la candidate du Front national, qui réédite la performance de son père en 2002 en accédant au second tour, sans toutefois arriver en tête comme elle l’a longtemps espéré. Mais il ne s’agit cette fois pas d’une surprise : sa qualification au second tour était prédite par tous les sondage s sans exception depuis 2013. Estimations incertaines Quand les sondeurs anticipaient une abstention record, le scrutin a mobilisé : le taux de participation, en baisse d’un point seulement à 17 heures, devrait avoisiner 78 à 81%, selon les estimations des instituts (79,5% en 2012). Les estimations de résultats des instituts sont toutefois moins certaines que lors des précédents scrutins, car le temps imparti pour les réaliser a été réduit avec la fermeture des premiers bureaux de vote à 19 heures, au lieu de 18 heures. Vainqueur triomphal de la primaire de droite, François Fillon a été grandement fragilisé par les affaires judiciaires, après la révélation fin janvier par Le Canard enchaîné de l’emploi soupçonné fictif de son épouse comme collaboratrice parlementaire, pour lequel la justice l’a mis en examen. François Fillon, grand vainqueur de la primaire de la droite, est éliminé dès le premier tour. Crédit photo : PASCAL GUYOT AFP Une élection hors norme Quatrième homme en 2012, avec 11,10% des voix, Jean-Luc Mélenchon pulvérise son score pour finir proche des 20%, principalement au détriment de Benoît Hamon, frondeur socialiste désigné lors d’une primaire face à l’ancien Premier ministre sortant Manuel Valls. Mais il échoue au troisième rang, place maudite de l’élection. Jean-Luc Mélenchon frôle les 20% selon les premières estimations, mais ne se qualifie pas pour le second tour. Crédit photo : BERTRAND GUAY AFP Quant à Benoît Hamon, il crève le plancher du score éliminatoire de Lionel Jospin en 2002 (16,18%), et fait même le pire score d’un candidat socialiste depuis Gaston Defferre en 1969 (5,01%). Benoît Hamon a reconnu une défaite \"historique pour le PS\". Crédit photo : MARTIN BUREAU AFP Cette dixième élection présidentielle au suffrage universel de la Ve République est hors normes à plus d’un titre : un président sortant François Hollande pas en mesure de se représenter, une première depuis la mort en fonction de Georges Pompidou en 1974; élimination des favoris Alain Juppé, Nicolas Sarkozy et Manuel Valls , lors des primaires; match serré dans la dernière ligne droite entre quatre candidats; contexte de menace terroriste, avec un scrutin sous état d’urgence, instauré après les attentats de novembre 2015.

Par Romain Herreros POLITIQUE - Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet a perdu connaissance durant plusieurs minutes. La candidate des Républicains aux élections législatives a fait un malaise en campagne à Paris ce jeudi 15 juin, après une altercation avec un passant, a rapporté l'AFP. NKM était en campagne sur un marché dans le Ve arrondissement, place Maubert. La candidate, qui s'est effondrée, a été prise en charge par les pompiers. L'AFP a partagé deux photos impressionnantes de la candidate après sa chute. On y voit notamment Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet allongée et la tête contre le sol, prise en charge par un secouriste après avoir été secourue par deux personnes. L'agence de presse a aussi diffusé une photo du moment de l'altercation (ci-dessous): AFP AFP AFP AFP L'ancienne ministre, en ballottage défavorable dans la 2e circonscription de Paris face à un candidat LREM, distribuait des tracts lorsqu'un homme d'une cinquantaine d'années les lui a pris pour les lui envoyer au visage, la traitant notamment de \"bobo de merde\".

NKM, déséquilibrée, a chuté sur le sol et perdu connaissance durant plusieurs minutes, sous une forte chaleur. Les pompiers sont intervenus et elle a repris connaissance. Se tenant la tête, elle a été installée dans leur camion et conduite à l'hôpital Cochin. Son équipe de campagne évoque de son côté \"une agression pendant une distribution de tracts\". Un terme également employé par Anne Hidalgo, qui a condamné \"avec la plus grande fermeté\" cet \"acte lâche et intolérable\". \"Je tiens à témoigner à NKM toute ma solidarité et lui souhaite de se rétablir au plus vite après cette agression\", a-t-elle ajouté dans un second tweet.

De la gauche à la droite, les messages de soutien venant des responsables politiques pleuvent. Le premier ministre, Edouard Philippe est allé rendre visite à Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet. Son adversaire, Gilles Le Gendre, s'est dit de son côté \"navré d'apprendre l'altercation et le malaise\" dont la candidate a été victime. \"Je lui souhaite de se rétablir très vite\", a-t-il indiqué. Il a ensuite annoncé la suspension de sa campagne. Vous ne pouvez visionner ce contenu car vous avez refusé les cookies associés aux contenus issus de tiers.

Après cette altercation, l'homme est parti en courant vers la bouche de métro la plus proche. \"C'est votre faute si on a Hidalgo aujourd'hui comme maire\" à Paris, lui avait-il dit, lançant également: \"Retournez dans l'Essonne!\", dont elle est députée actuellement. Une enquête a été ouverte, ont indiqué des sources judiciaires à l'AFP. Elle a été confiée au 3e district de police judiciaire de Paris et aucun suspect n'a pour le moment été interpellé. Une plainte déposée En début d'après-midi, l'équipe de NKM a diffusé un communiqué indiquant que la candidate subissait à l'hôpital \"des examens médicaux approfondis\". On y apprend également que \"la directrice de campagne de la candidate a déposé plainte\". \"Nous remercions le premier ministre, qui dans un délai extrêmement bref s'est rendu à son chevet et l'a assuré de son soutien moral\", poursuit le communiqué. Au Figaro , sa directrice de campagne a expliqué que NKM était \"très choquée\" par cet événement. La candidate aux législatives a par ailleurs décidé de confier la campagne à son équipe le temps qu'elle se rétablisse et ne recevra que \"la visite de ses enfants\". Par ailleurs, plusieurs élus parisiens de la droite et du centre ont organisé un \"rassemblement contre la violence et pour la démocratie\", qui se tiendra vendredi 16 juin à 18 heures à l'endroit où Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet a été agressée. \"Elle restera en observation cette nuit, je ne peux pas vous donner plus de détails sur sa situation médicale\", a précisé Olivia Laurentjoye dans un communiqué. \"Elle est très touchée par les marques d'affection ainsi que par l'initiative des Parisiens et des élus à se rendre demain à 18h pour un rassemblement place Maubert contre la violence et pour le respect du pluralisme\", a-t-elle ajouté.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's government showed its resolve to reform France's labor laws before the end of summer on Tuesday, warning unions that it intended to act swiftly. Macron said during the presidential campaign that he planned to fast-track the pro-business legislation through use of executive decrees in a country where the high cost of hiring and firing is seen as a deterrent to investors, and where unemployment is near double-digits. Unions had urged the government to take more time to discuss reforms they fear would reduce cherished employment rights and make France more like Anglo-American style labor markets where workers enjoy less protection. But speaking after meeting unions, Macron's prime minister stuck to a plan to pass the reforms during the summer holiday lull, a period in which unions could struggle to mobilize protesters, and said he would not seek to please unions on all of their demands. \"We won't agree on everything, but we must move forward,\" Edouard Philippe, a former conservative mayor told a news conference. \"It's both indispensable and urgent.\" Macron's La Republique En Marche (LREM) party is on course to win a landslide majority in this month's legislative elections, opinion polls show. That should help the 39-year old president sweep aside resistance from left-wing lawmakers and could also limit public support for any trade union strike action aimed at derailing the measures. Strikes and a rebellion in parliament were two factors that hamstrung the previous government's attempts to introduce similar reforms. Macron was a minister in that government between 2014 and 2016 before he quit to launch his presidential bid. His progress reforming France's regulation-laden economy this time around will be closely watched by Germany, which wants its European Union partners to boost growth and jobs by implementing measures like the ones it introduced more than a decade ago. In a document released on Tuesday, the government broadly stuck to measures contained in Macron's campaign manifesto including the capping of compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases. [L8N1J339K] Two of the biggest unions appeared willing to engage in talks with the governments. \"I don't think the unions will want to make a snap judgment since we only just got this letter from the government,\" Laurent Berger of the moderate CFDT union said on French TV. Although the more militant CGT union unsurprisingly said it disagreed with the reforms and called on workers to protest over the coming days and weeks, the smaller FO union said the reform plan contained both positive and negative points. \"It could be that unions will let past some major parts of the labor code reform, which would be good initially,\" Agnes Verdier-Molinie of the IFRAP free-market think-tank said. \"But they may be going for a deal on the pension reform, which the government could easily backtrack on because nobody understands what was in this reform,\" she said on Boursorama TV. Macron plans to tackle pension reform next year and has said he wanted to merge all 37 pension systems into one, including the generous ones enjoyed by workers at the state-owned EDF utility or SNCF railway company.

L’élue distribuait des tracts lorsqu’elle a été frappée par un homme aux alentours de 11 heures. « Cet homme était clairement hostile à la politique du gouvernement et de la majorité, ses propos étaient véhéments mais il n’était pas forcément agressif de prime abord » , a raconté Laurianne Rossi à l’Agence France Presse (AFP). L’homme a, selon elle, accusé les élus En marche ! d’être des « députés godillots » , puis critiqué « la couverture médiatique orientée en faveur d’Emmanuel Macron » . « J’ai commencé à lui répondre , mais je n’ai pas eu le temps de finir . Il m’a asséné un violent coup de poing dans la tempe droite et a pris la fuite » , a expliqué la députée. Toujours selon Laurianne Rossi, l’homme a parcouru une vingtaine de mètres avant d’être rattrapé par des militants et des commerçants, qui l’ont maîtrisé et ont ensuite attendu la police . « A ce stade, il est en garde à vue » , a confirmé une source proche de l’ enquête à l’AFP. Laurianne Rossi a déposé plainte. Son agression « semble sans gravité corporelle » , a précisé cette même source. La députée s’est dite « sonnée, un peu choquée » .

By David Wharton Staff Writer Follow July 31, 2017 9:41 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print After weeks of negotiations with the International Olympic Committee, Los Angeles officials have reached a deal to host the 2028 Summer Games under terms they hope will generate hundreds of millions in savings and additional revenues. The agreement will bring the Olympics back to Southern California for a third time, after Los Angeles hosted in 1984 and 1932. It also opens the door for the 2024 Games to be held in Paris. “It has been certainly a roller coaster,” L.A. bid chairman Casey Wasserman told The Times, adding that IOC officials “showed a real willingness to be thoughtful and creative.” Advertisement Initial reactions to the revised contract between the city and the IOC were mixed. Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College in Massachusetts, believes that L.A. officials “played their cards right.” “They’ve gotten a bunch of concessions that are significant,” said Zimbalist, who has been a critic of the Olympic movement in the past. Others questioned whether local bid officials could have bargained for even more, and whether the public should have been given a voice in the recent negotiations. Advertisement “I wonder if this was a missed opportunity for more input,” said Jules Boykoff, who teaches political science at Pacific University in Oregon and has studied previous Games. “What did people want them to ask for?” Monday’s announcement ended a tumultuous summer for the rival bid cities and Olympic leaders. 1 / 13 Scene at the Coliseum in Los Angeles during the opening ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.

(Los Angeles Times / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement The competition between L.A. and Paris, which began as a simple race for 2024, grew more complex when the IOC — with two eager candidates in hand — decided to name two winners. L.A. was expected to go second if only because it was willing to consider the option. It knew that the race with Paris would be close and that the U.S. had fallen short in several recent attempts to win the Summer Games. Paris, by contrast, had pushed back against waiting another four years. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who spearheaded the city’s campaign, said the terms of Monday’s agreement should outweigh any increased uncertainty that comes with committing to a major event more than a decade in advance. L.A.’s bid committee has estimated it would cost $5.3 billion to stage the Games and has predicted it can cover all expenses through revenues such as sponsorships and ticket sales. “I can look people in the eye and say this is a much stronger deal financially,” Garcetti said. The agreement, which was scheduled to become public at midday Monday, centers on several major issues. Advertisement The IOC has predicted it will contribute $1.7 billion of its broadcast and sponsorship revenues to Paris in 2024. Its contribution could jump to at least $2 billion by 2028 because of adjustments to the amount of sponsorship money L.A. would receive. The city will also have increased flexibility in the selling domestic sponsorships in any categories that remain unclaimed by the IOC’s international corporate partners. Olympic officials also waived various payments that could ultimately save L.A. organizers tens of millions. Under normal circumstances, cities that are awarded the Games must begin preparations immediately but do not receive the majority of their IOC contributions until a couple of years before the opening ceremony. For 2028, the IOC has agreed to advance L.A. a $180-million advance immediately. That is expected to cover the organizing’s committee’s costs for operating an extra four years and pump as much as $160 million into youth sports throughout the city. Advertisement In Olympic circles, such public benefits are referred to as “legacy” and usually occur only after the Games have finished and left town. Garcetti, who has spoken often in recent weeks about his desire for a more timely impact, predicted that youth programs could see increased funding within 12 months. “I want something for the people of L.A. now,” the mayor said. “I want the excitement to build.” But bid leaders seemed most enthusiastic about an element of the agreement that would have to wait until after the closing ceremony. Their bid estimate includes a $487.6 million contingency — money that would be set aside to pay for the sort of cost overruns that have plagued recent Games, leaving hosts with substantial deficits. Olympic experts have said that L.A. could be different because its plan relies on existing venues such as Staples Center, Pauley Pavilion and the Coliseum. It avoids spending billions to construct new stadiums and arenas. Advertisement Further savings would arise from housing athletes and the media at UCLA and USC rather than building expensive villages. If the Games finish at or under budget, the $487-million contingency would convert to a surplus — similar to the one left by the 1984 Los Angeles Games — and L.A. officials have struck a deal to keep most of that money. With the IOC waiving its customary right to 20% of any surplus, the resulting amount could total $100 million or more. Still, accepting the 2028 Summer Games comes with considerable risk. Politics and economies can make huge shifts over a decade. The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games offered a recent example — the Brazilian economy, which was booming a few years earlier, suffered a slump that left organizers making last-minute cutbacks and scrambling to pay their bills. L.A. organizers will also have to renegotiate contracts with all the venues, shifting to a new date. Wasserman said talks are already underway. Finally, the City Council will have to dive back into the issue after offering its support for 2024 earlier this year. An ad hoc committee is scheduled to reconvene later this week. Advertisement Garcetti and Wasserman said they are confident that they can reach an accord with all parties — which include state and federal officials — before the IOC meets in mid-September. At that point, IOC members will be asked to vote their approval and L.A. must sign the revised host city contract, making the deal official. david.wharton@latimes.com Follow @LAtimesWharton on Twitter ALSO American Caeleb Dressel ties Michael Phelps’ world championship record with seven gold medals Advertisement Would an 11-year wait for the Olympics lead to greater risks for L.A.?

The mountains classification has also been tweaked, with extra points awarded on the Hors Category climbs. \nRace director Christian Prudhomme seems to have taken inspiration from the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana by searching out steeper, little-known climbs and reducing stage distances. He also called on the UCI to allow him to reduced team sizes to end what he called a 'catenaccio' racing style.\n\"Certainly, from my first reaction there were quite a few stages going up over 2,000 metres. The Izoard goes up to 2,300 metres; that's going to be an absolute beast of a stage. Initial feelings are that it's going to be a race that is won or lost in the mountains. Of course, it's the Tour and anything can happen so we have to be ready for all eventualities.\"\nRichie Porte said: \"It's quite a balanced course. There's not a lot of time trialling but there is quite a bit of climbing but descending to the finish as well. There's quite a spread between the Planche des Belles Filles on the fifth stage and then the Col d'Izoard on the 18th. There's a lot of stages in between there with cross winds. I think it's typical to stand here now and saw that it's not a climber's Tour but the road will always decide that.\" \nDetailed reconnaissance of the new steep climbs will be vital for every Tour de France contender. \nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\nTour de France 2017 route\nStage 1, Saturday, July 1: Dusseldorf - Dusseldorf (ITT), 13kmStage 2, Sunday, July 2: Dusseldorf – Liege, 202kmStage 3, Monday, July 3: Verviers – Longwy, 202kmStage 4, Tuesday, July 4: Mondorf-Les-Bains – Vittel, 203kmStage 5, Wednesday, July 5: Vittel – Planche des Belles Filles, 160kmStage 6, Thursday, July 6: Vesoul – Troyes, 216kmStage 7, Friday, July 7:Troyes – Nuit-Saint-Georges, 214kmStage 8.
