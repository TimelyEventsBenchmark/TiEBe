Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly defends it as \"calling out when the Labour Party put what they know to be complete fabrications in the public domain\". The Electional Commission calls on all campaigners to act \"responsibly\", fact-checking body Full Fact criticises this behaviour as \"inappropriate and misleading\" and a spokesperson from Twitter says that they would take \"decisive corrective action\" if there were \"further attempts to mislead people\".",
