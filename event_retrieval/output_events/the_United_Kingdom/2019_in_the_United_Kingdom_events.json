The Electional Commission calls on all campaigners to act \"responsibly\", fact-checking body Full Fact criticises this behaviour as \"inappropriate and misleading\" and a spokesperson from Twitter says that they would take \"decisive corrective action\" if there were \"further attempts to mislead people\".",
