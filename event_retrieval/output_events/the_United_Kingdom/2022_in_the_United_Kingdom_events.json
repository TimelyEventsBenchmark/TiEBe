It reveals more than 1,000 girls had been abused over a 40-year period, and that agencies blamed victims for the abuse they suffered, not the perpetrators, and exploitation was not investigated because of \"nervousness about race\" in the belief that investigation against Asian men would inflame \"racial tensions\". The report makes 47 recommendations for improvement by agencies involved. West Mercia Police apologise \"unequivocally\" for past events, as well as Telford and Wrekin Council. Victims were often blamed for \"child prostitution\" and offenders were emboldened by the lack of police action.",
