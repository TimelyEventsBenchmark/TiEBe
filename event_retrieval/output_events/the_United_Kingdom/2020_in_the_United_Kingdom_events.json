This year's exams were cancelled due to the COVID-19 epidemic, so results were instead calculated using predictions submitted by teachers, called centre assessed grades (CAGs). The predictions were then moderated by the regulator, Ofqual, using an algorithm designed to eliminate grade inflation. This gave an overall pass rate 0.7% higher than in 2019, with more students being accepted for their first choice university course than in that year. Following concerns that 39% of results predicted by teachers in England were downgraded by the moderation process, Ofqual accuses some teachers of submitting \"implausibly high\" predictions. University data shows that 79% of the 2019 university intake did not achieve their predicted grades in exams.",
