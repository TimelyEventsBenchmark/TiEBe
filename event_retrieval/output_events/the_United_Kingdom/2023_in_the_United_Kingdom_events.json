The leaked messages suggest Hancock favoured school closures, while Williamson was more hesitant. Hancock, who worked alongside journalist Isabel Oakeshott to co-author a book, describes the release of the messages as a \"massive betrayal and breach of trust\". In response, Oakeshott says she released the messages because she believed doing so was in the \"public interest\".",
