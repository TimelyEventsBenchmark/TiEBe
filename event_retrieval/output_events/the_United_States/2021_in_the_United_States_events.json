Due to the ceremony's delay from February 28 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, films from two calendar years were eligible at the same point, with the cut-off date being the intended original Awards date. ChloÃ© Zhao's Nomadland wins three awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Frances McDormand for Best Actress. David Fincher's Mank leads the nominations with ten, while Anthony Hopkins wins Best Actor for The Father (becoming the oldest winner in an acting category), Daniel Kaluuya Best Supporting Actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and Youn Yuh-jung Best Supporting Actress for Minari. Keeping in line with other award ceremonies reporting viewership declines, the telecast garners 10.4 million viewers according to Nielsen estimates, down 56% from the previous year and making the broadcast by far the lowest-rated in Oscar history.",
