On , a large and violent multi-vortex tornado struck Greenfield, Iowa at EF4 intensity. In Greenfield, a mobile radar measured winds of 309–318 miles per hour (497–512 km/h) inside the tornado, marking the third time winds of over 300 miles per hour (480 km/h) had ever been measured. On , an intense EF3 tornado struck Rosston, Era, Valley View, and Pilot Point in Texas, killing seven people, making it the deadliest tornado of both the outbreak sequence and in the United States during 2024 and injuring up to 100 others. Due to a malfunction, tornado sirens in Valley View would not sound before the tornado struck. On , another intense EF3 tornado struck Eddyville, Crider, Charleston, and Barnsley in Kentucky, which prompted the issuance of four tornado emergencies.",
