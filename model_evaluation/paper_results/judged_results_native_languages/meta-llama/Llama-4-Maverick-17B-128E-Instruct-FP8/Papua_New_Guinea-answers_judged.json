It comes as the number of people infected with coronavirus rises above 4000 and the death toll surpasses 100. Meanwhile, Papua New Guinea is banning travellers from Asian countries, and one provincial leader has gone a step further, announcing he will stop all Chinese people from entering his province. There are no confirmed cases of the deadly virus in PNG, but the health department has conceded the country will struggle to cope if there is a local outbreak. PNG is among several Pacific governments that have announced new measures in the past 24 hours. Palau has said it is temporarily suspending flights from China, Macau and Hong Kong for the entire month of February, and is also restricting its government workers from travelling to those destinations. Vanuatu media is reporting its government is taking the same measures, while in the Federated States of Micronesia, the President David Panuelo said in a statement he would be meeting today with senior officials to discuss their response and he has suggested a \"ban on travellers from China, are the most proactive options available to us\". PNG announced its own ban late yesterday. The Immigration Minister Westly Nukundj issued a public notice, saying that all air and sea ports will turn away travellers from \"Asian ports\" because of the spread of the coronavirus. The notice does not specify which countries are included in the ban or how it will be enforced. It also says citizens and residents returning to PNG from \"any Asian countries\" must go through a two week \"quarantine assessment period\", and 20 days of monitoring \"before entry is determined\". PNG had already introduced additional screening for passengers from mainland China but there were concerns they were not being properly implemented. Pacific Beat has approached PNG's National Airports Corporation to confirm what specific screening measures have been put in place at Port Moresby's international airport but there has been no response so far. The Immigration Minister also announced they would temporarily close the remote land border at Wutung between PNG and Indonesia Ray Tanji is a community leader at Wutung and he's told the ABC they're worried. \"My people at the border and very very scared. We are at the gateway,\" he said. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, the East Sepik Governor Allan Bird announced that he would ban all Chinese people from his province until the situation calms down. He told Pacific Beat that he believes he has the power to implement the ban, and denies it is racially motivated. \"We are an absolute sitting duck...Any time there is a threat to life for people in my province, I have the power to make emergency decisions. This is one of those times.\" Credits Evan Wasuka, Reporter Image Details Passengers wear masks to prevent an outbreak of a new coronavirus in a subway station, in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2020.

While Papua New Guinea appears to have avoided the worst of the pandemic, there are concerns about clusters in several provinces and a lack of widespread testing. Only 50,000 Covid-19 tests have been carried out in the nation of some nine million since the pandemic began, and the World Health Organisation has said that \"the number of confirmed cases tends to be higher in provinces which report doing more testing\". The largest number of cases in the last year has been found in the capital Port Moresby, but now several more remote regions with limited public health facilities are trying to get outbreaks under control. Seventy-five of the new cases were reported in West Sepik on the border with the Indonesian province of West Papua, and cases were also found on the islands of New Britain and Bougainville.

As PNG struggles to contain the spread of Covid-19 , with its total number of confirmed cases approaching 2000, the government is preparing for the vaccine rollout, saying it hopes this will begin by the end of April. Photo: AFP Prime Minister James Marape said the PNG Medical and Scientific Advisory Comittee studied the various Covid-19 vaccines developed. He said it recommended that PNG source the AstraZeneca vaccine developed through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access, or COVAX, facility. It has also been approved by the World Health Organisation. Marape said vaccination would not be compulsory. It will be targeted at health workers, people over the age of 50 and those with underlying health conditions. According to the Department of Health, PNG will receive a total of 588,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine before end of June from the first allocation. The vaccine will be shipped to PNG in two shipments: the 1st shipment of 288,000 doses is expected to arrive sometime between end of March to April and the second shipment with the remaining 300,000 doses will arrive between May and June of this year. The tentative date of vaccination will be end of April or beginning of May. Frontline essential health workers would be vaccinated first, with the initial allocation of vaccine by the end of June, followed by the most vulnerable including those with co-morbidities and older persons in the second half of the year. In a statement, Marape voiced concern that a large number of health workers have been affected by Covid-19, therefore, they will be given priority for vaccination. \"Health workers will be vaccinated first as we are seeing a growing number of health workers who are getting infected in the line of their work,\"he said. \"There is evidence that there is a large community transmission in the National Capital District, and that is affecting health workers who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients in the course of their duty. \"This is a serious community transmission and we are now relooking at our own isolation strategies, and how we can best look after our health workers while processes for bringing in the vaccine are completed and the vaccines are brought into the country.\" The prime minister said he would not be taking the vaccine ahead of those who need it most, and would only take it to show Papua New Guineans that the vaccine can boost their immune system to fight the virus.

He said he had been clear of covid for about two weeks, before which he was sick for three weeks. Juffa said the public must be careful to protect themselves as Covid-19 is real and dangerous.

He called for Papua New Guineans to get vaccinated against the virus, however, so far less than one percent of the population has had a first dose of the vaccine. \"I call on all Papua New Guineans not to be complacent. A recent survey found that 62 per cent of our people do not think they will catch Covid-19, and that is why they have not come forward to be vaccinated,\" Esorom said. \"As we all watch the number of deaths continue to rise in Fiji, in India and right around the world, we should take this as a wakeup call for us all to vaccinate. The only way for our people to survive Covid-19 is through vaccination.\" PNG's government recently re-introduced strict border control measures in a bid to prevent the Delta strain reaching its shores. The National Control Centre's last update to PNG's confirmed number of Covid-19 cases, five days ago, reported the total had reached 17,340, with 179 known deaths. However, health authorities have recently scaled back an already limited Covid-19 testing regime as they shift their focus to vaccinating vulnerable parts of the population.

The official death toll is 167. The country's Health Secretary, Osborne Liko, said the doses gifted by New Zealand will boost PNG's vaccination programme and ensure that more people, including essential frontline workers, will be protected. \"These doses will ensure more lives are saved and that frontline workers can continue to provide essential services to the people of Papua New Guinea,'' Dr Liko said. However, PNG authorities have struggled with a slow uptake of vaccination so far, with hesitancy a major obstacle . Since March, only 41-thousand people have taken the first dose of Astrazeneca, mainly essential workers and around 7,000 health workers. However up to a hundred thousand doses of Astrazeneca sent earlier this year by Australia and India are set to go to waste next month when they expire, unless the uptake increases. PNG's Deputy Pandemic Response Controller, Dr Daoni Esorom, said the 146,000 doses sent by New Zealand this week will help the Department of Health and the National Control Centre to roll out the 2nd dose of Astrazeneca among front line health workers and other essential front line workers. According to Dr Daoni, fact that PNG is receiving 20 per cent of the quantity of doses sent to it from the COVAX facility, while partners like the Australian and New Zeeland governments will be supporting additional doses to the PNG government - all of which are purportedly to enable the government to vaccinate 50 percent of its eligible population. 146,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, bought by the NZ Government were delivered to PNG this week.

The move has been prompted by a spike in Covid-19 infection rates in Eastern Highlands province as well as the two provinces which sit on the border with Indonesia, Western and West Sepik. From left: PNG's Health Minister Jelta Wong, Prime Minister James Marape, and Foreign Minister Soroi Eoe who is Acting Prime Minister. Photo: PNG PM Media While testing for Covid-19 is limited in PNG, the delta variant was confirmed as being in the country in July, preceding a spike in patients at hospitals in these provinces. It's understood the lockdown would begin in a week's time, and entail closure of businesses, schools and churches, and restrictions in movement. The cabinet and PNG's pandemic advisory committee are also considering lockdowns in the National Capital District, Morobe Province, and other affected parts of the Highlands including Enga. The containment move was hinted at by Prime Minister James Marape before he flew to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly this week. Marape told local media that they were seeing evidence of the Delta variant spreading across the country, and people dying as a result. With Marape now abroad, it is expected that the acting prime minister, Soroi Eoe, will sign off on the lockdown measures before the weekend. Case numbers vague Since testing for Covid in PNG was scaled back in June, the available data on this third wave of the pandemic in the country has been vague. As of Tuesday, the main agency overseeing PNG's pandemic response, the National Control Centre, said the total number of confirmed Covid cases in the country was 19,069, with the death toll at 212. However, the limited level of testing and habitual delays in reporting of case loads from the provinces suggest the true figure of those infected is far higher. Earlier, the Eastern Highlands Coronavirus Steering Committee enforced a blanket ban on all public gatherings due to a spike in infections and deaths. Furthermore, West Sepik and Western continued to attempt to restrict movement of traditional border crossers back and forth to Indonesia, however capabilities to monitor the border are also limited. Around 2 percent of the country's population have been vaccinated, according to the National Control Centre.

He said Bougainvilleans first need to unite by thinking beyond their segregated mindsets and building positive relationships that can benefit both the people and the government. And he called for people at all levels to endeavour to help create an industrious Bougainville society. Toroama said progress depended on building support for the government's planned course to prepare the country for independence. Results from a historic non-binding referendum on independence had signalled the need to innovate and do things differently, he said. The final report on the referendum's findings was presented to Papua New Guinea in May last year, and showed 97.7 percent of Bougainvillians support independence. Toroama said foreign aid was one example where the government wanted to create change. Resources from aid now need to be used for economic development, co-ordinated by the newly established Bougainville Strategic Research and Planning Secretariat. In July Toroama and PNG Prime Minister James Marape held talks around the potential for independence , with both parties agreeing on a timetable that could lead to the transfer of many powers by 2023, and full independence in 2027. Since those talks, PNG Governor General Sir Bob Dadae aired concerns that PNG could disintegrate if Bougainville became independent.

The former governor of Eastern Highlands province, Julie Soso. Photo: RNZ\/Daniela Maoate-Cox With the government having decided earlier this year that the country must learn to live with the virus, health authorities also scaled back testing and reporting on cases. The result is a silent health disaster steadily unfolding around parts of the country such as the heavily populated Highlands region. Since PNG's first reported case of it in July, the Delta strain of Covid-19 has been largely left to fester and spread. The capital Port Moresby is undergoing a third wave of the pandemic, and the strain on its health system is mirrored in several provinces. Health authorities say deaths from the virus are being recorded at Eastern Highlands province's main hospital in Goroka every day, prompting a two week lockdown from today, in a bid to stem the surge. Local environmentalist Anis Tairo said since the surge began about a month ago things had quickly come to a head in the main urban areas, Goroka and Kainantu. \"For the first couple of weeks people were not taking anything serious. They were just walking around in groups, not wearing masks. It's very typical. We have the social attitude of gathering together, moving around together, eating together. \"And because of that, the provincial government or the national government, has had to start the lockdown so people can be isolated or stay home.\" Former provincial governor Julie Soso said reports from parts of Eastern Highlands of a spate of deaths coincided with the hospital becoming full. \"For the hospital itself, it's really stressed. Mi sori for our health workers there, because a lot of them are down. They're showing signs of Covid, mild and moderate Covid. So they are treating themselves and we are downstaffed.\" Health workers moving body bags at Goroka Hospital's morgue. October 2021. Photo: EMTV It's a similar situation in Western Highlands province, where another of PNG's main hospitals has had to cut back services to focus on the Covid-19 surge. Mt Hagen Hospital emergency physician and Covid-19 response clinical lead John Junior McKup said they recently re-purposed two wards to boost capacity for Covid-19 patients from 40 to 56. But he said even then, it was not enough. \"Like last week our biggest hit was ... we had about 90-plus positive patients turn positive in a day. Regularly the numbers have been like 50 or 60 positives in a day. But we're sending home all the mild and moderate cases to self-isolate at home. We're keeping all the severe cases only in the hospital.\" The National Pandemic Response Controller's office last week put the confirmed number of cases at almost 22,000 and known deaths at 243, but testing is so low as to make such statistics misleading. Homegrown method Clinicians warn the real figures are much higher, with individual provinces seeing far more cases than the National Control Centre records. Dr McKup said in the three weeks to last Friday over 800 positive cases and 22 deaths from Covid-19 were recorded in Western Highlands, with the number likely to have increased further since then. Tairo said the rise in deaths had been frightening for his family, who he had told to regularly employ steam inhalation as a method to ward off illness. \"Get some lemon leaves and some other fruit trees, we get the leaves, and then we boil them together and steam ourselves with it for the night, and before we go out we steam ourselves. We breathe in for a while, and then we sweat it out,\" he said. Soso said many local people had been using the steaming method to respond to flu or cold type symptoms in the pandemic. One of the few: PNG's Prime Minister James Marape was the first in his country to get the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, 30 March, 2021. Photo: PNG PM Media Low vaccination rate Although the public health response to Covid-19 has not gone smoothly so far in PNG, Dr McKup said the best way forward for the country, and for its beleaguered hospital system, was clear. \"We need lots more people to get vaccinated so they don't come and need the hospital beds,\" he said. \"We've seen an increase in the number of people coming in to get vaccinated after this wave. But still our numbers are quite low, even among healthcare workers as well. So we're pushing people to get vaccinated so they don't need an admission.\" PNG is offering its citizens Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines, with a third vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, coming soon. But health authorities say only about 2 percent of the population has been vaccinated to date. Soso said uncertainty and widespread misinformation remained huge obstacles. \"They can't believe yet in the vaccines, because of all these kinds of rumours and confusions that people are creating in the Facebook, and creating in the radios,\" she said. \"People are really discouraging one another to go and get the vaccine.\" Meanwhile, Soso confirmed that rumours of her death from Covid-19, as propagated recently on social media in PNG, were false.

He said \"healthy people with no underlying issues are collapsing.\" He told the paper ward councillors and presidents have painted a grim picture of the covid situation in rural areas. New lockdown measures are now in force in Eastern Highlands as the population of 700,000 scurries to protect itself.

Eastern Highlands provincial administrator\/controller John Gimisive said for the next 14 days, the curfew would be from 2pm to 8am. Gimisive said vehicles passing through the province should have access passes to be allowed through. He said night clubs, gaming sites and liquor outlets must be closed during the curfew. Meanwhile at Port Moresby General Hospital, two more Covid-19 deaths were recorded. Hospital chief executive officer Dr Paki Molumi said 145 people were admitted - 114 at the hospital and 31 at the Nightingale Taurama Aquatic Centre.

Dr Ezebilo said since most people live in rural areas there should be consultation with religious leaders to have them pass the message on. Similar approaches can be made to community leaders and highly respected people in the communities. Ezebilo believes a number of other steps that should be taken such as involve doctors by having the vaccine provided at hospitals. Dr Eugene Ezebilo Photo: Supplied \"Provide a \"questions and answers platform\" where Covid-19 vaccine experts can answer questions about the virus and vaccine from the general public,\" he said. Provide more factual information about Covid-19 vaccine on the radio and TV, newspapers and social media. Send reminders about the need to take Covid-19 vaccine to people through text messages, e-mails, social media and in-person. He adds that as most people in PNG live in rural areas where there are little or no healthcare facilities, there is a need to consider using mobile clinics to access the areas for vaccination and provide more Covid-19 vaccination centres especially in rural areas. \"More vaccines should be moved to rural areas where majority of the country's population is,\" he said.

The sudden ban, which started on Monday, has drawn criticism from opposition MPs and political critics, who called it a violation of human rights. Defending the move, Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili Jr said the government is not trying to suppress free speech, but that it has the \"responsibility to protect citizens from harmful content\". Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Papua New Guinea, with an estimated 1.3 million users - including many small businesses that rely on it for sales. Social media has also been key in facilitating public discourse amid declining press freedom in the country. Neville Choi, president of Papua New Guinea's media council, said the move \"borders on political autocracy, and an abuse of human rights\". More concerning was the fact that at least two government agencies that oversee communication and technology said they were unaware of the government's plans, Mr Choi pointed out, despite the police saying its \"test\" was done in partnership with these agencies. \"We are now heading into dangerous territory and everyone is powerless to stop this tyranny,\" opposition MP Allan Bird wrote on Facebook. Monday's ban comes months after the passing of new counter-terrorism laws, which gives the government powers to monitor and restrict online communications, , among other things. \"It is draconian law designed to take away our freedoms,\" Bird wrote, adding that the blocking of Facebook was \"just step one\". Despite the ban, many users have still been able to access Facebook using virtual private networks, or VPNs. John Pora, who chairs the Small and Medium Enterprises Corporation, is more concerned about the thousands of retailers who earn their livelihoods on Facebook. \"We have a couple of hundred thousand people in the informal sector and they'll be feeling uncertain, so I'm hoping the systems come back online soon to allow them to trade,\" he said. Papua New Guinea authorities have long threatened to make a move against Facebook. In 2018, the country banned the platform for a month while authorities attempted to root out fake profiles. At the time, authorities mooted the idea of a state-run alternative. In 2023 Papua New Guinea launched a parliamentary inquiry into \"fake news, bad news reporting and social media [platforms]\" in the country.

Foreign companies have in recent years snapped up tracts of forest in an attempt to sell carbon credits, pledging to protect trees that would otherwise fall prey to logging or land clearing. But a string of mismanagement scandals forced Papua New Guinea to temporarily shut down this \"voluntary\" carbon market in March 2022. Environment Minister Simo Kilepa told AFP that, with new safeguards now in place, this three-year moratorium would \"be lifted immediately\". \"Papua New Guinea is uplifting the moratorium on voluntary carbon markets,\" Kilepa said. \"We now have carbon market regulations in place and... guidelines to administer and regulate the carbon market.\" Papua New Guinea has ambitions to become a \"key player in international carbon markets\", officials from the national climate body told a briefing last week. Carbon credit schemes are seen as a crucial tool in halting the destruction of Papua New Guinea's steamy rainforests, which are thought to shelter around seven percent of global biodiversity. Before the 2022 moratorium, foreign-backed syndicates were able to sign carbon credit deals directly with village elders. In essence, they paid landowners so that tracts of rainforest would not be cleared for crops, sold for mining, or chopped down and turned into logs. By protecting jungle that would have disappeared, these companies generated carbon credits they could sell on international markets. 'Carbon cowboys' The scale of some proposals was immense -- one carbon trading scheme to be based on Papua New Guinea's northern coast would have ranked among the biggest in the world, according to Carbon Market Watch. But Papua New Guinea's carbon market was mired in controversy, with one regional governor alleging some foreign firms were little more than \"carbon cowboys\" out to make quick cash. An investigation by Australian national broadcaster ABC alleged logging was still taking place in rainforests set aside for carbon credits. And some landowners complained the lucrative promises of their foreign partners went largely unfulfilled. \"Attempts to establish projects have resulted in land disputes and the emergence of 'Carbon Cowboys',\" wrote Australian environmental consultants Sustineo. Carbon credit schemes around the world have been marred by a litany of similar complaints. No common set of rules governs these trades, and many projects have been accused of selling essentially worthless credits. Governments often force heavy polluters to offset emissions through mandatory carbon credit schemes. But firms, charities and individuals can also choose to buy credits on so-called voluntary carbon markets. Papua New Guinea's voluntary scheme falls under an international framework known as REDD, or reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. Papua New Guinea has been hammering out a bilateral deal which could see it produce carbon credits for city-state Singapore. In 2023, Papua New Guinea signed a memorandum of understanding with Dubai-based firm Blue Carbon, which has been securing swaths of land across Africa for carbon credits. \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

Petroleum Minister Jimmy Maladina had pleaded not guilty to the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The charge carries a potential maximum of five years in prison.

The victims were shot dead during an ambush in the Enga province over the weekend, a national police spokesman told the BBC. The Highlands area has long struggled with violence, but these killings are believed to be the worst in years. An influx of illegal firearms have made clashes more deadly and fuelled a cycle of violence. Authorities initially said at least 64 people have died. But later reports said they had miscounted and revised the toll down to 26. The BBC has asked the Papua New Guinea police for confirmation. Police started collecting bodies at the scene near the town of Wabag - roughly 600km (373 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby. \"This is by far the largest [killing] I've seen in Enga, maybe in all of Highlands as well,\" Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Acting Supt George Kakas told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). \"We're all devastated, we're all mentally stressed out. It's really hard to comprehend.\" Police received graphic videos and photos purporting to be from the scene, showing bodies loaded onto a truck, say media outlets. Escalating tribal conflict - often over the distribution of land and wealth - led to a three-month lockdown in Enga last July, during which police imposed a curfew and travel restrictions. In August last year, the violence made international headlines after graphic footage involving three dead men circulated online. Governor Peter Ipatas told ABC that there had been signs that fighting was about to erupt again ahead of the ambush. With up to 17 tribes involved in the most recent escalation, it was ultimately up to the security forces to keep the peace, he said. \"From a provincial perspective, we knew this fight was going to be on and we [alerted] the security forces last week to make sure they took appropriate action to ensure this didn't occur.\" Security more broadly remains a key concern for PNG. The government last month declared a state of emergency after major rioting and looting left at least 15 people dead. Australia - one of the country's closest allies - said news of the killings was \"very disturbing\". \"We're providing considerable support, particularly for training police officers and for security in Papua New Guinea,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a radio interview on Monday.

A magnitude-6.9 earthquake has destroyed an estimated 1,000 homes in Papua New Guinea after striking East Sepik province, and there are reports three people have died. The quake hit at about 6:20am on Sunday, 38 kilometres from the town of Ambunti at a depth of about 40 kilometres, shaking villages along the Sepik River and in surrounding areas. Papua New Guinea's Post-Courier\u00a0newspaper is reporting three people died as the earthquake sent homes underwater in areas inundated by recent flooding. A magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck East Sepik province after flooding had already inundated the region. ( Supplied:\u00a0Office of Member for Ambunti-Drekikir\u00a0District ) East Sepik province Governor Allan Bird told the ABC regional authorities made an initial estimate that the earthquake destroyed 1,000 homes. He said it damaged most parts of the province, which was already under strain from flooding. \"The flooding actually covers an area more than 800 kilometres long, and so there's about maybe 60 or 70 villages involved all along the Sepik River,\" he said. Authorities were ready to respond to flooding this week and had medical teams on stand-by when the earthquake struck and destroyed hundreds of homes, Mr Bird said. \"The floods weren't their biggest problem. They were confidently dealing with that because it's something they're used to,\" he said. \"It was the earthquake that no-one was prepared for. That would have caused the most significant damage now.\" Villages in East Sepik province were flooded before Sunday's earthquake. ( Supplied: Cyril Tara ) Mr Bird said the most urgent needs in the disaster-affected areas were shelter and clean water, as well as canvases to keep belongings and firewood dry. 'Double disaster' People in the quake-stricken zone reported homes being thrown under water, and said communities now faced shortages of food and clean drinking water. Gideon Marlow, who is volunteering to assist earthquake-hit villages, said people were shocked to see their homes destroyed in the disaster. \"They were trying to help themselves, looking for ways to a safer place to move from the high flood area to the safer side,\" he said. \"At this moment, you know, it's a double disaster for them. So people are looking for help trying to get some sort of assistance.\" Mr Marlow said in one village he visited, seven houses had collapsed while others were on the verge of collapsing. \"I'm trying to move around as a volunteer, trying to help them. It's everyone's business to help one another,\" he said. Houses either collapsed into floodwaters or were on the verge of falling after an earthquake in Papua New Guinea on Sunday. ( Supplied: Gideon Marlow ) A community leader in Kamanibit village in Angoram District, Cyril Tara, said 39 houses belonging to his community were under water following the quake. He was grateful no-one in his community was severely injured or killed, but he said food including sago \u2014 a starch made from the material in the trunks of palms \u2014 was short. \"The families in our communities who were lucky to have bigger homes were able to cater for the families who had lost their homes and their belongings,\" he said. \"All our food gardens have been destroyed. We have fish but right now we do not have any sago following the disaster on Sunday. \" At the moment, our drinking water has also been contaminated and it's not really good, with lots of bubbles following the quake and the taste is not like what we had before. \" He called on authorities, including heads of districts and Mr Bird, to visit the affected areas and see the impacts of the earthquake. Heavy rainfall combined with strong winds have brought significant flooding and triggered landslides in Papua New Guinea this month. Local media reported 23 people died in Chimbu province in three landslides on March 18. Storm surges have also inundated the coastal village of Lese Kavora in Gulf province.

Pope Francis disembarked from his plane and was received by a military guard of honour and a brass band that played the Vatican anthem. He had flown from Indonesia, where he delivered a message of religious unity in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation. He appeared fit and smiling during his three-day visit despite a hectic schedule and intense heat, presiding over a mass on Thursday of more than 80,000 people at a football stadium in Jakarta. Francis also signed a declaration in the Indonesian capital with the grand imam of Southeast Asia's largest mosque calling for action against religiously inspired violence and climate change. He will stay until Monday in Papua New Guinea, the multi-ethnic Pacific country where the majority of the population is Christian, mostly Protestant. The former Australian colony of 12 million inhabitants, visited by John Paul II in 1984 and 1995, is regularly plagued by tribal violence and saw deadly riots in January in the wake of anti-government protests against wage cuts. Francis could also renew calls for greater protection of the environment in a country that has recorded extensive deforestation in recent decades and has been hit by natural disasters. He is expected to focus on the spread of Christianity through evangelism on a one-day trip to Vanimo, a northwest Papua New Guinean town of 10,000 people. On Monday he will travel to East Timor and then Singapore, where he will wrap up the longest and farthest tour of his 11-year papacy. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"1618 July  At least 26 people are killed in attacks by an armed gang on several villages in Angoram District, East Sepik Province.","text":"Gang kills women and children in Papua New Guinea massacre - reports 25 July 2024 Share Save Flora Drury BBC News Share Save Getty Images The attacks happened in East Sepik province, in Papua New Guinea Dozens of villagers have reportedly been killed after a gang of young men launched a series of attacks in a remote region of Papua New Guinea. Survivors of the massacre have described hearing their neighbours' cries of pain, and watching as others were speared as they tried to flee the gang in canoes. At least 26 people - including 16 children - were killed, local media reported, with fears the death toll may yet rise to 50 as the search for survivors continues. United Nations human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said the \"shocking\" violence seemed to be \"the result of a dispute over land and lake ownership and user rights\" and appealed to officials to \"ensure those responsible are held to account\". Governor Allan Bird told Australia's ABC News there were just 20 police officers for the 100,000 people who live in the Angoram district of East Sepik province where the attack took place. National police have now arrived in the region to help with the investigation - more than a week after the violence took place. But according to local media, police already know the identity of the more than 30 men who carried out the attacks between 16 and 18 July. The gang - who Angoram police Inspector Peter Mandi said called themselves \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, according to the Guardian -  were armed with guns, knives and axes, attacking in the early hours. They allegedly raped and killed their victims, setting numerous homes alight. One woman described how she had floated for hours clinging to a log, trying to remain quiet while the attack went on around her. \"I could hear women wailing in pain, children crying out. I was lucky the men didn't see me,\" she told The National newspaper. Another survivor said simply of the \"surprise\" attack: \"We were helpless.\" The villagers who could escaped into the surrounding bush, leaving behind the dead. Provincial police commander Senior Inspector James Baugen described to the Post Courier how bodies had been left \"rotting\" in the village, while others had been taken by crocodiles after floating down the river. He added that many of the dead were mothers and their children. Gov Bird said law and order had been on the decline in the region for the last six months. It was thought land ownership was also the cause of a similarly shocking attack in Papua New Guinea's Highlands in February, in which another 26 people were killed. A year ago, escalating tribal conflict over land and wealth led to a three-month lockdown in Enga province, during which police imposed a curfew and travel restrictions.

But the session was not without drama. Just after 10am, after the opposition leader moved a motion for a vote of no confidence announcing Renbo Paita as the alternate prime Minister, the house descended into momentary chaos as members questioned why speaker, Job Pomat, refused to allow for debate after the motion. The opposition had intended to use the opportunity to highlight pressing concerns that caused MPs to move to the opposition. The member for Madang, Bryan Kramer, challenged the speaker to follow standing orders to the letter as stipulated in the constitution while Wabag MP, Lino Tom, accused the speaker of stifling the people's voices by not entertaining debate. \"The people of this country paid our salaries to debate this. The people need to know why we put in a vote of no confidence,\" Lino Tom said. \"This is the right forum where out voices need to be heard\" After intense exchanges between the chair and the opposition, the speaker admitted to making an error in parliamentary process. But he still proceeded to call for a vote. PNG's constitution allows a government a grace period of 18 months before a vote of no confidence can be brought to parliament. Since 1977, every sitting prime minister has had to fend off threats of votes of no confidence. James Marape himself, came to power in 2018, through a vote of no confidence. While James Marape may have been successful this time, he still faces the possibility of another vote of no confidence if the opposition musters enough numbers to do so. Speaking after the vote, the Prime Minister said, while votes of no confidence are an essential part of democracy, Section 145 of the constitution which provides for the process has been abused in many instances. \"Provincial Governors have five years to work. Provincial legislators have five years to work. The most important chair of the land has 18 months...and managing 18 months of politics and doing work, comes with great cost.\" The pressure is now on him to prove that that he has the ability and the political will to stem instances of corruption, fix the ailing economy, stem inflation and address crime - the biggest concerns for Papua New Guineans. Over the next few days, the Prime Minister will announce a cabinet reshuffle to fill vacancies left by MPs who have left.

Key points: There is a fragile peace in\u00a0Port Moresby following violent riots after a state of emergency was declared last night Security firms are still warning things remain unpredictable and volatile Attention has now\u00a0turned to restoring essential services as businesses face massive clean up bills It's understood the remains of the six people were found at two different shops in the city that were looted and set on fire. It brings the total of people dead in the country's capital of Port Moresby to 15, while\u00a0a further seven have been killed in Lae, PNG's second largest city. A 14-day state of emergency is in effect in Port Moresby as authorities try to restore law and order, as well as essential services, following violent riots. Tensions have been high throughout the country since a police strike paved the way for violence in PNG's capital and its second largest city of Lae ,. Shops were set on fire, ATMs were ripped out of walls and citizens were shot as crowds of angry residents took to the streets as part of the unrest. There is a fragile peace in the capital, though security firms are still warning things remain unpredictable and volatile, as Prime Minister James Marape tries to re-establish faith in the country's security and the government . The Marape government has placed the blame over the riots squarely at the feet of the nation's police constabulary, many of whom walked off the job in protest over a payroll issue just hours before Port Moresby descended into chaos on Wednesday. \"Not only [have] our security forces failed us but some of them went out of their way to incite or encourage our people to loot,\"\u00a0\u00a0National Capital District Governor\u00a0Powes Parkop, a coalition partner with Marape, said in a press conference today. \"\u2026 I even went to the extent of asking the Australian Government to be on stand-by and I made no apology in that respect, you see I can't trust our security forces, I can trust the Australian security personnel to come and give us support.\" Mr Marape has also suggested the political establishment itself could have had a role to play in this week's violence. PNG PM blames 'deep political influence' Photo shows James Marape and members of his government Prime Minister James Marape is claiming it was \"political influence\" that lit the match. The events in the capital appear to have had a ripple effect on other parts of the country, with Mr Marape stating other centres were trying to copy what happened. In an effort to restore calm, Mr Marape declared on Thursday night that 1,000 defence personnel would be on stand-by to quell any further unrest as part of a 14-day state of emergency . The announcement was followed by a high-visibility drive-through by police and defence officers of Port Moresby, with lights and sirens. On Friday afternoon, Mr Marape described the state of emergency as being \"toned down\" with limitations on movement of large groups of people, with the exception of church and funeral\u00a0services. The measures were designed to allow the government to supervise the re-opening of stores, with multiple shops damaged as part of the riots. Already, residents across the city are struggling to access necessities and attention has now turned to shoring up supplies of essential services. \"People ran out of food and medicines, [during the] two-day closure and it's impacted the whole nation,\" says Mahesh Patel, the founder and director of PNG's largest retailer, City Pharmacy Limited (CPL). He was able to open one store this morning but his chemist was burnt down and will remain closed, which he says will mean\u00a0residents don't have anywhere else to go when they are ill except to hospital. \"Five to six thousands patients every month will put pressure on the hospital system now,\" he said. He says he's worried about growers and farmers across the country in the wake of this week's unrest. Mr Patel said he is worried about the impact of the violent riots on retailers. ( ABC News: Tim Swanston ) \"It's not about money, it's not about CPL, it's about the nation as a whole,\" he said. \"Our orders will be cut into half next week.\u00a0The livelihood of the 300-400 staff which were involved in these stores which burnt down, we'll keep them employed for sure, but sooner or later we'll have to make a call on business viability.\" Some banks and petrol stations have reopened with limited business hours in PNG's capital, while other businesses are facing massive clean-up bills. PNG local was forced to flee from tear gas Christine Gabriel, a local business owner, was at work selling products with her 5-year-old boy when the violence kicked off. Chistine Gabriel, a local store owner, told the ABC she saw security try to chase rioters away on Wednesday. ( ABC News: Tim Swanston ) She told the ABC she saw \"the opportunists\" outside the fence near her stall throwing stones before a fire broke out in the building behind her. Ms Gabriel said she was encouraged by others around her to flee once the situation escalated and tear gas was let off. \"With my five-year-old boy and all my products, we just left and I got my son and I ran out,\" she said. \"When I get out there, everywhere is smoke, with tear gas. I saw a police officer and I said 'help, I'm with my son, he's suffocating from the smoke.' \"So he said, 'okay boys you stop and let the madam with her child run outside'. I got my son and tried my best to find a way out.\" In reflecting back on the violence, Ms Gabriel said she felt \"out of control\" and prayed to God for help. \"My feet and my arms were shaking and I thought 'that's the end of it,'\" she said. Outside a burnt down store and chemist in north Waigani, local resident Kennedy Kelgai said he didn't understand why people chose to destroy the building. Mr Kelgai is disappointed the looters chose to burn down stores in Port Moresby. ( ABC News: Tim Swanston ) \"This is where we get food. The people who looted the shops could have only taken the store goods, why do they have to set fire to the store?\" he said. He said many residents in nearby areas, like Morata, Gerehu and Tokarara get their supplies from there. \"The burning down of ... Shop North Waigani breaks my heart and brings tears to my eyes,\" he said. Many businesses in Port Moresby are owned by Chinese nationals, including stores that were burned down on Wednesday. Overnight, a spokesperson for China's foreign minister told China's state mouth piece, the Global Times, that the Chinese embassy in PNG would provide consular protection and assistance to Chinese nationals and institutions in PNG. A review into the riots is underway At a press conference on Friday afternoon, Mr Marape said Wednesday's riots had an element of \"organised arsonists\" and were assisted by \"some rogue element of our police force\". \"An investigation is now going deeper into this area. Within the next 14 days, a full investigation would have been completed, expressly on what transpired that should give us a basis to take administrative action as well as criminal action,\" he said. Some businesses were set alight in the riots, with owners now facing massive clean-up bills. ( ABC News: Tim Swanston ) Last night, Mr Marape confirmed he had suspended his chief of police as well as top bureaucrats in the finance and treasury departments while the government conducted a review of the cause of the riots. The unrest began after hundreds of police officers, soldiers, prison staff and other public servants walked off their jobs over what the government described as a payroll error.

It meant 300 Kina ($120) was docked from the fortnightly pay packets of public servants across the country, which is worth about half the pay of junior public service staff.\u00a0It's expected to be returned in the next pay cycle. Papua New Guinea's taxation body blamed a payroll \"glitch\" for the error. But many of those who gathered at Parliament House for a demonstration on Wednesday believed a new tax had been enacted, a claim strenuously denied by PNG's Internal Revenue Commission (IRC). Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said on Friday the circumstances in PNG \"have improved somewhat\" but the government was continuing to monitor the situation closely. \"There are no reports of Australians being caught up in these activities, but we are clearly keeping a close watch on that,\" he said.

Police Assistant Commissioner Joseph Tondon in Enga province said the death toll from the violence blamed on illegal miners was still being assessed. \u201cThere was a fierce battle on Sunday. It\u2019s estimated 35-plus men were killed in action,\u201d Tondon told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m putting all the figures together. There were some innocent bystanders also murdered,\u201d he added. A United Nations\u2019 humanitarian adviser for the South Pacific island nation, Mate Bagossy , said as many as 50 people had been killed in days of violence in Enga. He had no estimate for the number of wounded and was checking with local health facilities, which he said were ill-equipped to cope with medical emergencies. Authorities told aid agencies on Tuesday that up to 300 soldiers and police were moving to the area to restore peace, Bagossy said. \u201cWe are not sure it\u2019s calming. It\u2019s not yet stabilized,\u201d Bagossy said. Fighting in the Porgera Valley broke out on the outskirts of Porgera town near the New Porgera gold mine, which has halted most of its operations because of the violence until at least Thursday.

A disaster management meeting led by the Papua New Guinea\u2019s National Disaster Center and the U.N. Resident Coordinator Richard Howard on Tuesday agreed to send a team to Porgera within days to assess humanitarian needs, the degree of danger and the area\u2019s accessibility, Bagossy said. One obstacle for responders delivering aid was that the main road to Porgera remained blocked 40 kilometers (25 miles) from town by rubble from a massive landslide on May 24. The national government estimates more than 2,000 villagers were buried and hundreds more displaced. The United Nations estimated only 670 villagers died but does not dispute that the death toll could be far higher. Tribal warfare is a growing security problem across Papua New Guinea and is rife in Enga, where recovery has been slow since the landslide. Bagossy did not know how many fighters were involved near Porgera, but social media video showed they were heavily armed. \u201cThere is a combination of high-powered weapons, including assault rifles. That\u2019s not very common yet \u2014 it\u2019s expensive \u2014 but is becoming more and more common,\u201d Bagossy said. Community tensions had been simmering for some time, but the violence escalated last week. \u201cThe reports that we got is that this was initiated as a ... relatively minor conflict between illegal miners,\u201d Bagossy said. \u201cThe conflict escalated into clashes between two groups and then those two groups have reportedly brought in their allies and this has caused an eruption of violence in the entire area of Porgera town and surrounds,\u201d he added.

It is unclear how many people died in the disaster, with estimates ranging from 160 to 2,000. What's next? PNG officials say around 8,000 villagers may need to be relocated because of the threat of further landslips. Crowds of distraught mourners greeted Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape as he visited a PNG Highlands settlement destroyed by last week's massive landslide and promised to throw government support behind the recovery effort. Mr Marape sat and listened in front of a crowd of several hundred people at Mulitaka, including dozens of people daubed with mud and wailing to mark the loss of family or loved ones. Rations and clothing were being distributed onsite, but one community leader told Mr Marape that more help was badly needed. \"With a broken heart, we are asking the Enga provincial government to assist us with funding. Prime minister, please help us with funding,\" said Porgera District Coordinator Robert Alembo. \"The situation we are in right now is the dead of an unmarried woman. There is no support.\" Mr Marape got emotional during his visit, declaring at a regional airport on arrival that he was determined to make sure the government helped in the recovery effort. \"l am here to show my sorrow on behalf of the whole country,\" he said. \"We will do our utmost to fast-track relief work and ensure relief work goes on.\" 'The earth is still moving' One villager said it was important to have the prime minister in town to recognise the scale of the disaster, but said villagers were desperate for the government to bring in more heavy earthmoving equipment to help recover bodies still under the rubble. The landslide in Enga may have claimed up 2,000 lives, but locals say the death toll could be closer to 160. ( ABC News: Stephen Dziedzic ) \"It happened last Friday but we didn't get assistance from our government to recover those buried,\" he said. \"If our government can assist us in the recovery work, we will be thankful.\" But the prime minister told reporters and local dignitaries that he was still hesitant to do that because of the risk of triggering further landslides. \"From reports we received on engineering and seismic reports, the earth is still moving,\" he said. \"That's why [we] haven't moved in with machinery, in case it triggers another landslide.\" Mr Marape hailed development partners like Australia and New Zealand for their help and said a host of countries, including China and the United States, had offered more support. \"l saw some blessing in this \u2026 our global networks of family nations have all come together,\" he said. \"We can find comfort we are not alone in these recovery efforts.\" A huge landslide sent tonnes of debris towards a village in Enga province. ( AP: Juho Valta\/UNDP Papua New Guinea ) Local officials say the village is still deeply traumatised by the catastrophe, with many locals fleeing into the bush after the landslide buried houses in a vast wall of rubble and debris at 3am on May 24. The death toll from the catastrophe remains unclear, with estimates ranging from 160 to 2,000. Two Mulitaka residents told the ABC that perhaps 300\u2013400 people had perished but said it was hard to gauge the figure because some of those killed were from other districts. Australia has been using military transport planes to fly relief supplies into the region, while Australian disaster assistance response teams have been using drones to help map the mountainside and ascertain the risk of more landslides. PNG officials say around 8,000 villagers may need to be relocated because of the threat of further landslips in the area, although it is not clear how many have been moved at this stage.

And I can tell you now it's all going to consultants.\" The island of New Guinea is home to the third-largest expanse of rainforest on the planet, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and has long been celebrated as one of the \"lungs of the earth\". Impoverished, flanked by ocean, and already prone to natural disasters, Papua New Guinea is also considered to be highly vulnerable to the unfolding perils of climate change. \"COP is a total waste of time,\" Tkatchenko said. \"We are sick of the rhetoric as well as the merry-go-round of getting absolutely nothing done over the last three years. \"We are the third-biggest rainforest nation in the world. We are sucking up the pollutants of these major countries. And they are getting away with it scot-free.\" 'Talk fest' The COP summit in 2015 hammered out the landmark Paris Agreement, under which almost every country in the world has agreed to slash emissions to limit soaring global temperatures. But subsequent gatherings have been dogged by growing criticism, stoked by a perception that big polluters are using their sway to limit further climate action. Meanwhile, adaptation funds set up through COP to help developing nations have been accused of sluggish bureaucracy that fails to grasp the urgency of the crisis. Civil society groups banded together last year to urge a boycott of the COP summit hosted by the United Arab Emirates, claiming the meeting would \"greenwash\" the petrostate's poor climate credentials. Underwhelmed by proposed emissions cuts, dozens of African nations led a temporary walkout of developing nations during the 2009 COP talks in Copenhagen. And Ukraine has pressed its allies to avoid this year's summit if Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows face. But Papua New Guinea is among the first nations to have voiced such a full-throated call to boycott the COP summit altogether. \"Why are we spending all this money going to the other side of the world going to these talkfests,\" said Tkatchenko. 'No traction' Papua New Guinea is one of five Pacific nations involved in a pivotal International Court of Justice case that will soon test whether polluters can be sued for neglecting their climate obligations. Low-lying Pacific nations such as Tuvalu could be almost entirely swallowed by rising oceans within the next 30 years. Tkatchenko said the decision to pull out of COP talks had been applauded by others within the Pacific bloc. \"I'm speaking up on behalf of the smaller island states that are worse off than Papua New Guinea. They were getting no traction and acknowledgement at all.\" Papua New Guinea would instead seek to strike its own climate deals through bilateral channels, said Tkatchenko, flagging that negotiations were already under way with Singapore. \"With like-minded countries like Singapore, we can do 100 times more than COP. \"They have a big carbon footprint, and we would like to think about how they can work with Papua New Guinea to fix that up.\" A key meeting ahead of COP29 ended in frustration earlier this month, with countries making little progress on how to fund a new finance deal for poorer nations. COP -- or conference of parties -- is the top United Nations climate change conference, an annual summit in which nations look to determine legally binding climate commitments. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

{"year":"2019","month":"11","event_desc":"23 November to 7 December  The non-binding 2019 Bougainvillean independence referendum showed that more than 98% of valid ballots cast were in favor of independence.","text":"Bougainville residents queue to vote at a polling station in an historic independence vote in Buka on November 23, 2019. NESS KERTON\/AFP\/AFP via Getty Images CNN \u2014 An autonomous region of Papua New Guinea has voted overwhelmingly to leave the country and form a new independent nation, authorities announced on Wednesday. More than 181,000 people voted in the independence referendum in Bougainville, a group of islands that sit on one of the world\u2019s largest copper mines, off the east coast of mainland Papua New Guinea. On Wednesday afternoon, the referendum committee announced that nearly 98% had voted for independence, with less than 2% voting to remain with increased autonomy. The results were met with celebration in Bougainville, where the results were announced in the city of Buka. Spectators at the scene whooped and cheered, and a group of women broke into song, said Gordon Peake of the Australian National University, who attended the announcement. Bougainville, formerly an Australian colonial territory, has had a fractious relationship with Papua New Guinea since joining the country in 1976. There were failed attempts at independence then, before simmering discontent erupted into a nine-year civil war that left thousands of people dead. The vote is a significant indicator of public sentiment, but is non-binding, and will now need to be approved by the Papua New Guinea parliament before Bougainville can become its own country. Bougainville independence campaigners are bracing for this next step; the copper mine, estimated to be worth $58 billion, has long been a point of territorial contention. The civil war had in part been over a dispute about the mine\u2019s management, and some predict Papua New Guinea will be reluctant to lose access to the region\u2019s valuable natural resources. Women and children wear traditional dress at a referendum polling station in Buka, Bougainville, on November 25, 2019. NESS KERTON\/AFP\/AFP via Getty Images The referendum has been a long time coming. Bougainville was finally granted limited autonomy after the war ended; although it\u2019s still part of Papua New Guinea, it also has its own parliament, president, and legislative powers. A peace agreement also guaranteed that the region could hold a referendum on its political future, sometime between 2015 and 2020. \u201cThis referendum has been on people\u2019s minds for 20 years,\u201d said Peake. \u201cPeople have been waiting for the opportunity to cast their vote for a long time.\u201d Eddie Mohin has been campaigning for independence for years, and hailed the day as a victory. A former veteran who fought in the civil war, he said he had been working \u201caround the clock\u201d to ensure the vote could go forward \u2013 and now \u201cwe got what we wanted.\u201d Voting information pamphlets at a polling station in the Bougainville capital Buka on November 22, 2019. NESS KERTON\/AFP\/AFP via Getty Images \u201cAll along (the desire for independence) was in my blood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was what our ancestors always wanted \u2026 They wanted to make sure the issue of fighting for independence was put to rest.\u201d When asked if the issue was now resolved, he gave an emphatic \u201cYes.\u201d However, Peake cautioned that more complex work lies ahead, and that the fight has only been half won. Next, the Bougainville and Papua New Guinea governments will need to meet and negotiate details for a new relationship. Many factors will need to be considered \u2013 for instance, the terms of trade, travel, and residence.

But there is uncertainty over the future implications for the country and its people with the agreement giving the US access to strategic military and civilian locations within Papua New Guinea. \"You need not fear this is not a new thing,\" Prime Minister James Marape said. While the details of the agreement are yet to be made clear, there will be a steady increase in US military presence over the next decade - the biggest since the Second World War. \"How many soldiers we are looking at, how many contractors we are looking at, I do not have that scope today but there will certainly be an increased presence and a more direct presence of US in our country,\" Marape said. He has had other proposals from nations wanting an agreement of sorts but they were turned away because they stipulated PNG must not engage with other nations. The Prime Minister said the agreement with Washington was the only proposed agreement which allowed PNG to engage with who they want. \"Certainly, as we go forward over the next 15 years, we will see US soldiers in our country. We will see US contractors in our country,\" Marape said. Papua New Guinea is a strategic military location for western powers. In the north of the country, Lombrum in Manus Province, was once a combined US naval and airbase with over 30,000 personnel. Outside of political circles, various groups have come together to voice strong concerns about the agreement. The President of the Catholic Professionals Society, Paul Harricknen fears the agreement may be unconstitutional. \"America needs to understand that we are a constitutional democracy. If there is to be geopolitical rivalry, they cannot use PNG for their disagreements,\" Harricknen said. But Marape insists it is a constitutional agreement.

Israel's foreign ministry had said in February that PNG would open its first embassy in the country some time in 2023. Israeli media including Channel 14 and the Times of Israel reported the inauguration of the embassy would take place on September 5. The vast majority of countries with an official diplomatic presence in Israel have their embassies in Tel Aviv, with only the US, Kosovo, Guatemala and Honduras basing theirs in Jerusalem. However, the Times of Israel reports that both Sierra Leone and Paraguay have announced that they would open emabssies in Jerusalem, while Hungary and Fiji are expected to follow suit . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with Marape on the day of the ceremony, the Prime Minister's Office said. PNG does not currently have an embassy in Israel, but does maintain a consulate near Tel Aviv. Israel's relations with the island nation are handled by its embassy in Australia. Late last year, Australia's Labor government reversed a controversial decision by the previous government to recognise Jerusalem as the capital and to retain the embassy in Tel Aviv. Israel annexed the eastern part of Jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the city as its \"eternal and indivisible\" capital, but that is not recognised internationally.

Photo: Hugo Burnand. Many Pacific leaders or their representatives will be attending the coronation of King Charles III in London this weekend. On Saturday UK time, the King will be crowned alongside Camilla, the Queen Consort, at Westminster Abbey. The guest list numbers 2000 - a far cry from the 8000 invited to Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. World figures will be among them including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, his New Zealand counterpart Chris Hipkins and America's First Lady Jill Biden. RNZ Pacific has looked at who will be attending from the Pacific. Tonga King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipa'u will represent the Kingdom. It's not the first time Tongan royalty has attended the crowning of a British monarch as RNZ Pacific Tonga correspondent Kalafi Moala explains. \"Our king and queen are on their way to the United Kingdom, and of course this is part of a tradition because back in 1953 when Queen Elizabeth II was coronated, Tonga's Queen Salote (Tupou III), the grandmother of our current King, was the only monarch from outside Great Britain who was there.\" Moala said the Tongan king and queen were going to London via Bangkok and met with Tongans there. Papua New Guinea PNG governor-general Sir Bob Dadae will be attending the coronation, leading a delegation of more than 30 people, including support staff. The Post-Courier reports the delegation includes the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Justin Tkatchenko, representing the Prime Minister; and the Deputy Speaker of the National Parliament. Solomon Islands Solomon Islands Governor General Sir David Vunagi will be representing his country. The Solomons Times reports this will be the first Coronation of the Head of State of Solomon Islands that an official delegation will witness after independence. The coronation of the late Queen Elizabeth II came 25 years before Solomon Islands gained independence from Britain in 1978. Sir David and Lady Mary Vunagi together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade were invited. Tuvalu Tuvalu's Governor General, Rev Tofiga Falani, will represent the country at the ceremony. Confirmation of his attendance at Westminster Abbey was made by the Finance Minister Seve Paeniu. Samoa The Head of State and Masiofo are attending the coronation of their majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla. High Commissioner Francella Strickland and Ambasador Fatumanava Dr Pao Luteru are part of the delegation. The Head of State will be delivering the keynote address at a Commonwealth - Coronation special event on Small Islands States with Samoa as the Chair of the Alliance of Small Islands States (AOSIS). Cook Islands The Cook Islands will be represented by King's Representative Sir Tom and Lady Tuaine Marsters. New Zealand As well as the Prime Minister, the M\u0101ori King will be part of the New Zealand delegation to attend; Kiingi T\u016bheitia and his wife, will travel with Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro, Chris Hipkins and others. Fiji The Fijian government will not be sending anyone to attend the coronation ceremony, according to a Fiji PM communications team spokesperson. Special ceremony on Tanna, Vanuatu Meanwhile, on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu a special ceremony will be held to mark the occasion. The ABC reports that in the villages of Yaohnanen and Yakel, where the late Prince Philip was honoured as a deity, thousands of people are expected to mark the coronation of his son. Chief Johnson Iakapass said the celebrations would include a flag-raising ceremony and lots of kava. \"It will be a big celebration; we're talking about 5,000 to 6,000 people gathering together to celebrate the crowning of this king,\" he told the broadcaster. \"This person is really meaningful to the people of Tanna ... you will see a lot of people believing and celebrating the crowning of the prince. Chief Johnson said he is is expecting people from Australia and Europe to join the celebration on Tanna. In 1974, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited the New Hebrides, before it became Vanuatu, where the Prince handed over a white pig to a member of the Tanna community during an event in the capital, Port Vila.

Marape \u2013 who became prime minister in 2019 after toppling his predecessor and former party leader, Peter O\u2019Neill \u2013 was invited to form government by the governor general, after his Pangu Pati secured 36 seats and was able to strike deals with coalition partners to bring its numbers to more than 80. O\u2019Neill had hoped to reclaim the top job, but was left disappointed after only 14 members were declared for his rival People\u2019s National Congress (PNC) party. \u2018Enough is enough\u2019: the fight to elect women to Papua New Guinea\u2019s men-only parliament Read more The new parliament sat for the first time on Tuesday, despite the counting of votes continuing in 11 seats, and Marape was voted in as prime minister \u2013 97 votes for and none against. O\u2019Neill left the chamber before voting took place. Speaking on Tuesday, Marape reassured Papua New Guinea that his party was \u201cnot for one region, not for one family, not for one person\u201d but \u201cbelongs to this country\u201d. \u201cToday, I want to give comfort to every Papua New Guinean wherever you are, as shown and reflected on the floor of parliament where 100% of members showed up to vote not just for me but for the mandate, collectively the coalition secured because we went to the elections as partners,\u201d he said. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese issued his congratulations, tweeting: \u201cCongratulations James Marape on your re-election as Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. The Australia-PNG partnership is special: we are neighbours, friends and family. Australia is committed to working with the PNG government to continue to deepen our comprehensive bilateral relationship and tackle shared regional challenges.\u201d O\u2019Neill said he had left the chamber in protest at the fact that parliament had sat and decided on a prime minister while counting was still under way in some seats. \u201cI did not vote for Marape simply because I cannot support a leader not properly elected by the people in their electorates,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cI cannot vote for what is wrong. I walked out and gave our party MPs the opportunity to vote on conscience.\u201d O\u2019Neill had filed an urgent application seeking orders to prevent the parliament from sitting this week, arguing that for parliament to be called there has to be a declaration of all 118 seats. The supreme court refused to issue the orders, ruling there was no urgency in the application. The election was plagued with violence, with 50 election-related deaths reported by the end of July . There were also reports of voter fraud, ballot boxes being destroyed and candidates taking over polling stations. Up to a million people were believed to have been disfranchised due to the electoral roll not being updated in a decade.

An initial earthquake of 7.6 magnitude struck the Markham Valley at 9:46am on Sunday, followed by a 5.0 magnitude earthquake 70 km (45 miles) north an hour later, Commissioner of Police David Manning said in a statement on Monday. read more Sign up here. The two earthquakes were reported at a depth of 90 km and 101 km underground, he said. Significant damage to buildings and roads and landslides were reported in Morobe, Eastern Highlands and Madang provinces, he said. \"Sadly, seven people have been confirmed dead as a result of these landslides. Three in Kabwum District and three in Wau Town, Morobe Province, and one in Rai Coast, Madang Province,\" he said. \"This was a significant earthquake, however it occurred deep below ground level and this meant damage was less than if the epicentre had been closer to the surface,\" he added. Aviation company Manolos Aviation organised medical evacuations from Kombul village in Kabwum district. \"Half of the mountain is gone,\" said Manolos Aviation public relations officer Erebiri Zurenuoc, who was at the scene in Kombul. A National Command Centre has been established by the government, and a COVID-19 hotline has been repurposed for the public to offer information on earthquake damage. The regional power grid, internet cables, roads and highways had been damaged, Manning said. In Eastern Highlands province, there was damage to the University of Goroka and reports of injuries to students, he said. Engineers are assessing damage to the Yonki Dam that has caused power outages. In Madang province, there were multiple injuries as buildings and houses were damaged, and one death was reported on the Rai Coast, he said. He warned of a significant risk of aftershocks.

File photo. Charles has become the new King on the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Photo: AFP But there are a number of practical - and traditional - steps which he must go through to be crowned King. What will he be called? He will be known as King Charles III. That was the first decision of the new king's reign. He could have chosen from any of his four names - Charles Philip Arthur George. He is not the only one who faces a change of title. Although he is heir to the throne, Prince William will not automatically become Prince of Wales. However, he immediately inherits his father's other title, Duke of Cornwall. His wife Catherine will be known as the Duchess of Cornwall. There will also be a new title for Charles' wife, whose full title will be Queen Consort - consort is the term used for the spouse of the monarch. Formal ceremonies In the first 24 hours or so after his mother's death, Charles will be officially proclaimed King. This happens at St James's Palace in London, in front of a ceremonial body known as the Accession Council. This is made up of members of the Privy Council - a group of senior MPs, past and present, and peers - as well as some senior civil servants, Commonwealth high commissioners, and the Lord Mayor of London. More than 700 people are entitled in theory to attend, but given the short notice, the actual number is likely to be far fewer. At the last Accession Council in 1952, about 200 attended. The King does not traditionally attend. At the meeting, the death of Queen Elizabeth will be announced by the Lord President of the Privy Council (currently Penny Mordaunt MP), and a proclamation will be read aloud. The wording of the proclamation can change, but it has traditionally been a series of prayers and pledges, commending the previous monarch and pledging support for the new one. This proclamation is then signed by a number of senior figures including the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord Chancellor. As with all these ceremonies, there will be attention paid to what might have been altered, added or updated, as a sign of a new era. The King's first declaration The Accession Council meets again - usually a day later - and this time, the King will attend, along with the Privy Council. There is no \"swearing in\" at the start of a British monarch's reign, in the style of some other heads of state, such as the President of the US. But there is a declaration made by the new King and - in line with a tradition dating from the early 18th Century - he will make an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland. After a fanfare of trumpeters, a public proclamation will be made declaring Charles as the new King. This will be made from a balcony above Friary Court in St James's Palace, by an official known as the Garter King of Arms. Queen Elizabeth II crowned her son Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 Photo: AFP He will call: \"God save the King\", and for the first time since 1952, when the national anthem is played the words will be \"God Save the King\". Gun salutes will be fired in Hyde Park, the Tower of London and from naval ships, and the proclamation announcing Charles as the King will be read in in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The coronation The symbolic high point of the accession will be the coronation, when Charles is formally crowned. Because of the preparation needed, the coronation is not likely to happen very soon after Charles's accession - Queen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne in February 1952, but was not crowned until June 1953. For the past 900 years the coronation has been held in Westminster Abbey - William the Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles will be the 40th. It is an Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the ceremony, he will place St Edward's Crown on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661. This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg). Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and ultimately decides the guest list. Royal Family on Balcony at Buckingham Palace, London, pictured after Coronation, 2nd June 1953.Image source, Mirrorpix \/ Getty Images There will be music, readings and the ritual of anointing the new monarch, using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. The new King will take the coronation oath in front of the watching world. During this elaborate ceremony he will receive the orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury will place the solid gold crown on his head. Head of the Commonwealth Charles has become head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries and 2.4 billion people. For 14 of these countries, as well as the UK, the King is head of state. These countries, known as the Commonwealth realms, are: Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu. - BBC Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright \u00a9 2022 , Radio New Zealand Subscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter View latest newsletter Next story in World Queen Elizabeth II has died, Buckingham Palace announces Related Stories As it happened: A nation and world mourn Queen Elizabeth II 9 Sep 2022 She led the United Kingdom and Commonwealth for 70 years.

Torsten Blackwood\/AFP More than 30 people have died in fighting between rival clans armed with crowbars, knives and rocks on the Papua New Guinean island of Kiriwina, a government official said in a radio interview. The violence in the Trobriand archipelago follows dozens of deaths across Papua New Guinea during the South Pacific country\u2019s national election in July, but it\u2019s unclear if rival political allegiances were behind the clashes this week on Kiriwina. \u201cSo far, more than 30 dead total,\u201d Nelson Tauyuwada, a provincial government official, said in an interview with Radio New Zealand on Wednesday. \u201cThey were using short crowbars, stones, wooden metal bush knives\u2026 anything that they could injure the opponents.\u201d Tauyuwada, who is in the Milne Bay provincial capital Alotau on Papua New Guinea\u2019s mainland, said he had received information about the clashes from the local government in the area where the fighting happened. \u201cI think at the moment the fighting has stopped. The two communities have gone into their respective grounds to sort themselves out first, maybe bury their dead,\u201d he said. Tauyuwada said there had been continuing tensions between people from Bwetalu and Kavataria, two of the administrative divisions in Kiriwina. Youths from Bwetalu had destroyed food gardens in Kavataria and there was an earlier clash in which one person died and another was hospitalized, which provoked a desire for revenge, he said. Post-Courier, one of Papua New Guinea\u2019s main newspapers, reported Tuesday that provincial police hoped to reach Kiriwina on Wednesday. It said the tensions on Kiriwina emerged following the general election when rival tribal groups clashed at a football match. Kiriwina island\u2019s population was about 37,000 in the 2011 census. Mountainous Papua New Guinea is one of the world\u2019s most ethnically and linguistically diverse nations, with more than 800 indigenous languages. A creole known as Tok Pisin has emerged as a common language for Papua New Guinea\u2019s nine million people. But stability for the country, which gained its independence from Australia in 1975, remains elusive as it grapples with tribal violence and challenges such as corruption and lack of roads and primary healthcare in many regions. In July, the United Nations\u2019 resident coordinator in Papua New Guinea, Dirk Wagener, condemned the reported deaths of dozens of people in the country\u2019s highlands during a chaotic two-week voting period for national elections. The U.N. said allegations of ballot tampering and ballot box theft, as well as poor organization, planning, and underlying clan rivalries, fueled instability during the election. The International Organization for Migration estimated more than 15,000 people had been uprooted and displaced by the election violence.

Share Papua New Guinea PM Tests Positive for COVID at Beijing Olympics share Print Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea \u2014 Papua New Guinea's prime minister has returned home from Beijing after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis upended plans for face-to-face meetings with Chinese leaders, the government said. James Marape was in China to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics but \"returned a positive test result upon arrival in Beijing last Thursday evening,\" the government said in a statement on Sunday. Marape had been expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping but instead held a \"virtual meeting\" with premier Li Keqiang. The Papua New Guinea leader's trip to France for this week's \"One Ocean Summit\" hosted by President Emmanuel Macron has been abandoned, officials said. Papua New Guinea has officially recorded 37,390 COVID-19 cases in a country of 9 million people. But testing and tracing are minimal, and the real number is believed to be in the millions. Under 4% of the population is vaccinated. Clinics around the country reported at least 2.6 million people -- more than a quarter of the population -- presented with flu or pneumonia-like symptoms between March 2020 and September 2021. Marape's visit to Beijing had been hailed as another deepening of ties, as China vies with the United States for influence in the South Pacific region. His condition is not known as he was ushered quickly through the airport on Sunday with close contacts prohibited. Marape is now in isolation.

Pakistani refugee drowns at waterfall on Manus Island Read more The Manus Island detention centre, in operation in its second iteration since 2012, has already been ruled \u201c illegal and unconstitutional \u201d by the PNG supreme court in April this year, in judgment of a separate legal challenge brought by the opposition leader, Belden Namah. Despite some superficial changes to the detention regime since the court\u2019s ruling, the 854 men held there remain in detention and are not free to leave of their own volition, or communicate freely with the outside world. The PNG court has ruled that Australia has effective control of the detention centre, though the Australian government contests this and has consistently said it is not a party to the court proceedings. A spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the Guardian on Wednesday, \u201cThe Australian government is aware of the matter but is not a party to the proceedings. Beyond this, it would not be appropriate to provide further comment as the matter remains before the court.\u201d Australian High Commission officials were in the Port Moresby courtroom on Tuesday. The supreme court challenge, brought by the Port Moresby lawyer Ben Lomai, represents more than 750 men held on Manus and argues their ongoing incarceration breaches PNG\u2019s constitutional guarantee of the right to liberty of all persons.

Key points: PNG PM says closure will not be \"rushed\" Dutton says no-one will be resettled in Australia Australia to provide extra resources to help with transition Immigration Minister Peter Dutton confirmed the future closure, after meeting with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill on Wednesday. Mr Dutton told the ABC no-one from the centre would be resettled in Australia. He said there was no timeline for closing the centre yet, but both countries would work towards it \"as quickly as possible\". \"It's important to work through these issues in a methodical way,\" he said. \"We're talking to third countries at the moment, to look at settlement options.\" The ABC understands Australia will give PNG extra resources to cope with the transition, but Mr Dutton would not be drawn on how much. He said the figure, when finalised, would be substantial. \"We haven't got a final figure on that,\" he said. \"This Labor legacy of the failed border protection policy, not only did it result in 1,200 people drowning at sea, but it resulted in billions of dollars being spent on this program. It will take years to clean up this mess.\" Mr Dutton said there will be savings \"in the long run\" for the Government. Mr O'Neill also issued a statement, confirming \"both Papua New Guinea and Australia are in agreement that the centre is to be closed\". \"A series of options are being advanced and implemented. \"It is important that this process is not rushed but carried out in a careful manner. \"This must take into account the interests of the people of Papua New Guinea and the wellbeing of asylum seekers and refugees.\" Fact check: Australia's responsibility Is Australia responsible for asylum seekers detained on Manus Island? ABC's FactCheck investigates Shadow immigration minister Shayne Neumann called for Mr Dutton to \"secure proper third-country settlement options for refugees\". \"It is time for the Turnbull Government to be upfront and honest about what their intentions are with regards to the current situation,\" the Queensland MP said. Mr O'Neill called for the closure of the centre in April, after PNG's Supreme Court ruled Australia's detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island was illegal . According to the latest immigration detention statistics issued by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in June, 854 men remain on Manus Island. 'We will play our role' Mr O'Neill has previously said PNG did not have the resources to resettle the men. Addressing the National Press Club in Canberra in March, he said questions surrounding the costs of resettling refugees remained . \"We have issues about the cost of the resettlement, who is going to pay for it,\" Mr O'Neill said. \"Certainly, the [PNG] Government does not have the resources to resettle the refugees as required, but we will play our role.\" Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the announcement was a sign \"offshore detention's time was over\". Senator Hanson-Young told the ABC the Government must now bring the men to Australia. \"The Turnbull Government must ensure that these people are given a chance to rebuild their lives in safety in Australia,\" she said. Neither country has issued a timeframe for the closure, prompting calls for urgent action from human rights organisations. Oxfam Australia's chief executive, Helen Szoke, said the agreement \"must be acted on urgently\". In a statement, Dr Szoke said the remaining men should be processed quickly and offered permanent resettlement in Australia \"if they are successful\". Human Rights Watch director Elaine Pearson also called for the men to be brought to Australia \"or a safe third country\".

Key points: Students say police fired shots when students refused to allow the president of the student council to be arrested Student Christopher Kipalan says police still chasing and shooting at students in city's suburbs Students were protesting against PM Peter O'Neill's handling of corruption allegations The injured, one of whom had a gunshot wound to the head, were among a crowd of students trying to march to the national Parliament to continue a long-running protest against Prime Minister Peter O'Neill . There are conflicting reports of the number of injured, with an opposition member reportedly telling the country's Parliament that four people were killed. The PNG Government said claims of deaths were false, adding that five students presented to Port Moresby General Hospital after the confrontation but all were in a stable condition. Rioting and looting have been reported in several parts of PNG since the unrest began, including in the PNG Highland cities of Goroka and Mt Hagen, and in Lae on the north coast. The trouble broke out when police stopped the students from marching on the Parliament and began shooting into the crowd, according to students at the scene. Witnesses said officers then began attacking protesters, punching and kicking them. Government advisers said it was not clear whether police had fired warning shots or fired directly into the crowd.

They're out here to shoot and kill.\" 'They almost shot me' Papua New Guinea university student Christopher Kipalan was being interviewed by the ABC's PNG correspondent Eric Tlozek when chaos broke out. Student leader Christopher Kipalan, the chairman of the UPNG Forum, said police were still chasing and shooting at protesting students in the suburbs of Port Moresby. \"Police are trying to shoot the civilians plus the students,\" he said. \"So many casualties.

The Federal Government has confirmed all of the Australian Federal Police officers deployed in PNG have been accounted for. A man who was reportedly shot is carried in Port Moresby. ( Twitter: Martyn Namorong ) The students have been protesting for five weeks against Prime Minister Peter O'Neill's handling of corruption allegations and management of the economy. They said about 1,000 of them had tried to board buses at 7:00am to hold a peaceful demonstration outside the PNG Parliament, but were stopped by police. Eric Tlozek in Port Moresby: Students said they were gathering to take buses from the university campus where they have been protesting for five weeks to the national Parliament which, is sitting in Port Moresby today. They said police stopped them from gathering and taking the buses so they decided to walk instead and it was then that they had a confrontation with the armed police officers. They said a large number of police blocked the road in a line and demanded they hand over the student union president to be arrested. It was when the students refused to do that that tensions escalated. The students say they were unarmed and had their hands in the air but there was an argument between the leaders of the students and police and they said police then fired directly into the crowd. I'm told they fired tear gas but there are also witnesses who say they fired live ammunition and that a number of students were shot and I have seen photos of students reportedly shot. It was then that police moved in amongst the crowd, apparently physically beating, punching and kicking students and also some members of the media who were there to cover the student protest. When they tried to march to Parliament instead, they said a line of police blocked their path and demanded they hand over the student union president for arrest. The students refused and said police then opened fire directly into the crowd. The acting chancellor of UPNG, Dr Nicholas Mann, told Pacific Beat he did not know the full details of what happened. \"I understand that police have not given them the clearance or approval to do [march on Parliament], so when there is defiance of lawful instruction there is bound to be consequences,\" he said. But Ms Yalo said the march had been approved by authorities. \"It was kind of confusing because the previous day they said it was OK,\" she said. Albert Schram, the vice-chancellor of PNG University of Technology in the country's second largest city, Lae, said about 2,000 students and staff had been locked on campus with a police car at the gates. He told Pacific Beat the police fired in the air when students pushed on the gates, but added the situation remained calm. Loading... Prime Minister announces inquiry, condemns 'agitators' In a statement, Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said his government will undertake an inquiry into the \"underlying reasons\" for student unrest. The government has maintained the protests are being funded from outside the university's student body, and has singled out the country's opposition for criticism. \"The people behind these protests have political agendas. Members of the Opposition have been engaging with students ... The blood of the injured students is on the hands of those members and their supporters,\" Mr O'Neill's statement said. Meanwhile PNG's police minister Robert Atiyafa said any damage to property in response to the incident will lead to charges being laid. \"Any student who has broken the law will feel the full force of the law. Their actions are very foolish and I think there are several students who will have thrown their education down the drain through their actions today,\" Mr Atiyafa said in a statement. The statement said the situation in Port Moresby has now calmed, and \"people are going about their normal business.\" Loading ABC\/Reuters More stories: PNG university allows classes to resume Court delays removal of protesting students from campus Student protests in PNG's second city to continue Prime Minister tells protesting students he will not resign Students give PM 24 hours to respond to corruption petition Police patrol University of PNG campuses to maintain peace Students protest against interference in corruption cases Posted Wed 8 Jun 2016 at 12:26am Wednesday 8 Jun 2016 at 12:26am Wed 8 Jun 2016 at 12:26am , updated Fri 10 Jun 2016 at 8:16am Friday 10 Jun 2016 at 8:16am Fri 10 Jun 2016 at 8:16am Share options Copy link Facebook X\u00a0(formerly\u00a0Twitter) Top Stories Littleproud claims credit for Coalition's nuclear policy LIVE Photo shows David Littleproud speaks.
