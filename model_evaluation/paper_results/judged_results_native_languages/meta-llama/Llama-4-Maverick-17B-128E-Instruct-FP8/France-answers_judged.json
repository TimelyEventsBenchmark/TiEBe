Burkina Faso, which is currently battling an Islamist insurgency, says it wants to defend itself. There are currently 400 French special forces in Burkina Faso, who have just one month to leave. On Thursday, France said it would also recall its ambassador to the country for consultations. Burkina Faso's junta had demanded the ambassador's replacement over his comments about the country's deteriorating security situation. Last year French troops also left neighbouring Mali, where they had spent eight years fighting jihadists. France has kept close military links with many of its former colonies in West Africa and has been helping several of them fight jihadists who are active across the region under the now terminated Operation Barkhane. Some 3,000 French soldiers are still deployed in West Africa, mostly in Niger and Chad. Its continued ties, especially economic, have led to some resentment of its influence, which Russia has tapped into. Both Mali and the Central African Republic are now working with the Russian mercenary group, Wagner. Burkina Faso has denied reports it will also engage the Wagner Group against the jihadists but a liaison team from the mercenaries has already visited, according to the AFP news agency. A French foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed that the Burkinab\u00e8 government had sent a written request for its troops to leave. \"We will respect the terms of the agreement by honouring this request,\" the spokesperson said. Burkina Faso has been hit by a decade-long insurgency that has forced nearly two million people from their homes. Most recently, suspected jihadists kidnapped around 60 women who were foraging for food in the north of the country, and at the start of the month bodies of 28 people who had been shot dead were found in the north-western town of Nouna. The women have since been released. Since Capt Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 seized power in Burkina Faso in September, there has been widespread speculation that he might start working with Russian mercenaries, which neighbouring Ghana described as \"distressing\". Capt Traor\u00e9 has promised to win back territory from the jihadists, and to hold democratic elections in July 2024.

Quel que soit le d\u00e9compte retenu, la participation est en nette hausse dans la capitale . Selon la CGT, la quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e de mobilisation nationale contre la r\u00e9forme des retraites a r\u00e9uni quelque 500\u00a0000\u00a0personnes \u00e0 Paris. La Pr\u00e9fecture de police de Paris a fait \u00e9tat, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, de 93\u00a0000\u00a0manifestants samedi, contre 57\u00a0000\u00a0mardi. Le cabinet Occurrence, enfin, en a d\u00e9nombr\u00e9 112\u00a0000. Face \u00e0 l\u2019affluence, un itin\u00e9raire bis a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert une heure apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part du cort\u00e8ge de la place de la R\u00e9publique. Des incidents, dont plusieurs feux qui ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l\u2019intervention des pompiers , ont \u00e9maill\u00e9 la manifestation dans la capitale. Deux incendies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 allum\u00e9s sur le boulevard Voltaire. Plusieurs rang\u00e9es de CRS faisaient face \u00e0 des dizaines de jeunes, tout de noir v\u00eatus et le visage recouvert d\u2019un foulard. A 16\u00a0h\u00a030, la Pr\u00e9fecture de police avait fait \u00e9tat de huit interpellations. Plusieurs manifestations en r\u00e9gion samedi rassemblaient un peu plus de monde que celles de mardi, mais moins que celles des deux premi\u00e8res journ\u00e9es de mobilisation, selon les premiers chiffres des autorit\u00e9s. Le sursaut est surtout visible dans les villes moyennes, comme \u00e0 Roanne, o\u00f9 la police a compt\u00e9 6\u00a0000 manifestants, contre 3\u00a0000 mardi. Un rebond li\u00e9 entre autres \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un public plus familial, avec davantage de parents accompagn\u00e9s de leurs enfants dans les cort\u00e8ges. Dans certaines villes, les \u00e9carts entre les chiffres des autorit\u00e9s et des syndicats se creusent . A Toulouse, la pr\u00e9fecture a d\u00e9nombr\u00e9 25\u00a0000 manifestants mais la CGT en a compt\u00e9 100\u00a0000, soit un \u00e9cart d\u2019un \u00e0 quatre, plus marqu\u00e9 que lors des journ\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. A Tarbes, la police a annonc\u00e9 4\u00a0600 manifestants, tandis que les organisateurs en ont compt\u00e9 10\u00a0000. A Saint-Etienne, les chiffres variaient m\u00eame d\u2019un \u00e0 six (entre 5\u00a0300 \u00e0 30\u00a0000), comme \u00e0 Clermont-Ferrand (entre 8\u00a0000\u00a0et 50\u00a0000).

Une \u00e9vidence pour lui, r\u00e9sum\u00e9e par la banderole qui le pr\u00e9c\u00e8de dans sa marche vers la place de la Nation, \u00e0 Paris\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Alliance \u00e9cologique et sociale\u00a0\u00bb, le nom qui a remplac\u00e9 celui de \u00ab\u00a0Plus jamais \u00e7a\u00a0\u00bb, cr\u00e9\u00e9e en\u00a02020 par huit associations et syndicats. Le responsable associatif explique\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0C\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que Greenpeace rejoint des manifestations pour les retraites, m\u00eame si nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des cort\u00e8ges sociaux comme le 1 er -Mai. Il y a un impact direct du travail sur les \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre. On ne peut que combattre ce projet qui vise \u00e0 faire travailler plus longtemps, \u00e0 produire plus de biens, plus de consommation, plus de d\u00e9chets, plus d\u2019\u00e9missions et plus de pression sur les ressources naturelles de la plan\u00e8te.\u00a0\u00bb Pour lui, la pr\u00e9sence des militants de son organisation, aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s d\u2019autres associations comme Les Amis de la Terre, Oxfam ou Alternatiba au sein du cort\u00e8ge n\u2019est pas qu\u2019une simple d\u00e9monstration de solidarit\u00e9 pour ses partenaires syndicaux. \u00ab\u00a0Si on y va, il faut dire pourquoi. Et c\u2019est pour apporter un \u00e9clairage diff\u00e9rent sur les cons\u00e9quences de cette r\u00e9forme , ajoute Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Julliard. Un \u00e9l\u00e9ment est rarement abord\u00e9\u00a0: cette r\u00e9forme ne prend pas en compte les effets du r\u00e9chauffement climatique. Avec des temp\u00e9ratures plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es, les m\u00eames m\u00e9tiers vont \u00eatre de plus en plus p\u00e9nibles et difficiles \u00e0 faire si l\u2019on est plus \u00e2g\u00e9.\u00a0\u00bb Les militants qui ont march\u00e9 pour le climat et l\u2019\u00e9cologie font le lien entre leurs causes et les injustices sociales. \u00ab\u00a0Pas de justice climatique sans justice sociale\u00a0\u00bb , r\u00e9p\u00e8tent-ils. Sur une grande pancarte, \u00e0 l\u2019encre verte, l\u2019un d\u2019entre eux questionne\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Peut-on respirer avant d\u2019expirer\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb C\u00e9cile Duflot, la directrice d\u2019Oxfam, a march\u00e9 lors des quatre manifestations contre une r\u00e9forme \u00ab\u00a0profond\u00e9ment in\u00e9galitaire\u00a0\u00bb . \u00ab\u00a0Le gouvernement ne combat pas les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s pour la m\u00eame raison qu\u2019il ne lutte pas r\u00e9ellement contre le changement climatique, en laissant se d\u00e9velopper et dominer la rente, les int\u00e9r\u00eats financiers et \u00e9conomiques \u00e0 court terme\u00a0\u00bb , avance l\u2019ancienne ministre du logement (2012-2014). L\u2019ex-dirigeante des \u00e9cologistes se dit impressionn\u00e9e par le caract\u00e8re massif et pacifique des r\u00e9centes mobilisations \u2013 \u00ab\u00a0un adulte sur vingt dans la rue\u00a0\u00bb . Et en veut au gouvernement\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Il a z\u00e9ro courage quand il faut prendre des mesures sur la transition \u00e9cologique, il ne veut rien imposer, mais il se montre autoritaire sur sa r\u00e9forme des retraites.\u00a0\u00bb Les m\u00eames arguments sont d\u00e9clin\u00e9s d\u2019une association \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Vincent Drezet, l\u2019un des porte-parole d\u2019Attac, d\u00e9nonce \u00ab\u00a0une r\u00e9partition des richesses en faveur des superprofits qui pourraient servir \u00e0 aider au financement des retraites\u00a0\u00bb , quand la jeune Lucie Chhieng, 23\u00a0ans, d\u2019Alternatiba Paris, critique \u00ab\u00a0un gouvernement qui dit qu\u2019il y a urgence \u00e0 r\u00e9former les retraites, ce que ne dit m\u00eame pas le COR [Conseil d\u2019orientation des retraites]. Mais quand le GIEC [Groupe d\u2019experts intergouvernemental sur l\u2019\u00e9volution du climat] alerte sur l\u2019urgence d\u2019agir, le gouvernement ne fait rien\u00a0\u00bb. En faisant travailler plus longtemps, la r\u00e9forme du gouvernement aurait aussi des effets indirects. \u00ab\u00a0Cette r\u00e9forme priverait aussi les associations d\u2019un grand nombre de retrait\u00e9s, oblig\u00e9s de travailler plus longtemps. Or, ils ont un r\u00f4le important dans la vie associative\u00a0\u00bb , argumente Khaled Gaiji, pr\u00e9sident des Amis de la Terre. Sur le trottoir, des activistes de Derni\u00e8re R\u00e9novation distribuent des flyers pr\u00e9sentant leurs actions. Kik\u00e9, 31\u00a0ans, commercial dans une entreprise solidaire et sociale, r\u00e9sume son engagement\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Quand tu luttes pour la r\u00e9novation \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique des b\u00e2timents, tu sais que les premi\u00e8res victimes des passoires thermiques et des grands froids sont les plus d\u00e9munis.\u00a0\u00bb R\u00e9mi Barroux Le 11\/02 \u00e0 18:30 L\u2019essentiel Partager Twitter Facebook Copier le lien Le point sur la mobilisation \u00e0 18\u00a0h\u00a030 Quelque 963\u00a0000\u00a0personnes ont d\u00e9fil\u00e9 samedi en France contre la r\u00e9forme des retraites , selon le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. Ce chiffre global est en hausse par rapport \u00e0 mardi\u00a0: les autorit\u00e9s avaient recens\u00e9 757\u00a0000 manifestants au niveau national. \u00ab\u00a0Plus de 2,5\u00a0millions\u00a0\u00bb de personnes ont manifest\u00e9 en France, selon la CGT, qui avait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de 2\u00a0millions de participants le 7\u00a0f\u00e9vrier, 2,8\u00a0millions le 31\u00a0janvier et plus de 2\u00a0millions le 19\u00a0janvier. Quel que soit le d\u00e9compte retenu, la participation est en nette hausse dans la capitale . Selon la CGT, la quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e de mobilisation nationale contre la r\u00e9forme des retraites a r\u00e9uni quelque 500\u00a0000\u00a0personnes \u00e0 Paris. La Pr\u00e9fecture de police de Paris a fait \u00e9tat, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, de 93\u00a0000\u00a0manifestants samedi, contre 57\u00a0000\u00a0mardi. Le cabinet Occurrence, enfin, en a d\u00e9nombr\u00e9 112\u00a0000. Face \u00e0 l\u2019affluence, un itin\u00e9raire bis a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert une heure apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part du cort\u00e8ge de la place de la R\u00e9publique. Des incidents, dont plusieurs feux qui ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l\u2019intervention des pompiers , ont \u00e9maill\u00e9 la manifestation dans la capitale. Deux incendies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 allum\u00e9s sur le boulevard Voltaire. Plusieurs rang\u00e9es de CRS faisaient face \u00e0 des dizaines de jeunes, tout de noir v\u00eatus et le visage recouvert d\u2019un foulard. A 16\u00a0h\u00a030, la Pr\u00e9fecture de police avait fait \u00e9tat de huit interpellations. Plusieurs manifestations en r\u00e9gion samedi rassemblaient un peu plus de monde que celles de mardi, mais moins que celles des deux premi\u00e8res journ\u00e9es de mobilisation, selon les premiers chiffres des autorit\u00e9s. Le sursaut est surtout visible dans les villes moyennes, comme \u00e0 Roanne, o\u00f9 la police a compt\u00e9 6\u00a0000 manifestants, contre 3\u00a0000 mardi. Un rebond li\u00e9 entre autres \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un public plus familial, avec davantage de parents accompagn\u00e9s de leurs enfants dans les cort\u00e8ges. Dans certaines villes, les \u00e9carts entre les chiffres des autorit\u00e9s et des syndicats se creusent . A Toulouse, la pr\u00e9fecture a d\u00e9nombr\u00e9 25\u00a0000 manifestants mais la CGT en a compt\u00e9 100\u00a0000, soit un \u00e9cart d\u2019un \u00e0 quatre, plus marqu\u00e9 que lors des journ\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. A Tarbes, la police a annonc\u00e9 4\u00a0600 manifestants, tandis que les organisateurs en ont compt\u00e9 10\u00a0000. A Saint-Etienne, les chiffres variaient m\u00eame d\u2019un \u00e0 six (entre 5\u00a0300 \u00e0 30\u00a0000), comme \u00e0 Clermont-Ferrand (entre 8\u00a0000\u00a0et 50\u00a0000).

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said a man was stopped by two off-duty police officers who were returning home from a shift. He said the suspected attacker was shot three times and taken to hospital with serious injuries. Authorities are trying to establish if there was a motive for the attack. The attack took place at 06:42 (05:42 GMT) - within one minute all six people were injured and the attacker was stopped. Mr Darmanin thanked for police for their \"brave and effective\" intervention, which he said saved many lives. He added that among the injured was one French border police officer. Police are yet to name the man, who did not have identity documents on him at the time he was taken to hospital. Mr Darmanin told reporters the man attacked people in the station with what looked like a home-made weapon. Police earlier said the man used a knife or blade. Criminal investigators have taken control of the case for now, rather than anti-terror police, Mr Darmanin said. The incident caused major delays to trains at the station in the early morning rush, with police cordoning off the station and setting up large white curtains around the attack scene. Paris Gare du Nord is one of the busiest international railway stations in Europe - with about 700,000 travellers a day.

Accept Manage my choices Protestors hold unions' flags and signs during a demonstration on the fifth day of nationwide rallies organised since the start of the year, against a deeply unpopular pensions overhaul, in Paris, on February 16, 2023. \u00a9 Emmanuel Dunand, AFP The fifth day of action against President Emmanuel Macron 's reform -- whose headline measure is raising the legal retirement age from 62 to 64 -- aims to keep up the pressure ahead of a wider mass walkout, planned for March 7. But unlike previous strike days, most mainline trains and the Paris metro were running normally, as fewer workers participated during school holidays across most of France . That was reflected in education ministry figures showing fewer than eight percent of teachers on strike, half last week's level. Employees at state-controlled energy giant EDF said they had lowered output by more than 3,000 megawatts, or the equivalent of three nuclear power plants, without affecting supply to end users. On Wednesday, many hydroelectric plants had been disconnected from the grid. On Thursday, 30 percent of flights from Paris's Orly airport were cancelled. Demonstrators turned out across France carrying signs including \"retirement before arthritis\" or \"why not 69 years, if you're going to screw us?\" Unions said some 1.3 million people participated nationwide Thursday, the lowest figure since the protest movement started on January 19. The interior ministry put the national figure at 440,000, down from nearly a million on Saturday. Thursday's actions were meant to \"keep up the mobilisation\" against the reform but \"for today, the numbers aren't so important\", said Philippe Martinez, head of the hard-left CGT union, at a demonstration in Albi in southwestern France. \"After the school holidays, we'll need to turn up the volume,\" he said. 'Block everything' Polling shows around 70 percent of the public reject Macron's pension reform plans. A petition opposing the reforms has gathered more than one million signatures. Left-wing opponents have submitted thousands of amendments to the bill to delay procedures in parliament, which is currently debating the draft law. It is unclear whether the lower house will discuss its Article 7, which lays out the change to the retirement age, before running out of time on Friday. The unions have written directly to lawmakers asking them to throw out the whole bill and especially Article 7. Members of parliament have already rejected one article designed to press companies to employ more older workers. There is \"a possible majority in the chamber to vote against\" the retirement age provision, Socialist member of parliament Philippe Brun said. Aurore Berge, the parliamentary leader of Macron's centrist Renaissance party, said the left was \"afraid of having a vote\", adding she was sure the government would get the support it needed. Macron himself also sought to project confidence on Wednesday, telling a cabinet meeting that opposition parties had \"totally lost their way\" over the pensions fight. But the biggest day of action may still be to come, with unions promising to bring France to a halt on March 7. \"We're going to block everything on March 7. Everything everywhere must stop,\" Jean-Luc Melenchon , former presidential candidate for the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, said at a march in the southern city of Montpellier. Unions are debating whether to shift to rolling strikes after that date, with Paris metro workers and rubbish collectors already in favour.

Media caption, Watch: Bordeaux town hall in flames By Andre Rhoden-Paul in London & Hugh Schofield in Paris BBC News Bordeaux town hall has been set on fire as French protests continued over plans to raise the pension age. More than a million people took to the streets across France on Thursday, with 119,000 in Paris, according to figures from the interior ministry. Police fired tear gas at protesters in the capital and 80 people were arrested across the country. The demonstrations were sparked by legislation raising the retirement age by two years to 64. Unions have called for further protests next Tuesday, which would coincide with King Charles III's state visit to the country. He is scheduled to be in the southwest city of Bordeaux on that day, where fire engulfed the front door of the town hall on Thursday evening after a day of protests and clashes. It was not clear who was responsible for the blaze, which was quickly put out by firefighters. Interior Minister G\u00c3\u00a9rald Darmanin sought to quell any concerns ahead of the King's trip, saying on Thursday night that security \"poses no problem\" and the monarch will be \"welcomed and welcomed well\", according to AP. , external Macron defiant as French pension protests escalate France's government survives no-confidence vote In Paris, generally peaceful demonstrations saw occasional clashes between police and masked rioters who smashed shop windows, demolished street furniture and attacked a McDonald's restaurant, according to Reuters news agency. One police officer who lost consciousness was dragged to safety. AP news agency reported that police forces used tear gas and were pelted by objects and fireworks, with 33 people arrested in the capital. France's Prime Minister, \u00c3\u0089lisabeth Borne, tweeted , external : \"Demonstrating and voicing disagreements is a right. The violence and degradation we have witnessed today is unacceptable. All my gratitude to the police and rescue forces mobilized.\" Image source, Reuters Image caption, Firefighters on strike could be seen on the roof of one building in Paris during Thursday's protests \"I oppose this reform and I really oppose the fact that democracy no longer means anything,\" a demonstrator told Reuters. \"We're not being represented, and so we're fed up.\" \"It is by protesting that we will be able to make ourselves heard because all the other ways... have not allowed us to withdraw this reform,\" another told AFP news agency. The unrest also disrupted train travel, oil refineries and saw teachers and workers at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport walk out of work. Popular tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles, where a dinner is planned for King Charles and the French president next week, were also closed on Thursday. In the northern city of Rouen a young woman was seen lying on the ground after sustaining a serious injury to her hand. Witnesses said she lost her thumb after she was hit by a so-called \"flash-ball\" grenade fired by police to disperse demonstrators. There were other clashes in the western cities of Nantes, Rennes and Lorient. \"The street has a legitimacy in France,\" said a protester in Nantes. \"If Mr Macron can't remember this historic reality, I don't know what he is doing here\". Unions and the political left have deemed the day a success, but where the situation goes from here is an open question. The government is hoping that the protests will lose momentum, and that the violence on the streets will turn people away. The opposition says that the protests will not dwindle, but unions will need to devise a strategy going forward, rather than promising more days like Thursday.

Parisian rubbish collectors, who started their strike against the pension reform on 6 March, have renewed it until next Monday. The unrest followed the government's decision to force the legislation to raise the pension age through the lower house of parliament - where it lacks an absolute majority - without a vote. French President Emmanuel Macron defended the move, saying the reform is a necessity.

Officials said two others remained unaccounted for and rescue efforts continued in the La Plaine district. A firefighter told AFP news agency the search for survivors was a \"race against the clock\". The cause remains unclear, but investigators are looking into the possibility of a gas leak. The blast occurred at 00:49 local time on Sunday (22:49 GMT on Saturday). Housing Minister Oliver Klein described the discovery of the bodies as \"gruesome, difficult and dramatic\", and told reporters the government would support the families of the victims. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the explosion and around 200 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Two nearby blocks partially collapsed a few hours later, but there were no further reports of injuries from this. The mayor of Marseille, Benoit Payan, warned there was still a risk that nearby buildings could collapse. Around 100 firefighters attended the scene to tackle a blaze that burned under the rubble throughout Sunday. The fire hampered progress and made it difficult for sniffer dogs to detect survivors or bodies. The building is believed to have had one apartment on each storey. In a brief statement announcing the discovery of the bodies, the fire department said that \"given the difficulties of intervention, the extraction [of the bodies from the site] will take time\". A local gymnasium and two schools have been opened to accommodate the people who have had to leave their homes. Psychological support is also being offered. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter that he was \"thinking of those affected and their loved ones\" and thanked the emergency workers for their efforts. Mayor of Marseille Beno\u00eet Payan said rescuers remained \"determined\" to find people alive. \"Hope must hold us,\" he said. 'Unlike anything I've ever heard' One local told French media that they heard an explosion \"unlike anything I've ever heard\". Speaking to AFP, Saveria Mosnier, who lives nearby, said on Sunday: \"I was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming.\" She added: \"We very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\" Deputy Mayor Yannick Ohanessian told reporters at the scene that \"several\" witnesses had described a \"suspicious smell of gas\". Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin visited the scene on Sunday, followed by Housing Minister Olivier Klein on Monday. In 2018, housing standards in Marseille came under scrutiny after two dilapidated buildings in the working class district of Noailles collapsed, killing eight people. Following that incident, charities estimated that 40,000 people in the city were living in poorly-built homes, but on Sunday officials appeared to rule out structural issues as a cause of the latest collapse. Christophe Mirmand, a local authority leader in the Bouches-du-Rhone region, said there was no danger notice on the building and that it was not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing. The comments were echoed by Mr Payan. Additional reporting by Antoinette Radford and Alys Davies.

The disaster happened at the Armancette glacier, near Mont Blanc in south-eastern France, at about midday local time. It was a sunny day and skiing conditions had been described as \"good\" before the avalanche struck. Another injured person was taken to hospital, while eight others swept up were unharmed. Among the victims was a couple in their 20s, a 39-year-old woman and a man in his early 40s who was \"probably\" her partner and two guides, local prosecutor Karline Bouisset said. The avalanche was caused by a slab of snow detaching from the top of the mountain, according to Jean-Luc Mattel, an official of the nearby Contamines-Montjoie village. Mountain rescue teams were joined by search and rescue dogs as they worked on Sunday and Monday morning to reach those who were caught. Mr Mattel said the risk level on Sunday morning was \"reasonable\" and the guides, both of them locals, were highly experienced. The group are all thought to have been back-country skiing - when skiers go on unmarked or unpatrolled areas. \"Today, we are mourning, and there is great sadness among all of us mountaineers, friends of Les Contamines, those who died are people we knew, and all our thoughts go out to their families,\" he said. The mayor of Contamines-Montjoie, Francois Barbier, told the AFP news agency he thought it was the \"most deadly avalanche this season\". France's interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, and French President Emmanuel Macron also expressed their sympathy. Before the incident, a nearby ski resort called Les Contamines-Montjoie posted a video on social media showing a huge wall of snow moving down from the D\u00f4mes de Miage, of which the glacier is a part. It is not clear if the video shows the avalanche in which the people died. Watch: Snow and ice cascade down from D\u00f4mes de Miage in the French Alps One eyewitness told France Television that she was hiking just in front of the Armancette glacier when she saw the avalanche happening and took out her phone to film it. \"I had put the phone in front of me, but then I was looking with my eyes more than in the lens and suddenly there was a huge, huge, huge cloud that came down to the bottom, it split into two,\" she said. \"I think of the families, I think of the people, of those who got out of it, who had the fright of their life, of those who are still there.\" The nearby resort urged people to be careful if they were venturing off-piste - away from the prepared ski runs. Officials have told AFP that a further avalanche could not be ruled out. Two brothers died in an avalanche on the same glacier in 2014. They were both experienced mountaineers and had been properly equipped.

Tuesday marked the sixth day of strikes and protests since mid-January and trade unions said it would be the biggest yet. Most train and metro services were cancelled and many schools closed. Police estimated between 1.1 million and 1.4 million would taking part in the 260 protests highlighted by unions. The hardline CGT said as many as 700,000 demonstrators had turned out in Paris alone, although police figures were likely to be far lower. With the government showing no sign of backing down on its pension plan, one union leader, Emmanuel L\u00e9pine, said last week that the aim of blocking fuel deliveries was to \"bring the French economy to its knees\". It was unclear how long the refinery blockades would last. There are eight refineries in mainland France and the CGT said strikers had blocked the exits to all of them, including those run by TotalEnergies and Esso-ExxonMobil. AFP Refineries around Le Havre in the north were among those blocked, French trade unions said In the days ahead, there will be calls to extend the strikes to include power generation too. So far, for all the noise and sporadic disruption, the campaign has caused little damage to the economy and the bill is proceeding through parliament. Unions and the Left know time is running out before the reform becomes a reality - which is all the more reason for them to up the pressure now. French plan to raise pension age by two years to 64 One million join French retirement age protests French protests intensify against pension age rise President Emmanuel Macron has called the reform \"essential\" because of deficits forecast for France's pension system over the next 25 years, according to analysis by the independent Pensions Advisory Council. As well as raising the pension age by two years, the government says workers would have to contribute for 43 years into France's shared pension fund before earning a full pension. Very few French workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments. Neighbouring European economies have already raised the retirement age in recent years to reflect longer life expectancy. Italy, Germany and Spain have moved towards raising the official retirement age to 67, while in the UK it is currently 66. The majority of French citizens back the continuing strikes, a poll by French survey group Elabe suggests. According to the opinion poll, 56% of people support rolling strikes and 59% back the call to bring the country to a standstill. Two-thirds of people support the protest movement against the government's planned pension reforms in general, the poll indicates. However, the number of protesters taking to the streets began to fall last month and union leaders now believe rolling strikes are their best hope of success. \"If the refineries are blocked, we could run out of petrol by the end of the week,\" warned Thierry Cotillard, head of French supermarket group Les Mousquetaires. Government spokesman Olivier V\u00e9ran told France 2: \"We don't want French people to be, quote, unquote, 'victims' of a long-term blockade.\" Last week, he warned that the strikes could lead to an \"ecological, agricultural and health catastrophe\".

The portrait issue has been seized upon by Macron\u2019s critics as he travels around France in an attempt to counter accusations of arrogance and haughtiness, amid saucepan banging and street protests against the rise in the pension age. France\u2019s lower house of parliament passed proposals on Thursday that would require town halls in municipalities with more than 1,500 inhabitants to fly both the French and European flags, as most already do. But, as part of a series of amendments to the bill, two centrist lawmakers from Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, Denis Mass\u00e9glia and Nicole Dubr\u00e9-Chirat, succeeded in adding a provision that all town halls must by law display a presidential portrait. The amendment referred to portraits of any serving presidents, not specifically Macron, who was re-elected to a second term last year. The proposal will have to be debated in the senate before returning to the lower house. Town halls across France currently display portraits of serving presidents, but it is a tradition not a legal obligation. Mass\u00e9glia, a lawmaker in Maine-et-Loire, told parliament: \u201cTown halls are like the house of the French people. So the portrait of the president \u2013 whoever it is \u2013 should be displayed there, out of respect for the democratic vote.\u201d View image in fullscreen French climate activists hold inverted portraits of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in 2019. Photograph: Thomas Samson\/AFP\/Getty Images The left immediately seized on the proposed amendment to attack Macron\u2019s party. Antoine L\u00e9aument from the radical left party, La France Insoumise, accused Macron\u2019s centrists of \u201ca cult of the leader\u201d and called on mayors to take down Macron\u2019s picture as a protest both against the portrait proposal and Macron\u2019s new law raising the minimum eligible pension age from 62 to 64 . Another MP on the radical left, Raquel Garrido, accused Macron\u2019s party of wanting to push things through \u201cby force\u201d. In 2019, a civil disobedience movement by climate protesters resulted in more than 100 framed portraits of Macron being taken down from town halls across the country to highlight what demonstrators described as France\u2019s inaction on the climate emergency. It led to a police crackdown and several court cases for \u201cgroup theft\u201d of the portraits.

The children, aged between one and three, are being treated in hospital. Police overpowered and arrested the knifeman after he entered a children's playground to carry out the attack. A three-year-old British child is among the injured, another is Dutch. Two adults were also hurt, with one in a critical condition. Follow live coverage Police have confirmed that the suspect is a 31-year-old Syrian, who had refugee status in Sweden. This story contains details some readers may find distressing. Regional deputy Antoine Armand described the attack as \"abominable\" and said authorities were investigating, but knew \"very little\". Video footage of the attack uploaded to social media - too graphic for broadcast - shows a little playground, with life going on as normal. Children are running around, and their parents and minders are there. Then a man comes in with a knife, and very quickly there are screams. He's clearly looking for children to attack - and he attacks one in a pushchair. French Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne and Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin went to the scene of the attack. Ms Borne told a news conference that the attacker has \"no criminal or psychiatric record\". Annecy prosecutor Line Bonnet-Mathis told reporters that the young victims ranged from 22 months old to three years. There \"doesn't seem to be any kind of terrorist motivation\", she said. Police say the suspect has refugee status in Sweden and recently came to France, leaving behind a wife and three-year-old daughter. In an unsuccessful asylum application last year for refugee status in France, he said he was a Syrian Christian. During the incident, the attacker invoked the name of Jesus Christ. A woman identified as his ex-wife told BFM TV that her former partner was a Christian. \"He does not call me for four months. [Our relationship] stopped because we lived in Sweden and he did not want to live in Sweden anymore,\" she said, adding that he had not previously shown a violent streak. In recent years, France has become accustomed to knife attacks, often carried out by solitary young men with backgrounds in petty crime and some Islamist connection. It is clear that this attack is of a different nature. So far, most politicians are being careful not to leap to conclusions, but it is inevitable that the attack will feed into the debate on immigration. Tributes come in as questions grow In Annecy tonight, the darkening sky throws shadows across tributes of white roses laid out on the playground wall. A children's drawing, covered with hearts, flutters in the wind. A note, addressed to the four children who were stabbed here, reads: \"horror passes; love remains\". And as the flowers began appearing here this afternoon, the children began returning too. By early evening, the playground was once again full of their excitement, the rows of television cameras lined up nearby ignored. But those who witnessed the attack here, and the dramatic intervention of emergency services, told us they were still shaken and tearful. This attack on toddlers in a popular tourist spot has shaken France: the horror felt well beyond this town - the motive still a mystery. As here in Annecy, the tributes and the questions grow. Reuters White roses are seen at the children's playground The suspect is said to have attacked the children - some in pushchairs - as they visited the park, before fleeing the scene and stabbing an elderly man nearby. Police intervened and the perpetrator was shot in the legs. France's National Assembly has observed a minute of silence and roads are blocked around the scene of the attack. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the nation was in \"shock\" over the \"act of cowardice\". UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is on a trip to the US, said: \"All our thoughts are with those affected by this unfathomable attack, including a British child - and with their families. \"I've been in touch with President Macron, and we stand ready to offer any assistance that we can.\" A witness, Eleanor Vincent, told the BBC she \"knew something horrible had happened\" as she approached the lake. \"People were going about their business or on their holiday, as I was, and it's just shocking. I have no other way of describing it.\" Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident? You can share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk .

Firefighters were called to a building in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, on June 21, 2023. Abdulmonam Eassa\/AFP\/Getty Images Paris CNN \u2014 Six people remain in a critical condition and one person is missing after a gas explosion in central Paris on Wednesday, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN on Thursday. Some 50 people were injured in the incident, although the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office, which is investigating the blast, said the number may not be final. Some 270 firefighters were deployed to the scene near Rue Saint Jacques in the city\u2019s fifth arrondissement, and have contained the fire, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told reporters. Francois Braun, France\u2019s health minister, told CNN affiliate BFMTV Thursday that some of those injured are suffering from \u201cextremely significant burns,\u201d while others have suffered \u201csignificant traumatic injuries\u201d due to the blast. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin visited the site of the explosion on Wednesday. He said it was unclear how exactly the explosion occurred, adding there was no warning before the incident. The Paris prosecutor, who is probing the incident, said that early signs indicate that the gas explosion came from within the building that houses the Paris American Academy, according to CNN affiliate, BFMTV. A part of the building collapsed following the blast and fire, videos show.  Smoke was seen billowing from the rubble earlier on Wednesday as rescue workers attempted to tackle the blaze. Paris American Academy, a fashion and design school, describes itself on its website as the \u201cfirst bilingual design school\u201d in the French capital Kent State University, in the US state of Ohio, said all its students at the Paris American Academy are safe and accounted following the blast. Locals were also stopped from returning to their homes in surrounding streets by authorities in the aftermath of the explosion. Smoke rises above rooftops with the Pantheon in the background. Gonzalo Fuentes\/Reuters One woman, Anne, told a CNN producer at the scene that she was inside her flat, around 500 meters (1,640 feet) from the site, when the explosion happened. \u201cIt felt like an earthquake, the windows banged against each other,\u201d she said. Another woman who didn\u2019t want to give her name and lives in a neighboring avenue told CNN that her doors slammed shut from the explosion. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo visited the scene later on Wednesday, writing in a tweet, \u201cMy thoughts go first of all to the victims and their close ones.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron briefly addressed the disaster later on Wednesday, thanking the first responders for their work. \u201cIn celebrating music today, we are also thinking of [the victims] and all those who are going through a difficult time,\u201d Macron added before launching a performance Wednesday night at \u00c9lys\u00e9e for the Music Day.

France\u2019s elite police force, the RAID, were deployed to the cities of Bordeaux, Lyon, Roubaix, Marseille and Lille, to help contain the protests. Confrontations flared up between protesters and police in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre \u2013 where the 17-year-old named Nahel was killed days before \u2013 and in the southern port city of Marseille. Amid burning debris, \u201cvengeance pour Nael\u201d appeared to be spray painted on a wall in Nanterre, which translates to \u201crevenge for Nael\u201d in reference to the slain teenager and using an alternative spelling of his name, according to footage from the suburb. A bank was set on fire in Nanterre, according to photographs from the scene, and 15 people have been taken in for questioning by police after a march held in memory of the teenager turned violent. Protesters threw fireworks at police officers in Marseille, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, while footage from the northern city of Lille showed fires burning on streets and running riot police officers. Six people were taken in for questioning after participating in a protest banned by authorities in Lille, the regional authority said in a Facebook post. At least 421 people were arrested in the protests across France from Thursday night into Friday morning, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told BFMTV. More than half of those arrests took place in the Paris region, in the departments of Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, BFMTV reported, citing Paris police. Earlier, Darmanin said police were instructed to \u201cintervene systematically\u201d and expressed support for the police officers and firefighters who \u201care doing a courageous job.\u201d President Emmanuel Macron will hold a crisis meeting Friday for the second day in a row following Thursday night\u2019s violence, BFMTV reported. Authorities had hoped to avoid a repeat of the scenes that played out Wednesday night, when police stations, town halls and schools were set alight in various cities and about 150 people were arrested. The Interior Ministry earlier said it planned on deploying 40,000 police officers across the country Thursday \u2013 including 5,000 in Paris \u2013 to quell any potential unrest . The unrest broke out Tuesday, hours after a police traffic stop in Nanterre resulted in the killing of Nahel. Over the course of a chaotic night, 40 cars were burned and 24 police officers injured, French authorities claimed. The police officer was put under formal investigation for voluntary homicide and placed in preliminary detention, BFMTV reported Thursday. On Thursday, an estimated 6,000 people, according to BFMTV, joined a march to honor Nahel led by his mother in Nanterre. Many wore shirts emblazoned with \u201cjustice for Nahel,\u201d while others shouted the slogan. Some were seen holding signs saying \u201cthe police kill.\u201d A lawyer for the family on Thursday confirmed the spelling of the boy\u2019s name as Nahel; he was initially identified as Na\u00ebl. Buses and tramways in Lille shut down after 8 p.m. local time, according to BFMTV, and a couple of Parisian suburbs have installed curfews. The mother of 17-year-old Nahel, seen at left on a truck, gestures during a march on Thursday. Michel Euler\/AP Bus and tram services were also suspended in the \u00cele-de-France region, which includes Paris, from Thursday night, the local transport authority said. Government ministers were asked to postpone non-urgent travel and remain in Paris due to the protests, a government source told CNN on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity citing French professional norms. The violent scenes seen over the past two days have raised concerns that Nahel\u2019s death could lead to a level of unrest and rioting not seen since 2005 , when the deaths of two teenage boys hiding from police sparked three weeks of rioting and prompted the government to call a state of emergency. Anger at police brutality The video of Nahel\u2019s killing has sparked a similar level of shock and anger across France, touching a particular nerve among young men and women of color who feel that they have been discriminated against by police. A 2017 study by the Rights Defenders, an independent human rights watchdog in France, found that young men perceived to be Black or Arab were 20 times more likely to be stopped by police than their peers. Many of these individuals are simply \u201ctired,\u201d journalist and racial equality activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cPeople know and have been speaking about police brutality and have not been heard,\u201d she said. The Algerian Foreign Ministry on Thursday extended its condolences to Nahel\u2019s family, saying in a statement their \u201cgrief and sorrow are widely shared in our country\u201d and that it will \u201cclosely follow the developments of this tragic case.\u201d The ministry said it trusts the French government to \u201ccarry out their duty to protect, assure peace of mind and security which Algerian nationals are entitled to in their host country.\u201d French media have reported that the teenager was of Algerian descent. Video of the shooting in Nanterre surfaced on social media shortly after the incident took place Tuesday morning. The clip shows two police officers standing on the driver\u2019s side of a yellow Mercedes AMG, one near the door and another near the left front fender. As the car attempts to drive away, one officer is seen firing his sidearm. The bullet that hit Nahel pierced his arm and chest. After fleeing the scene, the car crashed into a stationary object at a nearby plaza. Nahel was in the car with two others at the time of the incident. One passenger in the vehicle was taken into custody and later released, while another, who is believed to have fled the scene, is missing, authorities said. This screengrab from video posted on Twitter shows the moment when police interacted with a 17-year-old teen during a traffic stop in a Paris suburb. From @Ohana_Fgn\/Twitter The local Nanterre prosecutor, Pascal Prache, said Thursday that the officers testified both drew their weapons and pointed them at the driver to dissuade him from restarting the engine. The officer who fired his weapon said, according to the prosecutor, that he was scared the boy would run someone over with the car. However, Prache said it is believed the officer accused of shooting and killing Nahel may have acted illegally in doing so. Lawyers for Nahel\u2019s family slammed the decision not to pursue charges over alleged false statements, claiming the officer said in his initial declaration that \u201cyoung Nahel had tried to run him over with the vehicle.\u201d CNN has asked the French national police for a response to the allegations against the unnamed officer. Police officers face protesters during clashes that broke out in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre on June 29. Zakaria Abdelkafi\/AFP\/Getty Images Prache said that Nahel had been known to authorities for a previous \u201cbreach of rules,\u201d but it is not clear what law or orders that pertains to. The teen was expected to appear before a juvenile court in September. Laurent-Franck Lienard, the lawyer of the officer accused of shooting Nahel, told French radio station RTL that his client acted in \u201ccompliance of the law.\u201d In another interview with BFMTV, he said that any accusations his client lied in a statement were false as he had never made a written statement and that his verbal testimony did not contradict the facts. He claimed his client\u2019s prosecution was \u201cpolitical\u201d and being used as a way to calm the violent tensions. As to the deadly incident, Lienard said police officers had \u201cstruggled for 30 seconds\u201d to detain the driver while the car had stopped. He added that his client feared for the safety of the public as the car had nearly hit pedestrians before the start of the video. Lienard said his client was not the person in the video who shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll put a bullet in your head,\u201d while also suggesting that might not have been what was said. He added that his client was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Nahel\u2019s death and he did not want to kill him. \u201cHe committed an act in a second, in a fraction of a second. Perhaps he made a mistake, justice will tell,\u201d Li\u00e9nard said. Protesters burn garbage bins and block a street during a protest in Paris on June 29. Fiachra GIBBONS\/AFP\/Getty Images Questions of racism Macron and other government officials, including Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, have called for patience to allow the criminal justice system to run its course. \u201cWe need calm for justice to carry out its work,\u201d Macron said Wednesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the situation to worsen.\u201d Rallying public support and goodwill, however, is likely to be difficult for Macron\u2019s government given how much political capital it spent in the first half of 2023 pushing through unpopular pension reforms , which sparked months of mostly peaceful mass protests. Acknowledging the government\u2019s massive unpopularity, Macron gave himself 100 days to heal and unite the country. That deadline is up on July 14, France\u2019s national day. Firefighters extinguish a fire at an office of French bank Credit Mutuel in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre on June 29, 2023. Zakaria Abdelkafi\/AFP\/Getty Images Addressing allegations of institutional racism in France is particularly challenging given the country\u2019s unique brand of secularism, which seeks to ensure equality for all by removing markers of difference, rendering all citizens French first. In practice, however, the vigorous adherence to French Republicanism often prevents the government from doing anything that would appear to differentiate French citizens on the basis of race, including collecting statistics. Racial and religious data, where available, typically comes from private institutions, and extra care is typically taken by politicians to avoid circumscribing racial motives to state institutions. A protester climbs on a building during clashes that broke out in Nanterre. Zakaria Abdelkafi\/AFP\/Getty Images \u201cOn a general level, people tend to think there is no racism in France. And it\u2019s one of the reasons people are so angry, because they feel and experience racism on a daily basis,\u201d said Diallo, the anti-racism activist. \u201cDespite that, they still face institutions, public discourse, and media which still say that there is no racism and that the race debate does not belong in France. And that\u2019s the reason people are so angry and so outraged.\u201d Government officials have so far not broached questions of racism in the police. Leaders of opposition left-wing parties have focused their criticisms on police violence rather than racism. Government spokesman Olivier Veran told BFMTV that anger against the state itself, however, is unjustified. \u201cIt is not the republic that killed this young man,\u201d Veran said. \u201cIt is one man who must be judged if the justice system deems it necessary.\u201d CNN\u2019s Aurore Laborie, Teele Rebane, Isaac Yee, Hira Humayun and Helen Regan contributed reporting.

The 17-year-old, named as Nahel M, was shot at point-blank range as he drove off and crashed soon afterwards. Anger at his killing has sparked violence across the country. A march led by the boy's mother was marred by clashes on Thursday afternoon. In a third night of unrest, 667 people were arrested, French officials say. In Paris, shops were ransacked and cars set on fire overnight despite a heavy police presence. Across France, 40,000 police officers were deployed, with 249 of them injured in Wednesday night's clashes, according to the interior ministry. Earlier, bus and tram services in Paris and the wider region stopped operating at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Thursday. Night-time curfews were in place in some suburbs. In the town of Nanterre, where the teenager was killed, a huge fire engulfed the ground floor of a building where a bank is located. Video and pictures on social media also appear to show piles of rubbish ablaze in several places. Officers were injured on Thursday afternoon as well, during violence in Nanterre that followed a largely peaceful march calling for justice. It was attended by more than 6,000 people. Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne said she understood the outpouring of emotion following the 17-year-old's death, but condemned the riots. \"Nothing justifies the violence that's occurred,\" she said. The teenager's death has sparked a wider conversation about the power of the police and the relationship between the authorities and people from France's suburbs, who feel segregated from the country's prosperous city centres. \"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" Nahel's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme. But Nahel's mother said she did not blame the police in general, or the system, for the killing - just the officer who fired the lethal shot that killed her son. The officer accused of killing him said he had fired because he felt his life was in danger. His lawyer told French radio station RTL that his client discharged his firearm \"in full compliance of the law\". Speaking to the BBC on Friday morning, Thierry Clair, deputy secretary general of Unsad-Police trade union, said an investigation would \"determine whether this is a case of a legal or illegal use of a weapon\". He said that by law, police officers may use their weapons in certain circumstances. \"The key thing is the principle of proportionality with the nature of the threat,\" Mr Clair said. \"For instance, one of the cases refers to stopping a vehicle whose occupants refuse to comply and present a risk for someone else if they attempt to escape. \"And the incident we're talking about - in which a weapon was used - might fall into that category.\" Watch: 'They've taken my baby' - Mother of teen shot by police Unrest spreads in France over police killing of teen Fresh unrest in France over police killing of teen Anger in Paris after police kill teen in traffic stop France France riots 2023 Paris Related Mbappe 'down but motivated' at Real Madrid - Ancelotti 2 days ago Football Mbappe left out of France squad as 'one-off' 3 days ago Football 'Merchants of death' people-smuggling gang jailed 5 days ago Europe More 28 Oct 2024 G\u00e9rard Depardieu's sexual assault trial postponed A Paris court orders a medical examination of the French actor accused by two women of sexual assault in 2021. 28 Oct 2024 World 14 Oct 2024 Marine Le Pen hits back in EU funds misuse trial Far-right politician Marine Le Pen denies misusing European parliamentary funds in her National Rally party. 14 Oct 2024 Europe 8 Oct 2024 Cyclists raise \u00a350,000 for charity in ride to Paris The 50 riders raise the sum for a homelessness charity though their journey from Northampton. 8 Oct 2024 Northamptonshire 27 Sep 2024 Al Fayed\u2019s victims in France call for investigation One woman says the owner of Harrods and the Paris Ritz ran his companies like a cult or a mafia. 27 Sep 2024 Europe 25 Sep 2024 Murder of Paris student fuels anger at failed deportation The Moroccan suspect was released from detention after serving five years for raping a student. 25 Sep 2024 Europe British Broadcasting Corporation Home News US Election Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Video Live Audio Weather BBC Shop BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info Contact technical support Copyright 2024 BBC.

Violent protests spread throughout the country after a 17-year-old, named as Nahel Merzouk, was shot by police during a traffic stop in the Paris suburb of Nanterre on Tuesday. In the aftermath, people have taken to the streets on four consecutive nights to protest, setting cars alight, throwing stones and fireworks, and ransacking shops. The French interior ministry said 1,311 people were arrested and 79 police officers were injured overnight.

Social media images showed an explosion rocking Marseille's old port area. City authorities said they were investigating the cause but did not believe there were any casualties.

Overnight, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin tweeted that the night had been calmer than previous ones, thanks to \"the resolute action of security forces.\" He put the night's arrest toll at 427. Some 2,800 people have been arrested overall since the teen's death on Tuesday. Darmanin tweeted late Saturday that 200 riot police had been mobilized in the port city of Marseille, where TV showed footage of police using tear gas as night fell. Near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, hundreds of police with batons and shields stood restlessly along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, several in front of the shuttered Cartier boutique. Posts on social media had called for protests on the grand boulevard but the police presence appeared to discourage any large gatherings. Protesters run from launched tear gas canisters during clashes with police in Marseille, in southern France, on July 1, 2023, after a fourth consecutive night of rioting in France over the killing of a teenager by police. CLEMENT MAHOUDEAU\/AFP via Getty Images Earlier in the day at a hilltop cemetery in Nanterre, the Paris suburb where the teen, identified only as Nahel, was killed, hundreds stood along the road to pay tribute as mourners carried his white casket from a mosque to the burial site. Journalists were barred from the ceremony and in some cases even chased away. Some of the men carried folded prayer rugs. \"Men first,\" an official told dozens of women waiting to enter the cemetery. But Nahel's mother, dressed in white, walked inside to applause and headed toward the grave. Many of the men were young and Arab or Black, coming to mourn a boy who could have been them. Inside the cemetery gate, the casket was lifted above the crowd and carried toward the grave. The men followed, some holding little boys by the hand. As they left, some wiped their eyes. Police were nowhere to be seen. A woman pays her respects at the site where Nahel M. died, shortly after his funeral, on July 1, 2023 in Nanterre, France. Nahel M.,  a French teenager of North African origin, was fatally shot by police on June 27, 2023, causing nationwide unrest and clashes with police forces. Sam Tarling \/ Getty Images The unrest was taking a toll on Macron's diplomatic profile. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's office said Macron phoned Saturday to request a postponement of what would have been the first state visit by a French president to Germany in 23 years. Macron had been scheduled to fly to Germany on Sunday evening for the visit to Berlin and two other German cities. Macron's office said he spoke with Steinmeier and, \"given the internal security situation, the president (Macron) said he wishes to stay in France over the coming days.\" Nahel was shot during a traffic stop. Video showed two officers at the window of the car, one with his gun pointed at the driver. As the teenager pulled forward, the officer fired once through the windshield. This week, Nahel's mother told France 5 television that she was angry at the officer who shot her son, but not at the police in general. \"He saw a little Arab-looking kid, he wanted to take his life,\" she said. Nahel's family has roots in Algeria. Race was a taboo topic for decades in France, which is officially committed to a doctrine of colorblind universalism. Critics say that doctrine has masked generations of systemic racism. The officer accused of killing Nahel was given a preliminary charge of voluntary homicide, meaning that investigating magistrates strongly suspect wrongdoing, but need to investigate more before sending a case to trial. Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache said his initial investigation led him to conclude that the officer's use of his weapon wasn't legally justified. Hundreds of police and firefighters have been injured in the violence that erupted after the killing. Authorities haven't released injury tallies for protesters. In French Guiana, an overseas territory, a 54-year-old died after being hit by a stray bullet. The soccer star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, captain of France's national team, posted a message on social media Friday calling for an end to the violence. The team was \"shocked by the brutal death of young Nahel,\" Mbapp\u00e9's statement read, but \"the time of violence must end to make way for that of mourning, dialogue and reconstruction.\" The reaction to the killing was a potent reminder of the persistent poverty, discrimination, unemployment and other lack of opportunity in neighborhoods around France where many residents trace their roots to former French colonies \u2014 like where Nahel grew up. \"Nahel's story is the lighter that ignited the gas. Hopeless young people were waiting for it. We lack housing and jobs, and when we have (jobs), our wages are too low,\" said Samba Seck, a 39-year-old transportation worker in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. Clichy was the birthplace of weeks of riots in 2005 that shook France, prompted by the deaths of two teenagers electrocuted in a power substation while fleeing from police. One of the boys lived in the same housing project as Seck. Like many Clichy residents, he lamented the violence targeting his town, where the remains of a burned car stood beneath his apartment building, and the town hall entrance was set alight in rioting this week. \"Young people break everything, but we are already poor, we have nothing,\" he said, adding that \"young people are afraid to die at the hands of police.\" Despite the escalating crisis, Macron held off on declaring a state of emergency, an option used in 2005. But government ratcheted up its law enforcement response, with the mass deployment of police officers, including some who were called back from vacation. France's justice minister, Dupond-Moretti, on Saturday warned that young people who share calls for violence on Snapchat or other apps could face legal prosecution. Macron has blamed social media for fueling violence. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised government support for shop owners. \"There is no nation without order, without common rules,\" he said. Darmanin has ordered a nationwide nighttime shutdown of all public buses and trams, which have been among rioters' targets. He also said he warned social networks not to allow themselves to be used as channels for calls to violence. The violence comes just over a year before Paris and other French cities are due to host Olympic athletes and millions of visitors for the summer Olympics, whose organizers were closely monitoring the situation as preparations for the competition continue. Thirteen people who didn't comply with traffic stops were fatally shot by French police last year. This year, three more people, including Nahel, died under similar circumstances. The deaths have prompted demands for more accountability in France, which also saw racial justice protests after George Floyd's killing by police in Minnesota.

The relative says they want \"better training for the French police, weapons regulation for police, and reviewing the law that allows police to use lethal force if a young person refuses to traffic at a traffic stop\". France's penal code was changed in 2017 to allow for a broader use of firearms after police said they were facing increased levels of violence. But critics argue the increase in traffic related shootings is a direct result of that change, which they say is much too vague because it leaves officers to determine whether the driver's refusal to comply poses a risk.

Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun waved to supporters during the march. Emmanuel Dunand\/AFP\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Hundreds of people marched on Monday in support of a French mayor whose house was attacked by a burning car, as the country entered a second week gripped by violent protests and riots. A large crowd in L\u2019Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, a suburb of Paris, showed solidarity with Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun, whose house was rammed by the vehicle early on Sunday morning. The gathering came after a calmer night in the country, which has been racked by angry protests since a police office shot and killed a 17-year-old boy at a traffic stop last Tuesday. Jeanbrun\u2019s address was well known in the community before the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. The incident injured his wife and one of his children, Jeanbrun said earlier, calling it an assassination attempt. Locals and officials held up a banner at the march reading \u201cTogether for the republic!\u201d Jeanbrun, dressed in the sash of the French tricolore, told supporters: \u201cI have only one word: thank you. \u201cDemocracy was attacked,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than ever, our republic and its servants are threatened and attacked,\u201d he added. Jeanbrun told the crowd that \"democracy was attacked.\" Stephanie Lecocq\/Reuters In a previous statement on Sunday, the mayor said that while he was at city hall, \u201cindividuals rammed their car upon my residence before setting fire to it to burn my house, inside which my wife and my two young children slept.\u201d \u201cWhile trying to protect the children and escape the attackers, my wife and one of my children were injured,\u201d he said, adding that he had \u201cno words strong enough to describe his emotion towards the horror of this night.\u201d France\u2019s Ministry of Interior said 157 people were detained overnight into Monday morning, down from more than 700 the night before. Three police officers were injured, a police station was attacked and 352 public roads were set on fire, but BFMTV reported that \u201cno major incident was reported\u201d overnight. French President Emmanuel Macron will launch a procedure to \u201cunderstand deeply\u201d the cause of unrest that has been rocking France over the past week, a source present at the meeting between Macron and his top officials on Sunday told CNN.

REUTERS\/Juan Medina Juan Medina\/Reuters Grandmother of teen killed in police stop calls for calm, as France sees sixth night of protest Macron told ministers present to continue to \u201cdo everything to establish order,\u201d the source said. The wave of protests started after a police officer shot dead Nahel Merzouk, 17, during a traffic stop. The officer accused of the shooting has been charged with voluntary homicide. Merzouk\u2019s grandmother appealed to protesters on Sunday, telling BFMTV: \u201cThey should not damage the schools, not break the buses, it was the moms who take the buses. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d the grandmother, identified by BMFTV as Nadia, said, adding that Nahel\u2019s mother \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a life anymore.\u201d The teenager\u2019s funeral took place on Saturday at a mosque in Nanterre, the Paris suburb where he was killed.

Vincent Jeanbrun, 39, the centre-right mayor of the southern suburb of L'Hay-les-Roses, was at the town hall when his house was attacked with his wife Melanie and children asleep inside. The aggressors drove their vehicle at the suburban house but were halted by a low wall ringing the property's outdoor terrace, the local public prosecutor said. They then torched their vehicle. As Jeanbrun's wife and children, aged 5 and 7, took flight through the back yard, they were targeted with fireworks. Jeanbrun told Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne his wife had had surgery to a broken leg and faced a three-month rehabilitation. \"While attempting to shield them and fleeing the attackers, my wife and one of my children were hurt,\" the mayor said.

Jeanbrun's town hall has been the target of attack for several nights since Tuesday's shooting and has been protected with barbed wire and barricades. On a walkabout hours after the incident, Jeanbrun met local well-wishers and passed by the town's covered market which has been wrecked during the unrest. \"Stay strong, Mr. Mayor. We\u2019re with you,\u201d one man told the visibly emotional mayor. \"I didn\u2019t think we'd ever live through something like this,\" the mayor told another bystander who wished his wife well. \"It\u2019s pretty disgusting,\" she replied.

{"year":"2023","month":"09","event_desc":"3 September  French Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne says that France will ban disposable vapes in an effort to combat smoking.","text":"France planning to ban disposable vapes in effort to combat smoking | France | The Guardian Support us The Guardian - Back to home The Guardian: news website of the year News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show caption France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, is concerned disposable vapes are targeting children and are a gateway to smoking. Photograph: Yaroslav Litun\/Getty Images\/iStockphoto France France planning to ban disposable vapes in effort to combat smoking Ban follows similar measures in Germany, Australia and New Zealand amid concern over health effects Lisa O'Carroll in Brussels Sun 3 Sep 2023 12.31 BST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email 1 year old Disposable vapes will be banned in France as part of a national plan to combat smoking, the prime minister said on Sunday. \u00c9lisabeth Borne told the broadcaster RTL that the government would \u201csoon present a new national plan to fight against smoking with, in particular, the prohibition of disposable electronic cigarettes, the famous \u2018puffs\u2019 which give bad habits to young people\u201d. The French government is putting the final touches to its 2024 budget with a wider plan to reduce smoking, which Borne said was the cause of 75,000 deaths a year in the country. She said the plan did not include another tax rise on cigarettes, adding: \u201cBut that does not mean we are not vigilant about tobacco consumption.\u201d Her main concern is disposable vapes, known as \u201cpuffs\u201d in France, which she says are a gateway to smoking. She is worried that the cigarettes with flavours such as ice candy, marshmallow and bubblegum reminiscent of childhood sweets and priced at \u20ac8 (\u00a36.85) to \u20ac12 for 500 \u201cpuffs\u201d are targeting teenagers. Several European countries are also looking at banning them. Online sales are banned in Belgium and a national consultation on prohibition is under way in Ireland. In Germany the government has banned flavoured heated tobacco products, with the drugs tsar warning this can only be a start. Australia has taken the toughest response , making vapes prescription only, reducing their nicotine content and restricting flavours. In New Zealand, similar steps have been taken with a ban on most disposable vapes and curbs on marketing to children, including a prohibition on vape shops near schools and rules that require generic flavouring descriptions. The rules, which came into effect in August, were designed to continue the sale of disposable cigarettes for those who use them as a transition to giving up smoking. Irish research shows that teenagers who use e-cigarettes are up to five times more likely to start smoking compared with those who do not. According to data released last year , New Zealand\u2019s smoking prevalence had dropped to 8% \u2013 one of the lowest in the world \u2013 but the rise in daily vape users was larger than the drop in daily smokers. The number of year 10 students \u2013 about 14 years old \u2013 in New Zealand who vaped daily had tripled, from 3.1% in 2019 to 9.6% in 2021. This year France\u2019s then health minister said that although Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government had no majority in parliament, ministers would \u201cwork with lawmakers\u201d to reach a deal on a ban. Fran\u00e7ois Braun said the law could be enacted \u201cbefore the end of this year\u201d . \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2023. The German government has banned flavoured heated tobacco products, rather than flavoured e-cigarettes as an earlier version said.

The attack took place in the northeastern town of Arras, home to large Jewish and Muslim populations. Police arrested the suspected attacker, Mohammed Moguchkov, who had cried the Arabic phrase \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d (God is greatest), according to the preliminary elements of the investigation. Authorities have suggested a probable link to the ongoing violence in the Middle East, with President Emmanuel Macron denouncing the incident as an act of \u201cIslamist terror\u201d. The deployment of the soldiers from Operation Sentinelle will be completed by Monday evening, according to the Elysee presidential palace. Sentinelle is a French military operation with 10,000 soldiers and 4,700 police and gendarmes deployed since the aftermath of the January 2015 attacks to protect parts of the country deemed sensitive from terrorism. \u201cThis school was struck by the barbarity of Islamist terrorism,\u201d Mr Macron said after visiting the school, adding that the victim had \u201cprobably saved many lives\u201d with his courage in blocking the attacker. Mr Macron said another attempted attack in another region had been foiled by security forces. According to the interior ministry, the president was referring to the arrest of a \u201cradicalised\u201d man who was arrested leaving a prayer hall in the Yvelines region of Paris for carrying a prohibited weapon. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin later said there was \u201cprobably a link between what\u2019s happening in the Middle East and this incident\u201d in Arras. France upped its alert level to the highest position following a crunch security meeting chaired by Mr Macron on Friday, the prime minister\u2019s office told AFP. A total of eight people were in police custody on Friday, a police source said. In addition to the attacker, several members of his family were arrested \u201cfor the purposes of the investigation\u201d, including one of his brothers and his sister, other police sources said. The national anti-terrorist prosecutor announced that it has opened an investigation. Moguchkov, who is in his 20s, is from Russia\u2019s mainly Muslim southern Caucasus region of Chechnya. He was already on a French national register known as \u201cFiche S\u201d as a potential security threat, a police source told AFP, and under electronic and physical surveillance by France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the DGSI. \u2018Terrorism has struck\u2019 The victim, a French teacher, was stabbed in the throat and chest. Among those wounded were a school security guard who was stabbed multiple times and is fighting for his life, and a teacher in a less serious condition, the source added. A cleaner was also hurt, according to anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard. A police cordon restricts access to the Gambetta-Carnot high school in Arras, in north of France, on Oct 13. PHOTO: EPA-EFE No pupils at the school were hurt, another police source said. The attack comes almost three years to the day after the October 16, 2020 beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, also by a Chechen, near his school in a Paris suburb. \u201cThree years after the assassination of Samuel Paty, terrorism has struck a school again and in a context that we all know,\u201d Mr Macron said. Police say Moguchkov\u2019s 17-year-old brother was detained close to another school. Panic in school The pupils and teachers were confined to the school premises before being allowed out in the afternoon. A large security cordon was set up around the school where parents had gathered, and police, firefighters and emergency services were deployed, AFP journalists reported. Mr Martin Dousseau, a philosophy teacher who witnessed the attack, described a moment of panic during break-time, when schoolchildren found themselves face-to-face with the armed man. \u201cHe attacked canteen staff. I wanted to go down to intervene, he turned to me, chased me and asked me if I was a history and geography teacher,\u201d Mr Dousseau said. \u201cWe barricaded ourselves in, then the police arrived and immobilised him.\u201d France has suffered a series of attacks by Islamist extremists since 2015 including the suicide and gun attacks in November 2015, claimed by the Islamic State group (IS), on targets in Paris where 130 people were killed. There has been a relative lull in recent years, though officials have warned that the threat remains.

Speaking in Arras, he reaffirmed his message from that address for the French to \u201cstand shoulder to shoulder\u201d and \u201cstay united\u201d. French Education Minister Gabriel Attal said in a message to regional education officials security should be reinforced at schools \u201cwithout delay\u201d. Mr Darmanin on Thursday had banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations in France until further notice, on the grounds they \u201care likely to generate disturbances to public order\u201d. In defiance of his order, several hundred people gathered in Paris and other French cities on Thursday shouting pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli slogans, AFP correspondents said. Police in Paris used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and said they had arrested 10 out of around 3,000 people present.

The rule will be applied as soon as the new school year starts on 4 September. France has a strict ban on religious signs in state schools and government buildings, arguing that they violate secular laws. Wearing a headscarf has been banned since 2004 in state-run schools. \"When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn't be able to identify the pupils' religion just by looking at them,\" Education Minister Gabriel Attal told France's TF1 TV, adding: \"I have decided that the abaya could no longer be worn in schools.\" The move comes after months of debate over the wearing of abayas in French schools. The garment is being increasingly worn in schools, leading to a political divide over them, with right-wing parties pushing for a ban while those on the left have voiced concerns for the rights of Muslim women and girls. \"Secularism means the freedom to emancipate oneself through school,\" Mr Attal told TF1, arguing the abaya is \"a religious gesture, aimed at testing the resistance of the republic toward the secular sanctuary that school must constitute.\" He said that he would give clear rules at the national level before schools open after the summer break. Hijab campaign tweets pulled after French backlash The Islamic veil across Europe In 2010, France banned the wearing of full face veils in public which provoked anger in France's five million-strong Muslim community. France has enforced a strict ban on religious signs at schools since the 19th Century, including Christian symbols such as large crosses, in an effort to curb any Catholic influence from public education. It has been updating the law over the years to reflect its changing population, which now includes the Muslim headscarf and Jewish kippa, but abayas have not been banned outright. Dominique Schnapper on state secularism in France The debate on Islamic symbols has intensified since a Chechen refugee beheaded teacher Samuel Paty, who had shown students caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed, near his school in a Paris suburb in 2020. The announcement is the first major policy decision by Mr Attal, who was appointed France's education minister by President Emmanuel Macron this summer at the age of 34. The CFCM, a national body representing many Muslim associations, has said items of clothing alone were not \"a religious sign\".

Dans chaque d\u00e9partement, les s\u00e9nateurs sont \u00e9lus par un coll\u00e8ge \u00e9lectoral de grands \u00e9lecteurs form\u00e9 d'\u00e9lus de cette circonscription : d\u00e9put\u00e9s et s\u00e9nateurs, conseillers r\u00e9gionaux, conseillers d\u00e9partementaux, conseillers municipaux, \u00e9lus \u00e0 leur poste au suffrage universel*. Depuis 2008, les s\u00e9nateurs sont \u00e9lus pour un mandat de 6 ans, le S\u00e9nat se renouvelant par moiti\u00e9 tous les 3 ans depuis 2011. Le nombre de s\u00e9nateurs \u00e9lus dans chaque circonscription varie en fonction de la population : 1 s\u00e9nateur pour la Loz\u00e8re, 5 dans le Bas-Rhin et 12 \u00e0 Paris. Chaque renouvellement permet d'\u00e9lire environ la moiti\u00e9 des s\u00e9nateurs r\u00e9partis en deux s\u00e9ries. La s\u00e9rie 2 qui comporte 178 si\u00e8ges a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e lors des \u00e9lections s\u00e9natoriales de septembre 2020. Les 170 si\u00e8ges de la s\u00e9rie 1 seront renouvel\u00e9s en septembre 2023. Selon le nombre de si\u00e8ges \u00e0 pourvoir, les s\u00e9nateurs sont \u00e9lus au scrutin majoritaire \u00e0 deux tours (circonscriptions d\u00e9signant 1 ou 2 s\u00e9nateurs) ou au scrutin de liste \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation proportionnelle (circonscriptions d\u00e9signant 3 s\u00e9nateurs ou plus.) * La composition du coll\u00e8ge \u00e9lectoral des s\u00e9nateurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par la loi du 2 ao\u00fbt 2013 . La composition du S\u00e9nat La \"Haute assembl\u00e9e\" est compos\u00e9e de 348 s\u00e9nateurs depuis le \u00a01er octobre 2011. Le dernier renouvellement a eu lieu le dimanche 11 septembre 2020 . La loi organique n\u00b0 2003-696 du 30 juillet 2003 ( JO n\u00b0 175 du 31 juillet 2003 ) a r\u00e9duit la dur\u00e9e du mandat des s\u00e9nateurs et a r\u00e9form\u00e9 la composition du S\u00e9nat afin de mieux repr\u00e9senter la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d\u00e9mographique et les collectivit\u00e9s territoriales. En 2007, la loi n\u00b0 2007-224 du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2007 ( JO n\u00b0 45 du 22 f\u00e9vrier 2007 ) a cr\u00e9\u00e9 deux nouvelles collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer (COM), les \u00eeles de Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy et de Saint-Martin, d\u00e9sormais ind\u00e9pendantes de la Guadeloupe. Lire le dossier Pour tenir compte de ces modifications, la loi organique n\u00b0 2007-223 du 21 f\u00e9vrier 2007 ( JO n\u00b0 45 du 22 f\u00e9vrier 2007 ) a cr\u00e9\u00e9 deux si\u00e8ges de s\u00e9nateurs (\u00e0 Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy et \u00e0 Saint-Martin). Lire le dossier La r\u00e9forme de 2003 (compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par celle de 2007) a pr\u00e9vu un accroissement graduel de l\u2019effectif s\u00e9natorial, qui est pass\u00e9 de 321 avant la r\u00e9forme de 2003 \u00e0 : 331 si\u00e8ges au renouvellement 2004 ; 343 si\u00e8ges au renouvellement 2008 ; 348 si\u00e8ges au renouvellement 2011. Les \u00e9lections devaient initialement se tenir en 2007 et 2010, mais en raison de la modification du calendrier \u00e9lectoral des \u00e9lections municipales et cantonales et afin que les s\u00e9nateurs soient \u00e9lus d\u00e9sormais et dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir par des grands \u00e9lecteurs en d\u00e9but de mandat, les \u00e9lections s\u00e9natoriales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cal\u00e9es d'une ann\u00e9e soit septembre 2008, 2011 et 2014. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection des s\u00e9nateurs de Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy et de Saint-Martin le 21 septembre 2008. Depuis 2011 , le S\u00e9nat est compos\u00e9 de 348 s\u00e9nateurs : 326 \u00e9lus dans les d\u00e9partements de m\u00e9tropole et d'outre-mer ; 2 en Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise ; 1 dans les iles Wallis et Futuna ; 1 \u00e0 Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy ; 1 \u00e0 Saint-Martin ; 2 en Nouvelle Cal\u00e9donie ; 2 \u00e0 Mayotte ; 1 \u00e0 Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon ; 12 repr\u00e9sentent les Fran\u00e7ais de l'\u00e9tranger. Le mandat s\u00e9natorial Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9forme adopt\u00e9e en juillet 2003 ( loi organique n\u00b02003-696 du 30 juillet 2003 ), les s\u00e9nateurs, investis par le suffrage universel indirect de tous les droits et obligations attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la fonction parlementaire, sont \u00e9lus pour six ans par un coll\u00e8ge \u00e9lectoral de plus de 160 000 \u00e9lus. L'\u00e2ge minimum d'\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 24 ans ( loi n\u00b0 2011-410 du 14 avril 2011 ). Le renouvellement partiel du S\u00e9nat continue d'\u00eatre triennal (tous les 3 ans), et porte d\u00e9sormais sur la moiti\u00e9 des si\u00e8ges. Le chapitre VIII du Titre IV du Code \u00e9lectoral d\u00e9termine les r\u00e8gles applicables au remplacement des s\u00e9nateurs . Les s\u00e9nateurs \u00e9lus au scrutin majoritaire , dont le si\u00e8ge devient vacant pour cause de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, d'acceptation des fonctions de membre du Conseil constitutionnel ou de D\u00e9fenseur des droits ou de prolongation au-del\u00e0 du d\u00e9lai de six mois d'une mission temporaire confi\u00e9e par le Gouvernement sont remplac\u00e9s par les personnes \u00e9lues en m\u00eame temps qu'eux \u00e0 cet effet. Les s\u00e9nateurs \u00e9lus au scrutin majoritaire qui acceptent des fonctions gouvernementales sont remplac\u00e9s, jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un mois suivant la cessation de ces fonctions, par les personnes \u00e9lues en m\u00eame temps qu'eux \u00e0 cet effet ( la loi organique n\u00b02014-125 du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2014 modifie, \u00e0 compter du renouvellement de septembre 2017 , les dispositions ci-dessus). Le s\u00e9nateur \u00e9lu \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation proportionnelle dont le si\u00e8ge devient vacant pour toute autre cause que l'acceptation de fonctions gouvernementales est remplac\u00e9 par le candidat figurant sur la m\u00eame liste imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le dernier candidat devenu s\u00e9nateur conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordre de cette liste. Le s\u00e9nateur \u00e9lu \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation proportionnelle qui accepte des fonctions gouvernementales est remplac\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration d'un d\u00e9lai d'un mois suivant la cessation de ces fonctions, par le candidat figurant sur la m\u00eame liste imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le dernier candidat devenu s\u00e9nateur conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordre de la liste. A l'expiration du d\u00e9lai d'un mois, le s\u00e9nateur reprend l'exercice de son mandat. Le caract\u00e8re temporaire du remplacement pour cause d'acceptation de fonctions gouvernementales s'applique au dernier candidat devenu s\u00e9nateur conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordre de la liste. Celui-ci est replac\u00e9 en t\u00eate des candidats non \u00e9lus de cette liste. Qui \u00e9lit les s\u00e9nateurs ? La composition du coll\u00e8ge \u00e9lectoral des s\u00e9nateurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par la loi du 2 ao\u00fbt 2013 relative \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection des s\u00e9nateurs. 1 - Les grands \u00e9lecteurs Il s\u2019agit : des d\u00e9put\u00e9s et des s\u00e9nateurs ; des conseillers r\u00e9gionaux \u00e9lus dans le d\u00e9partement, des conseillers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, et des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s des conseils municipaux qui repr\u00e9sentent 95 % des quelque 162 000 grands \u00e9lecteurs au total*. * L'article L.285 du code \u00e9lectoral permet d\u00e9sormais, \u00e0 partir de 30 000 habitants, la d\u00e9signation par le conseil municipal d'un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire par tranche de 800 et non plus de 1 000 habitants. Le nombre des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s des conseils municipaux d\u00e9pend de la population municipale authentifi\u00e9e au 1er janvier 2014 par les recensements. Les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s doivent avoir la nationalit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise et \u00eatre inscrits sur la liste \u00e9lectorale de la commune int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Le vote est obligatoire pour les grands \u00e9lecteurs ( Art. L. 318 du code \u00e9lectoral ). S'ils ne peuvent voter pour un motif l\u00e9gitime, ils sont remplac\u00e9s par un autre grand \u00e9lecteur. Si la non participation au scrutin n'est pas justifi\u00e9e, le grand \u00e9lecteur encourt une amende de 100 euros.

Dans les communes de 9 000 habitants et plus , tous les conseillers municipaux sont d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s de droit. Dans les communes de plus de 30 000 habitants, les conseillers municipaux \u00e9lisent des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 raison de 1 pour 800 habitants** au-dessus de 30 000 .

Le cadre l\u00e9gislatif de ces \u00e9lections est fix\u00e9 par les articles L. 283 \u00e0 L. 293 du code \u00e9lectoral. ** Cette disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019article 7 de la loi n\u00b0 2013-702 du 2 ao\u00fbt 2013. 3 - L'\u00e9lection des grands \u00e9lecteurs au sein des communes Dans les communes de moins de 1 000 habitants , les \u00e9lecteurs des s\u00e9nateurs sont \u00e9lus au scrutin majoritaire \u00e0 deux tours. Dans les communes de plus de 1 000 habitants , ils sont \u00e9lus au scrutin de liste \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation proportionnelle , avec application de la r\u00e8gle de la plus forte moyenne. 4 - Le calcul du quotient \u00e9lectoral dans le cas d'un \u00e9lection \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation proportionnelle Exemple d\u2019un d\u00e9partement o\u00f9 5 si\u00e8ges sont \u00e0 pourvoir et o\u00f9 3 listes sont en comp\u00e9tition. Hypoth\u00e8se : 1532 suffrages exprim\u00e9s : la liste A obtenant 1023 voix, la liste B obtenant 258 voix, et la liste C obtenant 253 voix. Nombre de suffrages exprim\u00e9s\/nombre de si\u00e8ges soit 1532\/5 = 306,4 Attribution des si\u00e8ges au quotient Nombre de si\u00e8ges obtenus = nombre de suffrages recueillis\/quotient \u00e9lectoral. Le r\u00e9sultat est arrondi au nombre entier inf\u00e9rieur, ce qui donne : pour la liste A : 1023\/306,4 soit 3 si\u00e8ges ; pour la liste B : 258\/306,4 soit 0 si\u00e8ge ; et pour la liste C : 253\/306,4 soit 0 si\u00e8ge \u00e9galement. Attribution des si\u00e8ges restants \u00e0 la plus forte moyenne Dans cet exemple, il reste deux si\u00e8ges \u00e0 attribuer. On attribue fictivement \u00e0 chaque liste le si\u00e8ge suivant et on divise le nombre de voix obtenues par chaque liste par ce nombre fictif de si\u00e8ges. La liste qui obtient le nombre le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 se voit attribuer le si\u00e8ge. On r\u00e9p\u00e8te l\u2019op\u00e9ration pour les si\u00e8ges suivants. Ainsi, pour l\u2019attribution du 4\u00e8me si\u00e8ge, on fait les calculs suivants : pour la liste A : 1023\/(3+1) = 255,75 ; pour la liste B : 258\/(0+1) = 258 ; pour la liste C : 253\/(0+1) = 253. La liste B se voit donc attribuer le 4\u00e8me si\u00e8ge. Pour l\u2019attribution du 5\u00e8me si\u00e8ge, les calculs sont les suivants : pour la liste A : 1023\/(3+1) = 255,75 ; pour la liste B : 258\/(1+1) = 129 ; pour la liste C : 253\/(0+1) = 253. La liste A se voit donc attribuer le 5\u00e8me si\u00e8ge. L'ordre des \u00e9lus en premier lieu les candidats \u00e9lus au quotient, d'apr\u00e8s l'ordre de pr\u00e9sentation sur les listes et en commen\u00e7ant par la liste qui aura obtenu le plus de suffrages ; ensuite, les candidats \u00e9lus \u00e0 la plus forte moyenne, toujours d'apr\u00e8s l'ordre de pr\u00e9sentation sur les listes, et en commen\u00e7ant par les moyennes les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es.

REUTERS\/Mohamed Azakir\/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - France will send dozens of armoured vehicles to the Lebanese army so it can properly carry out patrol missions in the country, France's defence minister said in remarks published on Monday. Speaking to Lebanon's L'Orient Le Jour newspaper after a trip to the country, Sebastien Lecornu said it was vital to beef up the Lebanese national army so that it could coordinate well with the United Nations peacekeeping force as tensions mount between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. \"We will pursue our partnership with military equipment, notably for the transport of troops protected by armour, which is key to maintain patrols,\" he said, adding that several dozen armoured vehicles would be given to the Lebanese army soon. \"Our support for the Lebanese army is for the long-term whatever the current difficulties,\" Lecornu added. Paris will also provide medicines and is setting up a joint programme to purchase medical supplies at reasonable prices for the Lebanese army in the future, he said. France has sought to use its historical relationship with Lebanon to try to defuse tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, but violence has spiked. Some 700 French soldiers are part of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) established in 1978 following violence on the Israel-Lebanon border. Hezbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim armed group classed by the United States and others as a terrorist organisation, wields enormous power in Lebanon, whose economy is in ruins and whose state is barely functioning. Lebanese leaders fear clashes between Hezbollah and Israel could flare into a major conflict. Sign up here.

It was the third time since the weekend that the palace had to evacuate visitors. \nMeanwhile three airports in the cities of Lyon, Toulouse and Lille received emailed threats Wednesday, police said, without elaborating on the nature of the threats. The airports all reopened to passengers and staff after security checks. \nThe evacuations were the latest in a series around France that included another popular tourist attraction, the Louvre Museum in Paris. They followed the killing of a teacher in the northern city of Arras on Friday by a suspected Islamist extremist. The threats have so far proved false. \nThe Louvre Museum and the Chateau of Versailles were both evacuated Saturday, and the former royal palace was again evacuated Tuesday. \nGovernment spokesman Olivier Veran said that the multiple security alerts and evacuations must not grip France with fear. \n\u201cThis is what the terrorists are waiting for, to terrorize us ... We can be vigilant and I prefer to speak about a vigilant society,\u201d Veran said in answer to a question after the weekly Cabinet meeting.\n\n\n\u201cVigilance, yes. Fear, no,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd even less so terror, and not psychosis.\u201d \nSecurity alerts are evaluated on a case by case basis in coordination with the police, he added.\nThe prefecture for the Lyon region reminded the public that communicating false information can lead to prison and a heavy fine.\nIn the Riviera city of Nice, an abandoned piece of luggage also briefly disrupted operations at the airport.\nThe high school in Arras, where the teacher was murdered by a former student suspected to be an Islamist terrorist, was evacuated on Monday after a security alert, ahead of a moment of silence in schools across France.\nIt was not clear whether the spate of security threats was linked to the fatal stabbing of the teacher or whether France might be a victim of fallout from the war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. \nFrance has heightened its threat alert level, allowing authorities to add 7,000 soldiers to the 3,000 already in French streets. They are tasked with guarding Jewish places of worship, schools, train stations and other sensitive areas. \nThe anti-terrorism prosecutor said on Tuesday that the suspect declared his allegiance to the so-called Islamic State group before the fatal stabbing.\n\u2014-\nJeffrey Schaeffer in Paris contributed.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The attack happened at Gambetta high school in the northern city of Arras at about 11:00 local time (09:00 GMT). The attacker has been arrested and is now in custody. Witnesses say he shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", or \"God is greatest\", during the attack. Visiting the school, President Emmanuel Macron condemned the \"barbarity of Islamist terrorism\". Mr Macron called on French people to stay \"united\" in the face of the attack, to \"not give in to terror or let anything divide us\". He said police had averted another attempted attack in another part of France. The man killed was a French language teacher. Those injured were another teacher and a security guard. Mr Macron said the teacher had \"come forward to protect others and had without doubt saved many lives\". The attacker, named as 20-year-old Russian national Mohamed Mogouchkov, is of Chechen origin and known to the security services for his involvement with Islamist extremism, according to police. As a former pupil at the school, he alarmed teachers with his views. The French anti-terror prosecutor's office says it has opened an investigation following the attack for \"murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise\" and \"attempted murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise\". News channel BFMTV has reported that the brother of the attacker has also been apprehended by police. Police say the situation is now under control. The attack comes amid rising tensions in France's sizeable Muslim and Jewish communities due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. However, police have said there is nothing to indicate a link with the Middle East. The attack comes nearly three years since the murder and beheading of another teacher, Samuel Paty , at his school outside Paris. The perpetrator of that attack, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, a Russian Muslim refugee, was shot dead by police shortly afterwards.

Portraits of hostages seized in the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7 are displayed during a march through the streets against antisemitism on Sunday in Paris, France. Antoine Gyori\/Corbis\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across France on Sunday to call out a sharp rise in antisemitic acts since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. In Paris, an estimated 105,000 demonstrators joined the march, making it the largest mobilization against antisemitism since the protest against the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Carpentras in 1990, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Protesters were joined in the French capital by political figures including Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Together they held a banner with the words, \u201cFor the Republic, against antisemitism.\u201d Demonstrators came out in smaller numbers in cities including Nice, Lyon and Marseille, according to BFM TV. More than 182,000 people took part in marches across the country, BFM TV reported, citing the interior ministry. Tensions have been rising in France, and particularly in the capital, over the Israel-Hamas war, resulting in a surge in antisemitic incidents, according to French President Emmanual Macron. In a letter published in French newspaper Le Parisien on Saturday, Macron condemned \u201cthe unbearable resurgence of unbridled antisemitism.\u201d He said more than 1,000 antisemitic acts were committed in France in one month alone \u2013 three times more than over the course of the entire previous year. Macron did not join the Sunday march but said in a social media post that \u201ca France where our Jewish fellow citizens are afraid is not France.\u201d \u201cA France where French people are afraid because of their religion or their origin is not France,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo tolerance for the intolerable.\u201d Later Sunday, Macron reiterated France\u2019s solidarity with Israel, after he was criticized by prominent figures in Israel over comments he made in an earlier interview with the BBC. On Friday, Macron told the BBC that a ceasefire is \u201cthe only solution\u201d to the situation in Gaza. \u201cWe share the pain and we do share a willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France. But I think there is no justification to attack civilians,\u201d Macron said. In a phone call with Israeli President Issac Herzog Sunday, Macron said Israel has the right to defend itself \u201c\u2018in compliance with international humanitarian law.\u201d \u201cThe threat of terrorist groups in Gaza had to be eliminated,\u201d Macron said, according to a statement from the Elysee Palace. \u201cThis fight must be conducted in compliance with international humanitarian law and taking into account the protection of civilian populations.\u201d Macron\u2019s calls for a ceasefire resonated as far as Australia, where Foreign Minister Penny Wong noted his comments and said, \u201cWe all want to take the next steps towards a ceasefire.\u201d But she added that it cannot be one-sided, pointing out that Palestinian militant group Hamas, who attacked Israel on October 7, still holds Israeli hostages. Pro-Palestinian rallies in Europe The marches against antisemitism in\u00a0France\u00a0came as pro-Palestinian demonstrators also rallied in multiple European capitals over the weekend. Around 300,000 people in London turned out for a large pro-Palestinian rally on Saturday, according to police, marching through the streets of the British capital calling for a ceasefire. There was a heavy police presence in central London\u2019s Hyde Park Corner as protesters chanted \u201cfree, free Palestine\u201d and the more controversial refrain \u201cfrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!\u201d Police said they had \u201cfaced aggression from counter-protesters\u201d who stormed the area \u201cin significant numbers\u201d as the rally was building up. Officers\u00a0intercepted a group of 150 people who were launching fireworks towards the end of\u00a0the march, police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said in a statement issued later Saturday. Arrests were made after some of the fireworks struck officers in the face, the statement read. A pro-Palestinian demonstration also took place in Germany\u2019s financial capital Frankfurt on Sunday, as well as in Barcelona and Brussels on Saturday.

Saudi Press Agency\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Law Firms Syria Law Offices Follow PARIS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - French judges have issued arrest warrants for Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, his brother Maher al-Assad, and two other senior officials over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians in Syria, a judicial source said on Wednesday. The arrest warrants -- which refer to charges of complicity in crimes against humanity and complicity in war crimes -- follow a criminal investigation into chemical attacks in the town of Douma and the district of Eastern Ghouta in August 2013, attacks which killed more than 1,000 people. Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue It is the first international arrest warrant that has been issued for the Syrian head of state, whose forces responded to protests that began in 2011 with a brutal crackdown that U.N. experts have said amounts to war crimes. These are also the first international arrest warrants that have been issued over the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, said Mazen Darwish, lawyer and founder of the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), which filed the case in France. Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue Syria denies using chemical weapons but a previous joint inquiry of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found that the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 2017 attack and has repeatedly used chlorine as a weapon. The Syrian presidency and information ministry did not immediately reply for comment. \"The president is responsible for many crimes in Syria - but with this type of weapon in particular - sarin gas - it's impossible to jump over the gap (of his involvement),\" Darwish told Reuters, noting that approval from the president as commander of the armed forces would be mandatory. Arrest warrants for sitting heads of state are rare because they generally enjoy immunity from prosecution. However, international law has exceptions to that immunity when a head of state is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity or genocide. The International Criminal Court currently has two arrest warrants against heads of state: one against sitting Russian President Vladimir Putin and another against former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir. Assad was shunned for more than a decade by most countries in the region and the rest of the world, with a few rare trips to Russia and Iran since the war broke out in 2011. His visit to the United Arab Emirates last year signaled a thaw in relations and was followed by a diplomatic flurry following this year's deadly earthquake in Syria. He has since been welcomed back into the Arab League and traveled as far as China. Warrants were issued to Ghassam Abbas, director of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC), the agency that established Syria's chemical weapons programme, and Bassam al-Hassan, chief of security and liaison officer. Assad's brother Maher was deemed complicit in his role as head of the fourth armoured division. Judges from the crimes against humanity unit at the Paris Tribunal have issued a total of 11 arrest warrants for crimes committed by Syrian officials. In October, French judges issued warrants for two former defence ministers over a 2017 bomb that killed a French-Syrian man at his home in Daraa.

The couple\u2019s two sons, ages 9 months and 4 years old, were suffocated or drowned. The prosecutor described a small, blood-stained apartment in extreme disarray.\nFlowers, a stuffed toy and a holiday garland adorned a fence outside the apartment building Tuesday, in honor of the victims. The windows of the apartment were shuttered.\nThe motive for the killings was unclear. The suspect, a 33-year-old man born in the Paris suburb of Colombes, was arrested Tuesday outside his father\u2019s home northeast of the French capital, the prosecutor said.\n\u201cThe human toll is horrifying, a whole family was killed, stabbed in an atrocious conditions.

Accept Manage my choices Generation Identity has repeatedly tried to bar migrants from entering the country, conducting high-profile raids in the Alps and the Pyrenees. On February 13, Darmanin announced that he had triggered procedures to ban the group in response to a series of anti-migrant actions. He had already raised the possibility of dissolving the far-right group in late January when it deployed around 30 activists on the Spanish border, with cars bearing the message \u201cDefend Europe\u201d and the use of drones to police the frontier \u2013 the latest in a series of stunts Generation Identity has used to attract\u00a0the French public\u2019s attention. \u2018A declaration of war\u2019 The organisation first grabbed French headlines in 2012 with an online video titled \u201cA declaration of war\u201d. A group of young people filmed close-up told the camera they were the generation that had seen an \u201cethnic divide\u201d and a \u201cbankrupt\u201d experiment in \u201cliving together\u201d that included \u201cimposed miscegenation\u201d. A month later, they engaged in direct action for the first time by occupying the roof of a mosque under construction in the central French city of Poitiers, using the building to\u00a0display anti-immigrant banners. Then-president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government considered shutting down Generation Identity in response to this, but did not do so. The group persisted with shock tactics over the following years \u2013 including blocking the road linking the \u201cCalais jungle\u201d migrant camp to the city centre in 2016 and by having one of its members infiltrate the NGO SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, which helps migrants in danger of death at sea, in 2018. But Generation Identity\u2019s biggest publicity stunt was when it launched a vast operation in the Alps along the Italian border, an open frontier thanks to the EU\u2019s Schengen agreement \u2013 and a major crossing point for migrants.\u00a0The activists dressed in blue jackets,\u00a0making\u00a0them\u00a0look like police officers and fuelling\u00a0the impression that they were usurping the role of the French state. Three members were sentenced to six months in prison for the Alps stunt in August 2019 \u2013 specifically for masquerading as police officers.

But then France shifted gears to take a decisive advantage at 20-16 in the 43rd minute of a tight contest in which the lead had not crossed more than three points up until then. The ROC had won their previous meeting with France by a solitary goal in the group stage at Tokyo despite trailing at halftime but their efforts were in vain in the final. The victory meant France emulated their male counterparts in bagging the gold medal, marking the first time since Los Angeles 1984 that both men\u2019s and women\u2019s handball teams from the same country have triumphed at the Games . The Soviet Union first managed the feat in 1976 before Yugoslavia nearly four decades ago. Norway took bronze after thrashing Sweden 36-19 earlier on Sunday, dominating the clash as their fast attacks overwhelmed the Swedish defence. Norway also won bronze in women\u2019s handball at the 2016 Rio Olympics after taking the title at the 2012 and 2008 Games. Sweden, playing their first Olympic medal match in women\u2019s handball, struggled throughout the game and missed many shots. On Sunday, Nora Moerk led Norway\u2019s assault on the Swedish goal, netting eight balls to grab the top-scorer spot for women in handball at the Tokyo Games with 52 goals. An outstanding performance by Norway goalie Silje Solberg, who had a superb 44% saving efficiency rate and even scored a goal, kept Sweden in check. \u201cIt\u2019s my first Olympic medal and it means a lot for me,\u201d Solberg said. \u201cTo finish this way is a good feeling for me and the whole team.

Led by Jean-Pierre Fabre-Bernadac, a retired Gendarmerie general, and signed by 80 other retired officers, the open letter to Mr Macron was published in Valeurs Actuelles, a right-wing news magazine, last week. Strongly supported by Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally and presidential candidate, the text was this week dismissed by Mr Macron\u2019s government as a diatribe from a bunch of military pensioners who \u201conly represent themselves\u201d. It was, it said, sadly reminiscent of the Algiers putsch - an attempt to oust Charles de Gaulle 60 years ago by retired generals who opposed moves towards granting Algeria, then a French colony, independence after a bloody civil war. However, the appeal has gained traction just days after a woman police employee had her throat slashed by an Islamist who had entered France illegally from Tunisia before eventually being granted residency. It also comes a year before presidential elections in which key themes are expected to be security and immigration - issues which the Right and far-Right see as Mr Macron\u2019s Achilles heel, despite him introducing a string of tough laws including one against Islamist \u201cseparation\u201d. \u201cFrance is in danger. Several mortal perils are threatening her,\u201d the generals wrote. \u201cEven in retirement, we remain soldiers of France and cannot in the current circumstances remain indifferent to the fate of our beautiful country.\u201d Under the influence of Left-wing dogma France was \u201cdisintegrating with the Islamists of the hordes of the banlieue [suburbs] who are detaching swathes of the nation and turning them into territory subject to dogmas contrary to our constitution,\u201d they warned. Failure to act now could see \u201can explosion and then intervention by our comrades on active service in the dangerous mission of protecting our civilised values and the safety of our compatriots\u201d. \u201cThere is no time to waffle, or tomorrow civil war will put an end to this growing chaos and the dead, for whom you will bear responsibility, will be counted in the thousands.\u201d Without citing any political figures, the generals said that they were \u201cready to support politicians who take into account the safety of the nation\u201d. Marine Le Pen has backed the retired generals' appeal and called on them to join her Credit : THOMAS COEX\/AFP Ms Le Pen promptly said she wholeheartedly agreed with their analysis and called on them to support her. \u201cI invite you to join our action and take part in the battle which is opening and which is above all the battle of France,\u201d she wrote on the Valeurs Actuelles site. \u201cAs a citizen and as a woman politician, I subscribe to your analysis and share your suffering.\u201d After days of silence, Florence Parly, the defence minister, dismissed the text on Sunday as the \u201cirresponsible\u201d work of \u201cretired soldiers who no longer have any role in our armed forces and only represent themselves\u201d. \u201cMs Le Pen's comments reflect a serious ignorance of the institution of the army, which is worrying for someone who wants to become commander-in-chief,\u201d she added. Ms Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, the industry ministry, also lashed out at Ms Le Pen. \u201cSixty years to the day after the putsch by the generals against General de Gaulle ... the mask is falling and the varnish is cracking. Marine Le Pen is far-Right and it\u2019s exactly the same story as 60 years ago.\u201d Ms Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the far-Right party she now leads with support from those who backed the army\u2019s efforts to stop de Gaulle granting independence to Algeria. However, Ms Le Pen's call for the retired generals to back her got a frosty reception. \u201cIt is clumsy, to say the least, to launch an electoral touting operation,\u201d responded Gen Fabre-Bernadac, who accused Ms Le Pen of \u201ctotal ignorance of the military world\u201d. Mr Macron has come under a barrage of criticism for his perceived \u201clax\u201d approach to immigration and security in recent days, buoyed by polls suggesting 65 per cent of the French do not think his government has a handle on crime. After last Friday\u2019s Islamist murder, several opposition figures, including Right-wing head of the Paris region Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, this week accused him of failing to concede that there is a link between \u201cimmigration and terrorism\u201d.

The accident occurred on Sunday evening in Normandy where he had a holiday home, according to police sources. In his tribute, President Emmanuel Macron said Dassault, 69, loved France and his death would be \"a great loss\". Dassault was the son of industrialist Serge Dassault, whose group builds Rafale war planes and owns Le Figaro newspaper. He was elected to the National Assembly - France's lower house of parliament - in 2002 and represented the Oise area of northern France. The MP, from the centre-right Republicans, was considered the 361st richest man in the world - worth an estimated \u20ac6.3bn ($7.3bn; \u00a35.2bn) according to Forbes. \"Olivier Dassault loved France. Captain of industry, lawmaker, local elected official, reserve commander in the air force: during his life, he never ceased to serve our country, to value its assets. His sudden death is a great loss,\" Mr Macron said on Twitter. The helicopter carrying Dassault crashed near Deauville at about 18:00 (1700 GMT), sources told AFP news agency. The pilot was also killed, the sources added. No-one else was on board. AFP Police and investigators sealed off the scene of the crash Investigators with France's civil aviation authority said in a tweet that the helicopter, an AS350 \u00c9cureuil, had crashed \"on take-off\" from private land. Dassault was the father of three children. Richard Ferrand, president of the National Assembly, said: \"I am thinking of his family and loved ones who must feel terrible pain.\" Valerie Pecresse, a conservative politician, tweeted: \"Great sadness at the news of the sudden passing of Olivier Dassault. A businessman, but also a renowned photographer, he had a passion for politics in his blood.\" Dassault's grandfather, Marcel Dassault, founded Dassault Aviation which made aircraft propellers in World War One. On Marcel's death in 1986, Serge Dassault appointed Olivier director of civil aircraft strategy at the company. In 2011 he was appointed chairman of the supervisory board of Groupe Dassault. Dassault later stepped down from his role on the board to avoid any conflict of interest in his political career.

REUTERS\/Gustau Nacarino Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren. Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board. One of the plane's black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France's interior minister said. In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation. Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines. \"We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,\" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter. Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard. Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said. Barcelona's Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner's Siegfried at the theater. French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms. Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. \"We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,\" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters. In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: \"A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.\" It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world\u2019s most used passenger jets. It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December. SHARP DESCENT Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes. \"The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,\" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference. Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday. Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky. France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus. \"The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,\" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground. The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in. \u201cThere will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,\u201d an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa\u00a0Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a \"dark day for Lufthansa\". \"My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,\" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there. Family members arrived at Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others\u2019 shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff. In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. \"The families knew each other,\" he told Reuters. \"The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.\" King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened. In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the \"awful tragedy\". Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

Pierre-Marie Bourniquel came under Kalashnikov fire upon entering the housing estate of Castellane, in the north of the Mediterranean port, after locals reported gunshots. Mr Bourniquel was travelling with a police commando and seeking to reach a high point overlooking the estate where Zinedine Zidane, the international French footballer was brought up, when his vehicle came under attack. He had sounded the police siren while approaching the area where armed clashes had reportedly erupted between at least two groups of \u201cbetween five to ten people\u201d in what is thought to be a drug-related dispute. \"It\u2019s a real Western,\" one police unionist told Le Figaro newspaper. Report: #French special units are in a standoff with the Gunman.unclear if there are more then on gunman #Marseille pic.twitter.com\/F7fQif3bH5 \u2014 Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) February 9, 2015 Undaunted, the gunmen trained their fire on the police chief, who had to duck down on the car floor to avoid being hit. The bullets passed within two or three metres of the vehicle, according to Le Figaro. According to police sources cited by AFP, the initial shots were fired \"in the air\" and there are no victims. Witnesses said the gunmen were \"masked\" and were \"dressed in blue, like the police\". The violence comes after a 25-year old man was shot dead in the estate on January 15 in an apparent drug-related killing. A local school and nursery were shut and the estate\u2019s 7,000 residents told to stay indoors. A police helicopter flew overhead. France has been tense since the Paris attacks in January in which Islamist gunmen killed 17 people, but there was no suggestion the Marseille incident had any religious connection. Rather it is though the violence was part of a drug dealing turf war. \u201cThe drugs trade in Marseille \u2013 for cannabis and cocaine \u2013 can bring in 100,000 euros (\u00a375,000) per month just for one housing estate,\u201d a police source told Le Figaro. According to France Info radio, the neighbourhood was calm in the early afternoon. The violence comes as Manuel Valls, the prime minister, was due in the Mediterranean port city on Monday afternoon to laud \u201cexcellent\u201d progress in fighting crime, which has seen dozens of gangland murders and led to one prosecutor dubbing parts of Marseille \u201clike the favelas of Rio\u201d. Several local politicians have called for the army to be sent to the city\u2019s toughest housing estates to tackle gangland violence. Mr Valls was due to announce extra means for local schools.

Ian Langsdon\/European Pressphoto Agency By Dan Bilefsky and Ma\u00efa de la Baume Jan. 7, 2015 PARIS \u2014 The police organized an enormous manhunt across the Paris region on Wednesday for three suspects they said were involved in a brazen and methodical midday slaughter at a satirical newspaper that had lampooned Islam. The terrorist attack by masked gunmen on the newspaper, Charlie Hebdo , left 12 people dead \u2014 including the top editor, prominent cartoonists and police officers \u2014 and was among the deadliest in postwar France. The killers escaped, traumatizing the city and sending shock waves through Europe and beyond. Officials said late Wednesday that two of the suspects were brothers. They were identified as Said and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, 34 and 32 . The third suspect is Hamyd Mourad, 18. News reports said the brothers, known to intelligence services, had been born in Paris, raising the prospect that homegrown Muslim extremists were responsible. Image People gathered to light candles under large mirror panels on the Old Port of Marseille, in southern France. Credit... Anne-Christine Poujoulat\/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Early Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said that Mr. Mourad had walked into a police station in Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, about 145 miles northeast of Paris, and surrendered. \u201cHe introduced himself and was put in custody,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Agn\u00e8s Thibault-Lecuivre. The assault threatened to deepen the distrust of France\u2019s large Muslim population , coming at a time when Islamic radicalism has become a central concern of security officials throughout Europe. In the space of a few minutes, the assault also crystallized the culture clash between religious extremism and the West\u2019s devotion to free expression. Spontaneous rallies expressing support for Charlie Hebdo sprung up later in the day in Paris, throughout Europe and in Union Square in New York.

Exit polls show the conservative UMP in first place, Marine Le Pen's National Front in second, with President Francois Hollande's French Socialist Party in third.","text":"France local elections: Conservatives hold off National Front - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live Close menu BBC News Menu Home Israel-Gaza war War in Ukraine Climate Video World US & Canada UK Business Tech More Science Entertainment & Arts Health In Pictures BBC Verify World News TV Newsbeat World Africa Asia Australia Europe Latin America Middle East France local elections: Conservatives hold off National Front Published 23 March 2015 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, AFP Image caption, Many races in the second round of voting will be between the UMP and the National Front France's centre-right UMP party and its allies have taken first place in the first round of local elections, according to official results from the Interior Ministry. They took 32% of the vote, while the far-right National Front (FN) came second with 25%. President Francois Hollande's governing Socialists came third with 22%. The results mean the second round on 29 March will see a run-off between the UMP and the FN in many constituencies. Voters are electing representatives in 101 departments, or counties, charged with issues like schools and welfare. UMP leader Nicolas Sarkozy said the outcome of the first round demonstrated \"the French people's profound desire for change\". \"The conditions for a massive swing back to the right and the centre are in place,\" he added. Mr Sarkozy also ruled out any \"local or national\" deals with the FN in constituencies where one of the two parties is involved in run-offs with the Socialists. In the past, voters for rival parties have rallied against the far-right group in the second round of voting. Image source, AFP Image caption, Mr Hollande, pictured here leaving a polling booth, has seen support for his Socialists fading Image source, AFP Image caption, Ms Le Pen, who cast her ballot in Henin-Beaumont in northern France, is expected to run for president Analysis: Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris It's another big vote for the French far right, following the municipal and European elections last year. In this first round of departmental or county council elections, nationwide 24.5% of voters chose the National Front, according to one poll. It is a figure that shows yet again how Marine Le Pen's strategy of building a system of local organisation and shutting down the party's overtly racist elements is paying off. However, opinion polls had suggested the far-right could have done better - even emerging as the most popular party in the election. That didn't happen, which has given some cheer to the mainstream opposition here, led by former President Nicolas Sarkozy. The poor results for the Socialists follows on from their defeats in municipal and EU elections last year. However, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the party had \"resisted better than expected\". Some polls had indicated that Marine Le Pen's FN could come top in the first round. She had been hoping the elections would build momentum ahead of her expected bid for the presidency in 2017. However, Ms Le Pen, insisted the result was a \"very big success\" for her party, exceeding its performance in the European Parliament elections. In the Var department, in the south-east corner of France, the FN got more than 30% in all constituencies, according to LCI TV. And in Nord department, near the Belgian border in the north-east, the FN will fight the second round in 37 constituencies out of 41. For the first time in these elections, voters are not choosing single candidates - but pairs of candidates - one man and one woman - in order to enforce strict gender equality in local politics.

In a statement on their website, French national police ask for information on the whereabouts of suspects Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi, warning that both could be armed and dangerous. Police released photos of the two men, who Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman told CNN are brothers in their 30s. Cherif Kouachi, left, and Said Kouachi, right, are suspects in the Paris attack. passport photos Police found an ID document of Said Kouachi at the scene of the shooting, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. \u201cIt was their only mistake,\u201d said Dominique Rizet, BFMTV\u2019s police and justice consultant, reporting that the discovery helped the investigation. Citing sources, the Agence France Presse news agency reported that an 18-year-old suspect in the attack had surrendered to police. CNN has not independently confirmed whether the suspect has surrendered. Police fanned out across France in an intense manhunt for the suspects, who were masked and dressed in black when they burst into the satirical magazine\u2019s office Wednesday, killing 12 people. A tactical unit was deployed in an operation about a 144 kilometers (about 90 miles) from Paris in Reims, France, following the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Authorities haven\u2019t revealed details about the target of the operation, but speculation surged in French media that investigators could be closing in on the suspects. French authorities vowed to step up security and apprehend those responsible. \u201cEverything will be done to arrest (the attackers),\u201d French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night. \u201c\u2026 We also have to protect all public places. Security forces will be deployed everywhere there can be the beginning\u201d of a threat.

That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement. U.S. counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups, including ISIS and al Qaeda, that might be responsible for the attack. Charlie Hebdo has been singled out as a target for Islamist extremists in al Qaeda\u2019s publication, Inspire. Police impounded a black Citroen in northeastern Paris similar to the one purportedly used by the attackers as a getaway car. Video from CNN affiliate BFMTV shows the vehicle being towed from Porte de Pantin, in Paris\u2019 19th district. Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN. The same source said that French authorities are searching all travel records from the past 17 days to see whether any of the attackers entered the European nation over the holidays. This includes checks at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as whatever limited information is available from train stations. Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said. He asked for a moment of reflection Thursday and said flags will be at half-staff for three days. Satirical magazine has drawn anger Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects, including Christianity. But what it\u2019s done on Islam has gotten the most attention and garnered the most vitriol. Its last tweet before Wednesday\u2019s attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The magazine has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world . sot charlie hedbo cartoon editor terror attack paris_00001316.jpg BFM video Related video Killed cartoon editor in 2012: 'Disarm them with humor' Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine\u2019s office three years ago.

Accept Manage my choices Gerard Julien, AFP I Qatar will purchase 24 French Rafale fighter jets, the French presidency announced on April 30, 2015 (file photo) Tensions in the Middle East with conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Libya, as well as fears of Iran's growing influence in the area, have fuelled a desire across Sunni Gulf Arab states to modernise their military hardware. The contract, the third this year for Dassault  after deals to sell fighter jets to Egypt and India, also includes MBDA missiles, and the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French army, a French Defence Ministry official said. \"The president spoke to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, who confirmed his desire to buy 24 Rafale combat planes,\" President Francois Hollande's office said in a statement. Hollande will travel to Doha on May 4 to sign the contract before heading to Saudi Arabia as an honorary guest at a summit of Gulf Arab leaders. The Rafale sales have lifted French arms exports this year to about 15 billion euros and have been a welcome boost for Dassault, which had been under increasing pressure to sell the plane overseas after years of failures. Dassault shares were up 2.1 percent at 0912 GMT. The French government said last year that it would slow the pace at which it takes delivery of Rafale jets to just 26 over the next five years instead of 11 every year.

Labelled a \u201closer\u201d by French officials, Le Guen is the first person tried under an anti-terrorism law passed in 2012. Issued on: 04\/05\/2015 - 15:02 Modified: 04\/05\/2015 - 18:04 By: Joseph BAMAT Follow Video screen grab The two-day trial of Le Guen, aka Abden Jelil, will offer insight into the unusual life of a French expat and into leaders\u2019 pressing concern over the radicalisation of French nationals. Le Guen faces charges of criminal association in relation with a terrorist group, and could spend 10 years behind bars if found guilty. While accused of collaborating with Al Qaeda\u2019s north-African branch, some observers say he led a largely reclusive and innocuous life in northern Mali before the desert region was overrun by a motley crew of Islamist and separatist rebels in 2012. A French commando captured Le Guen in a night-time operation near Timbuktu on April 28, 2013, four months into France\u2019s military intervention to retake the control of the West African country. He was transferred to Paris two weeks later, where he has been awaiting trial ever since. \u2018Lost in life\u2019 France has been gripped with the fear of young, sometimes bright Frenchmen travelling to the Middle East to join the Islamic State group and other jihadist movements. But Le Guen\u2019s case does not fit neatly into the troubling trend. Defense Minister Jean-Yves le Drian and Prime Minister Manuel Valls have on separate occasions referred to him as \u201cpaum\u00e9\u201d a derisive term to describe someone who is a loser and lost in life. Born in 1955 in the western city of Nantes, Le Guen worked with France\u2019s merchant marines in his 20s. Eventually he converted to Islam, although his adoption of radical views reportedly came later. He eventually settled in Morocco, then Mauritania and then Mali in the late 2000s, where he lived with his Moroccan wife and five children at the time of his capture by French special forces. French officials say he first showed on foreign intelligence radars in September 2012, appearing in a photo taken at a meeting of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI). At the time, extremist militias had claimed control of around half of Mali and were advancing on the capital of Bamako. Le Guen had his first big moment in the spotlight when he appeared in a video published on the Mauritanian news website Sahara Media in October 2012. Dressed in a khaki-coloured tunic and black turban \u2013 the black AQMI banner serving as the backdrop, a Kalashnikov as a prop \u2013 he warned Western powers from meddling in Mali. He would be plucked out of the Malian desert five months later. Test case Some French media have reported that Le Guen escapes easy categorisation. He is said to have been imprisoned in Timbuktu in November 2012 by AQMI leaders who suspected him of being a spy. Other sources say he was temporarily detained because he defended a group of women who were being mistreated by militants. \u201cHe was not at all in combat mode when French forces intercepted him,\u201d FRANCE 24 journalist Serge Daniel reported shortly after his capture by French soldiers in 2013. \u201cHe was not a jihadist on the frontline, he was just a man who was tired. More like a fugitive.\u201d Le Guen\u2019s court case, which will end on Tuesday, is the first to test a law approved in 2012 that allows French prosecutors to go after citizens who are suspected of participating in terrorist acts on foreign soil, or who have left the country to receive terrorist training. Since then, and in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks in January, France has passed a slew of laws aimed at combating Jihadism at home and abroad, with MPs set to approve a bill giving French spies sweeping surveillance powers on Tuesday. In March, French authorities estimated that around 3,000 nationals had left the country to wage jihad abroad.

{"year":"2015","month":"01","event_desc":"A hostage situation occurs at a Jewish market, Hypercacher, in the eastern Paris suburb of Vincennes. There are two suspected hostage takers, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, and Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who were previously suspected of shooting a policewoman dead earlier in the week. There were at least sixteen hostages. The standoff ends with Coulibaly dead as well as four hostages. Four additional hostages and two police officers require hospitalization. Boumeddiene remains at large.","text":"Featured Shows\nMSNBC TV\nMore\nFollow msnbc\nMore Brands\nMore Shows\nFour hostages were found dead inside a kosher supermarket in Paris after police stormed the store, killing the gunman who was armed with an AK-47. The assault ended the third\u00a0deadly attack in a 54-hour string of terror that seized the city beginning on Wednesday.\u00a0\nOther hostages in the grocery store attack were freed and the gunman was identified as\u00a0Amedy Coulibaly, a known associate of\u00a0Ch\u00e9rif\u00a0and S\u00e4id\u00a0Kouachi. One officer was severely hurt during the assault, three other officers and two civilians were also injured in the assault, French prosecutor\u00a0Francois Molins said Friday.\nThe Kouachis, suspects in the shooting that took place at the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo earlier in the week, were killed by police on Friday after being holed up in a printing shop with one hostage, who was safely freed. Officials continued to search for one woman,\u00a0Hayat Boumedienne, the companion of Coulibaly.\nThe simultaneous raids end a string of attacks -- thought to be related -- that have gripped France since the Kouachis allegedly gunned down eight journalists and four others at the Charlie Hebdo in Paris.\u00a03\nAs night fell on the French capital and the threat appeared to have been neutralized, the city sought to assess the damage and begin the recovery process.\u00a0On the Arc de Triomphe, a sign at the top read \"Paris est Charlie\" -- or Paris is Charlie.\u00a0\nPresident\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois Hollande delivered a live address Friday confirming the deaths, bringing the death toll of innocent Parisians to at least 17. France's Interior Minister\u00a0Bernard Cazaneuve confirmed on television that four police officers were injured at the supermarket, as well.\nHollande called the Paris supermarket attack an \"atrocious anti-Semitic\" act and urged the French to be united.\u00a0\u201cI assure you that we will come out stronger out of this challenge,\u201d Hollande said. \u201cVive la France.\u201d\nObama said Friday in Knoxville, Tennessee, that the U.S. is \u201chopeful that the immediate threat is now resolved\u201d in Paris. \u201cBut the French government continues to face the threat of terrorism and has to stay vigilant. The situation is fluid.\u201d\nOn Thursday, as France mourned its dead and police undertook a manhunt for the brothers, a police officer was killed and a street sweeper wounded in the southern end of the city in what later was determined to be the second attack. Two suspects -- Coulibaly, 32, and Boumedienne, 26 -- are wanted for that shooting.\nCoulibaly and Ch\u00e9rif\u00a0Kouachi had known each other for at least four years; they were charged together in 2010 with a plot to free a terrorist from prison, after he had been convicted of blowing up a French train facility.\u00a0Officials are still seeking Boumedienne. She has not yet been linked to the supermarket hostage situation, though police had originally said they were looking for two suspects -- one man and one woman.\nThe stunning violence that struck Paris on Wednesday was seen as an attack on freedom of speech. By Friday, Jewish targets appeared to be the focus. Thursday's shooting occurred across the street from a Jewish school while Friday's hostage situation was taking place at a kosher store in a heavily Jewish neighborhood as residents prepared for the Sabbath. Authorities cordoned off the Marais, city's historic Jewish center, which had also been the site of the Goldenberg deli terrorist attack in 1982.\u00a0Nearly 100,000 security personnel were on alert across France by Friday.\nStand-off in northern Paris: Printing shop\nAfter a three-day manhunt that crisscrossed a 140-mile range around Paris, police spotted the Kouachi brothers Friday in Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble, a bedroom community just five miles from the city's international airport. According to officials in the town, there was an exchange of gunfire before the brothers fled into a family-owned printing shop where they held one man hostage.\nThe brothers, French citizens who were both in their 30s,\u00a0were \"armed and dangerous,\" according to police. Sources told NBC News the suspects told police at the printing shop that they wanted to die as martyrs.\u00a0Authorities believe one, if not both of the Kouachi brothers had military training. S\u00e4id\u00a0Kouachi, 34, traveled to Yemen in 2011 to be\u00a0trained by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula\u00a0(AQAP), two senior U.S. counterterrorism officials told NBC News. AQAP is considered\u00a0the most violent branch of al Qaida. Molins said on Friday that he had been question in the past, but never charged with a crime.\nCh\u00e9rif\u00a0Kouachi, 32, was\u00a0sentenced to prison in 2008\u00a0after a Paris court found him and six other men guilty of helping funnel fighters to Iraq. A Homeland Security official told NBC News that the brothers have been on the U.S. no-fly list \u201cfor years.\u201d\nDuring the stand-off,\u00a0Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble\u00a0was completely sealed off, with military-manned checkpoints; helicopters circled overhead while hundreds of heavily armed anti-terror and military personnel surround the town.\nOn Friday, France\u2019s interior minister Cazeneuve, confirmed the major police operation was underway near the airport in Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble. Helicopters were circling the town as a cold drizzle fell.\n\u201cWe have signs of the presence of the terrorists, whom we want to stop,\u201d Cazeneuve told reporters in Paris.\n\u201cAn operation is underway right now in Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble, which is mobilizing all services in the area,\u201d Cazeneuve said. After a series of meetings early Friday, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande called the attack on the newspaper \u201cthe worst of the past 50 years.\u201d He said the nation remained \u201cshocked, considering that the perpetrators of these acts have not yet been arrested, and I am speaking before you as operations are ongoing.\u201d\nIn\u00a0Dammartin-en-Goele, residents and witnesses said the industrial town felt like it was under\u00a0siege.\u00a0\nThe nearby Charles de Gaulle School had been locked down, student Marion Genay told NBC News via Twitter.\n\u201cDammartin is surrounded by the [armed police],\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a very tense atmosphere, being locked in the high school.\u201d\nStand-off in eastern Paris: Kosher supermarket\nFour people, including the alleged gunman, were killed Friday after the shooter seized a kosher supermarket in Paris and held people captive inside, Hollande said.\u00a0At least five hostages were freed after dozens of heavily armed French police officers stormed the store, Hyper Cacher.\u00a0\nThe alleged gunman, Coulibaly,\u00a0was killed in the raid.\u00a0Le Monde\u00a0reported Boumedienne, 26, who remains at large, has been identified as a companion of Coulibaly, and is also a suspect in the Thursday killing.\u00a0\nIt was unclear how many shoppers were held inside Hyper Cacher, though the supermarket siege took place during a busy period when Jewish shoppers were preparing for the Sabbath.\u00a0Coulibaly is\u00a0believed to have carried an AK-47 with him.\nOfficers were dressed in full riot gear with rifles, sidearms, and shields outside of the supermarket. Rows of police vehicles were parked behind the store, and ambulances were on scene. Authorities\u00a0ordered all shops to be closed in the area around the supermarket.\nFrom Tel Aviv, Israel,\u00a0Kelly Peretz told msnbc\u2019s Jose Diaz-Balart\u00a0that her niece and her niece\u2019s 6-month-old baby were among the hostages inside the supermarket. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to hear something or see something,\u201d she said.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C.","question":"Who were the two main suspects linked to the Paris attacks in January 2015, including the Hypercacher hostage situation?","answer":"Amedy Coulibaly and Hayat Boumeddiene were the main suspects, with Coulibaly killed during the raid and Boumeddiene remaining at large.","region":"France","question_translated":"Qui \u00e9taient les deux principaux suspects li\u00e9s aux attentats de Paris en janvier 2015, y compris la prise d'otages de l'Hypercacher ?","answer_translated":"Amedy Coulibaly et Hayat Boumeddiene \u00e9taient les principaux suspects, Coulibaly ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 lors de l'assaut et Boumeddiene \u00e9tant toujours en fuite.","model_answer":"Answer: Les deux principaux suspects li\u00e9s aux attentats de Paris en janvier 2015 \u00e9taient Ch\u00e9rif et Sa\u00efd Kouachi, responsables des attentats contre Charlie Hebdo, ainsi que Amedy Coulibaly, qui a commis la prise d'otages de l'Hypercacher.

Issued on: 07\/05\/2015 - 16:30 By: NEWS WIRES AFP archive \"The little girl spent seven and a half hours in water that was 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit)\" before she and her father were recovered by a Spanish hospital ship, Portuguese navy spokesman Commander Paulo Vicente told AFP. The girl's mother and nine-year-old brother had managed to climb onto a lifeboat after their vessel capsized, and were rescued during the night. All the little girl and her father had to keep them afloat were life jackets, and rescue only came after a Portuguese air force plane spotted them in the water. The family's boat sank about 550 nautical miles (1,000 kilometres) to the southwest of the Portuguese islands.

Sid Ahmed Ghlam, a 24-year-old Algerian national, was detained on Sunday in Paris after he apparently shot himself by accident and called an ambulance. He is also being questioned over the murder of a woman on Sunday. France has stepped up security in the wake of recent attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and a Jewish supermarket. Ghlam was known to security services as having expressed a wish to travel to Syria to fight with Islamist militants, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. When police arrived at the scene on Sunday, they followed a trail of blood to the suspect's car, where they found weapons and notes on potential targets. Image source, AFP Image caption, Police are questioning the suspect in connection with the murder of Aurelie Chatelain Image source, AFP Image caption, They are searching a neighbourhood in Saint-Dizier, north-eastern France, where Ghlam spent time with his family The documents established \"beyond doubt\" that Ghlam planned on attacking churches, said Mr Cazeneuve. \"Several war weapons, hand guns, ammunition [and] bullet-proof vests,\" were found in his car and home, the minister added. Documents linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State were also found at his apartment, the Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. A contact in Syria had advised Ghlam to target churches, he added. The authorities have carried out security checks on the suspect twice in recent years but did not uncover anything to justify further investigation. Victim It is not known yet what link the man has to the murdered woman, Aurelie Chatelain, who was found dead in her car in Villejuif, a Paris suburb, on Sunday. Passers-by discovered her body as smoke poured out of the car from an overheating laptop. The 32-year-old was visiting the Paris area to attend a training course. \"Our thoughts and sorrow are with her relatives, her family, and her daughter now deprived of her presence.\" said Mr Cazeneuve.

{"year":"2015","month":"07","event_desc":"The 2015 Tour de France concludes in Paris, and is won by Chris Froome of Team Sky, the first British rider to win the Tour twice.","text":"Greipel wins final stage into Paris\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Greipel (Lotto Soudal) secured his fourth stage win of this year\u2019s Tour de France with a comprehensive sprint win in Paris on Sunday. The German edged out Bryan Coquard (Europcar) and Alexander Kristoff (Katusha) on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in a thrilling finale to this year\u2019s race.\nKristoff led with 200 metres to go having been delivered through the final corner by his team. However, the Norwegian ran out of gas with Greipel timing his sprint perfectly from a fast-finishing Coquard. Mark Cavendish (Etixx-QuickStep), who has won on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es several times, could not find his way through the crowd.\nFurther back in the peloton, Chris Froome crossed the line arm in arm with his Team Sky teammates and celebrated his second Tour de France title in three years.\nPeter Sagan (Tinkoff-Saxo) finished seventh on the stage, one place behind Cavendish, but safely came over the line to claim his fourth Green Jersey in a row. There was further celebrations for Froome, who picked up the King of the Mountains jersey, becoming the first man since Eddy Merckx to claim both yellow and polka-dot in a single Tour.\nNairo Quintana (Movistar) rode into Paris to secure his second place and his second white jersey in three seasons. There was still time for French celebrations with Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale) winning the combativity prize, while Movistar ran away with the teams\u2019 prize courtesy of their second place with Quintana and third with Alejandro Valverde.\nThe stage, though, belonged to Greipel who has established himself as the prominent sprinter thanks to his four stage wins this year. The German has not just been the fastest but also the smartest, most complete sprinter in the race, displaying a number of qualities throughout the last three weeks. Today marked his first stage win in Paris and it was a significant victory for a rider who has spent the last few seasons in the shadows of Cavendish and Marcel Kittel (Giant-Alpecin).\nThe German had to fight for his win, though, with Cavendish looking for a much needed win, and a gaggle of other sprinters still waiting to open their accounts in this year's race. Coquard exemplified this, the young Frenchman unable to match the best in this race but desperately hoping to win for his team, that are struggling to find a sponsor for next year.\nKristoff, who had a phenomenal spring campaign, has not been able to find his winning touch and he again hit the front too soon today, allowing for Greipel to ghost around his rivals on the outside before opening up for the line. However, this win also belonged to Lotto Soudal, that set the pace when the race entered Paris under grey, wet skies.\nIt was veteran rider Sylvain Chavanel - possibly riding his final Tour \u2013 who opened up the attacks as the peloton reached the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The race was neutralized at that point, due to the conditions, with Froome safe in the knowledge that the Tour was secure.\nWhen Chavanel was caught with 42km remaining a three-man group moved clear but it was Lotto Soudal that held them at 30 seconds, and even when the front of the peloton was engulfed with lead-out trains Lotto Soudal kept their composure. All Greipel had to do was finish the job.\nFull Results\nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\nSuperprestige Niel: Laurens Sweeck wins Monday mudfest\nSuperprestige Niel: Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado dominates from start to finish\nVolta a la Valenciana 'up in the air' after floods destroy infrastructure\nCyclingnews is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Issued on: 07\/05\/2015 - 09:59 Modified: 07\/05\/2015 - 11:08 By: FRANCE 24 Follow FRANCE 24 Emmanuel Dunand, AFP | Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy Sarkozy , now head of the opposition UMP , is accused of discussing the idea of giving a magistrate a lucrative job in exchange for inside information on another corruption investigation related to his campaign financing. The ruling is another blow to Sarkozy, who returned to frontline politics last year ahead of an expected run for the presidency in 2017. \"Contrary to our legitimate hopes, the court has not upheld our calls for dismissal (of these recordings),\" said Paul-Albert Iweins, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, adding that he planned to appeal the decision. Investigators first bugged Sarkozy's phones over allegations that he accepted illicit payments from L'Or\u00e9al heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign, much of it in cash-filled envelopes. He was cleared in 2013 of taking advantage of the elderly woman while she was too frail to understand what she was doing. But during the investigation, fresh allegations surfaced that he had discussed the possibility of giving a magistrate from a top appeals court, Gilbert Azibert, a juicy job in Monaco in return for information on the Bettencourt case. Sarkozy was put under formal investigation in July for corruption, influence peddling and violation of legal secrecy over the case. Azibert never got the posting in Monaco but has also been charged along with Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog. The former president's legal team has attempted to suppress the recordings, saying they were a breach of lawyer-client privacy rules. The crimes Sarkozy is accused of carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison but legal experts say a custodial sentence is unlikely even in the event of a conviction. The investigation is one of several cases threatening to derail Sarkozy\u2019s recent political comeback . Just last month, he was named as an \u201c assisting witness \u201d in connection with an inquiry into fines paid by the UMP after he exceeded legal spending limits during his failed 2012 presidential campaign.

The abuse reportedly took place at a centre for displaced people near the airport of the Central African capital Bangui between December 2013 -- when the French operation began -- and June 2014. The announcement came a day after the Central African Republic government said it would launch its own legal action against the French soldiers. \"We regret the fact we were not brought into these investigations despite the cooperation agreements we have with France,\" said Justice Minister Aristide Sokambi. Devastating sex scandal France's defence ministry has said it immediately launched a probe into the rape allegations when they were first received in July, sending police investigators to the former French colony on August 1. But the damning allegations only became public after The Guardian newspaper broke the story last month. The allegations were first collated in an internal United Nations report and only reached French authorities when it was leaked by a senior UN official. Both the French government and UN have denied trying to cover up the potentially devastating scandal, but the UN official was suspended from his job over the leak. If proven, the allegations will not only affect the French army but also the Central African Republic, which is trying to find a way out of a conflict that has killed thousands and displaced nearly 900,000 people.

REUTERS\/Emmanuel Foudrot Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS (Reuters) - The suspected Islamist who attempted to blow up a French chemical plant on Friday has admitted killing his manager beforehand, a source close to the investigation said on Sunday, as police linked the suspect to a militant now in Syria. Yassin Salhi, 35, told detectives he had killed Herv\u00e9 Cornara in a parking area before arriving at the plant in Saint Quentin-Fallavier, 30 km (20 miles) south of Lyon, where he tried in vain to cause a major explosion. Police found the 54-year-old victim's decapitated body and head, framed by Islamic inscriptions, at the plant, which is owned by the U.S. firm Air Products. There were no other casualties. Examination of one of Salhi's mobile phones revealed that he had taken a picture of himself with the severed head before his arrest and sent the image to a Canadian phone number. Canadian authorities said on Sunday they were assisting the investigation. The phone number belongs to a French national, known by his first name Sebastien-Younes, who has been in Syria since last year, the same source said, confirming media reports. His last known location was the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa. According to other French media reports, Salhi told police he had argued with Cornara and with his own wife before the killing. One of their work colleagues, quoted on the website of the television station i-Tele, also said the two men had clashed days earlier after Salhi dropped a pallet of fragile equipment. The suspect, whose wife and sister were released on Sunday after two days of questioning, is said by French security services to have associated with hardline Islamists over more than a decade, and had previously been flagged by them as a potential risk. Flanked by heavily armed police in masks and flak jackets, Salhi was taken on Sunday to the car park where he said he had killed Cornara, before retracing the route he had followed to the chemical plant. He was then escorted to the apartment he shared with his wife and three children in the quiet Lyon suburb of Saint-Priest, where further searches were carried out. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the government was increasing resources in law enforcement and domestic intelligence to combat Islamic extremism. \"We cannot lose this war, because it is essentially a war of civilization,\" Valls said in an interview broadcast on Europe 1 radio and i-Tele. \"It is our society, our civilization and our values that we must defend.\" Reporting by Gregory Blachier, Writing by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Ralph Boulton and Kevin Liffey Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Ukraine attacks Moscow with 34 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital 10:06 AM UTC ANALYSIS Kamala Harris' Michigan loss highlights Democrats' weak spots 11:56 AM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago Middle East category Dozens killed and wounded in Israeli strike on northern Gaza's Jabalia, medics say 10:51 AM UTC United States category Republicans on brink of clinching US House control after taking Senate 7:31 AM UTC World Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 turns back to Rome after engine fire World category \u00b7 November 10, 2024 \u00b7 12:26 PM UTC \u00b7  ago The right engine of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner operated by Chinese carrier Hainan Airlines caught fire shortly after take-off from Rome's Fiumicino airport this morning, an Italian airport official said.

The Swiss eighth seed played magnificently in a 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-4 victory at Roland Garros. Wawrinka, 30, brought an end to Djokovic's 28-match winning streak as he claimed his second Grand Slam title. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Shorts won French Open - Wawrinka Djokovic had been hoping to become the eighth man to complete the set of all four major titles. But the Serb will have to wait at least another 12 months before attempting to match the full set of major titles collected by Andre Agassi, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Roger Federer, Rod Laver, Rafael Nadal and Fred Perry. The 28-year-old had been a strong favourite to finally get his hands on the Coupe des Mousquetaires after beating nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and third seed Andy Murray, but he was outplayed by Wawrinka. \"It was an incredible atmosphere on court and I felt emotion like I never have before,\" said Wawrinka. Analysis, BBC Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller \"Stan Wawrinka knew he would have to produce his very finest tennis for at least three sets, and he did just that - in only his second experience of a Grand Slam final. \"The backhand down the line winner to seal the decisive break in the fourth set was the most breathtaking of all, but only one example of the array of glorious attacking shots that made even Djokovic look flustered. \"The world number one played well enough to have beaten almost anyone, but for 3 hours and 12 minutes, Wawrinka didn't play like just anyone.\" \"I would like to thank my coach Magnus Norman. You played in the final without winning but this victory is yours as well as mine.\" Djokovic was effusive in his praise for the new champion: \"There are things that are more important in life than victories and that is character and respect - Stan you are a great champion with big heart.\" Their last four matches in Grand Slams had gone to five sets and this was every bit as good in terms of quality, with Wawrinka hitting 60 winners as his aggression broke down the seemingly invincible Djokovic defence. The victory makes him only the second Swiss to win at Roland Garros after Roger Federer, the man he beat in the quarter-finals. Having lost the first set of the final following a poor service game at 3-3, Wawrinka came storming back with a barrage of winners that left Djokovic looking lost for a response. Four break points came and went in the second set before the fifth arrived in the shape of a set point, and Wawrinka finally converted to level the match. Image source, @schulerst Image caption, 2009 champion and Wawrinka's countryman Roger Federer watched the match on his mobile while at a Basle football match (left) before tweeting his congratulations (right) It was merely a sign of things to come as the eighth seed tore into the Djokovic serve in the third, and despite seeing off three break points for 1-1, there was little the top seed could do four games later. A brilliant forehand winner was followed by an equally breathtaking backhand to earn three break points, and the first was converted as Wawrinka moved forward and hammered a short ball. The crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier roared as the Swiss hit an outrageous winner around the net post on his way to securing the set. Djokovic was now facing a third French Open final defeat and he dug in, taking advantage of a lull at the opposite end of the court to fashion a 3-0 lead in the fourth. The match was now on Wawrinka's racquet, however, and he came storming back to level at 3-3 after some brilliant defence earned him the break. Djokovic called on everything he had to stay in touch, finding two volleys - the second a lunging effort reminiscent of his coach Boris Becker - to save break points with the score level in the set. Match stats Djokovic Wawrinka 6 Aces 9 65 First serve % 67 0 Double faults 3 63 % pts won on first serve 76 53 % pts won on second serve 50 30 Winners 59 41 Unforced errors 45 2\/10 Break points\/converted 4\/15 Moments later it looked as though Djokovic would force the fifth set that had seemed inevitable as he moved 0-40 up, but there was another burst of brilliance to come from Wawrinka. A volley, a backhand and a serve got him out of trouble, and he rode the wave of five successive points into the next game as two screaming backhand passes at 4-4 gave him the chance to serve out for the title. It was never likely to be easy and, after a possible ace was overruled by the umpire on his first match point, the Swiss had to face a break point as Djokovic clung on to his career Slam hopes. The Serb could only send a forehand wide under pressure, and given a second opportunity to take the championship, Wawrinka steered another of those trademark backhands down the line and raised his arms in triumph.

Eighty people were reported killed after gunmen burst into the Bataclan concert hall and took hostages before security forces stormed the hall. People were shot dead at restaurants and bars at five other sites in Paris. At least 180 people were injured. These are the deadliest attacks in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings . French President Francois Hollande, visibly shaken, called Friday night's almost simultaneous attacks \"a horror\" and vowed to wage a \"merciless\" fight against terrorism. Paris saw three days of attacks in early January, when Islamist gunmen murdered 18 people after attacking satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a Jewish supermarket and a policewoman on patrol. Live: Follow the latest developments here In pictures: Paris shootings Eyewitness accounts from the scene The attack on the 1,500-seat Bataclan hall was by far the deadliest of Friday night's attacks. Gunmen opened fire on concert-goers watching US rock group Eagles of Death Metal. The event had been sold out. \"At first we thought it was part of the show but we quickly understood,\" Pierre Janaszak, a radio presenter, told Agence France Presse. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaking outside the Bataclan concert hall President Hollande said the attacks were \"an abomination and a barbaric act\" \"They didn't stop firing. There was blood everywhere, corpses everywhere. We heard screaming. Everyone was trying to flee.\" He said the gunmen took 20 hostages, and he heard one of them tell their captives: \"It's the fault of Hollande, it's the fault of your president, he should not have intervened in Syria\". Within an hour, security forces had stormed the concert hall and all four attackers there were dead. Three had blown themselves up and a fourth was shot dead by police. Attack sites: La Belle Equipe ,  92 rue de Charonne, 11th district - at least 19 dead in gun attacks Le Carillon bar and Le Petit Cambodge restaurant at rue Alibert, 10th district - at least 12 dead in gun attacks La Casa Nostra restaurant , 92 rue de la Fontaine au Roi, 11th district - at least 5 dead in gun attacks Stade de France , St Denis, just north of Paris - explosions heard outside venue, three attackers dead Bataclan concert venue, 50 boulevard Voltaire, 11th district - stormed by several gunmen, at least 80 dead Image caption The attacks took place at six sites across Paris, mainly in the centre of the city What we know #Paris: Power, horror, and lies Meanwhile, not far from the Place de la Republique and the Place de la Bastille, three busy restaurants and a bar were targeted by gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs. Around 40 people were killed as customers were singled out at venues including a pizza restaurant and a Cambodian restaurant, Le Petit Cambodge. \"We heard the sound of guns, 30-second bursts. It was endless. We thought it was fireworks,\" Pierre Montfort, a resident living close to Le Petit Cambodge said. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amateur footage captured the panic at the Stade de France in Paris, following a reported suicide blast The other target was the Stade de France, on the northern fringe of Paris, where President Hollande and 80,000 other spectators were watching a friendly international between France and Germany, with a TV audience of millions more. The president was whisked to safety after the first of at least two explosions just outside the venue to convene an emergency cabinet meeting. Three attackers were reportedly killed there. As the extent of the bloodshed became clear, Mr Hollande went on national TV to announce a state of emergency for the first time in France since 2005. The decree enables the authorities to close public places and impose curfews and restrictions on the movement of traffic and people. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Eyewitness Ben Grant: \"There were a lot of dead people... it was horrific\" Paris residents have been asked to stay indoors and about 1,500 military personnel are being deployed across the city. All schools, museums, libraries, gyms, swimming pools and markets will be shut on Saturday as well as Disneyland Paris. All sporting fixtures in the affected area of Paris have also been cancelled, AFP reports. Police believe all of the gunmen are dead - seven killed themselves with explosives vests and one was shot dead by the security forces - but it is unclear if any accomplices are still on the run. US President Barack Obama spoke of \"an outrageous attempt to terrorise innocent civilians\". UK PM David Cameron said he was shocked and pledged to do \"whatever we can to help\". The Vatican called it \"an attack on peace for all humanity\" and said \"a decisive, supportive response\" was needed \"on the part of all of us as we counter the spread of homicidal hatred in all its forms\". Image copyright AP Image caption Spectators flooded the pitch of the Stade de France after the France v Germany football match as news of the attacks spread Image copyright AFP Image caption Rescuers evacuate people following one of the attacks Image copyright Reuters Image caption Witnesses have been speaking of \"carnage\" Analysis: BBC's Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas It's just 10 months since Paris was the scene of multiple terrorist attacks, first the massacre of staff at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and then a hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket. What happened in Paris on Friday night is exactly what Europe's security services have long feared, and tried to foil. Simultaneous, rolling attacks, with automatic weapons and suicide bombers in the heart of a major European city, targeting multiple, crowded public locations. The tactics have been used before, in Mumbai and elsewhere. But how they've come to Europe is one of many questions that will have to be answered. Were the attackers French citizens? If so, how they were radicalised, armed and organised - was it in France, in Syria, and by whom? Why weren't they detected? Is France, after two major attacks this year, uniquely vulnerable or does the carnage in Paris mean all of Europe faces new threats to our public places and events? And if a Syrian link is proven, will France recoil from that conflict or will it redouble its commitment to the fight against radical groups there?

Officials say a small group of protesters also tried to burn copies of the Koran in the capital, Ajaccio. Overall, several hundred people gathered in the city to express support for two firefighters and a police officer injured on Thursday. The government condemned both acts, pledging to punish the perpetrators. 'Unacceptable desecration' On Friday, the crowd gathered in front of the prefecture in Ajaccio to show their solidarity with the firefighters. Some protesters later marched to the scene of the attack on Thursday night - a poor neighbourhood in the capital. They chanted \"Arabs get out!\" and \"This is our home!\", AFP news agency reports. The demonstrators then attacked the local Muslim prayer room, ransacking it and partially burning books - including copies of the Koran. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the attack was \"an unacceptable desecration\". The French Council of the Muslim Faith also denounced the violence. In Thursday's incident, the firefighters were ambushed by \"several hooded youths\", French media report. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve pledged that the perpetrators of both the attack on the emergency services and the Muslim prayer hall would be identified and arrested. Mr Cazeneuve also stressed that there was no place for \"racism and xenophobia\" in France. France has beefed up security measures for the Christmas holidays, following the 13 November attacks in Paris by Islamic militants that left 130 people dead.

I was born in France, I am a French MP,\" he added.\nA member of Macron's entourage said the president was \"hurt\" by the \"intolerable\" comments, while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne urged the assembly to sanction the far-right MP, adding that \"racism has no place in our democracy\".\nThe far-right leader of RN, Marine Le Pen, backed her MP on Twitter by saying, \"the controversy created by our political opponents is obvious and will not fool the French people\".\nLe Pen challenged Macron in this year's presidential vote and then led her party to its best-ever performance in subsequent legislative elections, with 89 MPs.\nThe far-right party was founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, but his daughter claims to have overhauled the former National Front into a mainstream force, despite critics who say the changes are only cosmetic.\nDe Fournas later defended his comment, telling BFM television that the National Rally wants a halt to all illegal immigration after a surge in the number of people trying to reach France from Africa in recent years.\nHe accused France Unbowed opponents of \"manipulation\", and his party also denied any personal attack against Bilongo, a teacher of Congolese heritage who was born in Paris.\nDe Fournas later apologised to Bilongo for \"the misunderstanding my comments caused,\" and in case Bilongo was hurt by them.\nJordan Bardella\u00a0\u2014 a favourite to take over officially from Le Pen at this weekend's RN congress\u00a0\u2014 insisted the MP had meant the return of boats to African ports and accused LFI and the government of \"extreme dishonesty\".\nLFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon tweeted that the comments were \"beyond intolerable\" and that the deputy should be kicked out of the National Assembly.\nA parliamentary committee will meet Friday to discuss the incident, which could see de Fournas punished with a temporary exclusion from the Assembly.\nMacron's centrist Renaissance party will refuse to attend further sessions unless the council issues a \"heavy penalty\", its vice-president in parliament Sylvain Maillard said on Twitter.\nThe ruling party failed to win an overall majority in the legislative elections, leading to tensions as Macron's government seeks to push key bills through the legislature.\nRN MPs have been involved in earlier controversies during the latest term. First, the oldest member of the National Assembly Jos\u00e9 Gonzales praised French Algeria and its colonial rule on 28 June.\u00a0\nDuring a recent session, two RN deputies lashed out at the government, calling the Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire a \"coward\" and the Minister of Education Pap Ndiaye a \"communitarian\".\nThese invectives led to sanctions by the President of the National Assembly, which are also to be debated by the institution's bureau.\nDe Fournas, a wine grower in the Nord M\u00e9doc, is in his first term of office at the age of 37. He had not participated in any rows until now in the Palais Bourbon, where he sits on the Economic Affairs Committee.","question":"What did French National Rally deputy Gr\u00e9goire de Fournas shout during a parliamentary session in November 2022?","answer":"He shouted \"go back to Africa!\" during Black deputy Carlos Martens Bilongo's remarks on migrants.","region":"France","question_translated":"Qu'est-ce que le d\u00e9put\u00e9 du Rassemblement national Gr\u00e9goire de Fournas a cri\u00e9 lors d'une s\u00e9ance parlementaire en novembre 2022 ?","answer_translated":"Il a cri\u00e9 \"Retourne en Afrique !\" pendant les propos du d\u00e9put\u00e9 noir Carlos Martens Bilongo sur les migrants.","model_answer":"Answer: \"\u00c0 la honte\".

He takes over from Marine Le Pen, who stepped down from the leadership ahead of her unsuccessful 2022 run for the presidency. https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/4J6cp Jordan Bardella has been elected leader of the far-right French party National Rally Image: Berzane Nasser\/ABACA\/picture alliance Advertisement France's far-right National Rally (RN) party on Saturday chose 27-year-old Jordan Bardella to succeed\u00a0longtime leader Marine Le Pen . Bardella, who had been serving as interim party chief, garnered around 85% of party members' votes. His rival for the job was Louis Aliot, the mayor of Perpignan and former partner of Le Pen, who got 15%. Le Pen stepped down from the party leadership in 2021 ahead of her unsuccessful bid for the presidency in this year's elections. Who is Jordan Bardella? Raised by his Italian-born mother in a social housing block in the outskirts of Paris, Bardella has risen quickly through the party ranks. He promotes an elegant image, is rarely seen out of a suit, and has made an impact\u00a0with sharp performances in\u00a0this year's election debates. However, he has faced criticism from party veteran Aliot, who has\u00a0accused\u00a0him of encouraging white supremacist groups that\u00a0should be unacceptable for a party trying to prove it can unite the country. Bardella accused Aliot of \"bitterness and bad faith,\"\u00a0insisting his goal is to win over more supporters from traditional parties on the right and left. France: A divided country To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video What will Le Pen do? Marine Le Pen failed to unseat President Emmanuel Macron in last spring's presidential election, but has nonetheless made her party a formidable force after taking over from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen 11 years ago. Since then, she has pursued a policy of cleaning up the image of the party, which has long been overtly far-right, changing its name from the National Front to National Rally in 2018. Efforts to shed their legacy of virulent antisemitic and extremist views helped\u00a0RN candidates win 89 seats in the National Assembly after Macron's re-election, depriving his centrist party of an absolute majority . With Bardella serving as chairman of the party,\u00a0Le Pen plans to focus on leading the RN group in parliament, where she will have a powerful platform for a potential fourth run at the presidency in 2027. Bardella's election marks the first time since the party's founding 50 years ago that no one from the Le Pen family will be at the helm. However, Bardella is in a relationship with the daughter of Le Pen's sister. dh\/nm (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Related topics Related topics Far-right populism in Europe France About DW Who we are Press DW Global Media Forum DW offers Learn German DW Akademie Service Newsletters Reception FAQ Contact Topics from A to Z Headlines B2B Sales & Distribution Travel Advertising German News Service Follow us on \u00a9 2024 Deutsche Welle Privacy Policy Legal notice Digital accessibility Data privacy settings","question":"Who succeeded Marine Le Pen as the president of France's National Rally party in November 2022?","answer":"Jordan Bardella succeeded Marine Le Pen as the president of the National Rally party.","region":"France","question_translated":"Qui a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Marine Le Pen \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence du parti Rassemblement National en novembre 2022 ?","answer_translated":"Jordan Bardella a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Marine Le Pen \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence du parti Rassemblement National.","model_answer":"Answer: Jordan Bardella","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer 'Jordan Bardella' matches the expected answer 'Jordan Bardella a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Marine Le Pen \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence du parti Rassemblement National' in terms of the key information (the name of the successor).

There is no electoral college, and no involvement of parliament. A candidate who wins more than 50% of the popular vote is elected. If, as seems likely, no candidate wins that majority in the first round, the top two candidates go through to a run-off election two weeks later, on April 24. Although the French interior ministry reports the results by commune, department and region, only the overall national result counts. The breakdowns are interesting because they often show regional patterns in voting - Le Pen has in the past done well in the south and the north-east. Polls close at 1900CEST in most districts, but at 2000CEST in Paris and other large cities. French departments in the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean voted on Saturday. French citizens living overseas can also vote, and 1.4m of them are on the electoral register this time. The interior ministry said it was expecting some results from rural areas as soon as polls closed in Paris, with a majority of communes reporting by about midnight.

David Lisnard said they are a \"symbol of Islamic extremism\" and might spark scuffles, as France is the target of Islamist attacks. France is on high alert following a series of incidents including July's truck attack in nearby Nice. Anyone caught flouting the new rule could face a fine of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac38 (\u00c2\u00a333). They will first be asked to change into another swimming costume or leave the beach. Nobody has been apprehended for wearing a burkini in Cannes since the edict came into force at the end of July. What do Muslim women think of the ban? This is not the first time that women's clothing has been restricted in France. In 2011 it became the first country in Europe to ban the full-face Islamic veil , known as the burka, as well as the partial face covering, the niqab. Earlier this week a private waterpark near Marseille cancelled a burkini-only day after being subjected to criticism. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The authorities will need to distinguish between swimmers in burkinis and wetsuits The ruling \"Access to beaches and for swimming is banned to any person wearing improper clothes that are not respectful of good morals and secularism. \"Beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation, when France and places of worship are currently the target of terrorist attacks, is liable to create risks of disrupting public order.\" The reaction in the French press The French media has questioned the legality of the ban. Le Monde points out , external that no French law bans the wearing of full-body swimsuits. \"The law on the full-face veil only bans covering the face in public... The burkini, which covers the body but does not hide the face, is thus a totally legal garment.\" France TV Info's legal blog, Judge Marie, says , external the risk of disturbing public order, invoked by the Cannes mayor, seems rather tenuous. \"The basic freedom to come and go dressed as you please seems to me to be infringed in a way that is disproportionate to this risk,\" the blog says. Meanwhile, a commentary in left-of-centre paper Liberation accuses , external the Cannes mayor of trying to score a political point: \"David Lisnard\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is not responding to a specific issue, but is sending a radical message to his constituents, to his electorate.\" BBC Monitoring Mr Lisnard confirmed to local media that other religious symbols such as the kippah (Jewish skullcap) and the cross would still be permitted, and the ban would not apply to the veil that some Muslim women wear over their hair. He said: \"I simply forbid a uniform that is the symbol of Islamic extremism. \"We live in a common public space, there are rules to follow. \" The League of Human Rights (LDH) said it would challenge the ban in court. \"It is time for politicians in this region to calm their discriminatory ardour and defend the spirit of the Republic,\" local LDH leader Herve Lavisse said. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) is also expected to mount a legal challenge against the decision. Its lawyer Sefen Guez Guez called the ban \"illegal, discriminatory and unconstitutional\".

A car plowed into straw bales that demonstrators had placed across a road, hitting the three people before it came to a stop against a tractor\u2019s semi-trailer, prosecutor Olivier Mouysset said in a statement. The fatal crash in southwest France represented a dramatic turn for the growing protest movement among French farmers for better remuneration and against what they consider to be excessive regulation, mounting costs and other problems. The months of demonstrations have become increasingly vigorous in recent weeks, with traffic barricades, dumps of foul-smelling agricultural waste outside government offices and other protests. Farmers have also been turning road signs upside down to protest what they argue are nonsensical agricultural policies. France is one of Europe\u2019s agricultural powerhouses, with influential farming lobbies but also deep discontent among farmers who say they struggle to make ends meet despite working long hours to feed the country and boost its exports with their produce. RELATED COVERAGE Tesla, hammered by protests and plummeting sales, to report 1st quarter performance Anti-Trump protesters rally in New York, Washington and elsewhere across the country Thousands gather in London to support trans rights following UK ruling over definition of woman French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has been working to assuage farmers\u2019 concerns before their anger blows up into a wider movement, like the yellow vest protests against economic injustice in 2019 that dented Macron\u2019s popularity and saw frequent violence between protesters and riot police. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, newly installed by Macron in a government reshuffle this month , posted Tuesday on social media that \u201cbeing a farmer means working without respite. It\u2019s working for us, for the French. We are and will remain at their side.\u201d The woman hit and killed by a car in the Ari\u00e8ge region of southwestern France was a farmer, Attal said. French media reported that she raised cows. \u201cAll our farmers are in mourning. Our nation is shocked,\u201d Attal said. Macron, in a social media post, described the accident as a tragedy that \u201cupsets us all\u201d and said he ordered his government to find \u201dconcrete solutions\u201d to the difficulties that farmers are highlighting. The death and injuries provoked an outpouring of emotion in parliament, with lawmakers standing solemnly to applaud the victims and the profession more generally. \u201cWe can say today that we are all farmers,\u201d said Dominique Potier, a socialist. The car that rammed into the barricade of straw bales in the Ariege town of Pamiers was carrying three people, the prosecutor said in his statement. The woman killed in the pre-dawn collision was in her thirties, the statement said. Her husband was seriously injured and hospitalized and their 14-year-old daughter also was helicoptered for hospital treatment and is in critical condition, the prosecutor said. His statement said the collision did not appear to be intentional. Police detained the three occupants of the car for questioning.","question":"What were the main grievances of French farmers during the 2024 protests?","answer":"Farmers protested for better pay and against excessive regulation, rising costs, and other challenges in the agricultural sector.","region":"France","question_translated":"Quelles \u00e9taient les principales revendications des agriculteurs fran\u00e7ais lors des manifestations de 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Les agriculteurs ont manifest\u00e9 pour de meilleurs salaires et contre la r\u00e9glementation excessive, l'augmentation des co\u00fbts et d'autres d\u00e9fis dans le secteur agricole.","model_answer":"Answer: Les principales revendications des agriculteurs fran\u00e7ais lors des manifestations de 2024 concernaient principalement les conditions de travail, les revenus, la r\u00e9glementation environnementale et les politiques agricoles de l'Union europ\u00e9enne.

At 34, he is the youngest PM in modern French history, outranking even Socialist Laurent Fabius who was 37 when he was appointed by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1984. Mr Attal replaces \u00c9lisabeth Borne, who resigned after 20 months in office. Throughout that time she struggled with a lack of a majority in parliament. Gabriel Attal, who is currently education minister, certainly makes an eye-catching appointment. He will now have the task of leading the French government into important European Parliament elections in June. His rise has been rapid. Ten years ago he was an obscure adviser in the health ministry, and a card-carrying member of the Socialists. He will also be the first openly gay occupant of H\u00f4tel Matignon. He was previously in a civil partnership with another Macron whizz-kid, the MEP St\u00e9phane Sejourn\u00e9. Welcoming him to his new role, President Macron wrote on social media: \"I know I can count on your energy and your commitment to implement the project of revitalisation and regeneration that I announced.\" LUDOVIC MARIN\/AFP\/POOL Gabriel Attal (L) has the task of leading the government into European Parliament elections in June \"France will never rhyme with decline, France rhymes with transformation, France rhymes with audacity,\" Mr Attal declared outside his new residence. But given the difficulties of the president's second term - and the growing challenge from the nationalist right - is \"eye-catching\" alone going to cut it? Handsome, youthful, charming, popular, cogent, Mr Attal certainly comes to office trailing clouds of glory - much, let it be said, like his mentor and role-model the president himself. But like many go-getters of his generation, he was inspired by Emmanuel Macron's idea of breaking apart the old left-right divide and re-writing the codes of French politics. In the wake of Macron's 2017 election, Mr Attal became a member of parliament, and it was there that his brilliance as a debater - easily the best of the neophyte Macronite intake - brought him to the president's attention. At 29, he became the youngest ever minister in the Fifth Republic with a junior post at education; from 2020 he was government spokesman and his face began to register with the voters; after President Macron's re-election, he was briefly budget minister and then took over at education last July. It was in this post that Mr Attal confirmed to the president that he has what it takes, acting with no-nonsense determination to end September's row over Muslim abaya robes by simply banning them in schools. He led a campaign against bullying - he himself was a victim, he says - at the elite \u00c9cole alsacienne in Paris, and took on the education establishment with his proposal to experiment with school uniform. JACQUES DEMARTHON\/AFP President Macron's party faces a strong challenge from National Rally and its young leader Jordan Bardella - as well as Marine Le Pen And, all the while, he managed to buck the normal trends by actually becoming popular among the public. Polls show that he is by far the most admired member of the Macron government - competing at the same level as the president's main enemy, the nationalist Marine Le Pen and her youthful colleague Jordan Bardella. And there, of course, is the heart of it. By drawing Gabriel Attal from his pack of ministers, Mr Macron is using an ace to outplay the queen and her jack. But will it work? The drawn-out process of naming him - everyone knew a reshuffle was coming but it took forever - shows that if President Macron is well aware of the weakness of his current position, he has also been in deep uncertainty over how to address it. Reuters Mr Attal replaces \u00c9lisabeth Borne but is likely to face the same problems she had without a majority in the National Assembly More than one commentator has made the obvious point that what the public wants above all now is not so much a rearrangement of faces at the top, but a new sense of purpose to the Macron presidency. But as things stand, Mr Attal will face exactly the same problems as did his long-suffering predecessor \u00c9lisabeth Borne. These are: a hard-right opposition that is surging in popularity and looks set to win easily in June's European elections; a National Assembly with no in-built majority for the government, making every new law a struggle; and a president who seems unable to define what he wants his second term to achieve. On top of which, the new prime minister will have a problem all of his own - which is establishing his authority over such heavyweights as G\u00e9rald Darmanin and Bruno Le Maire. And what is the plan, some are also asking, if as seems likely Mr Macron's party loses heavily in the European elections? Normally that would be the occasion for a prime ministerial replacement, to give a new \u00e9lan for the second half of the mandate. But, as things stand, that card has already been played, and in the event of a defeat in June Gabriel Attal risks drifting on as a discredited loser. Even opposition figures recognise that he is a class act. He is respected and liked in the National Assembly. But there are also questions about what he actually stands for. The suspicion for many is that he is all smiles and verbiage, much like the man to whom he owes his career. As the president's nominee, he is the wunderkind's wunderkind. But if he is only Macron's mini-me, the marvel could prove a mirage.

The painting is protected by bulletproof glass and is undamaged.","text":"Mona Lisa: Protesters throw soup at da Vinci painting 28 January 2024 Share Save Oliver Slow BBC News Share Save Watch: Moment protesters throw soup at Mona Lisa painting Environmental protesters have thrown soup at the glass-protected Mona Lisa in France, calling for the right to \"healthy and sustainable food\". The 16th Century painting by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the world's most famous artworks, and is held at the Louvre in central Paris. The Louvre said the work was behind protective glass and was not damaged. Video shows two female protesters wearing T-shirts that read \"food counterattack\" throwing the liquid. They then stand in front of the painting, saying:  \"What is more important? Art or the right to healthy and sustainable food? \"Your agricultural system is sick. Our farmers are dying at work,\" they add. Museum security are then seen putting black screens in front of them before the room is evacuated. A group called Riposte Alimentaire (Food Counterattack) claimed responsibility for the stunt. In a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, it said the protest was part of efforts to integrate \"food into the general social security system\". It said that the current model for food \"stigmatises the most precarious and does not respect our fundamental right to food\". The group called for a food card worth \u20ac150 (\u00a3128) to be given to citizens each month to be used on food. The Louvre said that members of Riposte Alimentaire, which it described as an environmental movement, sprayed pumpkin soup on the painting at around 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT), and that there was no damage. It said the Salle des Etats, where the work is displayed, was evacuated, and reopened to visitors at 11:30 after cleaning was carried out. \"The museum will lodge a complaint,\" it added. Rachida Dati, France's Minister for Culture, said \"no cause\" could justify the Mona Lisa being targeted. \"Like our heritage [the painting] belongs to future generations,\" she said on X. The French capital has seen protests by farmers in recent days , calling for an end to rising fuel costs and for regulations to be simplified - on Friday they blocked key roads in and out of Paris. The Mona Lisa has been behind safety glass since the early 1950s, when it was damaged by a visitor who poured acid on it. In 2019, the museum said it had installed a more transparent form of bulletproof glass to protect it. In 2022, an activist threw cake at the painting , urging people to \"think of the Earth\". The painting was stolen from the Louvre in 1911 , causing an international sensation. Vincenzo Peruggia, an employee of the world's most visited museum, hid in a cupboard overnight to take the painting. It was recovered two years later when he tried to sell it to an antiques dealer in Florence, Italy. Man dressed as old woman throws cake at Mona Lisa Real v replica: Can you tell which is which?

SNCTA, the largest union representing air traffic controllers in France, has dropped plans for a 24-hour strike on Thursday after reaching a deal on pay and working conditions. However, the deal came too late to roll back cancellations ordered by France's DGAC civil aviation authority. As a result,\u00a075 per cent of flights remain canceled at Paris Orly Airport on Thursday and 55 per cent at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. In Marseille-Provence, 65 per cent of flights are cancelled along with 45 per cent in other airports in mainland France. Two other unions, UNSA-INCA and Usac-Cgt, had also called a strike. It is not clear whether they will still go ahead with the action. France \u2019s largest air traffic controllers union had filed a strike notice for this Thursday,\u00a0protesting the restructuring of workers' services. The SNCTA, which represents over 60 per cent of France\u2019s air traffic controllers, told the French press earlier this week that they expected a \"record turnout\". The national press has dubbed the 25th a \u201cjourn\u00e9e noir\u201d (black day) for French airports. \"People should expect major disruption and long delays,\" a spokesperson for the SNCTA union told AFP. It was predicted that the 24-hour strike would lead up to 70 per cent of flights in and out of French airports to be cancelled. Despite the strike being called off, the news came too late for cancellations to be reversed, and they remain at or just slightly below original figures. It is unclear whether 'overflights' that need to enter French airspace will still be affected but budget airline Ryanair warned that over 300 flights would be cancelled due to the threatened strike. Unions were objecting to the restructuring of air navigation services, a debate that has been ongoing for the last 15 months. Air traffic authorities are overhauling work schedules to cope better with predicted increases in flight traffic. Unions were demanding an accompanying rise in salaries and employee numbers. SNTCA was seeking pay increases of 5.04 per cent per year in 2025, 2026 and 2027, as well as the doubling of their \u201cspecial qualification allowance\u201d. It is not yet known what deal has been reached. The strike threat came despite the agreed \u2018Olympic truce\u2019 to suspend industrial action until the end of the games. CGT-RATP union members also announced a seven-month strike notice from 5 February to 9 September that could hit the Ile-de-France bus and metro network - including during this summer's Olympic Games . However, the French Senate adopted a bill on 9 April to allow the state to ban transport strikes for set periods each year to avoid disruption during major events like Paris 2024. It also calls for more advance warning of strikes and increased minimum service obligations. The bill faces opposition and must be adopted by the French National Assembly before it becomes law. Workers at the state-owned public transport company say they are walking out over pay.

Authorities say Kendji Girac's life is no longer considered in danger. Police were called at about 05:30 local time (04:30 GMT) to a traveller site in Biscarrosse, around 50km (31 miles) from Bordeaux. French media reported that in initial talks with investigators, the 27-year-old linked the incident to his own mishandling of a firearm. According to the reports, Mr Girac - who has sold millions of albums since his appearance on The Voice - told first responders he had shot himself accidentally while handling a pistol he had purchased from a junk shop. He was transported to a hospital in Bordeaux following the shooting. A source close to the investigation told the AFP news agency that police had not ruled anything out in their probe. The shooting took place near the reception area of a traveller community camp in Biscarosse, where Mr Girac had been for several days. \"This isn't a gangland shooting. It's an accident. He was playing with the thing and 'bam',\" a man called Emilio, who said he was Mr Girac's uncle, told AFP at the camp. The singer was due to perform in Marseille on Friday to celebrate the approach of the Olympic flame. The event's organiser said he will no longer take part in light of his injury. Kendji Girac is the stage name of Kendji Maille, 27, who grew up in the Catalan Gypsy community. He first rose to fame in 2013, after covering a song by Congolese-French rapper Gims. The following year, he won The Voice France. He has released five studio albums, most recently L'\u00c9cole de la Vie (The School of Life) in 2022. His hits Color Gitano and Andalouse have hundreds of millions of views on YouTube. Around half a million people make up the Gypsy community in France. Many live in the south-west of the country, where Mr Girac was brought up. Like many French Gypsies, Mr Girac has Spanish roots and several of his songs are in Spanish. But Mr Girac's popularity extends well beyond his own community. With his good looks, modern Gypsy and rumba pop music and clean-cut image he has become a \"poster boy\" for the French Gypsy community. Reacting to the news, French TV host Cyril Hanouna said: \"We are all shocked. We love him, he's a great guy, incredibly kind, always smiling, always ready to help.\" The Gypsy mayor planning to tear down Gypsy homes France Travellers","question":"What happened to Kendji Girac in April 2024?","answer":"Kendji Girac was seriously injured after being shot in the chest in Biscarrosse, France.","region":"France","question_translated":"Que s'est-il pass\u00e9 pour Kendji Girac en avril 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Kendji Girac a \u00e9t\u00e9 gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9 par balle \u00e0 la poitrine \u00e0 Biscarrosse, en France.","model_answer":"Answer: Kendji Girac a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une tentative de suicide par balle en avril 2024.

French authorities in New Caledonia and the interior ministry in Paris said five people, including two police officers, were killed after protests earlier this week over voting reforms pushed by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government turned deadly. At least 60 members of the security forces were injured and 214 people were arrested over clashes with police, arson and looting Thursday, the territory\u2019s top French official, High Commissioner Louis Le Franc, said. \u201cEverything is being done to restore order and calm that Caledonians deserve,\u201d French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said after a meeting at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris. AP AUDIO: Violence rages in New Caledonia as France rushes emergency reinforcements to its Pacific territory AP Paris bureau correspondent John Leicester reports it\u2019s unlikely the unrest in France\u2019s Pacific territory of New Caledonia will have an impact on the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris. He said that in addition to 1,700 security forces troops that have already been deployed to help police, 1,000 more are on the way but the situation \u201cremains very tense, with looting, riots, arson and attacks, which are unbearable and unspeakable.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE New Zealand qualifies for the 2026 World Cup with a 3-0 win over New Caledonia in the Oceania final New Zealand qualifies for the 2026 World Cup with a 3-0 win over New Caledonia in the Oceania final Two members of the island\u2019s Indigenous Kanak community were among the five dead, French Interior and Overseas Territories Minister Gerald Darmanin said Thursday as he vowed that France \u201cwill regain total control.\u201d He said 10 people, all allegedly from the pro-independence movement known as The Field Acton Coordination Unit, were under house arrest. In April, the group had backed several protests against French authorities on the island. Still, Darmanin claimed the movement is a \u201csmall group which calls itself pro-independence, but instead commits looting, murder and violence.\u201d Leaders of a Kanak Workers Union in Paris appealed for calm and said they were deeply saddened by deaths in their faraway homeland. \u201cWe wish to see the French government make a strong political statement rather than send troops,\u201d a union leader Rock Haocas told reporters on Thursday. \u201cStarting a conversation would be a strong political statement.\u201d In New Caledonia, The National Council of Chiefs of the Indigenous Kanak people condemned \u201call acts of vandalism and gun violence,\u201d but rejected the allegations that the pro-independence movement was involved in the deadly violence. Grand Chief Hippolyte Sinewami-Htamumu expressed full support for the pro-independence group, which has mobilized more than a hundred thousand people \u201cof all ages and from all backgrounds\u201d in peaceful protests in recent months in the capital, Noum\u00e9a, and throughout the island. \u201cThis is not a \u2018terrorist group\u2019 or \u2018mafia group,\u2019 as certain political leaders want us to believe,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. The state of emergency will be in place for at least 12 days as French military forces were being deployed to protect ports and airports and to free up police troops. The curfew has been extended until Friday morning, said Le Franc, the high commissioner. The territory\u2019s political parties also appealed for calm on both sides \u2014 those who support independence and those who want the island to remain part of France. The last time France imposed emergency powers on one of its overseas territories was in 1985, also in New Caledonia. The measures enable French and local authorities on the archipelago to tackle unrest, authorizing house detentions for those deemed a threat to public order, allowing for searches, weapons\u2019 seizures and restricting movement, with possible jail time for violators. The Pacific island east of Australia, home to about 270,000 people and 10 time zones ahead of Paris, is known to tourists for its UNESCO World Heritage atolls and reefs. Tensions have simmered for decades between the Indigenous Kanaks seeking independence and colonizers\u2019 descendants who want it to remain part of France. People of European descent in New Caledonia, which has long served as France\u2019s prison colony and now has a French military base, distinguish between descendants of colonizers and descendants of the many prisoners sent to the territory by force. This week\u2019s unrest erupted as the French legislature in Paris debated amending the French constitution to make changes to voter lists in New Caledonia. The National Assembly on Wednesday approved a bill that will, among other changes, allow residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years to cast ballots in provincial elections. Opponents say this will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia and further marginalize the Kanaks, who had once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination. Macron said Wednesday that he would convene the Congress, a joint session of lawmakers from both houses of the French parliament, by the end of June to amend the constitution and make the bill law in the absence of a meaningful dialogue and consensus among local representatives. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon\u2019s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. A peace deal between rival factions was reached in 1988. A decade later, France promised to grant New Caledonia political power and broad autonomy, and hold up to three successive referendums on the island\u2019s future. The referendums were organized between 2018 to 2021 and a majority of voters chose to have New Caledonia remain part of France, instead of backing independence . The pro-independence Kanak people rejected the results of the last, 2021 referendum , which they had boycotted because it was held at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. ___ Surk reported from Nice, France.

According to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \u201cto die and become a martyr,\u201d the statement also said.

Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris\u2019 Stade de France. Darmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats , including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries. The Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. \u2018\u2019Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024.

It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country\u2019s national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high. Organizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000. The French government also decided that tourists won\u2019t be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead. Extra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily. ___ Associated Press writer Anne Peterson in Portland, Ore. contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP coverage of Paris Olympics https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/2024-paris-olympic-games","question":"What was the 18-year-old suspect from Chechnya accused of planning during the 2024 Paris Olympics?","answer":"He was accused of plotting an attack targeting spectators and police forces at the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne during soccer matches.","region":"France","question_translated":"De quoi le suspect de 18 ans originaire de Tch\u00e9tch\u00e9nie \u00e9tait-il accus\u00e9 de planifier pendant les Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Il \u00e9tait accus\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer une attaque visant les spectateurs et les forces de police au stade Geoffroy-Guichard de Saint-\u00c9tienne pendant les matchs de football.","model_answer":"Answer: un attentat \u00e0 la bombe dans un stade.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer mentions 'un attentat \u00e0 la bombe dans un stade' (a bomb attack in a stadium), which aligns with the expected answer's description of planning an attack targeting spectators and police at a stadium during the football matches.

A 10-day stream of stars began flowing down the Cannes\u2019 red carpet with the opening night film, \u201cThe Second Act,\u201d a French comedy starring Lea Seydoux, Vincent Lindon, Louis Garrel and Rapha\u00ebl Quenard. They play squabbling actors filming a movie directed by an artificial intelligence. The festival\u2019s first lengthy standing ovation, though, went to Streep , who was awarded an honorary Palme d\u2019Or during Tuesday\u2019s opening ceremony. After Juliette Binoche introduced her, Streep alternatively shook her head, fanned herself and danced while the crowd thunderously cheered. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful that you haven\u2019t gotten sick of my face and you haven\u2019t gotten off of the train,\u201d said Streep, who soon thereafter declared Cannes officially open with Binoche. \u201cMy mother, who is usually right about everything, said to me: \u2019Meryl, my darling, you\u2019ll see. It all goes so fast. So fast,\u2033 added Streep. \u201cAnd it has, and it does. Except for my speech, which is too long.\u201d Streep. (Photo by Daniel Cole\/Invision\/AP) The reception was nearly as rapturous for Gerwig, the first American female filmmaker to serve as president of the Cannes jury that will decide the festival\u2019s top award, the Palme d\u2019Or. Thierry Fremaux, Cannes\u2019 artistic director, on Monday praised her as \u201cthe ideal director\u201d for Cannes, given her work across arthouse and studio film and her interest in cinema history. And, Fremaux said, \u201cWe very much liked \u2018Barbie.\u2019\u201d In the days to come, Cannes will premiere George Miller\u2019s \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s self-financed \u201cMegalopolis\u201d and anticipated new movies from Paolo Sorrentino, Yorgos Lanthimos, Andrea Arnold and Kevin Costner. But much of the drama surrounding this year\u2019s Cannes has been off screen. After French actor Judith Godr\u00e8che earlier this year accused two film directors of rape and sexual abuse when she was a teenager, the French film industry has been dealing with arguably its defining #MeToo moment. On Wednesday, Godr\u00e8che will premiere her short \u201cMoi Aussi.\u201d Asked about #MeToo expanding in France, Gerwig told reporters in Cannes on Tuesday that it\u2019s progress. \u201cI think people in the community of movies telling us stories and trying to change things for the better is only good,\u201d Gerwig said. \u201cI have seen substantive change in the American film community, and I think it\u2019s important that we continue to expand that conversation. So I think it\u2019s only moving everything in the correct direction. Keep those lines of communication open.\u201d Lily Gladstone,Greta Gerwig, Eva Green, and Pierfrancesco Favino. (Photo by Scott Garfitt\/Invision\/AP) Gerwig is joined on the jury by Lily Gladstone, star of \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d French actor Eva Green, Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona, French actor Omar Sy, Lebanese actor and director Nadine Labaki, Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda, Turkish screenwriter Ebru Ceylan and Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino. \u201cI thought I just got over my imposter syndrome last year,\u201d said the Oscar-nominated Gladstone . \u201cBut I\u2019ll start all over again.\u201d The jurors were asked how the many real-world concerns outside the festival might affect their deliberations. One film in competition, Ali Abbasi\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d stars Sebastian Stan as a young Donald Trump. Labaki was questioned on the war in Gaza. \u201cI truly believe that one of the tools to really change something in the situation we all live in right now, which is a situation I think is not that great, is really through art and through cinema,\u201d said Labaki. \u201cIt may propose a more tolerant way of seeing things and seeing each other as human beings.\u201d Filmmakers, Favino said, play the important role of reminding the world of where it can find beauty. \u201cThis is why I decided that I could be here without feeling guilty as a human being,\u201d said Favino. \u201cBecause if we look for beauty, then we might look for peace.\u201d Other concerns are also swirling around this year\u2019s Cannes. Festival workers, fed up with short-term contracts that leave them unqualified for unemployment benefits in between festivals, have threatened to strike. During Tuesday\u2019s opening ceremony, two small bands of festival workers protested, including one group that unfurled a banner from the roof of the Palais. On Monday, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammed Rasoulof, whose film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d is premiering next week in competition in Cannes, said he had fled Iran after being sentenced to eight years in prison and flogging. The film is said to be a critical depiction of the Iranian government. Heidi Klum (Photo by Scott Garfitt\/Invision\/AP) As Cannes continues, though, many will be focused on the stars parading the festival\u2019s famous red carpet. They\u2019ll include Emma Stone, Anya Taylor-Joy, Demi Moore, Selena Gomez, Nicolas Cage and Barry Keoghan. At the closing ceremony on May 25, George Lucas is to receive an honorary Palme d\u2019Or. Regardless, the 77th Cannes will have a lot to live up to. Last year\u2019s festival, widely celebrated for its robust lineup, produced three Oscar best picture nominees: \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d A good Cannes will help France keep the global spotlight through the summer. The festival will be followed by the French Open, the Tour de France and the summer Olympics in Paris. On May 21, the Olympic flame will be carried up the steps to the festival\u2019s hub, the Palais des Festivals. To help rekindle the spirit of last year\u2019s festival, Messi, the canine star of \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d was the first star to hit the red carpet Tuesday. The border collie, enlisted to film daily snippets for French TV, frolicked up and down the carpet while tuxedo-clad photographers hollered \u201cMessi!

The suspected arsonist was an Algerian national who wasn\u2019t flagged as a potential extremist, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said after inspecting the fire-damaged synagogue. He said the man had sought permission to stay in France for medical treatment and, after it was refused, had been placed on a police wanted list for possible return back to his country. Darmanin praised the 25-year-old police officer for using his service weapon against the \u201cparticularly dangerous, particularly violent\u201d assailant who rushed at him with a knife, declaring: \u201cHe was right to do so.\u201d The minister said the officer would be decorated for his \u201cextremely courageous, extremely professional\u201d behavior. \u201cThis antisemitic act in Rouen affects all of us, deeply,\u201d he said. France is \u201cextremely determined to continue protecting all the Jews of France, wherever they are, who must practice their religion without fear.\u201d Related stories Dialysis patients struggle to get treatment in blockaded Gaza.

France has also seen pro-Palestinian protests in major cities and students occupying university campuses in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

It aims at intimidating French Jews and we won\u2019t accept this intimidation. We refuse it, and we will continue to fight against this unbridled antisemitism.\u201d Firefighters were alerted early Friday morning to the blaze at the synagogue. Police officers discovered the man on the roof of the building, clutching the metal bar in one hand and the kitchen knife in the other, and smoke rising from the synagogue\u2019s windows, Rouen prosecutor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Teillet said. He said the man hurled abuse and threw the metal bar at the police before jumping off the roof and then running at one of the officers with his knife raised. The officer fired five shots, hitting the man four times, fatally wounding him, the prosecutor said. Rouen Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said that the man is thought to have climbed onto a trash container and thrown \u201ca sort of Molotov cocktail\u201d inside the synagogue, starting the fire and causing \u201csignificant damage.\u201d \u201cWhen the Jewish community is attacked, it\u2019s an attack on the national community, an attack on France, an attack on all French citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fright for the whole nation.\u201d Hours later, the inside of the synagogue still smelled of fire, although the building was largely intact. A couple of walls were charred and damaged and wooden cabinets adorned with the Star of David where the Torah is stored for services were blistered and blackened. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe,\u201d said Natacha Ben Haim, head of Rouen\u2019s Jewish community. \u201cThe assailant threw an incendiary object inside through a small dormer that he most certainly broke into. The fire started then, very quickly apparently, and the damage is considerable. We managed to save the Sefer Torah, but parts of the wall fell, from the ceiling, too.\u201d The synagogue\u2019s rabbi, Chmouel Lubecki, urged community members to light candles and attend Friday night services for the Jewish sabbath to show strength and unity. \u201cWe need to be strong,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t let the antisemitism take our Judaism.\u201d French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said this month that the sharp spike in antisemitic acts in France that followed the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel has continued into this year. Authorities registered 366 antisemitic acts in the first three months of 2024, a 300% increase over the same period last year, Attal said. More than 1,200 antisemitic acts were reported in the last three months of 2023 \u2014 which was three times more than in the whole of 2022, he said. \u201cWe are witnessing an explosion of hatred,\u201d he said. ___ John Leicester reported from Paris.

Prisoner Mohamed Amra - known as \"The Fly\" - was being taken from court to a prison when a car rammed the prison van at a toll booth. Gunmen then opened fire at prison officers, with two officers killed and two critically injured. Several hundred police officers and gendarmes have been deployed to carry out a manhunt.

AFP \/ Getty The 30-year-old inmate is said to have ties to a gang in the southern city of Marseille, which has been plagued by drug-related gang violence. At the time of the ambush which led to his escape he was being transported back to jail in the town of \u00c9vreux after attending a morning court hearing in Rouen. The ambush took place around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) near a toll booth on the A154 motorway. The officers were shot with \"heavy weapons\" by the prisoner's accomplices, according to French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti. The attackers escaped in a car which police believe they have now recovered, abandoned near the toll gate where the attack happened. Watch: Hooded gunmen seen in footage taken from passing bus Roadblocks have been set up across north-west France, with police following up on every tip-off.

The other leaves a wife who is five months pregnant,\" he said. \"Everything - and I mean everything - will be put in place to find the perpetrators of this vile crime,\" Mr Dupond-Moretti said, adding that the perpetrators were \"people for whom life has no value\".

Some 16,000 employees would be affected. The new media group\u00a0would bring together France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, Radio France, the National Audiovisual Institute and France M\u00e9dias Monde (FMM).

The arrest was announced just as France hosted world leaders on the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday. Russia wasn\u2019t invited. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said the suspect, whom it didn\u2019t identify, is accused of failing to register with authorities as a foreign agent while collecting \u201cinformation about military and military-technical activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d It added that the information could be used to the detriment of the country\u2019s security.

Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee posted a video showing officers detaining the suspect at a cafe and driving him to the committee\u2019s Moscow offices for interrogation. The charges carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. The arrest comes during a strain in Russian-French ties that followed French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s statements about the possibility of deploying the country\u2019s troops in Ukraine . Moscow has warned that French soldiers would be legitimate targets for Russia if they are sent to Ukraine. The charges against the French citizen are based on a recently approved law that requires anyone who collects information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other newly endorsed legislation as part of a multi-pronged Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to muzzle criticism of its actions in Ukraine. Arrests on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

The demand has its roots in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a decades-old campaign against Israel\u2019s policies toward the Palestinians. The movement has taken on new strength as Israel\u2019s war against Hamas surpasses the eight-month mark and stories of suffering in Gaza have led to growing international pressure on Israel to end the fighting. Protesters in the BDS movement \u2014 including student encampments and corporate demonstrations \u2014 have claimed parallels between Israel\u2019s policy vis-\u00e0-vis Gaza, to apartheid in South Africa.

Voters cast ballots in two dozen languages in 27 countries with scores of different campaign issues. So here\u2019s a look at what happened in some key countries in the June 6-9 elections for a new European Parliament . FRANCE This was the biggest bombshell of Europe\u2019s mass election night: President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s moderate pro-business party was so badly trounced by the far-right party of Marine Le Pen in the EU vote that he called a snap legislative election in France. Propelled by her anti-immigration, nationalist ideas , Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party is forecast to win the most of France\u2019s 81 seats in the European Parliament \u2014 about twice as many as Macron\u2019s Renaissance movement.

(AP Photo\/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, File) The snap French legislative election is a big gamble for Macron and his party, which risks further losing support while Le Pen\u2019s National Rally could see its influence surge. Many French voters used the EU election to express dissatisfaction with Macron\u2019s management of the economy, farming rules, or security. The result hurts him as he tries to lead Europe-wide efforts to defend Ukraine and boost the EU\u2019s own defenses and industry.

The party no longer wants to leave the EU and the euro, but to weaken it from within. On the left, France\u2019s long-suffering Socialist Party surged behind lead candidate Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, who wants a more ambitious climate policy and protections for European businesses and workers. GERMANY The leader of the EU\u2019s richest and most powerful country, Germany, also suffered a blow. Center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s unpopular governing coalition lost badly to the conservative opposition, which benefited from his troubles. The conservative bloc maintained its position as the strongest German party in Brussels as it looks ahead to a national election expected in the fall of next year. And the far-right Alternative for Germany made good gains despite a string of scandals surrounding its top two candidates for the EU legislature. That\u2019s especially sobering to many, given Germany\u2019s Nazi past. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the dominant party in the two-party conservative bloc that won the most votes. Projections showed support for Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democrats at 14%, their worst post-World War II result in a nationwide vote. Germany\u2019s Greens, central to globally important EU climate policy, saw support slump. Germany will have the largest number of the new European Parliament\u2019s 720 seats at 96.

(AP Photo\/Michel Euler) HUNGARY Long-serving Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n saw yet another election victory \u2014 but a new challenger has upended his grip on Hungarian politics. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party was expected to win 43% of the vote, according to estimates from the EU Parliament. While Fidesz took a plurality of votes, it was down nearly 10 points from its support in the last EU elections in 2019, and looked set to lose two seats in what was widely seen as a referendum on Orb\u00e1n\u2019s popularity. A deep economic crisis and a recent series of scandals involving Fidesz politicians have rocked the party which prides itself on upholding family values and Christian conservatism. Challenger P\u00e9ter Magyar broke ranks with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party in February and in a matter of months built up Hungary\u2019s strongest opposition party. That party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA), was expected to take 31% of the vote.

(Sven Hoppe\/dpa via AP) Magyar has shot to prominence on public accusations of corruption and mismanagement within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government. Magyar\u2019s party has presented itself as a more centrist alternative to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s brand of illiberal populism. Orb\u00e1n cast the election as an existential struggle between war and peace, telling voters that casting their ballots for his opposition would draw Hungary directly into the war in neighboring Ukraine and precipitate a global armed conflict. He has been in power since 2010. ITALY Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-fascist roots, is forecast to more than double its number of seats in the European Parliament since the last election. And that will hand her new power to influence policy in the EU. While voters punished moderate leaders in France and Germany, they gave Meloni\u2019s party even more support than in the last national elections in 2022. Her pro-Ukraine and Israel policies have proven reassuring to centrist American and European allies, but she is leading culture wars at home that preserve her far-right credentials. The center-left opposition Democratic Party came in second, followed by the other main opposition party, the 5-Star Movement. In Italy, the vote is not expected to destabilize the government, even if Meloni\u2019s advantage will be at the expense of her partners in the governing coalition, the populist, anti-migrant right-wing Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, and the center-right Forza Italia, led by Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. Italy has 76 European parliamentary seats. SLOVAKIA A liberal, pro-Western group won the EU elections in Slovakia, beating the party of populist, pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico just weeks after he survived an assassination attempt . The attack on Fico sent shockwaves through the nation of 5.4 million and appeared to boost voter turnout, which had been the lowest of the entire bloc in 2014 and 2019 but reached a record 34.4% Sunday. The assassination attempt didn\u2019t help Fico\u2019s leftist Smer (Direction) party, the senior partner in the governing coalition, to win the vote. Smer has been attacking the EU\u2019s support for Ukraine, as well other policies on immigration, climate change and LGBTQ+ rights. Smer was in a close race against the main opposition Progressive Slovakia, which won 27.8%, or six seats in the EU parliament, according to provisional results. Smer follows at 24.8%, or five seats. A far-right opposition party that wants Slovakia out of NATO, the Republic, finished third with 12.53% and will have two seats. __ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of global elections at: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/global-elections\/","question":"Which political party in France performed strongly in the 2024 European Parliament elections, leading to Macron's decision?","answer":"The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, performed strongly.","region":"France","question_translated":"Quel parti politique en France a obtenu de bons r\u00e9sultats lors des \u00e9lections au Parlement europ\u00e9en de 2024, conduisant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de Macron ?","answer_translated":"Le parti d'extr\u00eame droite Rassemblement National, dirig\u00e9 par Marine Le Pen, a obtenu de bons r\u00e9sultats.","model_answer":"To accurately answer this question, we need to consider the context and available information about the 2024 European Parliament elections in France and their potential impact on French politics, particularly on President Macron.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the context of the 2024 European Parliament elections\nThe European Parliament elections are held every five years, and the 2024 elections would be significant as they reflect the current political mood across the EU, including France.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the potential impact on French politics\nThe results of these elections can influence national politics, especially if certain parties achieve significant gains or losses.

The 26-year-old man was detained in a hotel north of Paris on Monday, and investigators are searching for possible accomplices, the national counterterrorism prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement. The arrest came the day before U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in France , and three days before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in France.

The statement said the man was presented to an investigating judge on Friday who filed preliminary charges for participation in a terrorist group planning criminal attacks, and for possession of explosives materials aimed at preparing an attack in connection with a terrorist group.

(AP Photo\/Christophe Ena) Read More By HOWARD FENDRICH Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit PARIS (AP) \u2014 As Carlos Alcaraz began constructing his comeback in Sunday\u2019s French Open final, a 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Alexander Zverev for a first championship at Roland Garros and third Grand Slam title in all, there arrived the sort of magical shot the kid is making a regular part of his varied repertoire. It was a running, then sliding, down-the-line, untouchable forehand passing winner that Alcaraz celebrated by thrusting his right index finger overhead in a \u201cNo. 1\u201d sign, then throwing an uppercut while screaming, \u201cVamos!\u201d No, he is not ranked No. 1 at the moment \u2014 the man he beat in the semifinals, Jannik Sinner , makes his debut at the top spot on Monday \u2014 but Alcaraz has been there before and, although a \u201c2\u201d will be beside his name next week, there is little doubt that he is as good as it gets in men\u2019s tennis right now. And more accomplished than any man ever was at his age. Alcaraz is a 21-year-old from Spain who grew up running home from school to watch on TV as countryman Rafael Nadal was accumulating title after title at Roland Garros \u2014 a record 14 \u2014 and he eclipsed Nadal as the youngest man to collect major championships on three surfaces. Nadal was about 1\u00bd years older when he did it. RELATED COVERAGE Andre Agassi will play at the US Open Pickleball Championships next week Alcaraz waiting on results from medical tests to see if he will play in Madrid Rising tennis star Eala stays focused at Madrid Open despite more attention on her \u201cDifferent tournaments, different aura,\u201d Alcaraz said when asked to distinguish among his trio of trophies, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to say: same feeling. I mean, winning a Grand Slam is always special,\u201d This one from the clay-court major joins hardware from triumphs on hard courts at the U.S. Open in 2022 and on grass at Wimbledon in 2023 . He is 3-0 in Slam finals. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing career already. You\u2019re already a Hall of Famer. You already achieved so much \u2014 and you\u2019re only 21 years old,\u201d said Zverev, who also lost the 2020 U.S. Open final , that one after being two points from winning. \u201cIncredible player. Not the last time you\u2019re going to win this.\u201d Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, exited the French Open in the semifinals each of the past three years, including after tearing ankle ligaments during the second set against Nadal in that round in 2022. Hours before Zverev\u2019s semifinal victory over Casper Ruud began on Friday, a Berlin district court announced that he reached an out-of-court settlement that ended a trial stemming from an ex-girlfriend\u2019s accusation of assault during a 2020 argument. On Sunday against Alcaraz, Zverev faltered after surging in front by reeling off the last five games of the third set. Alcaraz\u2019s level dipped during that stretch and he seemed distracted by a complaint over the condition of the clay, telling chair umpire Renaud Lichtenstein it was \u201cunbelievable.\u201d But Alcaraz reset and ran away with it, taking 12 of the last 15 games while being treated by a trainer at changeovers for some pain and cramping in his left leg. \u201cI know that when I\u2019m playing a fifth set, you have to give everything and you have to give your heart,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI mean, in those moments, it\u2019s where the top players give their best tennis.\u201d No. 3 seed Alcaraz and No. 4 Zverev were making their first appearance in a French Open final. Indeed, this was the first men\u2019s title match at Roland Garros since 2004 without at least one of Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer . Nadal, who is 38 and was limited by injuries over the last two seasons, lost to Zverev in the first round two weeks ago; Djokovic, 37, a three-time champion, withdrew before the quarterfinals with a knee injury that required surgery; Federer, 42, is retired. There were some jitters at the outset. Zverev started with two double-faults \u2014 changing rackets after the second, as though the equipment were the culprit \u2014 and got broken. Alcaraz lost serve immediately, too. Let\u2019s just say they won\u2019t be putting those initial 10 minutes in the Louvre. Actually, lot of the 4-hour, 19-minute match was patchy, littered with unforced errors. Alcaraz was at his best when it mattered the most \u2014 the last two sets. \u201cI lost focus, and on my serve, I didn\u2019t get the power from my legs anymore, which is weird. Because normally I do not get tired. I don\u2019t cramp,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cAgainst Carlos, it\u2019s a different intensity.\u201d Just like he did against Zverev, Alcaraz overturned a deficit of two sets to one against Sinner, making him the first man to capture the French Open by doing that in each of the last two matches since Manolo Santana \u2014 also from Spain \u2014 in 1961. Alcaraz showed off all of his skills: the drop shots, the artful half-volleys, the intimidating forehands delivered aggressively and accompanied by a loud grunt. His 27 forehand winners were 20 more than Zverev\u2019s total. Not bad for a guy who arrived in Paris saying he was afraid to hit his forehand at full force because of a forearm injury that sidelined him for nearly all of May. He said Sunday that there were \u201ca lot of doubts\u201d entering the French Open and he was forced to limit his practice time \u2014 which is why he considers this victory the proudest moment of his still-nascent career. In the fifth set, under constant pressure from Alcaraz, Zverev got broken to fall behind 2-1. The next game showed the grit and gumption that already are hallmarks of Alcaraz\u2019s style. Zverev \u2014 who argued about one line call on a second serve by Alcaraz that the German said afterward was out according to an unofficial video review \u2014 would hold four break points. He failed to convert any. Alcaraz didn\u2019t let him, and wrapped up the game with a drop shot. The crowd roared. Alcaraz held his left index finger to his ear while waving his racket. He broke again for 5-2, then served it out and dropped onto his back, caking his shirt with clay \u2014 just as Nadal often did after championship point. Alcaraz first learned to play tennis on the rust-colored surface, although he says he prefers hard courts. Alcaraz says he dreamed long ago of adding his own name to the list of Spanish men to win the event, including his coach, 2003 champion Juan Carlos Ferrero.

The arrest was announced just as France hosted world leaders on the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday. Russia wasn\u2019t invited. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said the suspect, whom it didn\u2019t identify, is accused of failing to register with authorities as a foreign agent while collecting \u201cinformation about military and military-technical activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d It added that the information could be used to the detriment of the country\u2019s security.

Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee posted a video showing officers detaining the suspect at a cafe and driving him to the committee\u2019s Moscow offices for interrogation. The charges carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. The arrest comes during a strain in Russian-French ties that followed French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s statements about the possibility of deploying the country\u2019s troops in Ukraine . Moscow has warned that French soldiers would be legitimate targets for Russia if they are sent to Ukraine. The charges against the French citizen are based on a recently approved law that requires anyone who collects information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other newly endorsed legislation as part of a multi-pronged Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to muzzle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.

Olivier Marleix, the head of the party in the National Assembly, calls for Ciotti's resignation in response.","text":"French right uproar over call for far-right alliance 11 June 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby BBC News Share Save REUTERS\/Sarah Meyssonnier The leader of France's right-wing Republicans party, Eric Ciotti, has sparked an outcry after he backed an alliance with the far-right National Rally in snap elections announced by President Emmanuel Macron. The anti-immigration party of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella scored a dramatic victory in European elections on Sunday, prompting Mr Macron to dissolve parliament and call a first round of elections in 19 days' time. The decision has sent shockwaves through French politics, not least among the Republicans party, which won only 7.25% of the vote and has seen many of its voters move to National Rally (RN). For Republicans leader Eric Ciotti the solution was clear: \"We need to have an alliance while remaining ourselves... an alliance with the National Rally and its candidates.\" The snap election has prompted parties on both left and right to consider forming  alliances to stand a greater chance of winning more seats. Left-wing parties have already agreed to abandon their differences to form a \"popular front\". But never before has the traditional right in French politics made any sort of political accord with the far right and Mr Ciotti's remarks set a party that was already struggling to find a voice \"on the verge of implosion\", as Le Monde put it. Mr Ciotti, who is on the right wing of his party, revealed he had already spoken to Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella. Ms Le Pen immediately praised his \"courageous choice and sense of responsibility\" and looked forward to an end to \"40 years of a pseudo-cordon sanitaire\" disappearing. But his suggestion was immediately greeted with a chorus of derision. Outside party headquarters in Paris, supporters spoke of an act of treachery for a party whose origins lie with the first president of France's current Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle. A clearly furious Republicans vice-president Florence Portelli said the party would fire Mr Ciotti for suggesting an accord with the far right. \"I think there's a chance he can be made to leave, if he doesn't go by himself, and I have no doubt it'll happen,\" she told France Info TV. REUTERS\/Sarah Meyssonnier Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella say they are ready to exercise power Senate Republicans leader Bruno Retailleau accused him of disloyalty: \"The Republicans will never form an alliance with the RN, we have deep ideological differences and we have to maintain our independence and integrity.\" Many of Mr Ciotti's critics said he was driven by local politics in his home city of Nice. One MP, Vincent Desc\u0153ur, said he was resigning in protest and another, Jean-Yves Bony, said he would too if Mr Ciotti didn't step down in 48 hours. Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, who led the Republicans in the European elections, said working with RN would merely be doing Mr Macron's work for him. President Macron has explained his bombshell decision to call elections, saying he could not carry on after the European elections as if nothing had happened and did not want to come across as powerless. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay\/Pool He ruled out resigning as president \"whatever the result\" of the elections, which take place over two rounds on 30 June and 7 July, less than three weeks before the Paris Olympics. \"It's not the RN who write the constitution, or the spirit of it,\" he told Le Figaro. National Rally won 31.4% of the vote on Sunday, more than double the 14.6% of Mr Macron's Renew alliance, while a resurgent centre left, led by Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, reached 13.8%. Another far-right party, Reconquest, took 5% of the vote, and there had been talk of the two parties forming an alliance for the next election. But Marion Mar\u00e9chal of Reconquest, who is Marine Le Pen's niece, said RN had decided against an alliance because they wanted nothing to do with her party's leader Eric Zemmour. Macron snap election leaves rivals stunned after EU vote Europe's night of election drama capped by Macron bombshell Macron takes huge risk with surprise election At the last parliamentary election, France's notoriously divided left-wing parties formed a group called Nupes, bringing together the Socialists, far-left France Unbowed (LF), Communists and Greens. Despite Nupes imploding amid even wider divisions over issues such as the war in Gaza, the left parties have agreed to form a pact to fight the new elections. Although Mr Macron won a second term two years ago, his party failed to secure a majority in parliament, making it a struggle to pass legislation. He has often had to rely on support from the Republicans to do so, so his decision to call elections is a big risk, especially when he is facing defeat. The first opinion poll taken since Sunday's elections suggests National Rally would win 34% of the vote, ahead of 19% for Mr Macron's party. But until now the two rounds of a parliamentary election have been tricky for National Rally as they have often struggled to win more than 50% of second-round run-off votes because their opponents tend to coalesce against the far right. It is so far unclear whether their dramatic success on Sunday may have changed that.

The French Interior Ministry said 250,000 people turned out to protest, 75,000 of them in Paris. Despite rainy and windy weather, those who fear that the elections will produce France\u2019s first far-right government since World War II gathered at Place de la Republique before marching through eastern Paris. Up to 21,000 police and gendarmes were deployed. The protesters held placards reading \u201cLiberty for all, Equality for all and Fraternity with all\u201d \u2014 a reference to France\u2019s national motto \u2014 and \u201cLet\u2019s break frontiers, documents for all, no to the immigration bill.\u201d Some chanted \u201cFree Palestine, viva Palestina,\u201d and wore keffiyeh scarves. Among them was Nour Cekar, a 16 year-old high school student from the Paris region, who has French and Algerian parents and wears the hijab. \u201cTo me, the extreme right is a danger because it supports an ideology based on the fear of the other, whereas we are all French citizens despite our differences,\u201d she told The Associated Press. RELATED COVERAGE Fireworks as thousands greet Serbian students who cycled to France seeking EU support for protests Anti-Trump protesters rally in New York, Washington and elsewhere across the country Thousands gather in London to support trans rights following UK ruling over definition of woman Cekar said she will vote for the left-wing coalition because \u201cit is the only political party that addresses racism and Islamophobia.\u201d \u201cI fear the rise of the National Rally because I am afraid that they will ban the hijab in name of women\u2019s liberty. I am a woman and I should be able to decide what I want to wear. I am a free woman,\u201d she said, adding that she is insulted on social media and in the streets on a daily basis because of her headscarf. Against the backdrop of music of French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, the crowd chanted \u201cEveryone hates racism.\u201d \u201cFrance is made up of people of different origins. It is its strength. The National Rally wants to break that,\u201d 68-year-old Mohamed Benammar, a French doctor with Tunisian roots who works in a Paris public hospital, told AP. \u201cWe provide medical care to everyone, without worrying about their nationality, the color of their skin or their religion, unlike the fascists (extreme-right leaders) that single out Black, Arabs or Muslim people,\u201d he said. Although his son told him that it was useless to protest, Bennamar said he\u2019s convinced that it is important to make his voice heard. \u201cI am here to send a strong signal to politicians. We won\u2019t stay silent in the face of the far right,\u201d he said. Police in Paris reported \u201cnumerous attempts at damage\u201d by protesters. They said that nine protesters were arrested and three officers were injured. An AP journalist said police used tear gas against demonstrators who tried to vandalize a bus stop and advertising boards. In the French Riviera city of Nice, protesters marched down Jean M\u00e9decin Avenue, the city\u2019s main shopping street, chanting against the National Rally, its leader Jordan Bardella as well as against President Emmanuel Macron. Local police said 2,500 people took part. Nice is traditionally a conservative stronghold, but has over the past decade turned firmly in favor of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally and her far-right rival Eric Zemmour. Crowds have been gathering daily ever since the anti-immigration National Rally made historic gains in the European Parliament elections on Sunday , crushing Macron\u2019s pro-business moderates and prompting him to dissolve the National Assembly. New elections for the lower house of parliament were set in two rounds, for June 30 and July 7. Macron remains president until 2027 and in charge of foreign policy and defense, but his presidency would be weakened if the National Rally wins and takes power of the government and domestic policy. \u201cWe need a democratic and social upsurge \u2014 if not the extreme right will take power,\u2019' French unions said in a statement Friday. \u201cOur Republic and our democracy are in danger.\u2019' They noted that in Europe and across the world, extreme-right leaders have passed laws detrimental to women, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color. To prevent the National Rally party from winning the upcoming elections, left-wing parties finally agreed Friday to set aside differences over the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and form a coalition . They urged French citizens to defeat the far right. French opinion polls suggest the National Rally \u2014 whose founder has been repeatedly convicted of racism and antisemitism \u2014 is expected to be ahead in the first round of the parliamentary elections. The party came out on top in the European elections, garnering more than 30% of the vote cast in France, almost twice as many votes as Macron\u2019s party Renaissance. Macron\u2019s term is still on for three more years, and he would retain control over foreign affairs and defense regardless of the result of the French parliamentary elections. But his presidency would be weakened if the National Rally wins, which could put its 28-year-old party leader Bardella on track to become the next prime minister, with authority over domestic and economic affairs. ___ Morton reported from London.

Almost out of fuel and on a wet track, Denmark's Nicklas Nielsen took the checkered flag in the 499P hypercar shared with Italian Antonio Fuoco and Spaniard Miguel Molina over 311 laps of the Sarthe circuit. The Toyota GR010 hybrid driven by Jose Maria Lopez, Kamui Kobayashi and Nyck de Vries finished 14.221 seconds behind after starting 23rd. Nielsen, Fuoco and Molina were all first-time overall winners, but the outcome remained open right to the end in a race with a safety car period lasting more than four hours during the night. The car's fuel gauge was registering around 2% at the finish. \"The worst for me was when they asked me to go slower because that's usually where the mistakes happen,\" Nielsen said about saving fuel to the finish. \"The last lap was so long. They kept me updated on the gap ... so it was just about managing the gap to the car in P2 [second]. ...

The seven countries had deficits \u2013 the shortfall between government revenue and spending \u2013 above 3% of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules. The news will be a blow to Macron as it is the first time France returns to the EU's public spending sin bin since he came to power in 2017. And it sets the stage for a potential clash between Paris and Brussels following elections on June 30 and July 7 \u2013 in which the far right and left, ahead in the polls, are pledging to spend more at a time when France will need to make cuts. Column Subscribers only 'Political instability and the prospect of the RN coming to power are throwing the markets and the business world into disarray' Macron plunged France into political turmoil by calling the snap vote after his party's crushing defeat to the far right in the EU elections earlier this month. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that France could be thrown into a debt crisis if the spending programs of either the far right or a new left-wing alliance were adopted. Interview Subscribers only French finance minister: 'Reducing state spending by \u20ac10 billion is a first step' The political uncertainty has hurt French stocks as Paris, which was Europe's biggest stock market by valuation, lost its crown this week to London. 'No return to austerity' Brussels is reprimanding nations for the first time since the EU suspended the rules after the 2020 Covid pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war, as states propped up businesses and households with public money. The EU spent two years during the suspension overhauling the budget rules to make them more workable and give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defense. But two sacred goals remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60% of national output, with a public deficit of no more than 3%. \"After almost four years under the General Escape Clause, our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle,\" the EU's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said in a statement. \"This does not mean 'back to normal,' because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not 'back to austerity,' because this would be a terrible mistake.\" Editorial Macron's ostrich policy regarding public finances The Commission will formally propose opening excessive deficit procedures for the seven countries in July to the EU's finance ministers. It also noted in Wednesday's statement that Romania had \"not taken effective action to correct\" its excessive deficit, despite opening a procedure in 2020 based on 2019 data. The EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year are Italy (7.4%), Hungary (6.7%), Romania (6.6%), France (5.5%) and Poland (5.1%). Break with the past Countries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, until action is taken to address the violation. In practice, though, the Commission has never gone as far as levying fines \u2013 fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.

Under the new rules, countries with an excessive deficit must reduce it by 0.5 points each year, which would require a massive undertaking.

Adopted in 1997 ahead of the arrival of the single currency in 1999, the rules known as the Stability and Growth Pact seek to prevent lax budgetary policies by setting the strict goal of balanced accounts.

Among the injured, two individuals sustained serious wounds, with one reported to be in critical condition, stated a police spokesperson. The perpetrators, described as several masked gunmen armed with firearms, fled the scene. The shooting occurred at the Eden Palace, a venue specializing in weddings, where approximately a hundred people were gathered. \"As reported by a police source, the incident unfolded around 1.15am during a wedding reception.

The assailants arrived in a 4X4 vehicle, likely a BMW, according to the same source. Authorities are investigating whether the vehicle originated from Germany or Luxembourg, located approximately fifteen kilometers away. \"The incident appears to be linked to settling scores related to drug trafficking rather than a deliberate attack on the wedding event itself,\" the source commented. Investigators were observed collecting samples from a vehicle at the scene by reporters on Sunday morning. At least three bullet holes were visible on a glass door leading into the expansive reception hall. \"Numerous shell casings were recovered from the site,\" noted the local daily Le R\u00e9publicain lorrain.

The French interior minister said Thursday that 30,000 police officers will be deployed on voting day, including 5,000 in the Paris region. Tensions are high as left-wing and moderate groups try to prevent the anti-immigration, nationalist National Rally from winning an absolute legislative majority, which would be a first and a major historical shift for France. Candidates have complained of both hate speech and physical violence in the brief and polarizing campaign for the snap elections. Thevenot, a candidate for the centrist Ensemble alliance led by President Emmanuel Macron, said she and a deputy and a party activist were putting up election posters in Meudon near Paris on Wednesday night when a group attacked them. Thevenot\u2019s deputy and the party activist were taken to a hospital. \u2019\u2019The symbolic violence of words quickly was replaced by physical violence,\u2033 she told reporters while back on the campaign trail Thursday. \u2018\u2019We are still a bit shocked ...

The prosecutor\u2019s office said it opened an investigation into a gang assault with a weapon against a public official. Four people, including three minors, are in custody, prosecutors said. Politicians on all sides condemned the attack and others on candidates from various parties. Marie Dauchy, a National Rally candidate in Savoy, said she was assaulted Wednesday at a food market while campaigning and announced she was abandoning the race. Her party\u2019s leader and three-time presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, said on X that two men had \u201ccowardly\u201d assaulted Dauchy. Nicolas Conquer, a candidate for The Republicans, said on social media that he was assaulted while distributing election flyers in the Atlantic coast city of Cherbourg on Tuesday. He was accompanied by a minor when the incident happened, and reported it to police, he said. In the Alps, 77-year-old local official Bernard Dupre was beaten while hanging campaign posters for former Health Minister Olivier Veran, Veran said Thursday. French media broadcast images of Dupre\u2019s bloodied eye. \u201cLet\u2019s reject the climate of violence and hatred that is taking hold,\u201d Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Thursday on X. \u201cThis climate is deplorable,\u201d Le Pen said in a TV interview. A few hours before being targeted, Thevenot had shared her anxiety as a person of color in a \u201ccomplicated\u201d political situation with French broadcaster TF1. Her parents hail from the African island of Mauritius. \u201cI don\u2019t say this only as spokesperson of the government, but more as the daughter of immigrants and mother of mixed-race children,\u201d she said, citing repeated and intensified racist attacks. \u201cThey no longer do it anonymously, but with uncovered faces and even with a certain pride.\u201d Many people have voiced concerns that the surge in voter support for the fiercely anti-immigration National Rally has made people feel more comfortable using racist, xenophobic and antisemitic language in public. A candidate who campaigned in the outskirts of Paris for Macron\u2019s camp was assigned private security guards by her party after she said she was the target of antisemitic abuse. Pamphlets targeting Black people appeared in mailboxes in the Paris suburb of Chatou, shocking residents. Activist group SOS Racisme filed a legal complaint for inciting hatred, and said that its offices around France have seen a rise in reports of racist comments and acts during the campaign. The government agency tallying racist acts did not have recent data since the brief campaign began. French newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported that Fadila Khattabi, the minister for people with disabilities and the daughter of Algerian immigrants, was in tears when she shared a personal story at a ministerial meeting at the Elys\u00e9e Palace on Monday. \u201cConsidering my origins, I am scared of racist speech,\u201d she said, according to the newspaper. \u201cMy son, a symbol of republican success, a child of immigration who became a pharmacist, now wants to leave France, out of fear of a National Rally victory.\u201d A group called the Antifascist Action Paris-Suburbs called for a protest outside the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, on Sunday night as results come in to stand up against the far right. Le Pen denounced the call. Macron called a surprise legislative election on June 9 after his centrist alliance suffered a punishing defeat at the hands of the National Rally in French voting for the European Parliament, plunging the country into a chaotic, sudden legislative campaign. ___ Angela Charlton in Paris contributed. ___ Follow AP coverage of global elections at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/global-elections\/","question":"What political party secured the most votes in the first round of France's early legislative elections in June 2024?","answer":"The National Rally secured the most votes in the first round.","region":"France","question_translated":"Quel parti politique a obtenu le plus de voix au premier tour des \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives anticip\u00e9es en France en juin 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Le Rassemblement national a obtenu le plus de voix au premier tour.","model_answer":"Since the election has not yet taken place, I'll provide a response based on available information up to my last update.

Seven independence activists linked to a group accused of orchestrating riots last month in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia have been sent to mainland France for pre-trial detention, according to the local prosecutor. \u201cThis transfer was organised during the night by means of a plane specially chartered for the mission,\u201d Yves Dupas, the public prosecutor in the territory\u2019s capital, Noumea, said in a statement on Sunday. The seven were sent to France, he added, \u201cdue to the sensitivity of the procedure and in order to allow the investigations to continue in a calm manner, free of any pressure\u201d. Among the seven detainees was Christian Tein, head of the pro-independence group Field Action Coordination Cell (CCAT), who has been in custody and was charged on Saturday over the recent violence in which nine people died, including two police. Hundreds of people were wounded and damage estimated at $1.6bn was inflicted during the unrest over controversial voting reforms.    Authorities did not immediately specify what charges Tein faces, but Dupas said his investigation covered armed robbery and complicity in murder or attempted murder, according to French daily Le Monde. Tein\u2019s lawyer Pierre Ortent said on Saturday he was \u201cstupefied\u201d that his client was being sent to France, accusing magistrates of \u201canswering to purely political considerations\u201d. \u201cNo one had any idea in advance that they would be sent to mainland France. These are totally exceptional steps\u201d for New Caledonia, Ortent said. Stephane Bonomo, lawyer for another detainee, Gilles Joredie, said the prosecutors\u2019 actions were creating \u201cmartyrs for the independence cause\u201d, according to Le Monde. CCAT group\u2019s communications chief Brenda Wanabo was also one of the suspects sent to almost 17,000km (10,563 miles) away, to France, Le Monde added. Riots, street barricades and looting broke out in New Caledonia in May over an electoral reform that would have allowed long-term residents to participate in local polls. Paris deployed troops to the territory in response. The archipelago\u2019s Indigenous Kanaks feared the move would dilute their vote, putting hopes for eventually winning independence definitively out of reach.

Snap national elections called by pro-business moderate President Emmanuel Macron have plunged the country into a hasty and disorderly electoral race, in which hate speech is becoming a growing concern. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin announced Wednesday that the government ordered the shutdown of several groups peddling extremist hatred. A series of decrees announcing the shutdown outlined investigations into the groups and said they posed risks of violence. The groups affected include GUD, known for violence and antisemitism. Its members have supported far-right political leader Marine Le Pen in the past. Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party is leading all polls ahead of the two-round elections, June 30 and July 7, while Macron\u2019s centrist alliance is lagging far behind. However, the outcome remains highly uncertain due to the complex, two-stage voting system and potential political alliances.

Another targeted group, called Les Remparts, is accused of inciting hate, discrimination and violence toward foreigners and non-white people, according to Interior Ministry decrees reviewed by The Associated Press. Some members, a decree said, wear a jacket bearing the inscription \u201cWhite Division\u2019\u2019 and the group has offered self-defense trainings. The ministry cites a 2023 attack in which dozens of hooded far-right militants, armed with iron bars, attacked a civil society group at a conference about Palestinians. Some of the attackers had ties with Les Remparts, the decree said. Another decree targeted a group called Jonas Paris, which it said claims to support France\u2019s Muslim community but instead promotes violence, hate and discrimination toward non-Muslims, women and LGBTQ+ people. Antisemitic and anti-Muslim discourse has also surfaced in the campaign . Activist group SOS Racisme announced Wednesday it filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the spread of a widely shared video that mocks people of African origin and tells them to \u2018\u2019go home.\u2019\u2019 The lawsuit is seeking charges of provocation of racial hatred against the video\u2019s creators. Noting similar videos that have appeared in Germany, the group said, \u2018\u2019these expressions of unbridled racism reflect a climate of the freeing-up of racist speech, fed by the worrying scores of the far right\u2019\u2019 in recent elections around Europe . Facing the prospect that France could elect its first far-right government since the Nazi occupation during World War II, other parties have been scrambling to form alliances and field candidates . The elections were called by Macron earlier this month after his party suffered a crushing defeat in the European Parliament election . In a TV debate Tuesday night, young and fast-rising National Rally president Jordan Bardella renewed his proposal to abolish free health care for foreigners and toughen regulations around acquiring French nationality. His proposal to prevent dual citizens from accessing certain \u201cstrategic\u201d state jobs in particular attracted the ire of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who said it revealed the true objectives of a party that has long been tied to xenophobia and racism. \u201cThe message you are sending is that when we are dual citizens, we are half-citizens, we are not real French people,\u201d Attal said. Attal suggested the real targets of this measure are not dual citizens with high-level positions, when he said Bardella\u2019s party had a Franco-Russian representative in the European Parliament. Bardella has softened many of the party\u2019s hard-line positions, and was put on the spot during the debate over another key issue, the age of retirement. Macron\u2019s raised it last year from 62 to 64, prompting months of protests that weakened his government. The National Rally backs the idea of setting back the retirement age to 62, but Bardella said 42 years of work would be needed for entitlement to a full pension, de facto raising the retirement age for those who started working later in their 20s. Eric Bompard, of the France Unbowed party, part of a new left-wing coalition, also came after Bardella\u2019s economic program and his proposal to lift taxes for people under 30. Bompard said the National Rally\u2019s program would contribute to making the rich richer, at the expense of the poorest 30% share of the population, while Attal accused the 28-year-old Bardella of personally benefiting from the measure. \u201cWhy would a 31-year-old laborer pay taxes, while a 29-year-old consultant or trader would stop paying?\u201d Attal asked. ___ Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of global elections at: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/global-elections\/","question":"Which far-right group known for violence and antisemitism was dissolved by the French government in June 2024?","answer":"The French government dissolved the far-right group Groupe Union D\u00e9fense (GUD) in June 2024.","region":"France","question_translated":"Quel groupe d'extr\u00eame droite connu pour ses violences et son antis\u00e9mitisme a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissous par le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais en juin 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais a dissous le groupe d'extr\u00eame droite Groupe Union D\u00e9fense (GUD) en juin 2024.","model_answer":"Answer: Les Zouaves Paris.

High drama, for sure, but this was a shock. When the graphics flashed up on all the big French channels, it was not the far right of Marine Le Pen and her young prime minister-in-waiting Jordan Bardella who were on course for victory. It was the left who had clinched it, and Emmanuel Macron's centrists - the Ensemble alliance - had staged an unexpected comeback, pushing the far-right National Rally (RN) into third. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the veteran left-wing firebrand seen by his critics as an extremist, wasted no time in proclaiming victory. \"The president must call on the New Popular Front to govern,\" he told supporters in Stalingrad square, insisting Mr Macron had to recognise that he and his coalition had lost. His alliance, drawn up in a hurry for President Macron's surprise election, includes his own radical France Unbowed, along with Greens, Socialists and Communists and even Trotskyists. But their victory is nowhere big enough to govern. France is going to have a hung parliament. None of the three blocs can form an outright majority by themselves of 289 seats in the 577-seat parliament. Live: France faces hung parliament deadlock after left alliance wins most seats As soon as he had spoken, Mr M\u00e9lenchon went off to a much bigger square, Place de la R\u00e9publique, to celebrate his success with a crowd of 8,000 people, according to police numbers. For National Rally's supporters the champagne was fast turning flat at their celebration-gone-wrong in the Bois de Vincennes forest to the south-east of Paris. Only a week ago all the talk had been of a possible absolute majority, and Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were still talking up their chances a couple of days before the vote. Marine Le Pen put a brave face on it. \"Two years ago we had just seven MPs. Tonight RN is the first party in France in terms of MP numbers.\" In the last parliament they had 88 MPs and now more than 140, so she was right. And no other party has more than 100 MPs, because the Macronists and the Popular Front are both coalitions. Jordan Bardella complained that his party had been foiled by unnatural \"alliances of dishonour\", forged by a \"single party\" made up of the Macron camp and the left. He wasn't wrong about the unnatural alliance, but it is only a temporary one of convenience. Listen: How France's second round unfolded More than 200 candidates who saw themselves as part of a \"republican front\", pulled out of the second round so that a better-placed rival could stop RN winning. Not even Marine Le Pen's younger sister, Marie-Caroline, was able to offer a glimmer of good news from her own election battle around Le Mans. Her bid to get into parliament failed by just 225 votes, defeated by Mr M\u00e9lenchon's candidate, Elise Leboucher, after the Macron candidate dropped out. Turnout, at 66.63%, was the highest in a parliamentary second round since 1997. Even if RN's vote held up, this time it was having to contend with non-RN votes often being used tactically to create a \"barrage\" or block against them. All over France, RN was losing run-offs it needed to win. JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER\/AFP Marie-Caroline Le Pen was unable to increase her family's representation in parliament Some of their candidates were less than appealing. There was the woman who promised to stop making racist jokes if she was elected in Puy-de-D\u00f4me; and then there was the ill-equipped young man in Haute-Savoie in the south-east who took part in a TV debate with his centrist rival and made barely any sense on anything. They both lost, but they reflected RN's big advance in rural areas. RN scored 32% of the vote - 37% with their right-wing allies - and for more than 10 million voters a taboo has been broken. In Meaux, east of Paris, RN won but not by much. After casting her vote, Claudine said people she knew tended not to admit to voting RN, unless they were with close friends. Claudine voting in Meaux east of Paris, with her dog Zapie Before the projected result at 8pm, there was fevered speculation about whether President Macron would come out and speak. Word spread that he had gone into a meeting 90 minutes earlier. Gabriel Attal, his beleaguered prime minister, eventually appeared to give the government's response. Four weeks ago, he had sat stony-faced and arms folded opposite the president as Mr Macron revealed his election plan. Now he announced he would be handing his boss his resignation in the morning, but he would stay on as long as duty called. Mr Attal is supposed to fly off on Tuesday evening to a Nato meeting in Washington. It's hard to imagine him being replaced just yet. France has entered a period of political instability with no obvious way out. There had been talk of unrest on the streets, but only a handful of incidents were reported in Paris and cities including Nantes and Lyon, All eyes are now on the president, who will have to navigate a way out of this deadlock. The new National Assembly is due to convene in 10 days' time, but the Paris Olympics starts on 26 July and France could do with a period of calm.

The spire had been in renovation for years and was surrounded by scaffolding and a white cover when the fire began about 120 metres above ground level. Eye-witness Patrick Waeselynck told BFM television he was sitting at a cafe terrace when he heard shouts of \"fire\". \"I turn around and I see the cathedral spire, the tarpaulin which was protecting the restoration work, which was burning, big flames, black smoke,\" he said. \"The first thing we thought was what happened in Paris, it was a shock of course.

The soldier was hospitalized with a shoulder blade injury, but was not in life-threatening condition, and the motive for the attack was under investigation, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said. An investigation was opened into attempted murder, and the suspect\u2019s identity was being confirmed, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Authorities did not suspect terrorism as a motive at this stage, according to the national counterterrorism prosecutor\u2019s office. The soldier was among thousands of troops serving in the Sentinelle force for France\u2019s domestic security, created to guard prominent French sites after a string of deadly Islamic extremist attacks in 2015.

People had watched in horror as 40 fire trucks rushed to the site and emergency workers set up a cordon around the cathedral, a jewel of French medieval Gothic architecture made famous by the paintings of impressionist Claude Monet in the 19th century. Sign up here. The flames were officially put out at 4:30 p.m. (1430GMT), local fire authorities said. The spire had been in renovation for years and was surrounded by scaffolding and a white cover when the fire began about 120 metres above ground level. Eye-witness Patrick Waeselynck told BFM television he was sitting at a cafe terrace when he heard shouts of \"fire\". \"I turn around and I see the cathedral spire, the tarpaulin which was protecting the restoration work, which was burning, big flames, black smoke,\" he said. \"The first thing we thought was what happened in Paris, it was a shock of course. But the police arrived, they set up a security perimeter, the firefighters arrived.\" Workers involved in the renovation raised the alarm, said fire brigade chief Stephane Gouezec. \"The elements that were combusting when we arrived were plastic elements from the worksite,\" Gouezec told several TV channels just outside the building.

We have many, many policies so that these accidents don't happen.\" He added he thought a spark from a weld could have fallen onto a plastic cabin interior at the work site. A local official said they were assessing if any parts of the cathedral or its art works had been damaged by the jets of water used to fight the fire. \"It is one of the most beautiful monuments in the city and we hope that there will not be too much damage,\" said Benjamin Gliksman, 42, who owns a record shop. The 2019 fire at Notre-Dame in Paris also started during renovation works and destroyed the cathedral's roof, the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Five years on, restoration of the Paris landmark continues and its reopening to worshippers is scheduled for December. As of April this year the renovation had cost 550 million euros ($599 million). Earlier this year a massive fire hit another historic European building, Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange , toppling its spire. Large parts of the outer walls later collapsed.

The 18-year-old suspected neo-Nazi was the administrator of a group on the Telegram phone application called \"French Aryan division\" where he made threats against the July 26-August 11 Paris Olympics , the source said. He was detained in the eastern Bas-Rhin region, which includes the city of Strasbourg, and was being questioned by anti-terror police. French security services are on high alert ahead of the Paris Games when around 10 million visitors and 10,000 athletes are expected in the French capital. In May, they arrested a Chechen teenager suspected of plotting an \"Islamist-inspired\" attack on an Olympics football game in the southeastern city of Saint-Etienne. Le Parisien newspaper, which first reported the arrest of the far-right suspect on Wednesday, said the young man had followers on Telegram who were prepared to mount attacks and had threatened violence against a Paris-based drag queen who took part in the Olympic torch rally at the weekend.

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"No party wins a majority in the National Assembly, with the left-wing New Popular Front gaining a plurality of seats and the far-right National Rally coming in third place.","text":"What just happened in France's shock election? 8 July 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby BBC News in Paris Share Save Jubilation and stunned silence: France reacts to exit polls Nobody expected this. High drama, for sure, but this was a shock. When the graphics flashed up on all the big French channels, it was not the far right of Marine Le Pen and her young prime minister-in-waiting Jordan Bardella who were on course for victory. It was the left who had clinched it, and Emmanuel Macron's centrists - the Ensemble alliance - had staged an unexpected comeback, pushing the far-right National Rally (RN) into third. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the veteran left-wing firebrand seen by his critics as an extremist, wasted no time in proclaiming victory. \"The president must call on the New Popular Front to govern,\" he told supporters in Stalingrad square, insisting Mr Macron had to recognise that he and his coalition had lost. His alliance, drawn up in a hurry for President Macron's surprise election, includes his own radical France Unbowed, along with Greens, Socialists and Communists and even Trotskyists. But their victory is nowhere big enough to govern. France is going to have a hung parliament. None of the three blocs can form an outright majority by themselves of 289 seats in the 577-seat parliament. Live: France faces hung parliament deadlock after left alliance wins most seats As soon as he had spoken, Mr M\u00e9lenchon went off to a much bigger square, Place de la R\u00e9publique, to celebrate his success with a crowd of 8,000 people, according to police numbers. For National Rally's supporters the champagne was fast turning flat at their celebration-gone-wrong in the Bois de Vincennes forest to the south-east of Paris. Only a week ago all the talk had been of a possible absolute majority, and Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were still talking up their chances a couple of days before the vote. Marine Le Pen put a brave face on it. \"Two years ago we had just seven MPs. Tonight RN is the first party in France in terms of MP numbers.\" In the last parliament they had 88 MPs and now more than 140, so she was right. And no other party has more than 100 MPs, because the Macronists and the Popular Front are both coalitions. Jordan Bardella complained that his party had been foiled by unnatural \"alliances of dishonour\", forged by a \"single party\" made up of the Macron camp and the left. He wasn't wrong about the unnatural alliance, but it is only a temporary one of convenience. Listen: How France's second round unfolded More than 200 candidates who saw themselves as part of a \"republican front\", pulled out of the second round so that a better-placed rival could stop RN winning. Not even Marine Le Pen's younger sister, Marie-Caroline, was able to offer a glimmer of good news from her own election battle around Le Mans. Her bid to get into parliament failed by just 225 votes, defeated by Mr M\u00e9lenchon's candidate, Elise Leboucher, after the Macron candidate dropped out. Turnout, at 66.63%, was the highest in a parliamentary second round since 1997. Even if RN's vote held up, this time it was having to contend with non-RN votes often being used tactically to create a \"barrage\" or block against them. All over France, RN was losing run-offs it needed to win. JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER\/AFP Marie-Caroline Le Pen was unable to increase her family's representation in parliament Some of their candidates were less than appealing. There was the woman who promised to stop making racist jokes if she was elected in Puy-de-D\u00f4me; and then there was the ill-equipped young man in Haute-Savoie in the south-east who took part in a TV debate with his centrist rival and made barely any sense on anything. They both lost, but they reflected RN's big advance in rural areas. RN scored 32% of the vote - 37% with their right-wing allies - and for more than 10 million voters a taboo has been broken. In Meaux, east of Paris, RN won but not by much. After casting her vote, Claudine said people she knew tended not to admit to voting RN, unless they were with close friends. Claudine voting in Meaux east of Paris, with her dog Zapie Before the projected result at 8pm, there was fevered speculation about whether President Macron would come out and speak. Word spread that he had gone into a meeting 90 minutes earlier. Gabriel Attal, his beleaguered prime minister, eventually appeared to give the government's response. Four weeks ago, he had sat stony-faced and arms folded opposite the president as Mr Macron revealed his election plan. Now he announced he would be handing his boss his resignation in the morning, but he would stay on as long as duty called. Mr Attal is supposed to fly off on Tuesday evening to a Nato meeting in Washington. It's hard to imagine him being replaced just yet. France has entered a period of political instability with no obvious way out. There had been talk of unrest on the streets, but only a handful of incidents were reported in Paris and cities including Nantes and Lyon, All eyes are now on the president, who will have to navigate a way out of this deadlock. The new National Assembly is due to convene in 10 days' time, but the Paris Olympics starts on 26 July and France could do with a period of calm. Left-leaning newspaper Lib\u00e9ration summed up the whole night with the headline C'est Ouf . A relief for them that voters brought RN's bid for power to a halt.

The local prosecutor said officials were investigating the blaze as a potential arson attack. Flames engulfed the upper floors of an apartment block in the Moulins area of Nice,  close to the city's airport. The mayor of Nice said they had images that clearly showed the fire had been caused by petrol poured into a stairwell by hooded people during the night. Visiting the scene later, caretaker Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said three people were being sought by police. Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said three young children were among the victims and that police would \"shed light on the circumstances of this terrible tragedy\". The fire broke out on second floor and spread quickly to the upper floors. Nice prosecutor Damien Martinelli told journalists that in light of initial findings, \"I have opened an inquiry into acts of arson as the cause of death.\" Local reports said the seven victims were all part of the same family. Officials said three adults, a teenager and younger children aged five, seven and 10 had died. Two members of the family are said to have tried to escape through a window - one died and the other is in a critical condition. Prefect Hugues Moutouh said everyone had been affected by the tragedy and \"very determined to provide help and assistance to the survivors\". One man called Iftahou told the Nice Matin website that he had arrived at the scene while the fire was burning and realised there was no hope for those inside. The head of the Comorian community in the south of France, Najim Maecha, said he knew the family and that they had lived in Nice since about 2013. Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said the human toll of the disaster was extremely high. As well as the seven victims, another 30 people have suffered smoke inhalation. \"I've asked the interior minister to deploy security forces to ensure residents' safety and avoid new incidents after this tragedy that's being investigated as potential arson,\" he said. President Emmanuel Macron, on a visit to the UK, said \"our thoughts are with the victims' relatives. We are on their side and on the side of the people of Nice\".

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach also visited the Village to the north of the French capital, where thousands of athletes and officials are arriving, with up to 14,500 expected there at the peak of the Games. Comprising 40 different low-rise housing blocks, the complex has been built by employing innovative construction techniques using low-carbon concrete, water recycling and reclaimed building materials. It was also intended to be free of air-conditioning with a natural cooling system, but some Olympic delegations are unconvinced and have ordered around 2,500 portable cooling units for their athletes. Seine-Saint-Denis, where the main athletics stadium for the Olympics is also situated, is the poorest area in France and is hoping to reap benefits from the sports extravaganza. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach speaks to IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior at the Athletes' Village. \u00a9 David Goldman, AFP Macron promised the area would not be forgotten after the Olympics. \"I will come back after the Games to see the legacy with you and to see how life has changed,\" he said. Israelis 'welcome' Meanwhile, France's foreign minister said Israeli athletes were welcome at the Paris Games after a hard-left member of the French parliament sparked outrage by urging them to stay away because of the conflict in Gaza. \"The Israeli delegation is welcome in France,\" Stephane Sejourne said in Brussels ahead of talks with his Israeli counterpart, adding that the call by France Unbowed (LFI) lawmaker Thomas Portes for the country's exclusion had been \"irresponsible and dangerous\". \"We will ensure the security of the delegation,\" Sejourne added. Portes drew an angry response from French Jewish groups and both political opponents and allies. Yonathan Arfi, head of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (Crif), said the comments were \"putting a target on the backs of Israeli athletes\". Arfi said Israeli athletes were \"already the most in danger at the Olympic Games \", recalling the 11 \"murdered by Palestinian terrorists\" at the 1972 Munich Games. Meanwhile, French security forces were continuing preparations for the unprecedented opening ceremony on Friday, the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium. Between 6,000 and 7,000 athletes are to sail down the river on 85 barges and boats, with a backdrop of world-famous monuments including Notre-Dame cathedral, currently being renovated after a devastating fire in 2019. The athletes will disembark for the culmination of a ceremony at the Trocadero opposite the Eiffel Tower that organisers promise will be spectacular. Up to 300,000 ticketed spectators will watch from stands and on the river banks and another 200,000 are expected to watch from the overlooking apartments. Turning to the sport , Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogacar is setting his sights on Olympic gold in the road race after winning the Tour de France for the third time on Sunday. \"We are living in the golden age of cycling ,\" Pogacar said after completing a commanding victory in Nice, where the finish was moved to because of the Olympic preparations in Paris.

The president\u2019s office said in a statement that Macron \u201caccepted\u201d the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and other ministers on Tuesday. Attal and other government members are \u201cto handle current affairs until a new government is being appointed,\u201d the statement said. There is no firm timeline for when Macron must name a new prime minister, following parliamentary elections this month that left the National Assembly with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France\u2019s modern Republic. The caretaker government led by Attal will focus only on handling day-to-day affairs. \u201cFor this period to end as quickly as possible, it is up to all Republican forces to work together\u201d around \u201cprojects and actions that serve the French people,\u201d the president\u2019s statement said. The opening session of the National Assembly, France\u2019s powerful lower house of parliament, is scheduled for Thursday. RELATED COVERAGE Trump says Ukraine-Russia talks \u2018coming to a head\u2019 and \u2018no one is playing\u2019 him in push to end war France\u2019s president says that making Haiti pay for its independence was unjust Rubio and Witkoff met Ukrainian and European officials for landmark talks on Ukraine\u2019s future Normally, members of government are barred from being lawmakers, but Tuesday\u2019s move allows Attal to take up his seat as a lawmaker and lead the group of Macron\u2019s centrist allies in the National Assembly. It also insulates him from a no-confidence vote, because he already has resigned and a caretaker government cannot be subject to such a vote. France has been on the brink of government paralysis since elections for the National Assembly earlier this month resulted in a split among three major political groupings: the New Popular Front leftist coalition, Macron\u2019s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. The New Popular Front won the most seats but fell well short of the outright majority needed to govern on its own. The leftist coalition\u2019s three main parties, the hard-left France Unbowed, the Socialists and the Greens, have urged the president to turn to them to form the new government, yet their internal talks have turned into a harsh dispute over whom to choose as prime minister. France Unbowed suspended the talks on Monday, accusing the Socialists of sabotaging candidacies they have put forward to replace Attal. Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure said Tuesday the leftist coalition needs \u201cto think, talk and resume discussions\u201d if it wants to meet \u201cthe expectation of the public\u201d and fulfill its promise that it \u201cis ready to govern.\u201d Faure acknowledged that lengthy discussions, public bickering and occasional angry verbal exchanges among the coalition\u2019s party leaders are \u201cnot a good look.\u201d But \u201cthe stakes are so high that it\u2019s not unusual for us to talk for a long time and that sometimes, we yell,\u201d Faure said on France Inter radio. National Rally vice president Sebastien Chenu said the quarreling on the left is a sign that the New Popular Front \u201cis not ready to govern.\u201d He also lashed out at Macron on Tuesday, saying the retention of Attal at the helm of government following two recent elections \u2014 for the European Parliament and the National Assembly -- was \u201ca denial of democracy.\u201d Keeping him on to manage \u201ccurrent affairs\u201d amounts to \u201cfailing\u201d the French people, Chenu said in an interview with Europe 1 and CNews broadcasters. \u201cWe cannot make something new out of something old,\u201d Chenu said. \u201cAttal must pack his bags, he and all his ministers.\u201d Politicians from the three main groups are also waging a battle over the presidency and key committees in the National Assembly, France\u2019s influential lower house of parliament. Manuel Bompard, a lawmaker of the France Unbowed said he supported the idea of blocking lawmakers from Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally from holding leading positions in the parliament\u2019s committees, such as finance, defense and others. Despite Le Pen\u2019s party finishing third in the elections, behind Macron\u2019s group of centrists and the leftist alliance, Bompard said in an interview with France 2 TV that there is \u201cno reason for us to help them access positions of responsibility.\u201d Le Pen, a leading figure in the French far right and a National Rally lawmaker, insisted that \u201call political forces must participate in the functioning\u201d of the parliament. \u201cThe people have spoken. There are 577 lawmakers who represent them,\u201d Le Pen said in a post on X. \u201cEven if I am the last one to defend democracy, I insist that the Macronists, the New Popular Front, the National Rally and Eric Ciotti (a National Rally ally) must be represented in the legislative body,\u201d she added. ___ Surk reported from Nice, France. ___ Follow AP\u2019s global election coverage at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/global-elections\/ and AP\u2019s Paris Olympics coverage at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/2024-paris-olympic-games SYLVIE CORBET Corbet is an Associated Press reporter based in Paris.

The man, born in 1984, was held in custody and placed under judicial investigation on suspicion of \u201corganising events likely to lead to destabilisation during the Olympic Games\u201d, a source in the state prosecution service, who asked not to be named, told AFP. The source said an investigation was opened into \u201cpassing intelligence to a foreign power in order to arouse hostilities in France\u201d, adding that the crime was punishable by up to 30 years in jail. Prosecutors said a visit to the man\u2019s home \u201cat the request of the interior ministry\u201d had uncovered evidence of the suspected plans. They did not give any details of the alleged plot, except to say that it was not terrorist in nature, and that specialist anti-terrorist prosecutors were not following the case. Authorities have investigated over a million people, including athletes, coaches, journalists, volunteers, security guards and even local residents near event locations ahead of the Olympics, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told weekly Paris Match on Tuesday. Of those, 4,360 were denied access to the Games, with people close to Darmanin telling AFP on Sunday that 880 were barred over suspicions of foreign interference. In recent months, several high-profile stunts have raised suspicion that foreign actors are trying to influence French public opinion or stoke divisions, notably about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas . They include dummy coffins labelled \u201cFrench soldiers in Ukraine\u201d left by the Eiffel Tower in June and red hands tagged on Paris\u2019s main Holocaust memorial in May. In October, soon after Hamas\u2019s attack, stars of David were tagged on buildings in the Paris region, with two Moldovans suspected to be working for the Russian FSB security service later arrested.

French rail hit by \u2018massive attack\u2019 as Olympics begin France\u2019s high-speed TGV rail network has been hit by \u201cmalicious acts\u201d, disrupting some of the nation\u2019s busiest lines on the day of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony . \u201cArson attacks were started to damage our facilities,\u201d state-owned railway operator SNCF said on Friday, adding that the \u201csimultaneous malicious acts\u201d had taken place overnight. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X that France\u2019s intelligence services have been mobilised to find the perpetrators as he characterised the attacks as \u201cacts of sabotage\u201d that were \u201cprepared and coordinated\u201d. Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete called the \u201cmassive attack\u201d against the rail network an \u201coutrageous criminal act\u201d. He described people fleeing from the scene of fires and the discovery of incendiary devices at the sites. SNCF said many routes would have to be cancelled \u201cat least all weekend while repairs are conducted\u201d as thousands of rail staff were deployed to repair the damage. CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou said about 800,000 customers had been impacted ahead of a busy weekend for holidaymakers. Arsonists had targeted installations along the lines connecting the capital, Paris, with the country\u2019s west, north and east. The southeastern line was not affected as \u201ca malicious act was foiled\u201d, the railway operator said. It urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations. Trains to neighbouring Belgium and to London under the English Channel were also affected. The attacks occurred against a backdrop of global tensions and heightened security measures as the city prepared for the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics on Friday, an event featuring 7,500 athletes, 300,000 spectators and an audience of VIPs. Reporting from Paris, Al Jazeera\u2019s Bernard Smith said: \u201cSecurity was always a concern at these Olympics, and here you see why.\u201d The apparently coordinated attacks were \u201ca clear indication of the enormous security challenges France is facing\u201d, he said. National police said authorities are investigating what happened. \u201cIt\u2019s completely appalling,\u201d Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera told BFMTV. \u201cTo target the games is to target France.\u201d \u201cThese games are for the athletes who have been dreaming of them for years and fighting for the holy grail of standing on the podium \u2013 and someone\u2019s sabotaging that for them,\u201d she said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also weighed in, saying he absolutely condemned the saboteurs and hoped for the quick identification of the perpetrators. \u201cIt is unacceptable to disrupt a celebration of peace like the Olympic Games with acts of violence. I hope that the French authorities soon identify the culprits,\u201d he said in a post on X. More than 45,000 police officers, 10,000 soldiers and 2,000 private security agents are being deployed for the opening ceremony with snipers on rooftops and drones keeping watch from the air. Smith said \u201can unprecedented security operation\u201d was in place. A large area along the Seine has been locked down for the ceremony, which will go along 6km (3.7 miles) of the river and will be \u201cwatched by more than 100 global leaders from countries across the world\u201d, he said. It was not immediately clear whether the arson attacks were linked to the international sports event. Smith highlighted the tense geopolitical backdrop against which the games are taking place with Israel continuing its war in Gaza and Russia making territorial gains in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron had called for an \u201cOlympic truce\u201d during a meeting with Xi Jinping when the Chinese president visited France in May. Given the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, there is not much hope for such a truce, Smith said. On the contrary, the event has attracted accusations of double standards given that Russian and Belarusian athletes were banned from participating under their countries\u2019 flags but Israel was still allowed to take part with 88 athletes. \u201cThe Palestine Olympic Committee called for Israel to be blocked \u2026 because of the war in Gaza, but those calls have fallen on deaf ears,\u201d Smith said.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - The leftist France Unbowed party announced legislative steps on Tuesday to try to scrap French President Emmanuel Macron's pension changes and reverse a rise in the legal retirement age to 64 from 62. The right-wing National Rally (RN) quickly offered its support for the legislation proposed by France Unbowed (LFI), potentially boosting its chances of winning parliamentary approval. Sign up here. Cancelling the pension reform, signed into law last year and aimed at protecting state finances and boosting productivity, is a key goal of the left-wing camp that emerged last month as the strongest parliamentary force after a snap election . But the left-wing camp fell short of a majority in the election, leaving it dependent on the support of other lawmakers to push through any new legislation. \"We will, today, put down a legal proposition to cancel the pension reforms,\" Mathilde Panot, who heads the group of LFI lawmakers in the National Assembly, told France Inter radio. Macron's decision to use special constitutional powers to increase the retirement age and scrap some beneficial rules for certain job categories resulted in violent street protests last year. Marine Le Pen's RN also campaigned on lowering the retirement age, while Macron's centrist bloc and other centre-right politicians said they would oppose such a move. \"This bill won't pass without the votes of the Rassemblement National. And, in sticking to our programme, we'll be voting for it,\" RN party spokesman and lawmaker Laurent Jacobelli told BFM TV. \"Your bill will pass thanks to us...and you'll have to say it loud and clear,\" he said. Members of the left-wing coalition could, however, face a difficult decision. While left-wing parties have said many times they are united in their determination to reduce the retirement age, LFI's partners in the New Popular Front coalition - which includes the Socialists, Greens and Communists - might shy away from a vote that can pass only with the backing of their right-wing nemesis. The bill, which is unlikely to be voted on before September, would not pass if with only the support of LFI and RN lawmakers. France is in a state of parliamentary deadlock since Macron's decision to call the election, with the current government likely to carry out its functions throughout the summer in a caretaker capacity.

Demonstrators wave Western Sahara flags during a protest against the Spanish government support for Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara, in Madrid, on March 26, 2022. \u00a9 Pierre-Philippe MARCOU \/ AFP For Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the DAWN think tank (Democracy for the Arab World Now), the recognition by France of Morocco's annexation on Western Sahara undermines the rule of law, not only in North Africa but all over the world, including in Ukraine. \"The only way to resolve the conflict and territorial dispute would be the promised referendum,\" she told RFI English. \"The annexation of Western Sahara is as illegal as the one of Crimea in Ukraine, or the annexation of Jerusalem by Israel. So, any decision from French President Macron to side with Rabat would cause harm with global implications,\" she added. \"This recognition will only encourage the impunity of regimes like Russia and Israel. If even France must fall in line behind US diktat on Western Sahara, France\u2019s own sovereignty has taken a hit.\u201d She thinks that Macron should have ignored the pressure from Morocco, as the country has no major leverage on France. Historical colonial dispute Western Sahara has for long been designated by the UN as a \"non-self-governing territory\" whose people \"have not yet attained a full measure of self-government\". An armed conflict has opposed Morocco to the Sahrawi separatists of the Polisario Front in this vast desert territory bordering the Atlantic since 1975. Polisario has been supported by Algeria , to where most Sahrawi refugees have fled. Sahrawi refugees in Algeria's camps \u00a9 UNHCR Morocco controls 80 percent of the territory, while an area bordering Mauritania that is almost totally landlocked is run by the Polisario Front. Morocco's interest in the land is in its fish-filled waters and significant phosphate reserves, but also and mostly on its historical claim regarding its \u00a0sovereignty over parts of the Sahara desert. The territorial dispute dates back to colonial times, when Spain ruled over the actual Western Sahara and parts of Morocco, while France held the rest of North Africa including\u00a0today's Algeria and Tunisia. Extension of UN mandate in Western Sahara: the status quo or agreement in sight? In its most recent report , the international Crisis Group said it regretted teh fact that the UN had not been able to bring all actors to the table and to find a peaceful, negotiated and democratic solution for the future of what the Polisario calls the last colonised part of Africa.

It included a ceasefire, a buffer zone that divided Western Sahara along the sand berm and provisions for a referendum on self-determination for the entire territory. It also created a UN mission, MINURSO , to monitor the ceasefire and organise the referendum vote. But the referendum never took place, and subsequent talks failed to make notable progress.

Sven Hoppe\/dpa\/picture alliance\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 The men\u2019s individual triathlon race at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has been postponed due to poor water quality levels in the River Seine, the sport\u2019s governing body, World Triathlon, announced on Monday. Originally scheduled for Tuesday, World Triathlon, its medical team, the International Olympic Committee and Paris city officials made the decision\u00a0to postpone\u00a0the men\u2019s race to Wednesday. \u201cParis 2024 and World Triathlon reiterate that their priority is the health of the athletes. The tests carried out in Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held,\u201d the press\u00a0release said. \u201cDespite the improvement on the water quality levels in the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable\u00a0limits.\u201d CNN video Related video CNN meteorologist explains how extreme weather might affect the Olympics Heavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday\u2019s opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall. Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday\u2019s race would go ahead as planned. French triathlon federation technical director Benjamin Maze told French media on Tuesday that \u201cthere was a bit of anger and disappointment on the part of the triathletes,\u201d as they found out today\u2019s event had been canceled. \u201cThe events were supposed to take place at 8 a.m., so when we heard the news, they were already at breakfast eating some rice. Well, the pre-race meal as usual,\u201d Maze told French network TF1. \u201cIn this kind of situation, you have to, you have to accept your emotions. Once again, this disappointment, this anger and then to leave in a resilient mood, to leave in a much more positive mood. In any case, that\u2019s what we encouraged them to do,\u201d he added. Maze said that that athletes are naturally \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the developments since they have been preparing for this moment for years but added that it\u2019s all part of the job. \u201cThey know that they are doing an outdoor sport, even more so in triathlon. We knew that we had had problems with water pollution in recent days,\u201d he said.

Michel Euler\/AP The best photos of the Paris Olympics Prev Next The decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world\u2019s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024. About $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river\u2019s water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine. One of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin \u2013 called the Austerlitz basin \u2013 which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Following rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris. But the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 \u2013 following rain the previous day \u2013 E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU\/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin. That\u2019s double the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, as per World Triathlon standards . For much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU\/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules , unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides the race can go ahead. The individual triathlon races will begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race \u2013 passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2013 before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. The women\u2019s triathlon is still scheduled for Wednesday and will take place prior to the men\u2019s race, according to Olympic officials. If the water levels don\u2019t improve by Wednesday, the original contingency date remains in place for Friday, August 2.","question":"Why was the men's individual triathlon race at the Paris 2024 Olympics postponed?","answer":"The race was postponed due to poor water quality levels in the Seine River.","region":"France","question_translated":"Pourquoi la course individuelle masculine de triathlon aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024 a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e ?","answer_translated":"La course a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e en raison de la mauvaise qualit\u00e9 de l'eau de la Seine.","model_answer":"Answer: La course individuelle masculine de triathlon aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024 a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e en raison de la mauvaise qualit\u00e9 de l'eau de la Seine.

The widely anticipated deal will see Serbia receive nine single-seat and three two-seat jets by 2029 for an undisclosed sum, according to Dassault chief executive Eric Trappier. The dozen multi-role fighter aircrafts will help Serbia modernize its air force and replace aging Soviet-era combat jets. \"We are happy to become part of the Rafale club.

Macron said the deal pointed to a \"long-term alliance between our two countries within a stronger and more sovereign Europe.\" The Rafale is a \"multi-role\" fighter that can be used to hunt enemy planes, strike ground and sea targets and carry out reconnaissance. The deal was just one of several agreements inked during Macron's visit.

The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Durov had arrived from Baku, in Azerbaijan , another source close to the case said. France 's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud , drug trafficking , cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism , one of the sources said. Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. \"Enough of Telegram's impunity,\" said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. France \u2018refusing to cooperate\u2019, says Russia The Russian embassy in Paris on Sunday accused French authorities of \"refusing to cooperate\" after Durov\u2019s arrest. \"We immediately asked French authorities to explain the reasons for this detention and demanded that his rights be protected and that consular access be granted. Up to now, the French side is refusing to cooperate on this question,\" the embassy said in a statement reported by Ria Novosti news agency. Responding to the news of Durov\u2019s arrest, Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president on Sunday said Telegram\u2019s founder had \u201cmiscalculated\u201d by fleeing Russia and thinking that he would never have to cooperate with the security services abroad. Medvedev related a conversation he had with Durov several years ago in which Medvedev told him that if he did not want to cooperate with law enforcement agencies,\u00a0 he would have problems in any country. Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Durov wanted to be a 'brilliant \"man of the world who lives wonderfully without a Motherland\". \"He miscalculated,\" Medvedev said. \"For all our common enemies now, he is Russian \u2013 and therefore unpredictable and dangerous.\" Platform of 'privacy' The encrypted messaging app, based in Dubai , has positioned itself as an alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data. Telegram has committed to never disclosing any information about its users. In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said he got the idea to launch an encrypted messaging app after coming under pressure from the Russian government when working at VK, a social network he created before selling it and leaving Russia in 2014. He said he then tried to settle in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco before choosing Dubai, which he praised for its business environment and \"neutrality\". People \"love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram\", Durov told Carlson. He said at the time that the platform had more than 900 million active users. By basing itself in the United Arab Emirates , Telegram has been able to shield itself from moderation laws at a time when Western countries are pressuring large platforms to remove illegal content. Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally, as well as for users to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content. Competitor messaging service WhatsApp introduced worldwide limits on message forwarding in 2019 after it was accused of enabling the spread of false information in India that led to lynchings.

Macron slammed the door on a potential leftist government on Monday, saying it would be immediately removed from power by a majority of lawmakers from other camps. Instead, he embarked on another round of talks with party leaders on Tuesday. Sign up here. But facing a hung parliament in which each of the three almost equal groupings - the left, Macron's centrist bloc and the far-right National Rally - have ruled out forming a coalition, the president appeared to be back to square one. \"This election is being stolen from us,\" Green party chief Marine Tondelier told local radio. \"We're not going to continue these sham consultations with a president who doesn't listen anyway ... and is obsessed with keeping control. He's not looking for a solution, he's trying to obstruct it,\" Tondelier said. Socialist Party president Olivier Faure told France 2 television he would not engage in what he called a \"parody of democracy\" now the prospect of a leftist-led government was off the table. The LFI, a hard-left party within the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance that won the most seats in a snap parliamentary election this summer, called for a mass protest against Macron on Sept. 7. NFP leaders have repeatedly asserted that France's next prime minister should come from their ranks, but Macron has ignored their claims. Macron, a pro-business centrist, thinks the balance of power lies more with the centre or centre-right.

Most of the victims were believed to be women, some under 18, and many of the passengers didn\u2019t have life preservers, officials said, with one calling it the deadliest migrant accident in the channel this year. \u201cUnfortunately, the bottom of the boat ripped open,\u201d said Olivier Barbarin, mayor of Le Portel near Boulogne-sur-Mer, where a first aid post was set up to treat victims. \u201cIf people don\u2019t know how to swim in the agitated waters ... it can go very quickly.\u201d Europe\u2019s increasingly strict asylum rules , growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants have been pushing them north. Before Tuesday\u2019s accident, at least 30 migrants had died or gone missing while trying to cross to the U.K. this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. Rescuers pulled a total of 65 people from the English Channel on Tuesday in a search that lasted more than four hours, according to Lt. Etienne Baggio, a spokesman for the French agency that oversees the stretch of sea where the boat ripped apart. Doctors confirmed 12 died, he said.

Adam Beernaert, director of the Civil Protection authority, whose personnel looks after rescued migrants once they reach land, said the people his team attended Tuesday were traumatized. \u201cWhat needs to be said is that they shouldn\u2019t cross,\u201d Beernaert told the AP. \u201cThe sea is not easy. Weather conditions change all the time.\u201d Baggio called it the deadliest migrant boat tragedy in the English Channel this year. In July, four migrants died while attempting the crossing on an inflatable boat that capsized and punctured. Five others, including a child, died in another attempt in April. And five dead were recovered from the seas or found washed up along a beach after a migrant boat ran into difficulties in the dark and winter cold of January. Many of those aboard the vessel that broke up in the English Channel on Tuesday didn\u2019t have life vests, Baggio said. He said the boat was an inflatable. Three helicopters, a plane, two fishing boats and more than six other vessels were involved in the rescue operation. In another sea tragedy Tuesday involving migrants seeking a better life in Europe, a boat carrying migrants capsized in the Mediterranean off the Libyan coast, leaving one person dead and 22 missing, Libyan authorities said. The agency overseeing the rescue operation in the English Channel said the boat got into difficulty off Gris-Nez point between Boulogne-sur-Mer and the port of Calais further north. Sea temperatures off northern France were around 20 degrees C, or about 68 F. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin went to Boulogne-sur-Mer to meet those involved in handling what he described as the \u201cterrible shipwreck.\u201d He said the boat was frail and small \u2014 less than 7 meters (23 feet) long \u2014 and that smugglers are packing more and more people aboard such vessels. Most of the people on the boat were believed to be from Eritrea, and most of the victims were women, he said. Last week, the leaders of France and the U.K. agreed to deepen cooperation on illegal migration in the channel. \u201cWe absolutely must \u2014 and this is a very important point \u2014 re-establish special relations with our British friends,\u201d Darmanin said on Tuesday. He later told the AP that to successfully tackle smuggling networks, immigration legislation between the U.K. and France should be harmonized. \u201cIt has now been 30 years that these problems remain, and it is absolutely necessary that we find solutions,\u201d said Barbarin, the mayor of Le Portel. U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called it \u201ca horrifying and deeply tragic incident\u201d and paid tribute to French rescuers \u201cwho undoubtedly saved many lives, but sadly could not save everyone.\u201d \u201cThe gangs behind this appalling and callous trade in human lives have been cramming more and more people onto increasingly unseaworthy dinghies, and sending them out into the Channel even in very poor weather,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not care about anything but the profits they make, and that is why \u2014 as well as mourning the awful loss of life \u2014 the work to dismantle these dangerous and criminal smuggler gangs and to strengthen border security is so vital and must proceed apace.\u201d At least 2,109 migrants have tried to cross the English Channel on small boats in the past seven days, according to U.K. Home Office data updated Tuesday.

A 33-year old Algerian suspect who was seen wrapped in a Palestinian flag following the attack is injured after resisting arrest in N\u00eemes.","text":"French police arrest synagogue blast suspect 25 August 2024 Share Save Malu Cursino & Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save Getty Images CCTV showed a suspected attacker at the synagogue in La Grande-Motte French police say they have arrested a man suspected of setting fires and causing an explosion outside a synagogue in a southern resort. Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said \"the alleged perpetrator\" was detained on Saturday. He added that the police had shown \"great professionalism\". French media reported that the suspect was shot and injured by police after he opened fire on the officers who came to arrest him in the city of N\u00eemes. Earlier on Saturday, a police officer was injured in the blast outside the Beth Yaacov synagogue in the nearby seaside resort of La Grande-Motte. The police officer's injuries are not said to be life-threatening, following the blast between 08:00 and 08:30 local time (07:00-07:30 BST) on Saturday. Five people, including the rabbi, were inside the synagogue at the time, authorities said. The explosion was caused by two cars which were set alight outside Police sources told French media that one of the vehicles contained a hidden gas canister. The suspect - who was seen on CCTV with what French media said was a Palestinian flag around his waist - also set fire to several entrance doors of the synagogue. Jewish community leader Yonathan Arfi said the incident was \"an attempt to kill Jews\" and seemed to have been timed to target Saturday morning worshippers. President Emmanuel Macron said the incident was \"a terrorist act\". One eyewitness, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC: \"Just as we were coming round the last corner, there was a huge explosion - a fireball into the air. \"It was surreal, like a film. We didn\u2019t go any further.\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Mr Darmanin visited the site on Saturday evening. Both had earlier condemned the attack, with Mr Attal calling it \"an antisemitic act\". \"What happened here shocks and scandalises all Republicans in our country,\" Mr Attat said during the visit. \"Because the reality is that once again, French Jews have been targeted, attacked because of their beliefs.\" Mr Attal said an \"absolute tragedy\" had been \"narrowly avoided\" as \"there would have been victims\" if the synagogue had been full of worshippers. Both Mr Attal and Mr Darmanin said security would be strengthened outside synagogues. \"I want to assure our Jewish fellow citizens and the municipality of my full support,\" Mr Darmanin said earlier in the day. \"Absolute tragedy\" avoided in France synagogue attack, says PM The French Jewish community already live under high security, with many synagogues and Jewish schools under police protection. A January 2024 report by the Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) said there had been a nearly threefold increase of antisemitic acts in France between 2022 and 2023. In May, police shot dead a man after a synagogue in the north-western city of Rouen was set on fire . In 2015, two days after the attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, four people were murdered in a hostage attack on a kosher supermarket. The explosion comes amid heightened concerns for Europe's Jewish community, after the latest survey from the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) published last month found that Jewish people in the bloc continue to face high levels of antisemitism . More than 8,000 Jews in 13 EU countries, including Germany and France, were interviewed. Some 96% said they had encountered antisemitism in their daily lives.

Macron named 73-year-old Barnier , a conservative and the former Brexit negotiator for the European Union, as prime minister on Thursday, capping a two-month search following his ill-fated decision to call a legislative election that delivered a hung parliament. Sign up here. \"Democracy is not only the art of knowing how to accept victory, but the humility to accept defeat,\" Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the far-left France Unbowed party (LFI), told protesters at the start of the march in eastern Paris. \"I call on you to undertake a long battle.\" The organisers said about 300,000 people demonstrated peacefully across France, including 160,000 in Paris, although police in the capital said 26,000 people had protested in the city. The Interior Ministry did not immediately give a figure for the entire country, but its numbers are usually much lower than those given by organisers. Barnier meanwhile made his first official visit, meeting staff at a Paris hospital. The worsening condition of the public health sector has been one of the areas that people have demanded action after months of procrastination. \"Without carrying out miracles, we can make improvements,\" Barnier, who lacks a clear majority, told reporters. He said on Friday he wants to include conservatives, members of Macron's camp, and some from the left in his future government. But he faces the daunting task of trying to drive reforms and pass the 2025 budget with the threat of a no-confidence vote hanging over him at the start of October, when he is due to outline his policy objectives to parliament. DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY France is under pressure from the European Commission, the European Union's executive body, and from bond markets to reduce its deficit. The left, led by LFI, has accused Macron of a denial of democracy and stealing the election, after Macron refused to pick the candidate of the New Popular Front (NFP) alliance that came top in the July vote. Barnier's centre-right Les Republicains party is only the fifth bloc in parliament with less than 50 lawmakers, and the left believes he will push wholesale spending cuts and a tougher stance on immigration. Across 130 locations in France, people carried banners attacking Macron for betraying them and called on him to be impeached. \"He (Barnier) has no social conscience and will constitute a government which will be in the same line as the previous ones. So that is enough now,\" civil servant Jeanne Schmitt, 45, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Paris march. Pollster Elabe published a survey on Friday showing that 74% of French people considered Macron had disregarded the results of the elections, with 55% believing he had \"stolen\" them. Barnier continued consultations on Saturday as he looks to form a government, a tricky job given he faces a potential no-confidence vote. NFP and the far-right National Rally (RN) together have a majority and could oust the prime minister through a no-confidence vote should they decide to collaborate. The RN gave its tacit approval for Barnier, citing a number of conditions for it to not back a no-confidence vote, making it the de facto kingmaker for the new government. \"He is a prime minister under surveillance,\" RN party leader Jordan Bardella told BFM TV on Saturday. \"Nothing can be done without us.\" Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and David Holmes Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Europe Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Trump and Zelenskiy clash again and US warns it could abandon Ukraine talks 6:36 PM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago World category Pope Francis broke with tradition in choosing St. Mary Major for burial April 22, 2025 Business category Switzerland flexes financial muscle ahead of tariff date in Washington 5:14 AM UTC Europe category Trump envoy heads to Moscow for more Ukraine peace talks with Putin April 22, 2025","question":"How many cities and towns in France saw protests against Macron's appointment of Michel Barnier as prime minister in September 2024?","answer":"Protests took place in 130 cities and towns across France.","region":"France","question_translated":"Dans combien de villes de France y a-t-il eu des manifestations contre la nomination de Michel Barnier comme Premier ministre par Macron en septembre 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Des manifestations ont eu lieu dans 130 villes \u00e0 travers la France.","model_answer":"Answer: Cette information n'est pas disponible car nous sommes en 2023 et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements que vous \u00e9voquez (nomination de Michel Barnier comme Premier ministre par Macron en septembre 2024) rel\u00e8vent du futur.

Try again 06:46 FRENCH CONNECTIONS \u00a9 FRANCE 24 Tough talks on the distribution of the 39 cabinet posts continued right up to Saturday's official announcement, insiders said, with moments of high tension between the president and his prime minister. Opposition politicians from the left have already announced they will challenge his government with a confidence motion. In the July election, a left-wing bloc called the New Popular Front (NFP) won the most parliamentary seats of any political bloc, but not enough for an overall majority. Macron argued that the left would be unable to muster enough support to form a government that would not immediately be brought down in parliament. He turned instead to Barnier to lead a government drawing mostly on parliamentary support from Macron's allies, as well as from the conservative Republicans (LR) and the centrists groups. 'Government of the general election losers' Macron was counting too, on a neutral stance from the far right \u2013 but the leader of the National Rally (RN) Jordan Bardella was quick to condemn the composition of the new government. Bardella said the new government marked 'a return to Macronism' and had 'no future whatsoever'. \u00a9 Julien de Rosa, AFP\/File It marked \"a return to Macronism\" and so had \"no future whatsoever\", he said Saturday. At the other end of the political spectrum, far-left firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon called the new lineup \"a government of the general election losers\". France, he said, should \"get rid\" of the government \"as soon as possible\", while his party threatened to \"increase popular pressure\" on the government. M\u00e9lenchon dismissed the new government as made up of 'general election losers'. \u00a9 Lionel Bonaventure, AFP\/File Socialist party chairman Oliver Faure dismissed Barnier's cabinet as \"a reactionary government that gives democracy the finger\". Among the new faces in key cabinet posts are Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, a centrist, while conservative Bruno Retailleau takes over at the interior ministry. His portfolio covers immigration and his right-wing credentials have created unease even in Macron's own camp. Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, a close Macron ally, has kept his job. The difficult job of submitting a budget plan to parliament next month falls to 33-year-old Antoine Armand, the new finance minister. He has previously served as head of parliament's economic affairs commission. The only left-of-centre politician is a little-known former Socialist Didier Migaud who was named justice minister. Street protests Even before the announcement, thousands of people with left-leaning sympathies took to the streets in Paris , the southern port city of Marseille and elsewhere on Saturday to protest. They were objecting to a cabinet they say does not reflect the outcome of the parliamentary election.\u00a0The new government has nobody from inside the NFP bloc. Barnier is to address parliament with a key policy speech on October 1st. He then has the urgent task of submitting a budget plan to the National Assembly aimed at controlling France's rising budget deficit and debt mountain\u00a0\u2013 the first major test of his administration. France was placed on a formal procedure for violating European Union budgetary rules before Barnier was picked as head of government. France's public-sector deficit is projected to reach around 5.6 percent of GDP this year and go over six percent in 2025, which compares with EU rules calling for a three-percent ceiling on deficits. \"I am discovering that the country's budgetary situation is very serious,\" Barnier said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday, adding that the situation required \"more than just pretty statements\". The new cabinet's first meeting is scheduled for Monday afternoon.

The French and British governments have sought for years to stop the flow of migrants, who pay smugglers thousands of euros per head for the passage on overloaded rubber dinghies. Regional prefect Jacques Billant said the incident happened at around 1:00 am (2300 GMT on Saturday) off the coast of the northern town of Ambleteuse. \"The toll was terrible, with eight people reported dead,\" he told the press near the site of the accident. He said they seemed all to be men. Six survivors were hospitalised, including a 10-month-old baby with hypothermia, he added. The boat had set off from the Slack river that flows into the sea between the towns of Wimereux and Ambleteuse. It had 59 people on board from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Iran, Billant said. \"Only one out of six had a life jacket,\" he said. The dinghy \"quickly got into difficulty and ran aground\", he said. \"The boat was torn apart on the rocks.\" 'Children, tiny babies' Christel Leclair, a volunteer at a local charity, said a second boat had departed at around 7:30 am despite the fatal accident. Departures \"happen the whole time -- winter, day, night, summer... as soon as the sea is calm\", she said. Forty-six migrants have died trying to cross the Channel so far this year, a regional prefect said \u00a9 Bernard BARRON \/ AFP \"The boats are more and more overcrowded. They don't have life jackets, just sometimes the inner tube of a tire,\" she added. \"There are children, pregnant women and tiny babies. We're sad and deflated.\" The Auberge des Migrants (Migrant shelter) charity on X called on the French and British states to \"immediately rethink their migration policy\". Billant said that this year French authorities had dismantled 20 people smuggling networks, arresting 77 people of whom 59 have been referred to the courts. But Charlotte Kwantes, of the Utopia 56 charity helping migrants, said departures would only continue. Without enough legal options for migrants wishing to reach the United Kingdom, \"people are continuing and will continue to take the same risks, whatever the quantity of patrols and means deployed at the border\", she said. 'Saw them die' Maritime authorities said Saturday that migrants had made numerous attempts to cross the Channel in recent days, with 200 people rescued in 24 hours over Friday and Saturday alone. The latest incident comes after at least 12 migrants including six minors, mostly from Eritrea, died when their boat capsized off the northern French coast on September 3. More than 22,000 migrants have arrived in England by crossing the Channel since the beginning of this year, according to British officials. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged this summer to strengthen \"cooperation\" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers. Starmer's office on Sunday announced the appointment of Martin Hewitt as chief of the new UK Border Security Command, set up to bolster the fight against illegal migration notably by leading joint investigations with other European countries. Hewitt will accompany Starmer during a trip to Rome on Monday for talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni where tackling illegal migration will be high on the agenda. French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The Kanak people have long sought to break free from France, which first took the Pacific archipelago in 1853 and granted citizenship to all Kanaks in 1957. The latest violence flared on May 13 in response to attempts by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia, which Kanaks feared would further marginalize them by granting more rights to recent arrivals from mainland France. Macron declared a state of emergency two days later, rushing in 3,500 troops to help police quell the unrest.

Marine Le Pen's RN party, which holds major political sway over Prime Minister Michel Barnier's newly installed government, has jumped on the murder of the young student, identified by authorities only by her first name, Philippine, as vindication of its calls for tougher immigration and crime laws. Sign up here. She had been reported missing by her family last Friday, and her body was found the following day, in the Bois de Boulogne park, the Paris prosecutor's office said. The suspect, a 22-year-old Moroccan man who had previously been convicted of rape in France and was due to be deported, was on Tuesday arrested in Geneva, from where French authorities would seek his extradition, the Paris prosecutor's office said. Under pressure from the RN, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Wednesday that he would look into changing the law to prevent such a situation from happening again. \"Faced with such a tragedy, preceded by many others, we cannot just condemn it or be outraged,\" Retailleau, a long-time immigration hawk, said in a statement. \"It's up to us, public officials, to ... update our legislation, to protect the French.\" Retailleau, from the conservative Republicans party, had already signalled earlier this week that France was likely to see much tougher immigration and security measures, reflecting a what he said was a growing rightward shift across Europe. RN WIELDS NEW INFLUENCE AFTER SUMMER ELECTION The Philippine case has underlined the power that the RN wields over Barnier's government, particularly in areas such as immigration and crime. The RN, a kingmaker after this summer's legislative election, gave tentative support to Barnier's hard-won premiership. But it has reserved the right to withdraw its support if its concerns are not met. RN party chief Jordan Bardella accused the state of being too soft on security and immigration in a Tuesday post on X. \"It's time for this government to act: our compatriots are angry and will not be content with just words,\" he wrote. \"Philippine's life was stolen from her by a Moroccan migrant targeted by an OQTF (obligation to leave France deportation order).\" Greens lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau warned against the far right using the murder to \"spread its racist hatred\". France deports more non-EU citizens than any other European Union nation, official Eurostat data shows. But it issues so many expulsion orders - two to five times more than Germany in each quarter over the past two years - that its ratio of enforced expulsion orders is low. In the first quarter of 2024, France ordered the expulsion of 34,190 non-EU citizens, or nearly a third of all expulsions ordered across the EU, but only deported 4,205 people. Bureaucracy, diplomatic rows and a reluctance by some countries to accept the return of people holding criminal convictions are amongst the reasons why far fewer expulsions than are ordered are actually enforced.

Cherif fought\u00a0for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen from 2011 to 2018, during which time he was suspected of training his Paris childhood friend Cherif Kouachi, who along with his brother Said carried out the January 7, 2015 massacre at the satirical weekly in the French capital.

Peter Cherif, 42, had been on trial in Paris since mid-September for \"belonging to a criminal terrorist association\" while fighting for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen from 2011 to 2018. During that time he is suspected of training his Paris childhood friend Cherif Kouachi, who along with his brother Said perpetrated the January 7, 2015 massacre at Charlie Hebdo's offices in the French capital -- for which AQAP later claimed responsibility. The trial judge sentenced Cherif to life behind bars, with a minimum of 22-years to be served. The president of the court said the decision had been taken \"in view of the seriousness of the acts\" for which Cherif was convicted. Prosecutors had called him the \"architect\" of the first in a string of attacks carried out by radical Islamists that hit France in the late 2010s. The 12 killings at the magazine shocked the world and led to an international outpouring of political and popular support under the motto \"Je suis Charlie\" (\"I am Charlie\"). Cherif also was accused of being part of a criminal gang that held three French aid workers hostage for five months in Yemen in 2011. Calling the accused a \"jihadist through-and-through\" who was the \"cornerstone of planning\" for the Charlie Hebdo attack, prosecutors on Wednesday had requested a life sentence. Cherif declined to answer questions throughout most of the trial. But he admitted standing guard over the aid workers and serving as an interpreter between them and Yemeni Al-Qaeda members. Cherif has consistently denied playing any role in the attack on Charlie Hebdo or knowing it would happen. Prosecutors believe he was in on the plan and remained in contact with Cherif Kouachi once the attacker returned to France. \"I feel like I've taken part in a rigged match,\" Cherif's defence lawyer Nabil El Ouchikli said on Thursday, pointing out that the defendant was not charged with complicity in the Charlie Hebdo attack. He argued that prosecutors had resorted to the catch-all charge of terrorist association because \"they didn't have the proof\" for specific offences. Cherif himself on Thursday said that he had \"nothing to add\" after his representatives' closing arguments.

The vote was a key test for Barnier, whose Cabinet is forced to rely on the far right\u2019s good will to be able to stay in power, as the nation grapples with economic challenges exacerbated by global inflation. The no-confidence motion was brought by a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, composed of the hard-left France Unbowed, Socialists, Greens and Communists. It received 197 votes, far from the 289 votes needed to pass. Following the June-July parliamentary elections , the National Assembly, France\u2019s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: the New Popular Front, Macron\u2019s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. The far-right National Rally group, which counts 125 lawmakers, abstained from voting the no-confidence motion. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, herself a lawmaker, said she decided to \u201cgive a chance\u201d to the government for now.

A storm swell in the Mediterranean off the port city of Sete in southern France overturned three boats, killing one amateur sailor and putting another in the hospital in critical condition, said Herault department authorities. Some 64,000 people in the south of France were also left without power, network supplier Enedis told AFP, while several departments reported roads cut off by floodwaters . Following a crisis response meeting in Paris , Energy and Ecological Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told journalists the government was mobilising \"all state services\" and urged citizens to be careful. \"These episodes will have a tendency to recur. We're living at a time when climate change is making itself felt in concrete ways in our daily lives,\" she said. Authorities put the Seine-et-Marne department near Paris on red alert for flooding as the rain swelled the Grand Morin river, a tributary of the Seine, which runs through the French capital. Another 29 of the country's departments were placed on orange alert, with heavy rains and high winds expected. There were 35,000 households that lost electricity in the worst-hit department of Pyrenees-Atlantiques, with a clutch of other departments in the southwest and central east of the country also affected, Enedis said. Weather forecasters had predicted the storm would dump a month's worth of rain on a swathe of the country, including Paris. Portugal power cuts Portugal's civil protection authority reported more than 1,300 incidents overnight Tuesday to Wednesday, three-quarters of which involved fallen trees in the north of the country. Porto, the main northern city, was hit hardest, with 400 trees uprooted. Cars were also damaged and rail services interrupted near Barcelos, also in the north. The storm also cut power to more than 300,000 households, said the country's electricity supplier. Weather and civil protection officials, having predicted winds of up to 120 kilometres per hour (75 mph) and heavy rain, put the coast on a yellow alert, as waves reached up to seven metres (23 feet) high. Spanish weather officials issued an orange alert for the north and northwest of the country, warning of winds of up to 140 kilometres per hour in the Asturias region. Galicia, in the northwest, reported some roads blocked by mud slides and fallen trees in urban areas.

Issued on: 17\/10\/2024 - 19:14 4 min By: Joanna YORK Russian recruits undergo combat assault training at a firing range in the Rostov region, Russia, on October 4, 2024. \u00a9 Sergey Pivovarov, Reuters The escape route for Russian soldiers wishing to flee the fighting in Ukraine is complex and fraught with danger. Deserters face harsh punishment under Russian law, and it is almost impossible for them to travel to \"safe\" countries outside the Kremlin\u2019s sphere of influence. The six soldiers arrived in France separately in recent months after initially fleeing from Russia to Kazakhstan. It was the first time any EU country has allowed a group of deserters entry without travel documents or foreign passports, the Guardian reported on Thursday. \u201cWhen I landed in\u00a0France, it was the first time I could breathe fully. I felt a sense of calmness and freedom \u2026 the worst was behind me,\u201d Alexander, a former Russian contract soldier who deserted during the summer of 2023, told the British newspaper. Options other than fighting Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, almost 7,400 soldiers have been tried in military courts for going AWOL, and the number of cases rises each month, Russian independent media site Mediazona reported in April. This figure is thought to be a fraction of the total number of deserters \u2013 never mind those who want to desert but are too afraid. \u201cThis case in France is really important to show soldiers that they have other options than to go to Ukraine and kill people there,\u201d said Anastasia Burakova, founder of The Ark, an organisation that supports Russians who oppose the war in Ukraine both inside Russia and in exile. The European Union has discussed the prospect of offering asylum to draft evaders and deserters from the Russian army since the start of the invasion, but never made a formal decision. Read more Exclusive: On the ground in Russian territory held by Ukrainian forces Meanwhile, many deserters have been living in perilous conditions. Go By The Forest is an organisation dedicated to helping Russian soldiers who choose not to participate in the war. In March 2024, it told Mediazona that 30 percent of the 520 soldiers it has helped were hiding in Russia. The rest had fled abroad. Under Russian laws , which President Vladimir Putin strengthened following his Ukraine invasion, desertion during wartime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In Ukraine, there are reports of Russian soldiers who refuse to fight being held in pits and basements for days on end by superior officers. For deserters who do manage to leave Russia, options are limited. As serving troops are not in possession of their passports, deserters can only travel to former Soviet countries that do not require papers, such as Armenia, Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan. But once they arrive, \u201cit's not safe for them\u201d, Burakova said. \u201cIt's really difficult to find a job, to have an income,\" she said. \"They can't have any legal status. They can\u2019t leave the country. And also, they're at high risk of being kidnapped.\u201d Russian deserter Dmitri Sedrakov was illegally captured by Russian forces in Armenia on December 7, 2023, before being taken back to Russia. Others have been extradited from Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan . Organisations such as The Ark can help defectors reach these former Soviet states. \u201cBut we can\u2019t promise them that they will be not kidnapped from these countries,\u201d Burakova said. Political asylum The six soldiers granted visas intend to apply for political asylum in France. Their temporary visas were issued after lengthy discussions with human rights groups to ensure that they did not pose a security risk and were genuinely opposed to the war in Ukraine. The Ark uses open-source software to carry out such background checks. \u201cWe can identify that the people didn't take part in war crimes, or sometimes that they were just stationed in military points in Russia, not in occupied territories of Ukraine,\u201d\u00a0Burakova said. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU tightened its guidelines on granting visas to Russian nationals. Many countries suspended visas for Russians altogether. At the same time, The Ark was receiving a lot of messages from soldiers. \u201cBut it's been really difficult to tell soldiers who don't want to take part in this bloody war what they can do next,\u201d Burakova said. She hopes the French decision to grant visas to deserters will bring hope to other Russian soldiers. Both The Ark and Go By The Forest communicate to the public via their Telegraph channels, which are still not blocked in Russia. Ultimately, she hopes their efforts can have an even larger impact. \u201cShowing that there is a way out from the army is one of the tools to end this war more quickly,\u201d she said. \u00a9 France M\u00e9dias Monde graphic studio Read next New memoir from Russian dissident Alexei Navalny reveals he knew he would die in prison Europe Russia jails French researcher Laurent Vinatier for three years in 'foreign agent' case Europe Zelensky says he hopes war with Russia will end 'no later than next year' Europe Today's top stories A trap?

The overnight shutdown backed up flights, and officials at the airport urged stranded passengers to contact their airlines for information after the facility resumed operations by mid-morning. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said French authorities had regained control of the airport, which demonstrators targeted in the latest protest decrying a high cost of living . Retailleau added that reinforcements were being sent. \u201cWe will reestablish order,\u201d he said.

Since Monday night, Martinique has been gripped by bouts of protests over the high cost of living that turned violent, with at least one person killed as demonstrators set fire to a police station, cars and road barricades and clashed with officers. On Thursday night, protesters overran the tarmac on the airport in the island\u2019s capital, Fort-de-France, and tried to force their way into the main entrance, where hundreds of passengers had taken shelter, according to videos posted on social media. Police securing the entrance were seen fending off assaults from the demonstrators and firing what appears to be tear gas in their direction, and the airport later said on Facebook that flights were suspended. Three planes carrying some 1,000 passengers had to be diverted to nearby island of Guadeloupe on Thursday, Martinique local prefecture said in its statement. Another 500 passengers who were supposed to board those flights were stuck at the Fort-de-France airport, it said.

So far this week, nearly a dozen officers were injured as protesters threw bottles and rocks and police responded with tear gas, according to the government. Some demonstrators also opened fire, officials said. The latest round of violence prompted the government to announce another curfew as it stressed that demonstrations on public roads were prohibited. It is the latest in a string of protests that began in early September, prompting France to send special anti-riot police to the island, which has banned demonstrations in certain areas.

Police stepped in to secure the site and the local prefect said that some workers would be requisitioned to bring normal electricity service back to the archipelago.

Workers at the territory's thermal power station in the industrial zone of Jarry entered the command room \"and caused an emergency shutdown of all the engines\", the Guadeloupe prefecture said in a statement. Restored electricity supply for the 230,000 affected households was expected at 3.00 PM (1900 GMT) at best. Police intervened and the archipelago's prefect had \"requisitioned\" staff to bring the station back up to speed, it said. The French government has mobilised \"services and operators\" to bring power back as soon as possible, said Energy Minister Olga Givernet. A labour dispute over pay has pitted the energy branch of the hard-left CGT union against the EDF utility since September 15. Power outages have affected daily life in Jarry, the economic powerhouse of the French territory of close to 380,000 inhabitants, over the past week. Some businesses have closed, an AFP correpondent said, and emergency services suffered. Leon Prosper Jimmy, an ambulance driver in Pointe-a-Pitre, said that taking charge of patients in apartment buildings had become difficult because of non-functioning lifts. \"We have to carry them,\" he said, saying he often called the fire brigade or other services for backup. \"We manage as best we can,\" said the 41-year old. The CHUG hospital centre said it had activated backup power generators which would keep \"critical operations\" going for 72 hours.

The IOC took over running the boxing competition at this year's Paris Olympics. IOC president Thomas Bach warned that boxing's national federations needed to find a new and \"reliable\" international partner for the IOC to be sure the sport features on the programme at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. A decision is due early in 2025 on whether or not to keep the sport in the Games. FFBoxe said it planned to join World Boxing. World Boxing, which was founded in 2023 and boasts around 50 members, led by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Brazil, is in discussions with the IOC to take over running the sport at the Games. FFBoxe said the decision to \"disaffiliate\" from the IBA, was \"motivated by the desire to guarantee French boxing its place at the Olympic Games and to reinforce the stability of its clubs\". It said it had been prompted to act by a letter from David Lappartient, President of the French Olympic Committee, and a candidate to replace the departing Bach as IOC president, pointing out that boxing was not, for now, on the 2028 Olympic programme. The IBA is chaired by the Kremlin-linked Russian Umar Kremlev who sparked a damaging gender controversy during the Paris Olympics when he claimed that two women fighters had \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\". The IOC, which leaves gender rules to the sporting bodies, cleared them to compete and expressed doubts about the IBA's testing and motivations. The IBA responded with a chaotic press conference in Paris intended to clarify why it disqualified Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting from its world championships in 2023 but then cited \"medical confidentiality\" as it failed to produce definitive evidence.

Five people were seriously injured in a drive-by shooting at a restaurant in the city, including a 15-year-old boy who was left in critical condition after being shot in the head, police sources told the AFP news agency. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau described the incident as an alarming sign of drug-related violence escalating in the country. It follows a shooting in the north-western city of Rennes last week which killed a five-year-old boy. \"These shootings are not happening in South America, they are happening in Rennes, in Poitiers, in this part of western France once known for its tranquility,\" Retailleau told broadcaster BFMTV. \"We are at a tipping point and the choice we have today is a choice between general mobilisation or the Mexicanisation of the country,\" he said, alluding to Mexico's widespread issues with street crime and violence perpetrated by drug cartels. The mayor of Poitiers called it \"a new episode of violence unacceptable for the neighbourhood\". Shots were fired from a passing car, injuring several young people, police sources said. Two 16-year-olds were treated for minor wounds. Pictures from the scene in Place Coimbra, an area of the city known for drug-related crimes, showed the restaurant's facade riddled with bullet holes. The shooting then triggered fighting between rival gang groups in the area, according to police. \"Tensions between groups broke out, requiring the intervention of the police and the gendarmerie,\" Vienne regional police said in a statement. Retailleau said \"400 to 600\" people were at the scene, though it is not clear how many of those were directly involved. He was scheduled to visit Rennes, the capital of Brittany, on Friday following the shooting on 26 October, in which a five-year-old boy sitting in a car was shot in the head. Authorities confirmed the shooting was also drug-related. The drug trade in France has long been viewed as centred in the southern port city of Marseille, where at least 17 drug-related killings have been reported since the start of the year. But researchers say the influence of drug trafficking in France in recent years has spread beyond the main hubs of Marseille and Paris to medium-sized towns and even rural areas.

Issued on: 28\/11\/2024 - 22:41 2 min Authorities in France and other European countries have vowed to clampdown on migrant smuggling gangs charging huge sums to get undocumented people from South Asia and Africa into the country \u00a9 Sameer Al-DOUMY \/ AFP Charging between 15,000 and 26,000 euros per person, the traffickers are suspected of having smuggled several thousand people from India, Sri Lanka and Nepal into France since September 2021, the force said. Authorities estimate the network generated several million euros in illegal profits, which were laundered through construction companies, gold trafficking and informal transfers of money back to South Asia. The arrests took place between March and November 2024, said Julien Gentile, director of the French border force at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport. \"The smugglers facilitated migrants' travel to the European Union via Dubai or African states, while providing them with illegally obtained tourist, work or medical visas,\" said Gentile. The head of the network is still at large, with France's request for his extradition from Dubai yet to be agreed, according to the border force. Of the 26 men arrested, 15 were placed in pre-trial detention with seven under judicial supervision. The remaining four, who were recently arrested, were to be presented on Thursday to the investigating judge. The 11 million euros' worth of assets included properties, luxury cars, jewellery and gold. Those arrested are accused of belonging to different levels of the gang, ranging from smugglers to money launderers and shady finance brokers. \"This is the exceptional nature of the case,\" Gentile added. Details of the investigation by France's Office for the Fight against the Illicit Traffic of Migrants, were released with migration becoming a key issue for French political parties. The conservative government that took office in September has said it will clampdown, while France has also faced pressure over undocumented migrants crossing the Channel to Britain from its northern coast. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was to visit the Calais region on Friday for talks with local mayors on the migrant crisis. At least 72 undocumented migrants have died this year trying to cross the Channel. The mayors have asked for more police and a tougher clampdown on the smuggling gangs. Retailleau is also to go to London on December 8-9 for talks on the migrants. Human trafficking carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in France. In December 2023, a plane carrying hundreds of Indian passengers was grounded for days at Vatry airport east of Paris over concerns it was part of a human trafficking scheme. The plane had taken off from the United Arab Emirates and was detained after an anonymous tipoff. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine. This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635. Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary. However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question. \u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday. This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued. Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete. Getty Images In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version. But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in. Thus common words like tiktokeur , vlog , smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda , sauna , yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket). For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur . However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it. Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is. \u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving. Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts. Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep). \u201cFrench needs it, because as every English student of French knows, there is no word for \u2018shallow\u2019,\u201d he said.

{"year":"2024","month":"12","event_desc":"7 December  Notre-Dame de Paris reopens to the public following renovations prompted by the 2019 fire.","text":"Reconstruction work after the fire in Paris in 2019 required about 2,000 workers. Notre-Dame Cathedral, situated on an island in the River Seine in Paris, France, is reopening this weekend after more than five years of intense reconstruction work to restore the medieval building to its former glory. After a fire gutted the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019, the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece has now been masterfully restored and will reopen to the public on Sunday following a ceremony on Saturday, which will be attended by a lineup of heads of state and top-level delegates from around the world. French President Emmanuel Macron, who promised to restore the cathedral within five years after the catastrophe, made a preopening visit to the site on November 29 with his wife, first lady Brigitte Macron. The president thanked the thousands of workers who had reconstructed the building. \u201cThe inferno of Notre-Dame was a wound for the nation, \u2026 and you were its remedy,\u201d the president said. Here is what we know about this weekend\u2019s reopening and what happened to the nearly 900-year-old cultural icon five years ago: The blaze broke out on the evening of April 15, 2019, on the roof of the cathedral. The fire sent tongues of orange flames into the sky as smoke billowed from the building. The fire burned for 15 hours while more than 400 firefighters battled to extinguish it. It is still unclear what caused the blaze, but authorities suspect an electrical fault or a burning cigarette was the likely culprit. No members of the public were hurt because security officials had sounded the alarm and evacuated the cathedral. However, three security officials were injured. By the time the fire was extinguished the following day, the inside and roof of the cathedral had been largely destroyed. Its wooden and metal spire, which had been undergoing reconstruction work, collapsed. Its lead roof melted, and the intricate wooden beams that supported it burned away, leaving a gaping hole over the building. Some religious relics inside the building as well as exposed artwork on the exterior of the building were badly damaged. However, the vaulted stone ceiling acted as a barrier to the fire and prevented serious damage to the cathedral\u2019s interior stone walls. The cathedral\u2019s wooden frame was centuries-old, and authorities had long marked it as a possible fire hazard. Still, it was a painful period for the French nation. Toxic lead dust spread and cast a gloom over a solemn Paris. Macron, in an emotional speech on April 17, 2019, promised to restore the monument within five years and make it more beautiful than ever. Notre-Dame did not hold a Christmas Mass that year \u2013 for the first time since 1803. Hundreds of donors, including some of France\u2019s richest businesspeople, contributed more than 840 million euros ($889m) to the medieval building\u2019s restoration campaign, which was launched by Macron. About 150 countries, among them the United States and Saudi Arabia, also contributed. The restoration involved the work of about 2,000 people, including craftspeople, architects and other professionals. Construction workers used powerful vacuum cleaners and cleaning gels to remove the thickened soot, dust and years of accumulated grime from the lower stone walls of the cathedral. Carpenters then hewed giant oak beams by hand to rebuild the intricate roof frame and the spire. About 2,000 oak trees were felled to provide the wood to rebuild the roof. Work has not entirely finished, and scaffolding will cover parts of the exterior for a few more years so decorative features on the facade can be fully restored. Notre-Dame is set to host a high-profile ceremony on Saturday with more than 50 heads of state and government, dignitaries and VIPs attending under tight security. Notable among them will be US President-elect Donald Trump, who has travelled to Paris on his first foreign trip since winning the November presidential election.

{"year":"2024","month":"11","event_desc":"29 November  France officially recognises the killing of up to 400 members of the Tirailleurs S\u00e9n\u00e9galais by the French Army in Thiaroye, present-day Senegal in 1944 as a massacre.","text":"France admits colonial 'massacre', says Senegal's leader 29 November 2024 Share Save Damian Zane BBC News Share Save AFP The Tirailleurs Senegalais, seen here at the end of the conflict, were sent to France ahead of an anticipated German invasion during World War Two France has for the first time acknowledged that its soldiers carried out a \"massacre\" in Senegal in which dozens \u2013 perhaps hundreds \u2013 of West African troops were killed almost exactly 80 years ago, Senegalese President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has said. Those who died were part of the Tirailleurs Senegalais unit, recruited at the start of World War Two to help defend France, the colonial power. On returning to Senegal in 1944 many protested about their pay, historians say, which led to a brutal response. The killings have been a point of contention between Senegal and France and their reported acknowledgement by Paris comes as Faye is talking about a reassessment of the countries\u2019 relationship. Those who joined the Tirailleurs Senegalais not only came from Senegal but also from across France\u2019s African empire, including what is now Mali, Guinea, Niger, Benin and Chad. They were sent to France and many were captured by Germany during its successful invasion of the country. Liberated in 1944, the soldiers were taken back to Senegal and housed in the Thiaroye military camp, 15km (nine miles) from the capital, Dakar. Even before leaving France, many had been complaining about the pay they were set to receive and the fact that it was not the same as other French troops, historian Armelle Mabon says. Anger over the money grew once at Thiaroye, which the colonial authority viewed as a mutiny. On 1 December, the French violently brought an end to the protests. At the time it was said that 35 of the tirailleurs were killed, but some have put the death toll as high as 400. \"France must recognise that on that day, the confrontation between soldiers and riflemen who demanded their full legitimate wages be paid, triggered a chain of events that resulted in a massacre,\" the AP news agency quotes a letter from French President Emmanuel Macron to Faye as saying. Previously, in 2014, then President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had called what happened a \"bloody repression\". Senegal is due to mark the 80th anniversary of the shootings on Sunday. In his response to Macron\u2019s letter, Faye is quoted by AP as saying that his French counterpart\u2019s acknowledgement would \"open the door\" so the \"whole truth about this painful event of Thiaroye\" can be discovered. \"We have long sought closure on this story and we believe that, this time, France\u2019s commitment will be full, frank and collaborative,\" he added. He also indicated that he might be asking for an apology. Sixty-four years after Senegal's independence, France still has a military presence in the country, but speaking to the AFP news agency on Thursday, Faye, who was elected in March, said that France should close its base there. \"Senegal is an independent country, it is a sovereign country and sovereignty does not accept the presence of military bases in a sovereign country,\" he is quoted as saying.

The court in Lille, northern France, sentenced one of the ringleaders, Mirkhan Rasoul, a 26-year-old from Iraq, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 200,000 euros ($218,000). Rasoul attended the trial in a secured plexiglass box and under the surveillance of armed police. Other sentences ranged from two years to 10 years in prison. \u201cThese sentences are obviously very severe,\u201d said Kamel Abbas, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants already imprisoned in France. \u201cThat\u2019s a testimony of the scale of the case, and of the intention to severely punish the smugglers.\u201d Most of the defendants were not in court for the verdicts and sentencing. Some attended the trial remotely from various prisons in northern France, while others are not in custody. Fourteen of the 18 defendants were from Iraq, with the others from Iran, Poland, France and the Netherlands.

Craig Turner, deputy director of the British National Crime Agency (NCA), involved in the arrest of one of the defendants, said the network was one of the most prolific organizers of crossings. \u201cTheir sole motive was profit, and they didn\u2019t care about the fate of migrants they were putting to sea in wholly inappropriate and dangerous boats,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before,\u201d Turner said. The criminal network was making approximately \u20ac100,000 ($109,035) from each crossing according to a statement from the NCA published on Tuesday. The trial comes in what has been a particularly deadly year for attempted crossings of the English Channel, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in all of 2023 , though fewer than in 2022. At least 56 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to French officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the crossings began surging in 2018. The route, despite French and British efforts to stop it, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties, or perceived easier access to asylum and work. Europe\u2019s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants are also pushing many migrants north . On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for international cooperation against smuggling gangs, likening the issue to a global security threat on par with terrorism. Starmer told a conference of international police organization Interpol that \u201cpeople-smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism.\u201d He said intelligence and law-enforcement agencies should try to \u201cstop smuggling gangs before they act\u201d in the same way they do in counterterrorism operations. ___ AP journalists John Leicester in Paris and Jill Lawless in London contributed. ___ Follow all AP stories on global migration at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/migration","question":"What was the outcome of the French court trial in Lille involving 18 people accused of smuggling migrants across the English Channel?","answer":"The court convicted all 18 defendants, sentencing them to prison terms ranging from 2 to 15 years, with fines and bans on remaining in France after serving their sentences.","region":"France","question_translated":"Quel a \u00e9t\u00e9 le verdict du proc\u00e8s devant le tribunal fran\u00e7ais de Lille impliquant 18 personnes accus\u00e9es de trafic de migrants \u00e0 travers la Manche ?","answer_translated":"Le tribunal a condamn\u00e9 les 18 accus\u00e9s, leur infligeant des peines de prison allant de 2 \u00e0 15 ans, ainsi que des amendes et des interdictions de s\u00e9jour en France apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution de leur peine.","model_answer":"Answer: Le tribunal correctionnel de Lille a condamn\u00e9 18 personnes impliqu\u00e9es dans un r\u00e9seau de trafic de migrants \u00e0 des peines allant de 6 mois de prison avec sursis \u00e0 10 ans de r\u00e9clusion.

Try again 02:24 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier attends a debate on two motions of no-confidence against the French government at the National Assembly in Paris, France, December 4, 2024. \u00a9 Sarah Meyssonnier, Reuters French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, a historic move which plunged the country further into political chaos. For the first time in over sixty years, the National Assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen . Barnier's rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival. President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left. Read more Why the French government is headed for collapse The National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote. With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government. Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to \"submit his resignation\" to Macron and declared the session closed. Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia , an apparent world away from the domestic crisis. He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace. On Tuesday, Macron accused Le Pen's far-right of \"unbearable cynicism\" in backing the motion. No new elections can be called within a year of last summer's vote, narrowing Macron's options. Laurent Wauquiez , the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far right and hard left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will \"plunge the country into instability\". 'His failure' Some have suggested Macron himself should resign to break the impasse. But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to \"political fiction\". \"It's frankly not up to scratch to say these things,\" Macron said during his trip to Saudi. Eric Coquerel, a hard-left MP, said the motion against Barnier sounded the \"death knell of Emmanuel Macron's mandate\". With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes over the threat of cutbacks that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis. The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn. Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president. \"His failure,\" was left-wing daily Liberation's front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027. 'Shattered strategy' But in an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen's move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government. \"In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued,\" the daily said. Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier. Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election. Read more What does the EU embezzlement trial mean for Le Pen and the French far right? But if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial. Candidates for the post of premier are few and far between, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders. On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve , a contender in September. Macron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. The lifespan of Barnier's government is also the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.

{"year":"2024","month":"12","event_desc":"13 December  President Macron appoints MoDem leader Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as prime minister.","text":"No-one gets France's difficulty more than me, says Macron's new PM Bayrou 13 December 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save Reuters In his first words Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou singled out reducing France's deficit and debt as a moral priority Centrist leader Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has become France's latest prime minister, chosen by President Emmanuel Macron in a bid to end months of political turmoil. Bayrou, a 73-year-old mayor from the south-west who leads the MoDem party, said he was fully aware of the \"Himalayan\" task facing France, and he vowed to \"hide nothing, neglect nothing and leave nothing aside\". He is seen by Macron's entourage as a potential consensus candidate and his task will be to avoid the fate of his predecessor. Ex-Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier was ousted by MPs nine days ago and welcomed Bayrou to the prime minister's residence on Friday. Barnier was voted out over a budget aimed at cutting France's budget deficit, which is set to hit 6.1% of economic output (GDP) this year. Bayrou said the deficit and public debt were a moral as well as a financial problem - because \"passing it on to one's children is a terrible thing to do\". Macron is half-way through his second term as president and Bayrou will be his fourth prime minister this year. French politics has been deadlocked ever since Macron called snap parliamentary elections during the summer and an opinion poll for BFMTV on Thursday suggested 61% of French voters were worried by the political situation. Although a succession of allies lined up to praise Bayrou's appointment, Socialist regional leader Carole Delga said the whole process had become a \"bad movie\". Far-left France Unbowed (LFI) leader Manuel Bompard complained of a \"pathetic spectacle\". The centre-left Socialists said they were ready to talk to Bayrou but would not take part in his government. Leader Olivier Faure said because Macron had chosen someone \"from his own camp\", the Socialists would remain in opposition. BERTRAND GUAY\/POOL\/AFP Friday's handover took place at the prime minister's residence at the H\u00f4tel Matignon President Macron has vowed to remain in office until his second term ends in 2027, despite Barnier's downfall last week. He cut short a trip to Poland on Thursday and had been expected to name his new prime minister on Thursday night, but postponed his announcement until Friday. He then met Bayrou at the Elys\u00e9e Palace and a final decision was made hours later. But in an indication of the fraught nature of the talks, Le Monde newspaper suggested that Macron had preferred another ally, Roland Lescure, but changed his mind when Bayrou threatened to withdraw his party's support. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou commands respect - but can he save France from crisis? Bayrou arrived at the prime minister's residence at H\u00f4tel Matignon late on Friday afternoon. A red carpet had been rolled out for the transfer of power even before his name was confirmed. His challenge will be in forming a government that will not be brought down the way his predecessor's was in the National Assembly. The far left France Unbowed (LFI) have already threatened to demand a vote of no confidence as soon as they can. Ahead of his appointment, Macron held round-table talks with leaders from all the main political parties, bar the far left of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. The question is who can be persuaded to join Bayrou's government, or at least agree a pact so they do not oust him. Anne RENAUT\/AFP The red carpet was laid out at the prime minister's residence even before Bayrou was named When the only possible means of survival for a minority government is to build bridges on left and right, Bayrou has the advantage of having passable relations with both sides, reports BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield. Michel Barnier was appointed only in September and said on Friday he knew from the outset that his government's days were numbered. He was voted out when Le Pen's National Rally joined left-wing MPs in rejecting his plans for \u20ac60bn (\u00a350bn) in tax rises and spending cuts. His outgoing government has put forward a bill to enable the provisions of the 2024 budget to continue into next year. But a replacement budget for 2025 will have to be approved once the next government takes office. Bayrou said that reducing France's deficit and debt was a \"moral obligation\". Barnier wished his successor his best wishes, adding that \"our country is in an unprecedented and serious situation\". Under the political system of France's Fifth Republic, the president is elected for five years and names a prime minister whose choice of cabinet is then appointed by the president. Unusually, President Macron called snap elections for parliament over the summer after poor results in the EU elections in June. The outcome left France in political stalemate, with three large political blocs made up of the left, centre and far right. Eventually he chose Barnier to form a minority government reliant on Marine Le Pen's National Rally for its survival. Macron is now hoping to restore stability without depending on her party. Three centre-left parties - the Socialists, Greens and Communists - broke ranks with the more radical left LFI by taking part in talks with Macron. However, they made clear they wanted a prime minister from the left, rather than a centrist. \"I told you I wanted someone from the left and the Greens and I think Mr Bayrou isn't one or the other,\" Greens leader Marine Tondelier told French TV on Thursday. Patrick Kanner of the Socialists said that just because his party was not joining Bayrou's government, \"that doesn't mean we're going to bash it\". S\u00e9bastien Chenu, a National Rally MP, said for his party it was less about who Macron picked than the \"political line\" he chose. If Bayrou wanted to tackle immigration and the cost of living crisis then he would \"find an ally in us\".

Entire communities were flattened when Cyclone Chido made landfall, causing wind gusts of more than 225km\/h (140mph). The last reported death toll stood at 11 but speaking to local media, the island's prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville said it will \"definitely be several hundred\" once the damage is fully assessed, adding it was possible that a \"few thousand people had died\". French President Emmanuel Macron earlier said France would \"be there\" for the people of Mayotte and was sending 250 rescue workers. AFP Destruction in the aftermath of the cyclone that hit Mayotte on 15 December France's interior minister Bruno Retailleau said \"all makeshift homes have been completely destroyed\" and he feared a \"heavy\" death toll. On Saturday, one local news source reported that 11 people were killed and 246 injured, based on a hospital report. AFP had reported a higher death toll - at least 14 - citing a security source. Located north-west of Madagascar, Mayotte is an archipelago comprised of one main island, Grand-Terre, and several smaller ones. Most of the island's 300,000 or so inhabitants live in shacks with sheet metal roofs, and tens of thousands of people have lost their homes. Electricity, water and internet connections are all down. The government in Paris has sent a military transport plane with supplies and emergency workers. The territory's Pamandzi airport \"suffered major damage, especially to the control tower,\" acting French Transport Minister Francois Durovray wrote on X. Air traffic \"will be restored initially with military aid planes. Ships are on the way to ensure resupply,\" he added. Even before the cyclone hit with full force on Saturday morning, there were reports of trees being uprooted, roofs being ripped off buildings and power lines being downed. The head of Mayotte's firefighters' union, Abdoul Karim Ahmed Allaoui, told the BFM news channel on Saturday morning that \"even emergency responders are locked down\". He continued: \"There's no mobile phone service and we can't reach people on the island. Even buildings built to earthquake standards haven't held up. \"The emergency services command centre has been evacuated and is functioning at partial capacity.\" AFP Interior Minister Retailleau wrote in a statement on X: \"I offer my full support to the people of Mayotte. The state and local emergency services are fully mobilized. 110 civil security personnel and firefighters have already been sent and are on site. A second dispatch will be made tomorrow with 140 additional personnel.\" French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took up the post on Friday, said the cyclone was of \"exceptional severity\" and he was being updated on the situation \"hour by hour\". He has held an emergency meeting in Paris with ministers. Mayotte was initially placed under a purple alert - the highest level - and a \"strict lockdown for the whole population, including emergency services\" was imposed. It has since been lowered to red to allow emergency services to leave their bases. Retailleau said the island had not experienced such severe weather since 1934. After hitting Mayotte, the storm intensified overnight as it crossed the Mozambique Channel. The coastal city of Pemba has been battered by heavy rains and winds gusting up to 185km\/h (115mph). Videos on social media showed parts of Pemba city were flooded, trees uprooted and some homes damaged. The cyclone is now moving inland, with heavy rains reported in neighbouring Nampula province. While the winds are expected to ease, heavy rain and flooding are also predicted for southern Malawi and later Zimbabwe.

Paty, 47, was killed outside his school near Paris on 16 October 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression . The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police. Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November are accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organising a hate campaign online before the murder took place. The 540-seat courtroom in central Paris was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. The atmosphere became charged as the lead judge delivered the sentences. Families of the accused, seated on the benches, reacted strongly \u2013 there were gasps, cries, shouts, and even ironic clapping erupted, prompting the judge to pause several times and call for silence. Prosecutors requested sentences ranging from 18 months suspended imprisonment to 16 years in prison against the defendants. They include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped buy weapons for the attack and the father of a schoolgirl whose lies started the fatal spiral of events. Samuel Paty murder: how a teenager\u2019s lie sparked a tragic chain of events Read more The national anti-terrorism prosecutor had asked the court to downgrade the offences of four of the eight defendants, prompting ire from Paty\u2019s family. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a disappointment,\u201d Paty\u2019s sister Micka\u00eblle had told broadcaster TF1. \u201cIn a moment like this, it feels like one is fighting for nothing.\u201d Also, the public prosecutor dropped the charge of complicity in favour of a lower charge of association with a terrorist enterprise against the two young men accused of providing logistical support to the killer. He asked for 14 years in prison for Na\u00efm Boudaoud and 16 years for Azim Epsirkhanov. The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty\u2019s death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty\u2019s killing reinforced the French state\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. Much attention at the trial focused on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty\u2019s class when he showed the caricatures on 5 October 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that \u201cthis sick man\u201d needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina\u2019s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher\u2019s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed. Chnina is accused of alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. The public prosecutor requested a sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for him. His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty\u2019s school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth was given a sixth-month term with an electronic bracelet. Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty\u2019s family. \u201cIt\u2019s something that really shocks the family,\u201d lawyer Virginie Le Roy said. \u201cYou get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever.

Sarkozy, 69, faces a year in prison, but is expected to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet \u2014 as is the case for any sentence of two years or less. He was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling by both a Paris court in 2021 and an appeals court in 2023 for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. \u201cThe convictions and sentences are therefore final,\u201d a Court of Cassation statement on Wednesday said. Sarkozy, who was France\u2019s president from 2007 to 2012, retired from public life in 2017 though still plays an influential role in French conservative politics. He was among the guests who attended the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral earlier this month. Sarkozy, in a statement posted on X, said \u201cI will assume my responsibilities and face all the consequences.\u201d He added: \u201cI have no intention of complaining. But I am not prepared to accept the profound injustice done to me.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Trial of former President Sarkozy sheds light on France\u2019s back-channel talks with Libya\u2019s Gadhafi Here\u2019s a look at the election ban on France\u2019s far-right Le Pen and the legal issues Trial of former President Sarkozy sheds light on France\u2019s back-channel talks with Libya\u2019s Gadhafi Sarkozy said he will seek to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights, and hopes those proceedings will result in \u201cFrance being condemned.\u201d He reiterated his \u201cfull innocence.\u201d \u201cMy determination is total in this case as in all others,\u201d he concluded. Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said his client \u201cwill comply\u201d with the ruling. This means the former president will have to wear an electronic bracelet, Spinosi said. It is the first time in France\u2019s modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term. Sarkozy\u2019s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Sarkozy has been involved in several other legal cases. He has denied any wrongdoing. He faces another trial next month in Paris over accusations he took millions of dollars from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his successful 2007 campaign. The corruption case that led to Wednesday\u2019s ruling focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014. At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 presidential campaign. During the inquiry, they discovered that Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias \u201cPaul Bismuth.\u201d Wiretapped conversations on those phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising magistrate Gilbert Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case involving Sarkozy. Azibert never got the post and legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the case he was seeking information about. Prosecutors had concluded, however, that the proposal still constitutes corruption under French law, even if the promise wasn\u2019t fulfilled. Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention in his offer to help Azibert. Azibert and Herzog have also been found guilty in the case.

Four people - including two security guards and two men staying in the camp - were fatally shot in Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline near Dunkirk, the city's chief prosecutor Charlotte Huet said in a statement, as reported by French media. The gunman also confessed to an earlier shooting in the nearby town of Wormhout, the prosecutor added. Dunkirk's Mayor Patrice Vergriete said the motive behind the attacks \"remains unknown\". Several firearms were found in the suspect's car and he was previously unknown to police, the prosecutor's statement said. All five murders were reportedly committed within less than two hours in the Dunkirk area. According to the prosecutor, a 29-year-old man was killed with \"several gunshots\" at 15:15 local time (14:15 GMT) outside his house in Wormhout, a village just south of the city. About 45 minutes later, two security guards aged 33 and 37 were killed near a port in Loon-Plage, just west of Dunkirk, Huet added. Minutes later, two other men aged 19 and 30 were also shot dead. They were staying in the nearby migrant camp, the prosecutor said. BBC News has contacted local authorities for comment. Mayor Vergriete described the incident as a \"tragedy\" and said \"an individual coldly murdered several people\" in the area. Xavier Bertrand, head of the region's assembly, confirmed on X that five people had died in a \"tragic event\". French media reported a large emergency services presence close to a migrant camp, though it is unclear if the shootings took place inside a settlement.

Pelicot\u2019s ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot , and all but one of his co-defendants were convicted of sexually assaulting her over a period of nearly a decade after he\u2019d knocked her unconscious by lacing her food and drink with drugs. The other co-defendant was convicted of drugging and raping his own wife with Dominique Pelicot\u2019s help. Gisele Pelicot arrives at the court house in Avignon for the verdicts.

I never regretted making this decision. I have trust in our capacity to collectively project ourselves toward a future where all, women and men, can live in harmony, with respect and mutual understanding.

(AP Photo\/Valentin Pasquier, File) Maximum penalty for her ex-husband The court found Dominique Pelicot guilty on all charges and sentenced him to 20 years in prison, which was the maximum possible. At age 72, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He won\u2019t be eligible to request early release until he\u2019s served at least two-thirds of the sentence. Dominique Pelicot and the other defendants stood up, one after the other, as chief judge Roger Arata read out the verdicts and sentences, which took more than an hour. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot sometimes nodded her head as verdicts were announced. Dominique Pelicot\u2019s lawyer, B\u00e9atrice Zavarro, said she would consider an appeal, but she also expressed hope that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot would find solace in the rulings. \u201cI wanted Mrs. Pelicot to be able to emerge from these hearings in peace, and I think that the verdicts will contribute to this relief for Mrs. Pelicot,\u201d she said.

Another man was also found guilty of the sexual assault charge he was tried for \u2014 producing 51 guilty verdicts in all. In a side room where defendants\u2019 family members watched the proceedings on television screens, some burst into tears and gasped as sentences were revealed. Protesters outside the courthouse followed the developments on their phones. Some read out the verdicts and applauded as they were announced inside. But disquiet grew as many of the sentences were lower than campaigners had hoped for, and cries of \u201cshame on the justice system!\u201d rose up from the crowd. In addition to the 20 years they sought for Dominique Pelicot , prosecutors asked for sentences of 10 to 18 years for the others charged with rape. But the court was more lenient, with many defendants getting less than a decade in prison. The five judges voted by secret ballot, by majority for the convictions and sentences. Members of the feminist collective \u201cLes Amazones Avignon\u201d post a message of support for Gisele Pelicot reading \u201cIn France in 2024, 94 percent of the rapists are acquitted\u201d near the courthouse, on Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024. (AP Photo\/Lewis Joly) For the defendants other than Dominique Pelicot, sentences ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment, with some of the time suspended for some of them. Arata told six defendants they were now free, accounting for time already spent in pretrial detention. Sophie Burtin, 53, who traveled from Lyon to show support for Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, said the trial \u201cbrought the subject of rape out into open\u201d but expressed disappointment that \u201cthe sentences aren\u2019t at all exemplary.\u201d \u201cSome men will think, \u2018OK, it\u2019s alright, what they did wasn\u2019t really a rape,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe message that\u2019s sent is, \u2018Is it really serious?\u2019 \u2014 with sentences that are so light. For me, It was meant to be a historic trial, but the feeling I have is that history hasn\u2019t been made.\u201d All 51 men, including Dominique Pelicot, were found guilty on Thursday in the drugging-and-rape trial of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. Here\u2019s what to know. Who is Gis\u00e8le Pelicot? Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s courage during the bruising trial and her appalling ordeal, inflicted on the retired power company worker in what she had thought was a loving marriage, galvanized campaigners and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. She waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushed for the hearings and shocking evidence \u2014 including her ex-husband\u2019s homemade videos of the rapes \u2014 to be heard in open court, insisting that shame should fall on her abusers, not her.

It\u2019s heavy, but it\u2019s creating change.\u201d A banner that campaigners hung on a city wall opposite the courthouse read, \u201cMERCI GISELE\u201d \u2014 thank you Gis\u00e8le.

He first came to the attention of police in September 2020 when a supermarket security guard caught him surreptitiously filming up women\u2019s skirts. Police subsequently found his library of images documenting years of abuse \u2014 more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, stored on computer drives and catalogued in folders marked \u201cabuse,\u201d \u201cher rapists,\u201d \u201cnight alone\u201d and other titles. The abundant evidence led police to the other defendants. In the videos, investigators counted 72 different abusers but weren\u2019t able to identify them all.

(AP Photo\/Lewis Joly) Although some of the accused \u2014 including Dominique Pelicot \u2014 acknowledged that they were guilty of rape, many didn\u2019t. Some argued that Dominique Pelicot\u2019s consent covered his wife, too. Some insisted that they hadn\u2019t intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husband\u2019s invitations to come to their home. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were taking part in consensual kink. ___ Associated Press journalist Alex Turnbull in Paris and Nicolas Vaux-Montagny in Lyon, France, contributed.","question":"What was Dominique Pelicot's sentence in the 2024 rape trial?","answer":"Dominique Pelicot received the maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for his role in the rapes.","region":"France","question_translated":"Quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la peine de Dominique Pelicot lors du proc\u00e8s pour viol en 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Dominique Pelicot a \u00e9cop\u00e9 de la peine maximale de 20 ans de prison pour son r\u00f4le dans les viols.","model_answer":"To provide an accurate response, I must consider the context and available information regarding the trial of Dominique Pelicot in 2024.

The government, put together by newly named Prime Minister Francois Bayrou , includes members of the outgoing conservative-dominated team and new figures from centrist or left-leaning backgrounds. Coming up with a 2025 budget will be the most urgent order of business. The new government enters office after months of political deadlock and crisis and pressure from financial markets to reduce France\u2019s colossal debt. Macron has vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027, but has struggled to govern since snap elections in the summer left no single party with a majority in the National Assembly. Since his appointment 10 days ago, Bayrou has held talks with political leaders from various parties in search of the right balance for the new government. Some critics on Monday were angry at Bayrou for consulting with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, and some argue the government looks too much like the old one to win lawmakers\u2019 trust.

Residents want more Global tributes pour in to honor Pope Francis after his death Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned this month following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly , leaving France without a functioning government. Le Pen played a key role in Barnier\u2019s downfall by joining her National Rally party\u2019s forces with the left to pass the no-confidence motion. Bayrou will need support from moderate legislators on the right and left to keep his government alive. Banker Eric Lombard will be finance minister, a crucial post when France is working to fulfill its promises to European Union partners to reduce its deficit, estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product this year. Lombard briefly worked as an adviser to a Socialist finance minister in the 1990s. Bayrou has said he supports tax hikes championed by his predecessor, but it\u2019s not clear how the new government can find the right calculation for a budget that satisfies a majority of lawmakers angry over spending cuts. Hard-right Bruno Retailleau stays on as interior minister, with responsibility for France\u2019s security and migration policy. Sebastien Lecornu, who has been at the forefront of France\u2019s military support for Ukraine, remains defense minister, while Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who has traveled extensively in the Mideast in recent weeks, also retains his post.

Francis appeared relaxed and energized during the one-day visit, just two days before his 88th birthday, still displaying a faded bruise from a fall a week ago. He frequently deviated from his prepared homily during Mass at the outdoor La Place d\u2019Austerlitz, remarking at one point that he had never seen so many children as in Corsica \u2014 except, he added, in East Timor on his recent Asian tour. \u201cMake children,\u2033 he implored. \u201dThey will be your joy and your consolation in the future.\u201d Earlier, at the close of a Mediterranean conference on popular piety, Papa Francescu, as he is called in Corsican, described a concept of secularity \u201cthat is not static and fixed, but evolving and dynamic,\u201d that can adapt to \u201cunforeseen situations\u201d and promote cooperation \u201cbetween civil and ecclesial authorities.\u201d The pontiff said that expressions of popular piety, including processions and communal prayer of the Holy Rosary \u201ccan nurture constructive citizenship\u201d on the part of Christians. At the same time, he warned against such manifestations being seen only in terms of folklore, or even superstition. RELATED COVERAGE Iconic photos of Pope Francis\u2019 procession captured by AP photographer Photos: The death of a pope begins a centuries-old ritual to elect his successor Photos: Pope Francis\u2019 body is escorted by cardinals and Swiss Guards as mourners look on The visit to Corsica\u2019s capital Ajaccio, the birthplace of Napoleon, is one of the briefest of his papacy beyond Italy\u2019s borders, just about nine hours on the ground, including a 40-minute visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. Francis met privately with Macron at the airport before flying back to Rome. Francis was joined on the dais by the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo, who organized the conference that brought together some 400 participants from Spain, Sicily, Sardinia and southern France. The two-day meeting examined expressions of faith that often occur outside formal liturgies, such as processions and pilgrimages. Often specific to the places where they are practiced, popular piety in Corsica includes the cult of the Virgin Mary, known locally as the \u201cMadunnuccia,\u201d which protected the island from the plague in 1656 when it was still under Genoa. Corsica stands out from the rest of secularized France as a particularly devout region, with 92 confraternities, or lay associations dedicated to works of charity or piety, with over 4,000 members. \u201cIt means that there is a beautiful, mature, adult and responsible collaboration between civil authorities, mayors, deputies, senators, officials and religious authorities,\u2019\u2019 Bustillo told The Associated Press ahead of the visit. \u201cThere is no hostility between the two. And that is a very positive aspect because in Corsica there is no ideological hostility.\u201d The visit was awash in signs of popular piety. The pope was greeted by children in traditional garb and was continually serenaded by bands, choruses and singing troupes that are central to Corsican culture from the airport, to the motorcade route, convention center and cathedral. Thousands stood along the roadside to greet the pontiff and more waved from windows. Ren\u00e8 Colombani traveled with 2,000 others by ship from northern Corsica to Ajaccio, on the western coast, to see the pope. \u201cIt is an event that we will not see again in several years. It may be the only time that the pope will come to Corsica. And since we wanted to be a part of it, we have come a long way\u2033 Colombani said. The island, which Genoa ceded to France in 1768, is located closer to the Italian mainland than France. From the conference, the pope traveled to the 17th-century cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta to meet with clergy, stopping along the way at the statue of the Madunnuccia where he lit a devotional candle. The pope celebrated Mass beneath a looming statue of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor whose armies in 1808 annexed the papal states and imprisoned two of Francis\u2019 predecessors \u2014 Popes Pius VI and VII \u2014 before being excommunicated and eventually defeated on the battlefield. Thousands packed the esplanade where Napoleon is said to have played as a child. Francis met with Macron at the airport before departing for the 50-minute flight back to Rome. They discussed Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the Middle East and security issues in Africa\u2019s Sahel and Great Lakes regions, Haiti and Sudan, Macron\u2019s office said in a statement. Macron welcomed the pope\u2019s \u201ccalls for peace, non-violence and respect for human rights,\u201d the statement said. Both Macron and Francis expressed their \u201cdeep concern\u201d regarding the situation in Gaza and called for \u201can immediate and lasting ceasefire\u201d and \u201cthe massive delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid,\u201d according to Macron\u2019s office. On Syria, they reiterated their wish to see a \u201cfair and inclusive political transition,\u201d the statement said. Macron presented the pope with two books about Notre Dame Cathedral. The pontiff pointedly did not make the trip to Paris earlier this month for the pomp surrounding the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral following the devastating 2019 fire. The visit to Corsica seems far more suited to Francis\u2019 priorities than a grand cathedral reopening, emphasizing the \u201cchurch of the peripheries.\u201d It was Francis\u2019 third trip to France, each time avoiding Paris and the protocols that a state visit entails. He visited the port of Marseille in 2023 , on an overnight visit to participate in an annual summit of Mediterranean bishops, and went to Strasbourg in 2014 to address the European Parliament and Council of Europe . Corsica is home to more than 340,000 people and has been part of France since 1768. But the island has also seen pro-independence violence and has an influential nationalist movement. Last year, Macron proposed granting it limited autonomy. Given the short flight back to Rome, Francis didn\u2019t hold an airborne press conference en route home, the first time he has skipped the traditional briefing in 47 foreign trips as pope. Francis did come to the back of the plane though to greet reporters and receive a pretend birthday cake. __ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The deaths were confirmed after an early morning rescue operation involving French emergency services and the navy\u2019s \u201cDauphin\u201d helicopter. Around 50 people were stranded in the water and on the beach near Sangatte at around 6 a.m., according to the regional prefecture. Rescuers assisted 45 individuals, including four who were transported to hospitals. Three unconscious people were pulled from the water but could not be revived, despite efforts by medical teams. An investigation has been opened by prosecutors in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Jacques Billant, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said an overcrowded boat may have contributed to the tragedy. \u201cThere were more people attempting to board than the boat could hold,\u201d he said during a press conference Sunday. Angela Eagle, the U.K. border security and asylum minister, said the boats were operated by smugglers the government has vowed to stop. \u201cThis morning, lives have been lost at sea because ruthless criminals running the small boat trade are overloading people into unseaworthy vessels,\u201d Eagle said. \u201cThis government is committed to smashing these gangs.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Defending migrants was a priority for Pope Francis from the earliest days of his papacy Photos: The people who have lost their businesses as migration in the Darien Gap dries up The EU moves to fast-track asylum claims by migrants from 7 countries to speed deportation Sunday\u2019s tragedy comes during a spike in Channel crossing attempts as 2024 draws to a close. Officials have noted a significant increase in attempted crossings over the past few days. \u201cSince Dec. 24, 23 maritime incidents have been thwarted by internal security forces, saving over 1,000 lives,\u201d said Billant. \u201cBut crossing attempts continue, despite extremely dangerous sea conditions. The water is icy, so survival time in the water is very short.\u201d This year has been one of the deadliest for migrants attempting the perilous journey between France and England, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, with at least 76 deaths reported by officials. More than 36,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in 2023, though fewer than in 2022. Billant also blamed human traffickers for putting lives at risk. \u201cThese are low-quality boats put into the water solely for profit by these criminal networks, which have no regard for the lives of these children, women and men,\u201d he said. In November, a French court convicted 18 people in a migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people across the English Channel. Despite French and British efforts to stop it, the route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work. __ Associated Press writer Brian Melley contributed to this story \u2014\u2014 Follow AP\u2019s coverage at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/migration","question":"How many migrants died in the suspected maritime incident off the coast of Sangatte in December 2024?","answer":"Three migrants died in the incident.","region":"France","question_translated":"Combien de migrants sont morts dans l'incident maritime suspect\u00e9 au large de Sangatte en d\u00e9cembre 2024 ?","answer_translated":"Trois migrants sont morts dans cet incident.","model_answer":"To provide an accurate response, let's analyze the given information and the context.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question is asking about the number of migrants who died in a maritime incident suspected to have occurred off Sangatte in December 2024.\n\n2. **Contextual Information**: \n   - **Sangatte**: It's a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.

It took sailors on HMS Argyll just eight hours to save every person aboard the 28,000-tonne merchant ship in the Bay of Biscay after the ship's cargo of containers and cars caught fire. The crew aboard the Grande America merchant ship had been trying to fight the flames but were forced to abandon it, climbing into their lifeboat despite the 5m to 6m swirls in the sea at night.

On receiving a mayday message, the Argyll moved 150 miles through difficult sea conditions to launch their small sea boat, which was used to nudge the lifeboat against the safety of the frigate so the crew could be lifted to safety one-by-one.

Police fired tear gas and water cannon as the protests turned violent after weeks of relative calm, during which marches had attracted declining numbers of participants. A Banque Tarneaud branch spewed flames before firefighters arrived and rescued a woman and her infant from the building, with 11 suffering minor injuries, the fire department said. Rioters also set fire to an upmarket handbag store and two news-stands on the Champs Elysees, while scattered bonfires burned on the thoroughfare. Protesters hurled cobblestones at riot police through clouds of tear gas in front of the Arc de Triomphe monument, which was ransacked at the peak of the protests in December. Police arrested nearly 240 protesters as rioters looted stores around the Champs Elysees and wrecked the high-end Fouquet\u2019s restaurant. The canvas awning was later set on fire of the swanky brasserie, known in France as the place where conservative Nicolas Sarkozy celebrated his presidential election victory in 2007. Several hundred meters (yards) down the Champs Elysees, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told journalists the latest violence was unacceptable and all would be done to bring perpetrators to justice. \u201cWe are dealing with several hundred, several thousand in some cases, highly determined people who are there to create disorder,\u201d Philippe said. Police said 42 protestors, 17 of their own officers and one firefighter were injured. Protesters clash with French riot police during a demonstration by the \"yellow vests\" movement in Paris, France, March 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer The interior ministry estimated 10,000 people had participated in the protest in Paris, compared with 3,000 on the previous Saturday. Nationwide, protesters were estimated at 32,300, compared with 28,600 last week. ULTRA VIOLENT Macron cut short a weekend ski trip in the Pyrenees to return to the capital on Saturday night after the violence, the Elysees presidential palace said. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that although the protest was relatively small, there had been more than 1,500 \u201cultra violent\u201d people out looking for trouble. \u201cThey decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack - and I use their words - Paris,\u201d Castaner said, adding that more than 1,400 police officers were mobilised. A separate, peaceful march against climate change through central Paris drew as many 36,000 people, police estimated. Some 145,000 people marched nationwide. Yellow vest protesters had promised to draw bigger numbers to mark the fourth month since the movement erupted in mid November over since-scrapped fuel tax hikes and the cost of living. Named after the high-visibility vests French drivers have to keep in their cars and worn by protesters, the revolt swelled into a broader movement against Macron, his reforms and elitism. However, the weekly demonstrations, held every Saturday in Paris and other cities, have been generally getting smaller since December, when Paris saw some of the worst vandalism and looting in decades. Slideshow (19 Images) After the spike in violence, Macron offered a package of concessions worth more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners. His government ordered police to crack down on the protests in January, leading to complaints of police brutality. The 41-year-old former investment banker also launched a series of national debates aimed at determining what policies people want the government to focus on. Saturday\u2019s protests coincided with the end of the debates.

Thousands of Parisians watched in horror from behind police cordons as a ferocious blaze devastated Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday night, destroying its spire and a large part of the roof. An investigation has been opened by the prosecutor\u2019s office, but police said it began accidentally and may be linked to building work at the cathedral. The 850-year-old gothic masterpiece had been undergoing restoration work. Huge fire sweeps through Notre Dame Cathedral \u2013 in pictures Read more The French president, Emmanuel Macron, attended the scene and later gave a speech in which he vowed that the cathedral would be rebuilt, as fire crews said the landmark\u2019s rectangular bell towers and structure of the building had been saved.

Video: Notre Dame's spire collapses in huge fire Macron said \u201cthe worst had been avoided\u201d thanks to hundreds of brave firefighters who battled for hours and who would continue working through the night. One firefighter was severely injured but no other casualties were reported. Interactive \u201cWhat happened tonight in Paris, in this cathedral, is a terrible event,\u201d the president said, vowing to raise funds worldwide and bring the best talents from around the world to reconstruct the building in its entirety. \u201cNotre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives ... So I solemnly say tonight: we will rebuild it together.\u201d Macron announced an international fundraising campaign to raise money for the repairs. French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chairman and CEO of international luxury group Kering, pledged 100 million euros towards rebuilding Notre Dame. Laurent Nunez, junior minister of the interior said on Tuesday: \u201cNow the fire danger has been dealt with, there is the issue of the building and whether the structure has resisted the very serious fire. A meeting of experts and national architects is taking place this morning to consider whether the building is stable and whether fire-officers can set up inside to continue their work.\u201d Franck Riester, the culture minister, said the situation was still precarious but he was hopeful. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic because the two belfries were saved.\u201d He said it was too early to determine exactly which pieces of priceless art were damaged, saying the organ had been affected and paintings may have suffered from water damage. Thousands of Parisians \u2013 many weeping and some praying \u2013 watched as vast orange flames soared from the roof for hours, threatening one of the greatest architectural treasures of the western world. There were gasps on the southern bank of the river Seine as locals watched fire sweep across the roof, which slowly caved in.

It attracts about 13 million visitors a year from around the world. \u201cWe consider the two towers of Notre Dame to have been saved,\u201d the Paris fire-service commander Jean-Claude Galler said at around 11pm, as firefighters were still working to contain flames. The fire service said the fire had been reduced and it was a major accomplishment by hundreds of firefighters that the flames were stopped from spreading to the north tower belfry. However, the roof \u201chad been ravaged\u201d, with around two thirds destroyed. Fire brigade officers, who were preparing to spend the night attempting to cool the building, said the structure of the cathedral was \u201csaved and preserved\u201d. A spokesman said there was still a risk that scaffolding in the heart of the building could collapse. By 7pm, flames had burst through the roof of the cathedral and quickly engulfed the lead and wood structure of the cathedral\u2019s spire, which collapsed.

Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Guillot\/AFP\/Getty Images The spire had been added to the building in the 19th century. As part of its renovations, several bronze statues that surrounded the spire had been removed. The wooden frame at the top of the 13th-century landmark was made from so many oak beams that it was known as \u201cthe forest\u201d. That wood proved so combustible, the Paris fire service said, that it there was a danger to firefighters. Smoke billowed into the sky, visible from across the city, and ash fell in the surrounding area. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said that most artworks and religious relics were removed from Notre Dame as firefighters worked to control the blaze. France\u2019s culture minister, Franck Riester, posted photos on social media of people loading art on to trucks.

On the left bank of the river Seine, thousands of onlookers gathered at police cordons watching as the flames burned high into the clear blue sky. As part of the roof gradually collapsed in flames, bangs and crackles could be heard from the street. Some people sang Catholic liturgies as they watched. Others sank to their knees. Many were in tears. 0:49 Parisians sing hymns as they watch Notre Dame burning \u2013 video Camille, 20, from Normandy, a history student at the Sorbonne, watched as flames blazed through the frame of one of the cathedral\u2019s smaller stained glass windows. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of total sadness and also anger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our heritage. Whether you\u2019re Christian or not, part of our history is going up in smoke.\u201d Alexis, 35, a finance worker, had hurried to the scene after seeing the first images on the television news. \u201cI rushed down. I never thought it would be this depressing,\u201d he said. Over the course of an hour, he watched as the flames spread across the roof and sections of it slowly collapsed. A 55-year-old furniture restorer, who did not wish to give his name, said: \u201cThis is a major moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis building is a symbol of Catholicism. It\u2019s a symbol of Paris.\u201d On the north side of the cathedral on the \u00cele Saint-Louis, more crowds had gathered. \u201cIt\u2019s a national tragedy,\u201d said Paul Rechter, who lives barely 100 metres from the cathedral. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of France that is collapsing there, part of our national identity going up in smoke. Part of our history, our culture, our literature ... How on earth could it have happened? Why were there no precautions?\u201d The Guardian view on the Notre Dame fire: we share France\u2019s terrible loss Read more His wife Agnes said her parents and grandparents had lived on the \u00cele Saint Louis and the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. \u201cWe have known the cathedral since childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our personal history, too.\u201d She said she thought most of all of \u201cthe centuries of work, of craftsmanship, that went into that building ... The number of men who have worked on it down the years.\u201d Pierre Mesnage, 44, who has lived on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 for the past 20 years in an apartment that overlooks the cathedral, said: \u201cI cried when I saw it, honestly. I wept. I see that building every single day, all day if I\u2019m at home. It\u2019s a drama. A personal and a national tragedy. I\u2019m a Catholic, too, so there\u2019s an added significance. I really don\u2019t understand how it could happen. This is an emblem of Paris, an emblem of France. Why wasn\u2019t it protected?\u201d Ruud van der Leij, a computer studies teacher from Rotterdam, said he had been staring at the flames for more than two hours. \u201cYou can\u2019t look away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awful and fascinating at the same time. A terrible, awful, sad affair. Such a symbol.\u201d Marina Valleix, 42, said she had come specially from her home in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. \u201cI do treasure hunts with clues, for children, round the big Paris monuments,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here more or less every weekend.

Credit... Benoit\/Paris Fire Brigade, via Associated Press By Aurelien Breeden Feb. 4, 2019 PARIS \u2014 At least 10 people were killed and 37 injured after a fast-moving fire that may have been intentionally set coursed through an eight-story building in a residential part of western Paris on Tuesday. The fire, which the authorities were treating as a possible case of arson and which appeared to be tied to a neighborhood dispute, was the deadliest in the French capital in over a decade. Footage from the scene provided by the Paris Fire Department to French television showed flames bursting through the upper windows of the building and black smoke swirling around the courtyard, as firefighters climbed up ladders to reach people at their windows. Some were lowered to the ground using harnesses. The police opened a criminal investigation and R\u00e9my Heitz, the Paris prosecutor, told reporters early Tuesday that a 40-year-old woman who lived in the building, on Rue Erlanger, in the 16th Arrondissement, had been taken into custody nearby. \u201cThis person was arrested overnight, not far from the scene, not far from the fire,\u201d Mr. Heitz said. He said that the woman had a history of mental health issues but did not provide more details about her identity or the reasons for her arrest. The fire was the deadliest in Paris since 2005, when 24 people, including 11 children, were killed in a hotel near the Paris Opera , a tragedy that was the worst of its kind since World War II. Later that same year, a fire in a dilapidated apartment building in the 13th Arrondissement killed 17 people. In 2015, eight people died in a fire that tore through an apartment building in the 18th Arrondissement of the capital. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Jean-Francois Monier \/ AFP New tensions on Monday flared in France's eastern city of Dijon after it was rocked by a weekend of unrest blamed on Chechens seeking vengeance for an assault on a teenager. Police sources said the unrest was sparked by an attack on a 16-year-old member of the Chechen community on June 10. Members of the Chechen diaspora then set out on so-called punishment raids seeking to avenge the assault, they said. news Russian TV Channel Appears to Add Footage of US Unrest to Film Read more After three successive nights of violence, early Monday evening some 150 people, some hooded and armed, again assembled in Dijon, setting rubbish bins and a car on fire. Some also shot into the air, police sources told AFP. \"What happened is unprecedented and unacceptable,\" the city's mayor, Francois Rebsamen, told AFP. Attacks had already taken place on three successive nights starting Friday, with many people wielding baseball bats. The local prefect Bernard Schmeltz \u2014 the top state official in the region \u2014 said in a statement that the violence \"appeared to be part of a settling of scores between members of the Chechen community in France and residents\" of Dijon. Police said that in one incident some 50 Chechens entered the restive district of Gresilles overnight Saturday, and a man who owns a pizzeria was badly wounded by apparent gunfire. Even more people, around 200, also entered Gresilles late on Sunday with violent intent. In an interview with local daily Le Bien Public, a man claiming to be a Chechen said the raids aimed to avenge an assault by local drug dealers on the 16-year-old. \"There were about a hundred of us from all over France but also from Belgium and Germany. We never intended to ransack the city or take it out on the people,\" said the man, who was not identified by name. Dijon prosecutor Eric Mathais said a total of six people had been injured in the three incidents on the successive nights, but no one has yet been arrested. A probe has been opened into attempted murder by a criminal gang, he added. Rebsamen said the police reinforcements were arriving after he spoke by telephone with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Thirty-seven anti-riot police members came on Sunday, while 110 additional gendarmes will be deployed from Monday, he said. Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus. Two wars in the 1990s triggered a wave of emigration, with many Chechens heading for western Europe.

A man, 22, stabbed passers-by in a park in Villejuif, about 8km (5 miles) south of the French capital, on Friday. He was later identified by prosecutors as Nathan C, a 22-year-old with a history of mental illness for which he had been admitted to hospital. According to French media, witnesses heard him say that he was \"out of medication\". Prosecutors said that some religious items were later found in his bag, but that there was \"no evidence at this stage suggesting he was radicalised\". The attack took place at about 14:00 local time (13:00 GMT) at Hautes-Bruy\u00e8res park, and the targets appeared to have been chosen at random. In a statement posted on Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to the victims. \"I extend my support to the victims of the attack, their families and the police,\" he said. \"We resolutely pursue the fight against indiscriminate violence and our fight for the security of all French people.\" The mayor of Villejuif, Franck Le Bohellec, said the deceased victim was a 56-year-old man who was out walking in the park with his wife at the time of the attack. He died trying to protect her, the mayor said. She was seriously injured.

Ms Yan posted on Chinese social media that she \u201ctook antipyretics and managed to pass through checks at the airport and enter French territory\u201d after suffering from a fever and a cough. \u201cThe Chinese ambassador received calls and emails from several Chinese citizens\u201d about the post, and contacted the woman to tell her to phone emergency services immediately, according to a spokesperson from Beijing's embassy in Paris.

This 26 th edition will take place at Charl\u00e9ty Stadium from 26 to 30 August 2020. Paris will host the European Athletics Championships 2020 thanks to an ambitious and ecological application. From the moment these championships opened to applicants, Paris put everything in place to propose an excellent application. The French Athletics Federation and the Paris 2020 committee made a number of outstanding presentations in front of the various stakeholders. Their application had an even greater impact due to the fact that it benefited from considerable support from the public authorities both in Paris and in France as a whole. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that the European Athletics Council validated the Parisian project to host the European Athletics Championships 2020. It\u2019s an ambitious yet realistic project, which will enable us to return our sport to centre stage again, shortly after the Olympic Games,\u201d said European Athletics President Svein Arne Hansen. Andr\u00e9 Giraud, President of the French Athletics Federation, said, \u201cHosting the European Championships in France is a great opportunity for us to unify our clubs and our members around a popular event, which is intended to convey our values: setting new targets, commitment and solidarity\u2026\u201d Paris 2020, a neutral ecological footprint \u201cI\u2019m sure that Paris is capable of organising some fantastic championships, on a par with those organised over recent years in Zurich and Amsterdam, as well as those which are being prepared for next year in Berlin\u201d, said President Hansen. Paris is ready to take up the gauntlet by organising a responsible championships. Indeed, through the Green Inspiration concept, the organisation team for Paris 2020 is keen to reduce the environmental impact of the competition. Firstly, by reducing the distances between the athletes\u2019 village, the University campus and the competition site, Charl\u00e9ty Stadium. Between the two key venues, it\u2019s just 5 minutes\u2019 walk. They\u2019ll also be proposing some special offers, which will encourage spectators to favour public transport. Communication will not be outdone either as the digital and paperless formats will help to reduce the event\u2019s carbon footprint, something to inspire new generations for the foreseeable future. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be supporting this event,\u201d said Pierre Weiss, President of the organising committee, \u201cas you\u2019re supposed to be federative to promote athletics, and it also shows off France\u2019s expertise in terms of the organisation of environmentally-friendly events.\u201d Athletics at Charl\u00e9ty, a great story Despite the fact that France is one of the oldest European federations, the French public has had just one opportunity to support its athletes on home soil for the European Athletics Championships, back in 1938 at the Olympic Stadium in Colombes. At this time, the championships were reserved for men, with 272 athletes from 23 different nations. Meantime, the women competed in a special championship in Vienna. The stakes will be a lot higher in 2020, since nearly 1,500 athletes, from 51 member federations of the European Athletics will be expected to compete at S\u00e9bastien Charl\u00e9ty Stadium, to the south-east of Paris. The stadium, which can accommodate 20,000 people, is a prime venue in the history of athletics as it hosted the Finals of the IAAF Grand Prix in 1994 and 2002. In 2017, the MEETING de PARIS (IAAF Diamond League) will also be held at the Charl\u00e9ty Stadium, on Saturday 1 July. \u201cCharl\u00e9ty Stadium offers a fantastic infrastructure for athletics and the Parisian public has a reputation for being enthusiastic. The stadium\u2019s capacity is perfect for the European Athletics Championships and so it\u2019s likely to attract a big crowd, particularly during the evening sessions,\u201d said President Hansen. \u201cThese different factors, combined with its expertise in terms of the French Athletics Federation and local protagonists, as well as the presence of Europe\u2019s top athletes, are a guarantee that these championships will remain etched in people\u2019s minds\u201d. Paris accueillera les Championnats d\u2019Europe d\u2019Athl\u00e9tisme 2020 European Athletics a officialis\u00e9 ce vendredi 28 avril la nomination de Paris en tant que ville-h\u00c3\u00b4te des Championnats d\u2019Europe d\u2019Athl\u00e9tisme 2020. Cette 26 \u00e8me \u00e9dition se d\u00e9roulera au Stade Charl\u00e9ty du 26 au 30 ao\u00c3\u00bbt 2020. Paris accueillera donc les Championnats d\u2019Europe d\u2019athl\u00e9tisme en 2020, gr\u00c3\u00a2ce \u00c3\u00a0 une candidature ambitieuse et \u00e9cologique. D\u00e8s les premiers jours de l\u2019ouverture aux candidatures pour ces championnats, Paris a tout mis en \u00c5\u201cuvre pour faire valoir sa candidature. La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00c3\u00a7aise d\u2019athl\u00e9tisme et le comit\u00e9 Paris 2020 ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9 de remarquables pr\u00e9sentations devant les diff\u00e9rentes parties prenantes. La candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019autant plus impactante qu\u2019elle a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du soutien consid\u00e9rable des pouvoirs publics parisiens et fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. \u201cJe suis ravi que le conseil de European Athletics ait valid\u00e9 le projet parisien pour accueillir les Championnats d\u2019Europe d\u2019Athl\u00e9tisme 2020. Un projet ambitieux et r\u00e9aliste qui permettra de remettre notre sport sur le devant de la sc\u00e8ne, peu apr\u00e8s les Jeux olympiques,\u201d a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Pr\u00e9sident de European Athletics, Svein Arne Hansen. \u201c Accueillir les Championnats d\u2019Europe en France est pour nous une occasion formidable de f\u00e9d\u00e9rer nos clubs et nos licenci\u00e9s autour d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement populaire qui se veut vecteur de nos valeurs : d\u00e9passement de soi, engagement, solidarit\u00e9\u2026 \u201d souligne Andr\u00e9 Giraud, Pr\u00e9sident de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00c3\u00a7aise d\u2019athl\u00e9tisme. Paris 2020, une empreinte \u00e9cologique neutre \u201c Je suis certain que Paris saura organiser de formidables championnats, \u00c3\u00a0 la hauteur de ceux organis\u00e9s ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es \u00c3\u00a0 Zurich et Amsterdam, ou encore de ceux qui se pr\u00e9parent l\u2019ann\u00e9e prochaine \u00c3\u00a0 Berlin, \u201c a soulign\u00e9 le Pr\u00e9sident Svein Arne Hansen. Paris est pr\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 relever le d\u00e9fi, en organisant des championnats responsables. Avec le concept Green Inspiration , l\u2019organisation de Paris 2020 souhaite r\u00e9duire l\u2019impact environnemental de la comp\u00e9tition. D\u2019abord, en r\u00e9duisant les distances entre le village des athl\u00e8tes, \u00c3\u00a0 la Cit\u00e9 Universitaire, et le site de comp\u00e9tition, le Stade Charl\u00e9ty. Entre les deux, seulement 5 minutes \u00c3\u00a0 pied ! Mais \u00e9galement en proposant des offres sp\u00e9cifiques qui pousseront les spectateurs \u00c3\u00a0 privil\u00e9gier les transports en commun. La communication ne sera pas en reste. Le digital et les formats d\u00e9mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9s aideront \u00c3\u00a0 r\u00e9duire l\u2019empreinte carbone de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement. De quoi inspirer durablement les nouvelles g\u00e9n\u00e9rations ! \u201c Je suis ravi de porter cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement , dit Pierre Weiss, Pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 d\u2019organisation, car il se veut f\u00e9d\u00e9rateur pour promouvoir l\u2019athl\u00e9tisme, mais parce qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement l\u2019expertise de la France en mati\u00e8re d\u2019organisation et d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements \u00e9coresponsables. \u201c L\u2019athl\u00e9tisme \u00c3\u00a0 Charl\u00e9ty, une belle histoire Malgr\u00e9 que la France soit une des f\u00e9d\u00e9rations europ\u00e9ennes les plus anciennes, le public fran\u00c3\u00a7ais n\u2019a eu qu\u2019une seule occasion de soutenir ses athl\u00e8tes sur son territoire pour des Championnats d\u2019Europe d\u2019athl\u00e9tisme. C\u2019\u00e9tait en 1938, au Stade Olympique de Colombes. A cette \u00e9poque, les championnats \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux hommes, avec 272 athl\u00e8tes de 23 nations diff\u00e9rentes. Les femmes, quant \u00c3\u00a0 elles, participaient \u00c3\u00a0 un championnat sp\u00e9cifique \u00c3\u00a0 Vienne. L\u2019enjeu sera bien plus important, en 2020, puisque pr\u00e8s de 1 500 athl\u00e8tes, provenant des 51 F\u00e9d\u00e9rations Membres de European Athletics, seront attendus au Stade S\u00e9bastien Charl\u00e9ty, au Sud Est de Paris.

(Photo by Lucas BARIOULET \/ AFP) (Photo by LUCAS BARIOULET\/AFP via Getty Images) Paris (CNN) Police in Paris were forced to call for backup on Friday as dozens of protesters outside a theater tried to storm the building and reach President Emmanuel Macron . The Elysee presidential palace told CNN that protesters had tried to enter the building, while video on social media shows police tussling with protesters outside the Bouffes du Nord theater's building. Several demonstrators entered the building before being dragged back out by police. Riot police holding up shields formed a line against the protesters, who shouted \"Macron, out,\" in the latest of more than a month of protests against the embattled President's pension reform plans. The President and his wife, Brigitte Macron, \"were secured\" for several minutes but were able to return and finish watching \"The Fly,\" French news agency AFP reported, citing sources from the President's office. French newspaper Le Monde reported online that police called for reinforcement to quell the protests and to escort the President and his wife home. Read More Journalist and political activist Taha Bouhafs posted a video from inside the theater showing the back of the President's head, making comments that allegedly invited activists to come and disrupt the show. Bouhafs has been arrested over the tweet, on suspicion of taking part in a group formed to commit violence or damage, a French judicial source told CNN. Protests across France over pension reforms have hit fuel and power supplies, and cause large-scale transport disruption and the shutdown of schools. Macron says the changes are necessary to make the system fairer and more sustainable, but unions say workers will lose out. CNN's Angela Dewan and Arnaud Siad contributed to this report.

Photograph: Thibault Camus\/AP France This article is more than 4 years old Two injured in knife attack outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices in Paris This article is more than 4 years old Two arrested and counter-terrorism investigation launched after incident Jon Henley and Kim Willsher in Paris Fri 25 Sep 2020 18.12 BST First published on Fri 25 Sep 2020 12.08 BST Share A counter-terrorism investigation has been launched in France after two people were seriously injured in a knife attack in front of the former offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Two arrests have been made and the victims\u2019 lives were not in danger, authorities said. A man wearing bloodstained clothing and carrying a large knife or machete was detained near the Place de la Bastille in eastern Paris shortly after the attack, police said. The victims were a man and a woman employed by a TV production company called Premi\u00e8res Lignes based in the same building as the newspaper\u2019s former offices. A member of staff at Premi\u00e8res Ligne said the pair were having a cigarette outside the building when they were attacked. \u201cThere was one assailant who had a very big knife. The attack was very violent. I could hear the screams from the second floor,\u201d the unnamed man said. All schools in the area were placed in lockdown as a security measure. A large meat cleaver found near the scene is believed to have been used by the attacker. France\u2019s counter-terrorism prosecutors\u2019 office said it had opened an investigation into attempted murder in relation to a terrorist enterprise. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard, the head of the anti-terrorism unit, said the principal suspect, aged 18, was arrested at 1.26pm local time (1226 BST). Analysis of blood on his clothing and CCTV cameras suggested he had carried out the knife attack. A second person, aged 33, was arrested at 1.37pm. \u201cWe are currently trying to establish his link to the principal subject,\u201d Ricard said. A crisis control centre was opened at the interior ministry. Map Early reports said four people had been wounded, but police later amended the figure to two. It is unclear what motivated the attack on Friday morning. Charlie Hebdo has moved from its previous address on the Rue Nicolas-Appert since an attack by Islamist extremists in 2015 in which several of its editorial staff, including some of France\u2019s best-known cartoonists, were among 12 people killed. The new address is kept secret for security reasons. The trial of 14 suspects accused of involvement in the Charlie Hebdo killings, carried out by brothers Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, and in a subsequent attack on the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket, is currently under way in Paris. The newspaper republished controversial cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, which it first printed in 2006, to mark the start of the trial, saying in an editorial it would \u201cnever lie down \u2026 We will never give up\u201d. The staff of Charlie Hebdo sent a message of \u201csupport and solidarity\u201d in a tweet, describing Friday\u2019s knife attack as odious. A Premi\u00e8res Lignes employee, who asked not to be identified, said she was sitting at her desk when she heard shouting from the street. \u201cAt first it didn\u2019t sound like it was anything bad, but it carried on,\u201d the employee said. \u201cOne of the journalists went to the window and looked out and said: \u2018There\u2019s something going on. Something\u2019s happening.\u2019\u201d Many of the company\u2019s staff had experienced the Charlie Hebdo attack five years ago and were \u201cin shock\u201d, she said. \u201cThey said we must lock the office doors and go up on to the roof. That\u2019s where I looked down and saw one of our colleagues, wounded but alive, in the street. He had been wounded in the head and the hand, I believe.\u201d The employee said the building had since been evacuated. Staff had been interviewed by police and were now waiting in a nearby theatre to hear when they could leave. \u201cEveryone is very shaken,\u201d she said. The prime minister, Jean Castex, the interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, all visited the scene. Castex gave a brief press conference expressing his thoughts for the family and colleagues of those injured and for the forces of law and order and first responders. He added: \u201cI restate our unwavering attachment to freedom of the press, the fight against terrorism and can assure the nation that we are fully mobilised.\u201d Explore more on these topics France Europe Charlie Hebdo Charlie Hebdo attack news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Paris drivers warned of fines as city begins limiting traffic in parts of centre 5d ago Paris mayor sparks row with plan to keep Olympic rings on Eiffel Tower 2 Sept 2024 Paris mayor swims in Seine as river is cleaned up just in time for Olympics 17 Jul 2024 Paris authority slated for hiking cost of M\u00e9tro and bus trips during Olympics 6 May 2024 Gar\u00e7ons!

As water levels touched 5.2 metres on Wednesday, the capital\u2019s authorities said the river was expected to reach 6.1 metres (20ft) by Saturday. The river last reached that level, which is 4m higher than its normal height, during the June 2016 flooding when several monuments, including the Louvre museum, were closed as a result. Quayside roads and tunnels have been closed and all river traffic, including cruise boats and water taxis, halted as vessels are unable to pass under the bridges. Houseboat residents have been advised to move out and Michel Delpuech, the head of the city police, told residents to take extreme care near the water. Parisians were also warned they were more likely to come across members of the city\u2019s rat population after the rising water swamped the rodents\u2019 dens and forced them to seek drier shelters.

Photograph: Thomas Samson\/AFP\/Getty Images On Wednesday morning, a central section of the RER C urban rail line was shut down, closing several stations, including Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and Champ de Mars near the Eiffel Tower. The rail operator, SNCF, said it halted services after closing ventilation shafts to prevent further flooding of tunnels, where staff have been pumping out water. With the city on orange alert, the second highest flood warning level, the mayor, Anne Hidalgo , called a crisis meeting with police chiefs. Officials said the situation was serious but not catastrophic. Part of the Louvre museum, which sits on the bank of the Seine, was closed as works of art were moved to higher ground. The Musee d\u2019Orsay and the Orangerie were also preparing for flooding risks, cancelling their weekly evening opening on Thursday in case works need to be moved. View image in fullscreen The flood warnings have hit during Paris Fashion Week. Photograph: Edward Berthelot\/Getty Images The river overflowed earlier this week because of flood water from upstream where the basin that feeds the Seine has received twice as much rain as normal. Paris suffered the \u201cflood of the century\u201d in 1910 when the Seine reached 8.62 metres. It has been preparing for a similar event for several years. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if there will be a flood, but when,\u201d Colombe Brossel, the mayor\u2019s assistant, said in 2016 . Twenty-three French departments are on high flooding alert, from the Alps in eastern France to Normandy in the west. This article was amended on 24 January 2018. Because of an editing error, an earlier version switched the locations of the Alps and Normandy with each other.

Elle est d\u00e9positaire d\u2019un savoir-faire ancien transmis par des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations de ma\u00eetre-selliers.

Ainsi, une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation compos\u00e9e de responsables chinois effectuera une visite d\u2019\u00e9tudes au sein de la Garde r\u00e9publicaine fran\u00e7aise d\u2019ici mars 2018.

D\u00e9bourrage et dressage Ensuite, la Garde r\u00e9publicaine accueillera des cavaliers chinois dans le cadre de formations (d\u00e9bourrage, dressage, services d\u2019honneur \u00e0 cheval). Ces actions de formation pourront \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9es dans les domaines suivants : la cr\u00e9ation et l\u2019animation d\u2019une commission d\u2019achat de chevaux adapt\u00e9s aux missions d\u2019honneur, la formation de formateurs ayant vocation \u00e0 assumer un r\u00f4le de formateurs-relais au sein des structures de formation \u00e9questre de la partie chinoise, l\u2019\u00e9thologie du cheval \u2026 La Garde r\u00e9publicaine proposera la r\u00e9alisation de missions de formation et d\u2019expertise en Chine, par des militaires de la Garde r\u00e9publicaine sur ces m\u00eames th\u00e8mes. Le cheval apparait \u00e0 maintes reprises dans la mythologie chinoise, il est souvent muni d\u2019une paire d\u2019ailes et il est associ\u00e9 la plupart du temps au dragon. La l\u00e9gende de l\u2019empereur Huangdi, qui fut amen\u00e9 au Ciel par un cheval volant en est une parmi tant d\u2019autres. Le cheval ail\u00e9 revient souvent en peinture et en sculpture. L\u2019une des pi\u00e8ces ma\u00eetresses du mus\u00e9e du Gansu, l\u2019un des plus grands mus\u00e9es de Chine, repr\u00e9sente un \u201ccheval au galop volant\u201d. Le cheval est aussi le 7\u00e8me animal dans l\u2019astrologie chinoise, il symbolise l\u2019esprit vif et la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9. Aujourd\u2019hui, la Chine commence \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper sa fili\u00e8re \u00e9quine avec des \u00e9levages et des clubs hippiques. Si les paris de toutes sortes, y compris hippiques, sont interdits en Chine, de riches chinois ont fait construire des hippodromes dans lesquels ils commencent \u00e0 organiser des courses.

Issued on: 10\/02\/2025 - 16:57 1 min The island is among the most remote of France's possessions \u00a9 PATRICK HERTZOG \/ AFP\/File After affecting 18 percent of the small 58 square kilometre (22 square mile) Amsterdam Island on January 29, the fire is now hitting 45 percent of its territory, the prefecture for France's French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF) told AFP. \"There has been dry weather, and strong, shifting winds, with many changes of direction since January 15,\" said the prefecture, explaining the expansion of the fire. \"The fire is being allowed to burn, because given the isolation of the island, there is no way to extinguish the fire at the moment,\" it added. Located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, approximately 2,800 (1,740 miles) kilometres southeast of the French overseas territory of La Reunion, Amsterdam Island is one of the most isolated islands in the world. The 31 people -- mainly military personnel and scientists -- who were on the island when the fire broke out were all evacuated by boat the following day to Reunion. It is not yet known what caused the fire. Amsterdam Island is home to the Martin-de-Vivies scientific station, an internationally important site for monitoring greenhouse gas concentration worldwide. \"The base has been affected, the buildings are still standing but some water supply and telecommunications infrastructure is no longer operational,\" the prefecture said. A French naval surveillance frigate Floreal was being despatched to the island to examine the current situation with firefighters and other experts on board. They will go to the site to measure the progress of the fire, the extent of the damage and to investigate the causes of the fire, the prefecture said. A haven for wildlife, the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, none of which have any permanent settled population, also include the remote Kerguelen Islands in the Southern Ocean. \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

A case of the clade 1b variant was confirmed in the western Brittany region and \"the recommended oversight measures have been implemented\", the ministry said in a statement. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox and related to smallpox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly. The WHO declared an emergency over the virus in August and renewed it on November 22 following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). France's health ministry said the case concerned \"a person who had not travelled to central Africa, a region where several clades variants of the virus have been circulating for several months\". \"However this person was in contact with two people who returned from central Africa. Inquiries are underway to find the origin of the infection and identify all people in contact.\" Clade 1b and other mpox strains have been reported across 80 countries -- 19 of them in Africa -- so far this year, WHO has said previously. The agency has warned European nations to be prepared for \"rapid action\" to contain the latest variant.

Reports said that one tram, which had been stopped, moved backwards down a slope for unknown reasons, colliding with another tram that was stationary. Videos and photos posted on social media showed two trams containing dozens of people inside. One video shows smoke rising and chaotic scenes as an alarm sounds. A spokesman for the prefecture said an investigation into the cause of the accident has been opened and no fatalities have been confirmed. Prosecutors said the collision was not deliberate. One eyewitness named Johan told AFP news agency that he saw one of the trams reversing at speed, adding: \"We heard a big impact, a big bang.\" Another eyewitness told BFM TV that the doors of the tram flew off on impact. The outlet reported that a large security perimeter was set up in front of the station. The Bas-Rhin region's Fire and Rescue Service posted on X urging people to avoid the area to allow emergency services to access the area.

Try again 01:46 French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou sets out his policy priorities in a speech at the National Assembly in Paris on January 14, 2025. \u00a9 Benoit Tessier, Reuters French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou on Thursday survived his first vote of no confidence in parliament after the motion, brought by the leftist opposition, failed to gain traction on the far right. The challenge in the National Assembly came after Bayrou's statement this week on his government policy agenda, in which he opened the door to fresh talks on a 2023 pension reform \"without taboo\" but also said that France's \"excessive\" deficits needed to be cut in this year's budget. The speech sparked condemnation from most of the opposition in parliament where Bayrou \u2013 in the job only since last month \u2013 is well short of an absolute majority, making his government highly vulnerable to any no-confidence vote that, if successful, would force it to resign. Jordan Bardella , the leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), dismissed it as \"idle talk\" by \"a man of spineless continuity\". But the backers of the no-confidence motion, submitted by the hard-left LFI party, failed to win the RN's backing. \"We don't think a no-confidence vote should be a gadget to create a buzz,\" RN deputy Jean-Philippe Tanguy said ahead of the vote. The RN's vice-president, Sebastien Chenu, added also before the vote that his party would judge the government \"not by its words, but by its actions\". Tanguy warned, however, that the RN might still come for Bayrou over his budget for 2025 which is overdue after the previous government of Michel Barnier was toppled over its austerity plans. The new government's budget announcement would be a \"moment of truth\", Tanguy said. 'Another path' The near-certainty of defeat as the vote neared did little to diminish LFI's combativity. \"Mr Prime Minister, the days of your government of unhappiness are numbered,\" said LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard as the debate on the no-confidence motion got under way. \"And when it falls, the monarch will follow,\" he said, in a reference to President Emmanuel Macron , who appointed Bayrou as France's fourth prime minister within a year only last month. Bayrou meanwhile accused the hard left of trying to take France down the path of \"infighting\". The prime minister welcomed the decision of the moderately-left Socialists to deny the LFI motion their backing, despite having been allied with the LFI since last year's general election. The Socialists' defection showed that \"another path towards understanding is opening up\", Bayrou said. The no-confidence motion won the backing of 131 deputies, well short of the 288 it needed to pass. French politics was plunged into chaos last year when Macron called an election to break political deadlock but the vote returned a hopelessly divided lower chamber.

In 2015 Serge Atlaoui won a last-minute reprieve from being executed by a 13-member firing squad. The transfer agreement was signed remotely by Indonesia\u2019s senior minister of law Yusril Ihza Mahendra and France\u2019s Minister of Justice G\u00e9rald Darmanin, and was witnessed by delegations from both countries in Jakarta and Paris. It came after Atlaoui, 61, made a last-ditch plea to be returned home last month. The father of four, who is reportedly suffering from cancer, wrote to the Indonesian government requesting to serve the rest of his sentence in France. The deal will allow him to return home on Feb. 4, Mahendra said. \u201cThe Indonesian government has decided not to execute the prisoner and has agreed to transfer him to France,\u201d Mahendra told a joint news conference attended by France\u2019s ambassador to Indonesia, Fabien Penone. Penone thanked the Indonesian government for granting Atlaoui\u2019s request. \u201cWe want to develop our legal cooperation in a much more straightforward way,\u201d Penone said, adding: \u201cWe are reinforcing our bilateral relationship, we have a real partnership.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE China and Indonesia agree to boost maritime security cooperation in South China Sea despite tensions Indonesia offers to temporarily shelter wounded and orphaned Palestinians from Gaza Nations puzzle over how to respond to US trade war as global markets gyrate Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 for his alleged involvement in a factory manufacturing the psychedelic drug MDMA, sometimes called ecstasy, on the outskirts of Jakarta. His lawyers say he was employed as a welder at the factory and did not understand what the chemicals on the premises were used for. Atlaoui, from Metz, has maintained his innocence during his 19 years\u2019 incarceration, claiming that he was installing machinery in what he thought was an acrylics plant. Police accused him of being a \u201cchemist\u201d at the site. He was initially sentenced to life, but the Supreme Court in 2007 increased the sentence to death on appeal. His case has drawn attention in France, which vigorously opposes the death penalty \u201cin all places and under all circumstances.\u201d Mahendra said the French government had informed him that the maximum criminal penalty in France was 30 years imprisonment. Once repatriated, \u201cthe authority to treat the convict is entirely under French government,\u201d Mahendra said. If the France want to pardon Atlaoui or grant clemency, \u201cthat is entirely their authority and which we must also respect,\u201d the minister added. Indonesia executed eight death-row prisoners in May 2015, but Atlaoui was granted a stay of execution because he still had an outstanding court appeal. An Administrative Court in Jakarta denied that appeal the following month.

Zaheer Mahmood, 29, from Pakistan, attacked and badly wounded two employees of the Premieres Lignes news agency, days after Charlie Hebdo had republished cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. He was unaware Charlie Hebdo had moved offices to a secret location after 12 people were killed there in a gun attack claimed by al-Qaeda following the original publication of the cartoons in 2015. Mahmood was convicted of attempted murder and terrorist conspiracy. He will be banned from France when his sentence is served. Five other Pakistani men, some of whom were under 18 at the time of their crimes, were jailed for between three and 12 years on terrorist conspiracy charges for supporting Mahmood. The trial was held in the juvenile court in Paris due to their ages. The court heard that Mahmood had planned his attack after Charlie Hebdo republished its cartoons of the Prophet in September 2020 to mark the opening of the trial of some of those responsible for the 2015 massacre. The court was told that Mahmood was influenced by radical Pakistani preacher Khadim Hussain Rizvi, who had urged him to \"avenge the Prophet\". Armed with a meat cleaver, he arrived at Hebdo's former offices in the French capital's 11th district, and attacked and seriously wounded two employees of the Premieres Lignes news agency, which has offices nearby. Witnesses at the time described how they saw their colleagues \"bloodied, being chased by a man with a machete\". His victims, a woman named \"Helene\", 32, and a 37-year-old man, were present at the sentencing but did not comment on its outcome. Neither has accepted Mahmood's pleas for forgiveness. \"It broke something within me,\" the 37-year-old said, as he told the court of his lengthy rehabilitation process. Mahmood arrived in France illegally in 2017, although initially claimed to arrive in 2019. He also lied about his age, claiming to be 18.

Try again 01:40 French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou argues that a budget must be passed without delay. \u00a9 Christophe Archambault, AFP Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou on Monday moved to force through France 's budget without a vote but looked certain to keep his job -- for now -- thanks to support from the Socialists in the bitterly divided parliament. Bayrou, a veteran centrist named by President Emmanuel Macron in December to end months of political crisis following last summer's inconclusive legislative elections , is nowhere near having a parliamentary majority. Bayrou rammed through the budget legislation on Monday using article 49.3 of the constitution, which allows the government to pass laws without a vote. The step immediately prompted a no-confidence motion from the left in the divided parliament. But even if the far-right National Rally (RN ) party decides to back the vote this week, Bayrou appears certain to keep his job for now, after the Socialist Party decided against backing the motion, giving the prime minister a much-needed boost. \"No country can live without a budget,\" Bayrou told the National Assembly lower house. \"We have spared no effort to break this deadlock\", he added, thanking his ministers. The government is under pressure from the European Commission to bring the country's sprawling deficits and growing debt under control. A sustainable budget plan for this year is the priority for Bayrou, after the austerity budget plan of his predecessor, Michel Barnier , was jettisoned along with his government in December. 'Light in the tunnel' The adoption of the budget will make it possible to limit the deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP, Bayrou said, still one of the widest in the eurozone. On Monday, he resorted to the tactic twice, to force through the budget as well as the social security budget, and may need to do this again later this week. The use of article 49.3, while convenient for a minority government, means the opposition has the right to put forward a no-confidence motion to bring the prime minister and his government down. In December, the far-right National Rally party teamed up with a left-wing bloc to topple Barnier's government. Marine Le Pen also holds the key to the government's survival. \u00a9 Thomas Samson, AFP The hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) on Monday swiftly called for a similar vote towards toppling Bayrou's government, tabling a motion of censure. The motion was due to be put to the vote on Wednesday. The RN said it would make its position clear the same day. Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director at risk analysis firm Eurasia Group, said that Bayrou looked likely to survive the vote and France would have the budget, \"a month late.\" \"Is there light in the tunnel of France's budgetary and political crisis? Yes, probably,\" he said on X. The adoption of the budget and survival of Bayrou's government would be a huge relief for Macron. New legislative elections cannot take place until at least one year after the previous polls, so the toppling of Bayrou's government would plunge France into uncharted political waters. Bayrou is Macron's sixth prime minister since taking office in 2017. The president has faced calls to step down but has repeatedly insisted he will serve out his term in full. French President Emmanuel Macron has been under intense political pressure. \u00a9 Sebastien Bozon, AFP 'Spirit of responsibility' The Socialist lawmakers said in a statement that despite the concessions the legislation remained \"a right-wing budget\". But they also pointed to a \"spirit of responsibility\" and \"the interests of the country\" as they explained their decision to back Bayrou \"at a time when France is waiting to have a budget.\" Labour Minister Catherine Vautrin defended \"the first step\" towards getting France's finances under control, estimating that the social security deficit will be \"in excess of 22 billion euros\" in 2025. Frederic Valletoux, head of the social affairs committee, said: \"Never in 15 years have the social security accounts seen such a high level of deficit, with the exception of 2020, the peak year of the pandemic.\" The prime minister managed to convince the Socialists not to back a no-confidence motion against him earlier this year in a major victory that heralded the end of the New Popular Front (NFP), a broad left-wing alliance that had endured since the election campaign. But the Socialists broke off talks with Bayrou's administration last week after he referred to migrants \"flooding\" France, borrowing from terminology previously used by the far right. Read more French PM Bayrou sparks outrage with far-right rhetoric on migrant \u2018flood\u2019 In a symbolic move, the party leadership decided Monday to table a separate no-confidence motion after Bayrou's \"flooding\" comments, according to party sources.The move was not expected to be supported by the far right or centre right and therefore will not help topple Bayrou's government, party sources said.

The motion received just 115 votes out of the 289 needed to topple the government after the far-right National Rally and the centre-left Socialist Party opted not to support the move. Immediately afterwards, the prime minister invoked article 49.3 again to pass the portion of the bill regarding government expenditure by force, likely inviting another no-confidence vote from the leftist opposition this week. The decision of the Socialist Party not to support votes of no-confidence linked to the minority government's attempts to pass a budget has deepened tensions within the leftist New Popular Front alliance, which won the most seats in last year's snap elections while falling far short of a majority in the National Assembly.

Under an agreement last month between both countries for his transfer, Jakarta has left it to the French government to grant him either clemency, amnesty or a reduced sentence.

A welder from Metz in northeastern France, he has always denied being a drug trafficker, saying that he was installing machinery in what he thought was an acrylic factory. His return was made possible after an agreement between French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin and his Indonesian counterpart, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, on January 24. In the agreement, Jakarta said it had decided not to execute Atlaoui and authorised his return on \u201chumanitarian grounds\u201d because he was ill.

The government has no majority in parliament, and Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou had used special constitutional powers to get the budget bill approved without a vote by lawmakers, which triggered the no-confidence motion. Only 128 lawmakers approved the motion, far from the 289 votes \u2014 or half the National Assembly seats \u2014 needed for it to pass. Both the Socialists and far-right National Rally lawmakers refused to support it. Under France\u2019s Constitution, the motion\u2019s failure automatically turns the 2025 budget into law. French politics have been in disarray since President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections last year that left no party with a parliamentary majority. Bayrou, a veteran centrist, was appointed in December amid a political crisis prompted by budget disputes that led to the collapse of his predecessor\u2019s government . RELATED COVERAGE Olympic organizing team unveiled for 2030 Winter Games in French Alps France\u2019s government is fighting for survival over its 2025 budget. Here\u2019s what to know France braces for a political showdown as the new prime minister seeks to force a budget through A reassuring move for France and Europe France has been under pressure from the European Union to reduce its huge debt and deficit, which in 2024 reached 6.1% of GDP. The government has argued the country needs an operational budget at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening new tariffs on the EU and Russia is growing more emboldened in Ukraine. Bayrou acknowledged Wednesday an \u201cimperfect budget\u201d but said its adoption was an urgent step \u201cbecause our country cannot live without a budget.\u201d A budget meant to reduce deficit The budget is meant to reduce France\u2019s deficit to 5.4% of gross domestic product this year, including through spending cuts and tax increases worth a total of 50 billion euros. During discussions meant to seek a compromise in parliament, Bayrou agreed to provide an additional 1 billion euros for hospitals and committed not to cut 4,000 jobs in national education. He also said last month he was open to renegotiating a contested plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. The government said it intends to use its special powers next week to pass the social security budget, allowing key financial measures to be implemented by the end of the month. A political victory for Bayrou In December, a no-confidence motion forced conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign as all opposition forces, from the hard-left to the far-right, joined to bring the government down. Barnier had been named to solve the political impasse created by last year\u2019s elections, but his proposed austerity budget deepened divisions. Macron tapped Bayrou in the hope he could bridge divides. Unlike Barnier, Bayrou held intense negotiations with the Socialists aimed at reaching a non-aggression deal over the budget under which they would agree not to undercut each other. In a parliament with no party dominant, all have leverage, and Bayrou needed to convince just one opposition group not to support the motion.

(Photo by BORIS HORVAT \/ AFP) French scientists have reached a \u2018crucial milestone\u2019 in the long road towards nuclear fusion by managing to maintain raging-hot plasma for a record 22 minutes, officials have said. Advertisement Nuclear fusion has the much-vaunted potential to provide the world with clean, safe and nearly inexhaustible energy \u2013 but the scientific holy grail has remained stubbornly elusive over decades. The idea is to recreate the process that occurs at the heart of stars by fusing two atomic nuclei. This would be the opposite of fission \u2013 which splits the atom \u2013 currently used in nuclear power plants. Among other things, the process requires temperatures of more than 100 million degrees Celsius to create and maintain plasma. This hot, electrically charged gas easily becomes unstable, which can lead to lost energy and limit the efficiency of a possible future fusion reactor. The WEST tokamak machine in southern France managed to maintain plasma for 1,337 seconds on February 12th, government-funded research organisation the Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique et aux \u00e9nergies alternatives (CEA) said in a statement. This \u2018smashed\u2019 the previous record set in China last month by 25 percent, said the CEA, which runs the tokamak machine. The CEA\u2019s head of fundamental research Anne-Isabelle Etienvre told AFP that achieving plasma for that long shows, \u201cthat we control its production, but also its maintenance\u201d. But there are still many \u2018technological barriers\u2019 to overcome before thermonuclear fusion can, \u201cproduce more energy than it consumes\u201d, she added. Advertisement In the coming month, the WEST team is aiming to achieve even longer plasma durations \u2013 \u2018up to several hours combined\u2019 \u2013 as well as higher temperatures, according to the CEA. In doing so, the researchers hope to approach the conditions, \u201cexpected in fusion plasmas\u201d, the statement said. The scientists will also observe the effect that such intense plasma has on the inside of their tokamak machine, Etienvre said. The goal is to prepare the ground for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) being built in France, she added. First set in motion in 1985, the ITER brings together China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. It had been scheduled to go online this year, but repeated setbacks, delays and spiralling costs have postponed operations until at least 2033.

The police officers were on patrol at a demonstration taking place in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"I have lived in France for 41 years and I have never experienced something like this,\" Cemalettin Canak, 55, told the Reuters news agency. \"It has shocked me a lot,\" he added. \"Now when I go to the market, I will be a little nervous.\" Getty Images Of the two officers taken to hospital, the one injured to the chest was later discharged, prosecutors told the AFP news agency, while three others suffered minor injuries. \"Horror has seized our city,\" Mulhouse mayor Michele Lutz wrote on Facebook.

Pre-filled disposable e-cigarettes, known as \"puffs\", are popular with young people, can have a high nicotine content, come in many flavours including apple, watermelon and cola and are cheap. \"It is a great victory in a two-pronged battle that we were fighting: an environmental battle against the polluting lithium batteries in these 'puffs', and a health battle for our schoolchildren,\" lawmaker Francesca Pasquini, the author of the bill, told AFP. \"A fine piece of cross-party work!\" lawmaker Michel Lauzzana said on X. Addressing President Emmanuel Macron, Lauzzana added: \"We are now awaiting the promulgation of this law and its application throughout the country.\" The legislation was earlier approved by the National Assembly lower house. The measure is part of a wider government anti-smoking campaign. Health authorities in France and Belgium say that chronic nicotine consumption is especially harmful to the adolescent brain and could encourage use of other drugs. In December 2024, Belgium approved legislation to become the first EU country to ban disposable e-cigarettes.

Issued on: 06\/03\/2025 - 17:31 Modified: 06\/03\/2025 - 19:21 3 min By: FRANCE 24 \/ FRANCE 24 The European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 6 rocket lifts off from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, on March 6, 2025. \u00a9 Ronan Lietar, AFP Europe 's new rocket Ariane 6 successfully carried out its first commercial mission on Thursday, placing a French military satellite into orbit and confirming the continent's independent access to space . After several delays including a last-minute postponement on Monday , the heavy-lift rocket blasted off into rainy skies from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana just before 1:30 pm local time (1630 GMT). Around an hour after the launch, the control centre burst into applause as the rocket released the satellite into orbit, marking a successful mission. The high-profile launch comes as Europe seeks to strengthen its defences amid doubts it can still rely on the United States as a security partner under new US President Donald Trump . The success means that Europe can now independently put large satellites into orbit for the first time since Russia pulled its heavy Soyuz rockets after invading Ukraine in 2022. Ariane 6 was initially scheduled to have its first flight in 2020, but repeated delays meant the rocket did not blast off for the first time until July last year. Its first commercial mission put the CSO-3 satellite into orbit at an altitude of around 800 kilometres (500 miles) above Earth. CSO-3 has been waiting since 2022 to complete a network of three French military imaging satellites, with the first two launched in 2018 and 2020 on Soyuz rockets. 'Europe must ensure its own security' Europe has just 10 military satellites\u00a0\u2013 five French and five Italian\u00a0\u2013 compared to \"hundreds\" for the United States and China, French General Philippe Steininger said. \"Europe must ensure its own security,\" the European Space Agency 's space transportation director Toni Tolker-Nielsen said in Kourou earlier this week. He called for the number of annual Ariane 6 launches to increase to 12, compared to the five planned for this year. A previous attempt to launch the mission on Monday was called off just 30 minutes before launching due to a dysfunctional valve on one of the refuelling pipes, Arianespace said. Other planned launches in December and February were also scrubbed. Postponed launches are common for new rockets. The latest test flight of the world's biggest rocket, SpaceX 's Starship, is also scheduled for launch later Thursday after a last-minute postponement on Monday . The European space industry has struggled to remain competitive with Elon Musk 's SpaceX, which has become increasingly dominant when it comes to launching satellites. And SpaceX is only expected to become more central to US space efforts now that the billionaire Musk has become a prominent adviser to Trump. 'Important step' Europe recently found itself without a way to independently launch missions into space due to the Ariane 6 delays. Its predecessor Ariane 5 retired in 2023, Russia pulled its Soyuz rockets and an accident grounded the smaller Vega-C launcher for two years. But with Vega-C resuming flights in December and Ariane 6's first commercial launch, European space efforts are hoping to turn a page on the crisis. Given the military role of the satellite, heavy security was deployed at the spaceport on the northern coast of South America, with French fighter jets deployed to patrol the surrounding skies. Arnaud Prost, a French pilot who is also a reserve astronaut for the European Space Agency, learned that Monday's launch was scrubbed while he was flying a surveillance plane above the launchpad. A successful Ariane 6 launch was \"an important step for the independence of France and Europe's access to space,\" he told AFP. \"At the moment, Europe needs to find projects that bring us together,\" he said. \"Space exploration is a unique opportunity to do this.\" (FRANCE 24 with AFP) Read next Launch of Europe\u2019s Ariane 6 space rocket postponed due to \u2018anomaly\u2019 on the ground Europe Second time sideways: US lunar lander ends up tilted in another bumpy moon landing Technology Today's top stories A trap?

Jean-Pierre Maldera, described by French media as a \"godfather\" of the local mafia in the 1980s, was reportedly chased in his car and shot as he travelled up the A41 motorway on Wednesday morning. The shooters fled the scene and the burnt-out remains of the stolen Renault Megane car they were driving was found in a Grenoble parking lot shortly after. His death comes ten years after the disappearance of his younger brother, Robert Maldera, another mafia boss reportedly nicknamed \"the madman\" by members of Grenoble's criminal underworld. Regional newspaper Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 reported Maldera left the BMW he was driving and attempted to escape on foot across the motorway.

In 2004, the pair were found guilty of a series of offences linked to organised crime, though they were released the following year due to an administrative error, according to the French media. However, this was not the first time Maldera had been convicted. He had a rap sheet stretching back to the 1970s, according to French regional media outlet France 3. But Maldera appeared to opt for a quieter life after his release from prison in the early 2000s, with AFP news agency reporting the authorities did not hear of him again until his shooting this week. It is not clear if Maldera was still involved in criminal activity at the time of his death. His brother Robert disappeared in 2015 at the age of 55. He went missing after attending a meeting on the outskirts of Grenoble. His car was discovered two months later in a parking lot nearby.

The French far-right politician was found guilty on Monday of embezzling EU funds and she was barred from standing in an election for five years, with immediate effect. The decision means that, unless she can get her sentence overturned before the 2027 presidential election, Le Pen will likely not be able to stand. \"I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this,\" Le Pen told French TV station TF1. She said she would appeal against the verdict \"as soon as possible\" using \"whatever legal avenues I can\". Shock verdict rocks French far right Le Pen has been given a four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended. The other two can be spent with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She has also been handed a \u20ac100,000 (\u00a382,635) fine. \"Millions of French people are outraged,\" she said, claiming that judges have \"implemented measures that are reserved for authoritarian regimes\". Le Pen added that she was \"scandalised, indignant, but this indignation, this feeling of injustice, is an additional push to the fight that I fight for them [the voters]\". But the appeal process may take a long time. The appeals trial would probably not happen for another year, and a verdict would come several months after that. Preparing a presidential campaign under these circumstances could prove complicated. The 2027 election would have been her fourth attempt, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old president of the National Rally (RN), said on Monday that Le Pen's sentencing was a \"democratic scandal\". Bardella also called for a \"popular, peaceful mobilisation\". He then posted a link to an online petition which says a \"dictatorship of judges... wished to prevent French people from expressing themselves\". \"Let's show those who want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!\" the petition reads. At the start of the reading of the verdict, the judge, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" which saw the embezzlement of \u20ac2.9m worth of European funds. Two dozen RN figures were also found guilty and the party was ordered to pay a \u20ac2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Le Pen was accused, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, of hiring assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them. During the trial last year, Le Pen denied she had committed \"the slightest irregularity\". Before the sentence was issued on Monday, she stormed out of the court, alongside other defendants and headed to the RN's Paris headquarters, where the party held a \"crisis meeting\". At the weekend, Le Pen had told media that while she was \"not nervous\", the judges had \"the power of life or death over the [political] movement\". Shortly before her sentencing, Le Pen received messages of support from the Kremlin, as well as European allies such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini. But some of Le Pen's opponents have also stated they disapprove of the judge's decision. Media reported that centrist Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was \"troubled\" by the ruling against Marine Le Pen, although he did not intend to make a public statement on the matter. \"The choice to dismiss an elected official should only belong to the people,\" said Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI). And Laurent Wauquiez, of the right-wing Republicans, said that the decision would \"weigh very heavily on the functioning of our democracy\". \"It's undoubtedly not the route that should have been taken.\" The reading of the verdict, which started shortly after 10:00 (09:00 BST), took nearly three hours.

{"year":"2025","month":"03","event_desc":"17 March  French national Olivier Grondeau, who had been imprisoned in Iran since 2022 on espionage charges, is released and repatriated to France.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Iran frees Frenchman after nearly 900-day prison ordeal Paris (AFP) \u2013 French citizen Olivier Grondeau, detained by Iran since October 2022 on security charges but described by his family as an innocent tourist, has returned to France after being released, President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday. Issued on: 20\/03\/2025 - 07:35 Modified: 20\/03\/2025 - 14:31 3 min Grondeau was arrested in 2022 \u00a9 CDCS \/ MEAE \/ X account of France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot\/AFP Iranian authorities allowed another French national, who was under house arrest in Iran for several months and has requested anonymity, to also leave the country, sources familiar with the case told AFP on Thursday. Macron vowed to do everything to ensure the release of two other French citizens still held by Iran, while several other European nationals remain behind bars in the Islamic republic. The moves come ahead of an approaching critical juncture in the decades-long standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump writing the leadership a letter urging more talks on the issue. Western countries have for years accused Iran of detaining their nationals on trumped-up charges in a policy of state hostage-taking to use them as bargaining chips to extract concessions. He added that \"our mobilisation will not weaken\" to ensure the release of Cecile Kohler, a teacher, and her partner, Jacques Paris, who were detained in May 2022. They are accused of seeking to stir up labour protests, accusations their families have denied. Grondeau arrived in France on Monday evening, the Elysee Palace and a diplomatic source told AFP. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X he had been \"held hostage in Iran for 887 days\". 'Pressure on Iran' No further details on the circumstances of Grondeau's release were made available. There were also no further details in the case of the second national who had been held under house arrest. Exiled Iranian opposition group the People's Mujahedin (MEK), which is outlawed by Tehran, meanwhile alleged that Grondeau's release has been linked to an article that appeared this week in French media accusing its leader Maryam Rajavi of lavish spending at a spa resort. The piece in satirical weekly Canard Enchaine was \"demonisation and character assassination\", Shahin Ghobadi, spokesman of the MEK's political wing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), told AFP. \"There is clearly a quid-pro-quo and this is what Tehran gets in return,\" he said. Jean-Noel Barrot denied any deal with Tehran \u00a9 Thibaud MORITZ \/ AFP Speaking to TF1 television, Barrot denied France had given anything in return for the release of Grondeau which he said was the result of \"continued pressure\" on Iran. Grondeau, who is from Montpellier in the south of France, remains in hospital undergoing a battery of tests, having been severely weakened in recent months, particularly psychologically, a government source told AFP, asking not to be named. \"It is a great joy to have Olivier back, since he is innocent of all charges and has always belonged among us,\" his French lawyer, Chirinne Ardakani, told AFP. Grondeau, who turns 35 next week, was arrested in Shiraz, southern Iran, in October 2022 and sentenced to five years in prison for \"conspiracy against the Islamic republic\" including espionage. His family rejected the charges, describing Grondeau as a passionate fan of Persian poetry who went to Iran on a tourist visa as part of a world tour. 'Dying slow death' Until earlier this year, Grondeau had been identified only by his first name but his full identity was revealed by his family in January. In an audio message aired by French media at the time, Grondeau said he and the other two French detainees in Iran were \"exhausted\" and their strength was \"running out\". There has been growing concern over the health of the two other French citizens held by Iran, with Kohler's family warning that they risked dying if they were not freed. \"Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris must be freed from Iranian prisons,\" Macron said in his message. Ardakani, who also represents Kohler, said she was kept in a windowless cell of just eight square metres (86 square feet) \"under continuous video surveillance\" and had to sleep on the floor. Several other Europeans remain held by Tehran \u00a9 S\u00e9bastien DUPUY \/ AFP They are \"dying a slow death,\" Cecile's sister Noemie Kohler said in early March. Over half a dozen European nationals still known to be held include Iranian-Swedish academic Ahmadreza Djalali, who was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and sentenced to death in 2017 on charges of spying. Around 20 Westerners are held in Iran, a French diplomatic source, asking not to be named, told AFP on Thursday. \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

{"year":"2025","month":"04","event_desc":"15 April  Unknown individuals launch overnight attacks on prisons in Toulon, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille, Valence, N\u00eemes, Villepinte and Nanterre.","text":"French prison attacks are 'terrorism' says justice minister 15 April 2025 Share Save Ian Aikman & Jessica Rawnsley BBC News Share Save Getty Images French officials suggested the attacks were linked to the government's crackdown on drug crime France's Justice Minister said the government would not give in to \"acts of intimidation\" after a wave of attacks targeting prisons across the country. On Monday night, vehicles were set alight outside several French prisons and one jail was hit by gunfire, in what G\u00e9rald Darmanin described as \"terrorist attacks\". Seven prisons have been targeted, in Toulon, Aix-En-Provence, Marseille, Valence and N\u00eemes in southern France, and in Villepinte and Nanterre, near Paris. Darmanin suggested the attacks which began on Sunday were a response to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking. France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has launched an investigation. On Tuesday, Darmanin visited Toulon's La Farlede prison where gunmen opened fired on the prison gate with a Kalashnikov. \"I am delighted that the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has taken action because this is extremely serious,\" he told reporters. \"These are terrorist attacks.\" He added that \"significant means\" were being employed to find the perpetrators and they would be given \"extremely severe sentences\". Darmanin indicated that the \"acts of intimidation against prison workers\" were related to government efforts to tackle drug crime. \"It might also be because we hit them where it hurts,\" he said, \"and for the first time in decades, France is taking extremely serious measures against drug trafficking.\" Earlier on Tuesday, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the government's response must be \"relentless\". \"Those who attack prisons and officers deserve to be locked up in those prisons and monitored by those officers,\" he posted on X. He added that he had instructed police to immediately strengthen security at prison facilities. The prison guard union, FO Justice, expressed its \"deepest concern and anger\" following the \"extremely serious\" attacks overnight. The union posted updates from the aftermath of several attacks on X, including images of burnt-out vehicles in prison car parks and bullet holes in the Toulon prison entrance gate. It called for urgent government action to protect prison staff. Another union, Ufap-Unsa Justice, said there were not enough officers to secure prison perimeters \"24\/7\". Ufap said that staff vehicles were among those set on fire outside the jails in Villepinte, Aix-Luynes, Nanterre and Valence. The union condemned the \"cowardly and heinous attacks [that] aim to terrorise those who embody the authority of the state\". In Nancy, a prison officer was reportedly threatened at their home, while in Marseille, an attempted arson attack targeted prison officers' accommodation. Monday night's attacks come after seven vehicles were set on fire in a similar attack on France's national school of prison administration on Sunday, according to FO Justice. \"It is worrying to note that some people no longer hesitate to directly attack the prison's property, a symbol of state authority,\" it said in a statement. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Parisien reports that the letters DDPF - meaning \"French prisoners' rights\" - were found inscribed on damaged vehicles. The AFP news agency says anarchist slogans were found at some sites. AFP quotes a source close to the case as saying the attacks appeared to be coordinated and \"clearly linked\" to the government's strategy against drug trafficking. Darmanin and Retailleau have vowed to tackle the scourge of drug trafficking and drug-related violence in France amid a rise in gang-related crime. In February, the interior ministry announced a record number of cocaine seizures in the first 11 months of 2024 - 53.5 tonnes, a rise of 130% on the 23.2 tonnes seized in 2023. Retailleau said France had been hit by a \"white tsunami\". Darmanin has proposed a number of measures to tighten prison security, including establishing dedicated high-security prisons to isolate the drug lords who run their empires from behind bars. A law is passing through the French parliament which creates a special prosecutor's office to deal with drugs crime, with new powers for investigators.

Sign in Edition Global WEC Le Mans 24 Hours to clash with F1 Canadian GP in 2025 as WEC calendar announced The 2025 Le Mans 24 Hours will clash with Formula 1's Canadian Grand Prix and Imola has maintained its place on an unchanged World Endurance Championship calendar for next year. Gary Watkins Jun 14, 2024, 9:51\u202fAM Upd: Jun 14, 2024, 1:47\u202fPM Copy link Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on Pinterest Share on Viber Start action Photo by: Emanuele Clivati | AG Photo The Le Mans 24 Hours is scheduled for 14-15 June, with the pre-event Test Day on the preceding Sunday. It means the race will clash with the F1 Canadian GP and IndyCar's St Louis round at Gateway. It is the first time F1 and Le Mans have clashed since 2016. Meanwhile, Imola has renewed what was originally a one-year deal covering 2024 to retain the Italian round of the series for a further four years, with a public signing of the contract at Friday's Le Mans 24 Hours. The WEC switched from Monza to Imola this year because the home of the Italian Grand Prix was undergoing major paddock works. The limited number of garages, one less than the 37 cars on this year\u2019s entry, had been seen as an obstacle to Imola\u2019s continuation as part of the series. The WEC has stressed the importance of the support of the local municipality in making the new deal happen. Mayor Marco Panieri described the agreement between the WEC and the circuit \u201cas a fantastic opportunity for the city of Imola\u201d. \u201cThanks to this event we will be able to improve infrastructure like [pit] boxes and the fan zone, making visitors and staff experience more enjoyable,\u201d he said. Fans at Imola Photo by: JEP \/ Motorsport Images The 2025 WEC incorporates the same eight events in the same order as this year. The Le Mans 24 Hours is scheduled for 14-15 June, with the pre-event Test Day on the preceding Sunday. It means the race will clash with the F1 Canadian GP and IndyCar's St Louis round at Gateway. Pierre Fillon president of WEC co-organiser the Automobile Club de l\u2019Ouest told Motorsport.com last month that there were no plans to expand to nine races for \u201cbecause of costs\u201d. Richard Mille, president of the FIA Endurance Commission, said that the WEC was adopting an \u201cif it ain't broke, don't fix it\u201d mentality. \u201cThe eight rounds that we know from this year offer a great mixture of well-established circuits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey give the series presence in both Americas, Asia, Europe and in the Middle East, providing the perfect stage for the events of the golden era of endurance racing to unfold.\u201d The WEC\u2019s return to Austin for the first time since 2017 in September of this year will be extended into a second season at least. That always seemed likely once Roger Penske ruled out the series visiting his Indianapolis venue in \u201925 as a result of scheduling reasons, a statement he made in March. He has aspirations to bring the WEC to a facility he took over in 2020, a desire he first revealed back in 2022. The 2025 WEC will kick off in Qatar with a late February date, rather than in early March this year, because Ramadan falls earlier in 2025. The race will again be a 1812km event, a nod to Qatar\u2019s national day on 18 December, with a maximum duration of eight hours. The pre-season Prologue test will take place one week in advance of the race at Qatar\u2019s Losail International Circuit. The Le Mans 24 Hours is scheduled for 14\/15 June, with the pre-event Test Day on the preceding Sunday. After the three rounds in Europe concluded by the Le Mans 24 Hours in mid-June, Interlagos in Sao Paolo, Austin, Fuji and Bahrain again make up the post-Le Mans swing of the championship.

In retaliation, France expels 12 Algerian diplomats the next day.","text":"Algeria to expel 12 French embassy officials 14 April 2025 Share Save Jessica Rawnsley, Natasha Booty & Ahmed Rouaba BBC News Share Save AFP The latest rift comes days after tentative steps had been made to mend relations Algeria has asked 12 French embassy staff to leave the country within 48 hours, France's foreign minister has said. Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot added that it was linked to the indictment of three Algerians in France on Friday, one of whom is a consular official. They are accused of involvement in the abduction last year of Amir Boukhors, 41, an outspoken critic of Algeria's government with an audience of more than one million people online. He had reportedly been granted asylum in France in 2023. Barrot urged Algeria to \"abandon\" the expulsions and said France was ready to \"respond immediately\" if they went ahead. Never before have French authorities arrested an employee from the Algerian consulate, and the fallout has set back recent attempts to improve relations between the two countries. It also points to a power struggle in French politics, with some right-wing politicians accusing the presidency of pandering to Algeria, and the Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently threatening to quit unless President Emmanuel Macron backs a more hard-line approach. Boukhors, also known as Amir DZ, has lived in France since 2016. He was abducted in April 2024 in the southern suburbs of Paris and released the following day, according to his lawyer Eric Plouvier. Plouvier told the AFP news agency that Boukhors had been \"the subject of two serious attacks, one in 2022 and another on the evening of April 29 2024\". French media reported that he was forced into a car with a flashing light by \"fake police officers\", then released the next day in woodland without explanation. Algerian authorities accuse the influencer of being \"a saboteur linked to terrorist groups\". The North African nation has issued nine international arrest warrants against him, accusing him of fraud and associations with terrorist organisations. He denies the allegations. In 2022, the French courts refused attempts to extradite him to Algeria. The case is the latest in a growing number of incidents to have exacerbated a rift between France and Algeria. They include the arrest and imprisonment in Algeria of French-Algerian author Boualem Sansal , who was accused of undermining Algeria's territorial integrity. Algeria recalled its ambassador from Paris last year after France backed Morocco's claim to the disputed territory of Western Sahara. The 12 French officials asked to leave on Monday include some members of the French interior ministry, a diplomatic source told AFP. On Monday, Barrot said: \"I am asking Algerian authorities to abandon these expulsion measures... if the decision to send back our officials is maintained, we will have no other choice but to respond immediately.\" Barrot claimed that the expulsions were a response to the indictment of three Algerian nationals on Friday in Paris - including the consular official - on charges including abduction, arbitrary detention and illegal confinement and participating in a terrorist organisation. Algeria's foreign ministry said it had summoned French ambassador St\u00e9phane Romatet in response to \"express its strong protest\" and called for the official's immediate release, according to the official Algerian news agency. It added that the individual \"was arrested in public and then taken into custody without notification through the diplomatic channels\". The ministry claimed the move was \"not a coincidence as it happens in a very specific context with the aim of stymying the process of relaunching bilateral relations\". Tentative steps have been made to repair relations between the two nations with a phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune taking place in March. \"The two presidents had a long, frank and friendly exchange on the state of bilateral relations and the tensions that have built up in recent months,\" a joint statement read. Following an official visit to Algeria on 6 April where he met with Tebboune, Barrot said he hoped for a \"new phase\" in relations.

Edouard Philippe, 46\u00a0ans, maire (Les R\u00e9publicains, LR) du\u00a0Havre, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9, lundi 15\u00a0mai, \u00e0 Matignon par Emmanuel Macron (En marche !). Invit\u00e9 le soir m\u00eame au journal t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 de TF1, le nouveau premier ministre a justifi\u00e9 sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 Matignon. \u00ab\u00a0On se sent parfois de gauche, parfois de droite. La valeur cardinale de la vie en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 c\u2019est la libert\u00e9 pas seulement \u00e9conomique, mais de pens\u00e9e, la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression.\u00a0\u00bb M. Philippe a expliqu\u00e9 \u00eatre \u00ab\u00a0en train de constituer un gouvernement, un gouvernement rassembleur de comp\u00e9tences\u00a0\u00bb , qu\u2019il proposera \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron. Le nouveau pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique a compris \u00ab\u00a0tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t (...) qu\u2019il fallait qu\u2019il poursuive le mouvement audacieux et qu\u2019il fallait qu\u2019il s\u2019inscrive non pas dans une logique d\u2019ouverture mais dans une logique de recomposition de la vie politique\u00a0\u00bb , a-t-il avanc\u00e9. Evasif quant \u00e0 la composition de ce gouvernement, dont l\u2019annonce est pr\u00e9vue demain, il ajoute : \u00ab\u00a0La premi\u00e8re question qu\u2019on se pose : est-ce qu\u2019on va \u00eatre capable de donner \u00e0 la France une majorit\u00e9 de progr\u00e8s ?\u00a0\u00bb Le premier ministre Edouard Philippe sur le plateau de TF1 \u00a0quelques heures apr\u00e8s sa nomination, \u00e0 Boulogne le 15 mai. JEAN CLAUDE COUTAUSSE \/ FRENCH-POLITICS POUR LE MONDE \u00ab Honor\u00e9 de cette propositon\u00a0\u00bb Interrog\u00e9 sur une \u00e9ventuelle h\u00e9sitation avant d\u2019accepter le poste, Edouard Philippe a r\u00e9pondu : \u00ab\u00a0Je ne sais pas si c\u2019est un enfer mais je veux bien croire que la t\u00e2che est consid\u00e9rable. On est \u00e0 la fois honor\u00e9 de cette proposition et on y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit bien\u00a0\u00bb. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9fendu le projet de r\u00e9former le code du travail d\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 par ordonnance, comme l\u2019a propos\u00e9 Emmanuel Macron lors de la campagne pr\u00e9sidentielle : Nous avons un droit du travail tr\u00e8s lourd en France, il ne prot\u00e8ge pas beaucoup les salari\u00e9s. Il y a un grand nombre de ch\u00f4meurs, il faut donc faire quelque chose, on ne peut pas ne rien faire. Ce petit-fils de docker, dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 de Sciences Po et \u00e9narque (promotion Marc-Bloch), a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 militer au Parti socialiste (PS), tendance Rocard, durant ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes avant de se rapprocher de la droite. Il y a d\u2019ailleurs c\u00f4toy\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, dans les rangs des jeunes rocardiens, un certain Alexis Kohler, aujourd\u2019hui secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Elys\u00e9e. Le premier ministre Edouard Philippe \u00e0 Boulogne le 15 mai. JEAN CLAUDE COUTAUSSE \/ FRENCH-POLITICS POUR LE MONDE En\u00a02001, il rejoint l\u2019\u00e9quipe municipale du maire du\u00a0Havre, Antoine Rufenacht, qui lui passera le t\u00e9moin en\u00a02010. Mais c\u2019est dans l\u2019ombre d\u2019Alain Jupp\u00e9, qui l\u2019a fait venir comme directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral lorsqu\u2019il prend la pr\u00e9sidence de l\u2019UMP \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ation, en\u00a02002, qu\u2019il va prosp\u00e9rer.

Volont\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9largissement et de r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage La nomination d\u2019Edouard Philippe au poste de premier ministre prolonge l\u2019op\u00e9ration de renouvellement voulue et incarn\u00e9e par Emmanuel Macron. Peu connu du grand public, il appara\u00eet comme un visage nouveau. Surtout, elle s\u2019inscrit dans une strat\u00e9gie qui vise \u00e0 faire exploser la droite. Depuis son \u00e9lection, M.\u00a0Macron n\u2019a cess\u00e9 d\u2019adresser des messages et de nouer directement le dialogue avec une partie de la droite, avec un traitement particulier pour les jupp\u00e9istes. Dans le sillage du nouveau premier ministre, le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique esp\u00e8re attirer des responsables LR de premier plan, dont certains pourraient int\u00e9grer le gouvernement. Dans la foul\u00e9e, ce mouvement d\u2019une partie de la droite pourrait s\u2019\u00e9largir aux investitures pour les \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives, volontairement laiss\u00e9es ouvertes apr\u00e8s une premi\u00e8re liste de 428\u00a0candidats, qui devrait \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9e mercredi, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des candidatures \u00e9tant clos vendredi \u00e0 18\u00a0heures. Le choix d\u2019Edouard Philippe marque la volont\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9largissement et de r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage de la majorit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sidentielle. C\u2019est aux \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives des 11 et 18\u00a0juin que l\u2019on pourra mesurer les premiers effets de cette op\u00e9ration, alors que les dirigeants de LR, pour leur part, s\u2019accrochent toujours \u00e0 l\u2019espoir d\u2019une revanche dans les urnes pour imposer \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron une cohabitation.

Aucun des deux grands partis Ce sc\u00e9nario Macron-Le Pen rebat les cartes de la politique fran\u00e7aise\u00a0: c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois sous la Ve R\u00e9publique que la droite est absente du second tour, et la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019aucun des deux grands partis qui ont domin\u00e9 la vie \u00e9lectorale depuis pr\u00e8s d\u2019un demi-si\u00e8cle , Les R\u00e9publicains (LR) et le Parti socialiste, n\u2019y est pr\u00e9sent. Jamais \u00e9lu, Emmanuel Macron est d\u00e9sormais en bonne position pour emporter le scrutin supr\u00eame le 7 mai et devenir, \u00e0 39 ans, le plus jeune pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique de l\u2019Histoire, devant Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte. Face \u00e0 lui se dresse la candidate du Front national, qui r\u00e9\u00e9dite la performance de son p\u00e8re en 2002 en acc\u00e9dant au second tour, sans toutefois arriver en t\u00eate comme elle l\u2019a longtemps esp\u00e9r\u00e9.\u00a0Mais il ne s\u2019agit cette fois pas d\u2019une surprise\u00a0: sa qualification au second tour \u00e9tait pr\u00e9dite par tous les sondage s sans exception depuis 2013. Estimations incertaines Quand les sondeurs anticipaient une abstention record, le scrutin a mobilis\u00e9\u00a0: le taux de participation, en baisse d\u2019un point seulement \u00e0 17 heures, devrait avoisiner 78 \u00e0 81%, selon les estimations des instituts (79,5% en 2012). Les estimations de r\u00e9sultats des instituts sont toutefois moins certaines que lors des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents scrutins, car le temps imparti pour les r\u00e9aliser a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit avec la fermeture des premiers bureaux de vote \u00e0 19 heures, au lieu de 18 heures. Vainqueur triomphal de la primaire de droite, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon a \u00e9t\u00e9 grandement fragilis\u00e9 par les affaires judiciaires, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation fin janvier par Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 fictif de son \u00e9pouse comme collaboratrice parlementaire, pour lequel la justice l\u2019a mis en examen. Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, grand vainqueur de la primaire de la droite, est \u00e9limin\u00e9 d\u00e8s le premier tour.

Son adversaire, Gilles Le Gendre, s'est dit de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"navr\u00e9 d'apprendre l'altercation et le malaise\" dont la candidate a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. \"Je lui souhaite de se r\u00e9tablir tr\u00e8s vite\", a-t-il indiqu\u00e9.

Apr\u00e8s cette altercation, l'homme est parti en courant vers la bouche de m\u00e9tro la plus proche. \"C'est votre faute si on a Hidalgo aujourd'hui comme maire\" \u00e0 Paris, lui avait-il dit, lan\u00e7ant \u00e9galement: \"Retournez dans l'Essonne!\", dont elle est d\u00e9put\u00e9e actuellement.

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau [1\/2] French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe (R) and Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud attend a news conference to unveil the government's labour reforms, in Paris, France, June 6, 2017.  REUTERS\/Charles Platiau Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's government showed its resolve to reform France's labor laws before the end of summer on Tuesday, warning unions that it intended to act swiftly. Macron said during the presidential campaign that he planned to fast-track the pro-business legislation through use of executive decrees in a country where the high cost of hiring and firing is seen as a deterrent to investors, and where unemployment is near double-digits. Unions had urged the government to take more time to discuss reforms they fear would reduce cherished employment rights and make France more like Anglo-American style labor markets where workers enjoy less protection. But speaking after meeting unions, Macron's prime minister stuck to a plan to pass the reforms during the summer holiday lull, a period in which unions could struggle to mobilize protesters, and said he would not seek to please unions on all of their demands. \"We won't agree on everything, but we must move forward,\" Edouard Philippe, a former conservative mayor told a news conference. \"It's both indispensable and urgent.\" Macron's La Republique En Marche (LREM) party is on course to win a landslide majority in this month's legislative elections, opinion polls show. That should help the 39-year old president sweep aside resistance from left-wing lawmakers and could also limit public support for any trade union strike action aimed at derailing the measures. Strikes and a rebellion in parliament were two factors that hamstrung the previous government's attempts to introduce similar reforms. Macron was a minister in that government between 2014 and 2016 before he quit to launch his presidential bid. His progress reforming France's regulation-laden economy this time around will be closely watched by Germany, which wants its European Union partners to boost growth and jobs by implementing measures like the ones it introduced more than a decade ago. In a document released on Tuesday, the government broadly stuck to measures contained in Macron's campaign manifesto including the capping of compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases. [L8N1J339K] Two of the biggest unions appeared willing to engage in talks with the governments. \"I don't think the unions will want to make a snap judgment since we only just got this letter from the government,\" Laurent Berger of the moderate CFDT union said on French TV. Although the more militant CGT union unsurprisingly said it disagreed with the reforms and called on workers to protest over the coming days and weeks, the smaller FO union said the reform plan contained both positive and negative points. \"It could be that unions will let past some major parts of the labor code reform, which would be good initially,\" Agnes Verdier-Molinie of the IFRAP free-market think-tank said. \"But they may be going for a deal on the pension reform, which the government could easily backtrack on because nobody understands what was in this reform,\" she said on Boursorama TV. Macron plans to tackle pension reform next year and has said he wanted to merge all 37 pension systems into one, including the generous ones enjoyed by workers at the state-owned EDF utility or SNCF railway company.

By David Wharton Staff Writer Follow July 31, 2017 9:41 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print After weeks of negotiations with the International Olympic Committee, Los Angeles officials have reached a deal to host the 2028 Summer Games under terms they hope will generate hundreds of millions in savings and additional revenues. The agreement will bring the Olympics back to Southern California for a third time, after Los Angeles hosted in 1984 and 1932. It also opens the door for the 2024 Games to be held in Paris. \u201cIt has been certainly a roller coaster,\u201d L.A. bid chairman Casey Wasserman told The Times, adding that IOC officials \u201cshowed a real willingness to be thoughtful and creative.\u201d Advertisement Initial reactions to the revised contract between the city and the IOC were mixed. Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College in Massachusetts, believes that L.A. officials \u201cplayed their cards right.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten a bunch of concessions that are significant,\u201d said Zimbalist, who has been a critic of the Olympic movement in the past. Others questioned whether local bid officials could have bargained for even more, and whether the public should have been given a voice in the recent negotiations. Advertisement \u201cI wonder if this was a missed opportunity for more input,\u201d said Jules Boykoff, who teaches political science at Pacific University in Oregon and has studied previous Games. \u201cWhat did people want them to ask for?\u201d Monday\u2019s announcement ended a tumultuous summer for the rival bid cities and Olympic leaders. 1 \/ 13 Scene at the Coliseum in Los Angeles during the opening ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.

(Los Angeles Times \/ Los Angeles Times) Advertisement The competition between L.A. and Paris, which began as a simple race for 2024, grew more complex when the IOC \u2014 with two eager candidates in hand \u2014 decided to name two winners. L.A. was expected to go second if only because it was willing to consider the option. It knew that the race with Paris would be close and that the U.S. had fallen short in several recent attempts to win the Summer Games. Paris, by contrast, had pushed back against waiting another four years. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who spearheaded the city\u2019s campaign, said the terms of Monday\u2019s agreement should outweigh any increased uncertainty that comes with committing to a major event more than a decade in advance. L.A.\u2019s bid committee has estimated it would cost $5.3 billion to stage the Games and has predicted it can cover all expenses through revenues such as sponsorships and ticket sales. \u201cI can look people in the eye and say this is a much stronger deal financially,\u201d Garcetti said. The agreement, which was scheduled to become public at midday Monday, centers on several major issues. Advertisement The IOC has predicted it will contribute $1.7 billion of its broadcast and sponsorship revenues to Paris in 2024. Its contribution could jump to at least $2 billion by 2028 because of adjustments to the amount of sponsorship money L.A. would receive. The city will also have increased flexibility in the selling domestic sponsorships in any categories that remain unclaimed by the IOC\u2019s international corporate partners. Olympic officials also waived various payments that could ultimately save L.A. organizers tens of millions. Under normal circumstances, cities that are awarded the Games must begin preparations immediately but do not receive the majority of their IOC contributions until a couple of years before the opening ceremony. For 2028, the IOC has agreed to advance L.A. a $180-million advance immediately. That is expected to cover the organizing\u2019s committee\u2019s costs for operating an extra four years and pump as much as $160 million into youth sports throughout the city. Advertisement In Olympic circles, such public benefits are referred to as \u201clegacy\u201d and usually occur only after the Games have finished and left town. Garcetti, who has spoken often in recent weeks about his desire for a more timely impact, predicted that youth programs could see increased funding within 12 months. \u201cI want something for the people of L.A. now,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cI want the excitement to build.\u201d But bid leaders seemed most enthusiastic about an element of the agreement that would have to wait until after the closing ceremony. Their bid estimate includes a $487.6 million contingency \u2014 money that would be set aside to pay for the sort of cost overruns that have plagued recent Games, leaving hosts with substantial deficits. Olympic experts have said that L.A. could be different because its plan relies on existing venues such as Staples Center, Pauley Pavilion and the Coliseum. It avoids spending billions to construct new stadiums and arenas. Advertisement Further savings would arise from housing athletes and the media at UCLA and USC rather than building expensive villages. If the Games finish at or under budget, the $487-million contingency would convert to a surplus \u2014 similar to the one left by the 1984 Los Angeles Games \u2014 and L.A. officials have struck a deal to keep most of that money. With the IOC waiving its customary right to 20% of any surplus, the resulting amount could total $100 million or more. Still, accepting the 2028 Summer Games comes with considerable risk. Politics and economies can make huge shifts over a decade. The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games offered a recent example \u2014 the Brazilian economy, which was booming a few years earlier, suffered a slump that left organizers making last-minute cutbacks and scrambling to pay their bills. L.A. organizers will also have to renegotiate contracts with all the venues, shifting to a new date. Wasserman said talks are already underway. Finally, the City Council will have to dive back into the issue after offering its support for 2024 earlier this year. An ad hoc committee is scheduled to reconvene later this week. Advertisement Garcetti and Wasserman said they are confident that they can reach an accord with all parties \u2014 which include state and federal officials \u2014 before the IOC meets in mid-September. At that point, IOC members will be asked to vote their approval and L.A. must sign the revised host city contract, making the deal official. david.wharton@latimes.com Follow @LAtimesWharton on Twitter ALSO American Caeleb Dressel ties Michael Phelps\u2019 world championship record with seven gold medals Advertisement Would an 11-year wait for the Olympics lead to greater risks for L.A.?

The mountains classification has also been tweaked, with extra points awarded on the Hors Category climbs.\u00a0\nRace director Christian Prudhomme seems to have taken inspiration from the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana by searching out steeper, little-known climbs and reducing stage distances. He also called on the UCI to allow him to reduced team sizes to end what he called a 'catenaccio' racing style.\n\"Certainly, from my first reaction there were quite a few stages going up over 2,000 metres. The Izoard goes up to 2,300 metres; that's going to be an absolute beast of a stage. Initial feelings are that it's going to be a race that is won or lost in the mountains. Of course, it's the Tour and anything can happen so we have to be ready for all eventualities.\"\nRichie Porte said: \"It's quite a balanced course. There's not a lot of time trialling but there is quite a bit of climbing but descending to the finish as well. There's quite a spread between the Planche des Belles Filles on the fifth stage and then the Col d'Izoard on the 18th. There's a lot of stages in between there with cross winds. I think it's typical to stand here now and saw that it's not a climber's Tour but the road will always decide that.\"\u00a0\nDetailed reconnaissance of the new steep climbs will be vital for every Tour de France contender. \nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\nTour de France 2017 route\nStage 1, Saturday, July 1: Dusseldorf - Dusseldorf (ITT), 13kmStage 2, Sunday, July 2: Dusseldorf \u2013 Liege, 202kmStage 3, Monday, July 3: Verviers \u2013 Longwy, 202kmStage 4, Tuesday, July 4: Mondorf-Les-Bains \u2013 Vittel, 203kmStage 5, Wednesday, July 5: Vittel \u2013 Planche des Belles Filles, 160kmStage 6, Thursday, July 6: Vesoul \u2013 Troyes, 216kmStage 7, Friday, July 7:Troyes \u2013 Nuit-Saint-Georges, 214kmStage 8.
