It will re-brand itself as Ethiopian Prosperity Party(EPP).TPLF voted against it which means that it will not be part of it. Picture from the ruling coalition\u2019s executive committee meeting on Saturday November 15,2019. borkena November 16, 2019 Ethiopia\u2019s ruling coalition, Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front ( EPRDF ), has made a landmark decision on Saturday closing one long chapter in the history of the organization and opening a new one. The coalition was formed sometime in 1988 as a leftist organization based on \u201crevolutionary democracy\u201d under the leadership of Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) towards the end of decades-old armed struggle against colonel Mengistu Hailemariam\u2019s administration. Until April 2018, that is the time when Abiy Ahmed from what was then called Oromo People\u2019s Democratic Organization (OPDO) became prime minister, TPLF dominated Federal government meddled with the affairs of other regional states organized on the basis of ethnicity. It was soon after Abiy Ahmed became prime minister that the ruling coalition, which constitute four ethic parties, began to discuss transforming the coalition into a single united party \u2013 an idea that was raised during the organizational conferences and shelved indefinitely. Today, the coalition has made the final decision and it will no longer be a coalition party but a united single party. It was the executive committee of the coalition that passed the decision. According to a report by state affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporation (FBC), majority of the executive members voted in favour of ending coalition era which was marked by deepening\u00a0 division among Ethiopians along ethnic lines. Especially in the past three years, ethnic based violence became prevalent to a point where citizen\u2019s right to work and live in different parts of the country became risky. Thousands were killed and millions of people were internally displaced. Fekadu Tesema, a member of the executive committee member, told state media Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation that the executive committee meeting discussed issues that need attention under the new arrangement. Strengthening the federal system and developing administrative system while maintaining language diversity, ethnic identity and national identity were among the top agenda in the executive committee meeting. The executive committee is expected to discuss draft party program starting tomorrow, according to a report by Fana Broadcasting Corporation. Only six members of the executive committee members of the ruling coalition voted against the proposal to transform the\u00a0 organization\u2019s existence into a single united national party \u2013 which is poised to be named as, according to information from insiders, Ethiopian Prosperity Party (EPP). The six members executive committee who voted against the proposal are from TPLF . And it did not come as a surprise since TPLF has issued a statement sometime in October claiming that the decision to transform the coalition into a single party would trigger disintegration of the country. On the other hand, Four other parties that have been described as \u201cagar\u201d (sister parries) see the decision as a move in the right direction for the previous arrangement was discriminatory. Parties governing Afar region, Benishangul region, Gambella region and Somali region of Ethiopia were considered as part of the ruling coalition, EPRDF, but they did not have voting privileges and did not have membership in the executive committee and central committee which means that they was no possibly for leaders from these parties to hold the highest office in the country. \u00a0 But that ends with the end of the coalition. It is a new chapter for the ruling party , and perhaps to Ethiopia too. Join the conversation. Like borkena on Facebook and get Ethiopian News updates regularly .

Hopefully this will not be repeating the same mistake as the previous hopes, talks and promises that ended up in total despair in PM Abiy and EPRDF. We have to take this with reservation because Jawar is not charged with crime nor restrained yet from spreading his Salafism\/Al-habab Islamic hate speech against Christians and Ethiopians. He is already taking about Somalia ports being exploited for fishing by Vietnam if it is his business instead of addressing problems in Ethiopia!!! In his most recent exposed campaign speech his aim is to install Salafism\/ Al-shabab Islamic  type regime by working with Somalia government. His hidden agenda is to establish and separate Islam Oromo that will be part of Somalia and how to extort money from the faithful fasting Orthodox Christian by forcing them to buy fish that came through Somalia ports.

In fact what has changed really from TPLF? They are just maneuvering things! Either team Lemma is controlled or Aby is working hand in hand with Shabia\/jawar\/their masters. Jawar has dared to come to U.S and hold meetings with comfort. He doesn\u2019t seem to care one bit. Where is this arrogance coming from? He doesn\u2019t seem affected at all! He must know that Ethiopians are weak and will not do a damn thing either here in Daispora or in Ethiopia, that is why. The train has gone folks. There is a coordinated agenda to ethnic cleanse Ethiopians and form Horn of Africa Union and while Aby is making us snooz, Jawar is doing the work on the ground. Whether we like it or not, some Amara for survival reason are no longer talking about Ethiopiia. We are all responsible. So swallow your pride and accept the consequences. Her true children Ethiopians do not know what to do. The rug is being pulled from their feet even as we speak. Reply LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Comment: Please enter your comment!

The June 22 assassinations of several high-level government officials, which the government linked to an alleged coup attempt in the Amhara region\u2014as well as political unrest and communal violence in the capital, Addis Ababa, and Oromia following an incident with a popular Oromo activist and media owner, Jawar Mohammed\u2014highlighted increasing tensions ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s scheduled 2020 national elections. In June, the parliament voted to postpone an already overdue but highly contentious national census , despite the importance of the exercise ahead of the 2020 elections. Institutional reforms , notably around judicial independence and concrete measures to ensure truth, reconciliation, and accountability \u2014all of which are key to dealing with heightened political and ethnic tensions\u2014were limited. Freedom of Expression and Association The Sidama ethnic group submitted a request on July 18, 2018, to the federal government to hold a referendum to secede from the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples\u2019 Region (SNNPR). The Sidama are the largest and the first among a number of ethnic groups in SNNPR to make such a request. The federal government failed to organize a vote within the constitutionally stipulated one-year limit . Violence on July 18 in Awassa, capital of SNNPR, between protesters demanding a vote and security forces, followed by reported violence against non-Sidama residents of the region, resulted in the deaths of 53 people according to a zonal police official , the displacement of hundreds , and significant property damage. The SNNPR region was then placed under federal security control . In August, the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) said it would organize a referendum on November 13 , which was later delayed to November 20. Protests that broke out in Addis Ababa on October 23, following allegations by Jawar Mohammed that the government was removing his security detail, and then spread to many parts of the Oromia region, were met on occasion by excessive use of lethal force by the security forces, notably in Ambo town. The protests devolved rapidly into communal violence in several towns. The government said the unrest resulted in 86 deaths , 10 the result of \u201cconfrontations\u201d with security forces. In February , the government approved the Organization of Civil Societies Proclamation and repealed the notorious 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation, which had decimated independent human rights reporting. The new law lifts its predecessor\u2019s 10 percent foreign funding limit. Concerns with the law remain, including limitations on foreign lobbying. The government rewrote the country\u2019s restrictive 2009 Anti-Terrorism Proclamation (ATP); the new draft was under review in Parliament at time of writing. However, following the alleged coup plot in June, dozens of ethnic Amharas , including journalists , were held under the ATP\u2019s remand provisions . At time of writing, 13 detainees were still held on pre-charge detention, under an obscure procedure that allows for indefinite pre-charge detention after the four months allowed under the ATP had elapsed. Twelve are members of the political opposition, seven of whom are members of the National Movement of Amhara (NAMA), an ethno-nationalist opposition party, and five are members of an Amhara activist cultural movement. On February 23, 2019, Oromia regional police temporarily detained two journalists working for the private Mereja TV on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, while reporting on the government\u2019s demolition of homes and allegations of forced displacement. Upon release , they were attacked by a group of young men, and one was beaten with sticks in plain view of police. No one was arrested in relation to the assault. On July 18, security forces arrested employees and board members of the Sidama Media Network (SMN) and shut down the station in Awassa following protests over the government\u2019s failure to organize a referendum, according to media reports. Workers were allowed back into the office on July 23, but those arrested were detained for weeks without charge. The government responded to growing hate speech on social media, especially Facebook, by producing a hate speech bill in April. Shortly after the communal violence in late October, the Council of Ministers approved a draft.  Earlier drafts included vague definitions of hate speech, which, if not more narrowly defined to specifically address incitement to violence, discrimination, or illegality, may end up stifling legitimate expressions of dissent. The government continued the practice of shutting down the internet. Following the alleged June 22 coup attempt , the prime minister sought to justify a countrywide internet shutdown, which was only completely restored on July 2 , by telling media that the internet was \u201cneither air nor water.\u201d Earlier in June, the government shut down the internet for a week without explanation . Arbitrary Detention, Impunity for Past Abuses In September, Maekelawi, the police station in the heart of Addis Ababa that for years had been infamous for abuse and repression , was opened for the first time to the public after its closure last year . While there have been fewer reports of arbitrary arrests overall, there have been ongoing reports of abusive arrests of alleged Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) members and their alleged sympathizers in areas of Oromia where there has been fighting between suspected members of the previously banned OLF and the military. Beyond the arrests of some high-level officials in November 2018 , there has been little progress on accountability for past abuses. A national reconciliation commission was set up in December 2018 but it has an unclear mandate. In Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region , some of those who ran the region\u2019s notorious Jail Ogaden, where torture, rape and death were common , have been sentenced for abuses committed under their command; public information on these trials was lacking. Conflict-Related Internal Displacement Longstanding grievances over access to land and complex questions of identity and demarcation of internal borders on occasion led to abuses, including open conflict between ethnic groups , killings, and large-scale internal displacement. The number of people internally displaced by conflict remained high; according to the International Organization for Migration, 1.6 million people were internally displaced as of July, 66.4 percent due to conflict.  The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center reported that ethnic clashes in Oromia, Amhara, Somali, and SNNPR regions led to 522,000 new displacements in the first half of 2019 . Between March and May, the government returned approximately 1.5 million internally displaced people to their home areas, many still unsafe , including by restricting delivery of humanitarian assistance and demolishing camps in areas of displacement. Those that returned often faced secondary displacement due to ongoing insecurity and a lack of humanitarian assistance in areas of return. The International Committee of the Red Cross, invited back to the Somali region for the first time in 11 years, distributed emergency relief assistance in conjunction with the Ethiopian Red Cross to people affected by communal violence. Complex and politically charged issues surrounding the management of the ongoing expansion of Addis Ababa, and clarification of constitutional provisions around Oromia\u2019s \u201cspecial interest\u201d remain unanswered and a growing source of tension . These tensions increased in February when the Oromia regional government announced its plans to demolish 12,000 homes \u201cbuilt illegally\u201d on the outskirts of Addis. Key International Actors Ethiopia continued to enjoy strong support from foreign donors and most of its regional neighbors, due to its role as host of the African Union, its contributions to United Nations peacekeeping and regional negotiations, regional counterterrorism efforts, and migration partnerships with Western countries. In October, Prime Minister Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to achieve \u201cpeace and international cooperation,\u201d as a result of the peace agreement signed with Eritrea; yet many of the trickier issues around the agreement remain unsettled, including the border demarcation between the two countries. Following the ouster of Sudan\u2019s President Omar al-Bashir in April and a breakdown in talks between military and civilian parties, the p rime minister led efforts to mediate an agreement for a transitional government together with the African Union. However, tensions with Egypt over use of the Nile flared. In October 2019, the European Union dispersed \u20ac7 million (US$7.8 million) of a \u20ac10 million (US$10 million) electoral support package . At time of writing, no plans for international election monitoring were in place. In its 2019 Universal Periodic Review, Ethiopia committed to reviewing outstanding requests from special procedures on an individual basis and has since responded favorably to several, marking the first authorized visits of mandate holders since 2006. The UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression was due to visit Ethiopia in December. A request by the special rapporteur on torture was pending. Over 100,000 Ethiopians have been deported from Saudi Arabia, many with no belongings and no money for food, transportation, or shelter. Neither the government nor the international community have earmarked adequate assistance to provide deportees medical care to help them deal with injuries or psychological trauma resulting from abuses faced in Yemen and in Saudi Arabia, shelter them, or aid them to return and reintegrate in their home villages.

The airline said 149 passengers and eight crew members were on flight ET302 from the Ethiopian capital to Nairobi in Kenya. It said 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, eight Americans and seven British nationals were among the passengers. The crash happened at 08:44 local time, six minutes after the months-old Boeing 737 Max-8 took off. Live updates Air disasters timeline Do we know how it happened? The cause of the disaster is not yet clear. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. \"At this stage, we cannot rule out anything,\" Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told reporters at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. \"We cannot also attribute the cause to anything because we will have to comply with the international regulation to wait for the investigation.\" Image copyright Jonathan Druion Image caption The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 reported that the plane's \"vertical speed was unstable after take-off\" . An eyewitness at the scene told the BBC there was an intense fire as the aircraft hit the ground. \"The blast and the fire were so strong that we couldn't get near it,\" he said. \"Everything is burnt down.\" First word of the crash came when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed expressed his \"deepest condolences\" on Twitter. In an earlier statement, the airline said that search and rescue operations were under way near the crash site around the town of Bishoftu, which is 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital. Who are the victims? Mr Gebremariam told the news conference that passengers from more than 30 countries were on board the flight. He said they included 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven Britons, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Dutch citizens, four Indians and four people from Slovakia. Three Austrians, three Swedes, three Russians, two Moroccans, two Spaniards, two Poles and two Israelis were also on the flight. Image caption The crash site is around 60km (37 miles) south-east of the Ethiopian capital There was also one passenger each from Belgium, Indonesia, Somalia, Norway, Serbia, Togo, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda and Yemen. Four people held United Nations passports, the airline said, and it believed some passengers could have been heading to a session of the UN Environment Assembly which begins in Nairobi on Monday. What do we know about the plane? The 737 Max-8 aircraft is relatively new to the skies, having been launched in 2016. It was added to the Ethiopian Airlines fleet in July last year. Boeing said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and offered to send a team to provide technical assistance. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash five months ago, when a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesia with nearly 190 people on board. Investigators say the pilots of that aircraft had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature of the Boeing 737 Max. The anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, findings suggest. What October's Max-8 crash told us Lion Air: How could a brand new plane crash? There is no suggestion that the Ethiopian Airlines jet suffered similar issues on Sunday. What about the airline's safety record? Ethiopian Airlines flies to many destinations in Africa, making it a popular carrier in a continent where many airlines fly only from their home country to destinations outside Africa. It has a good reputation for safety, although in 2010 one of the company's aeroplanes crashed in the Mediterranean Sea shortly after leaving Beirut. The incident killed 90 people on board. Image copyright AFP Image caption People monitor the arrivals board at the airport in Nairobi on Sunday morning The airline's highest fatalities prior to this came in a November 1996 crash during a hijacking on a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. One of the plane's engines stopped when the fuel ran out and although pilots attempted an emergency water landing, they hit a coral reef in the Indian Ocean and 123 of the 175 people on board were killed.

{"year":"2019","month":"06","event_desc":"24 June  The Ethiopian state television announced that the Chief of the Amhara Region security Asaminew Tsige was shot to death after the government's accusation of plotting the 22 June Amhara Region coup.","text":"T he ruling Amhara Democratic Party and the newly established National Movement of Amhara have been working hard to get support from the Amharic-speaking Ethiopian population nationwide. Their key talking points include \u201crestoring\u201d Amhara identity in external territories and providing protection for Amhara living around the country, including by instituting Amhara zones to achieve self-administration. But a big question remains: what is the future of Amhara nationalism, and by extension ethnic federalism, if and when its proponents realize that they can\u2019t deliver on most of their promises to the people? In the past, Amhara nationalism failed, as scholars couldn\u2019t even agree on whether an Amhara ethnicity ever existed. During the 2005 polls, the only relatively free multiparty election in our history, the then-Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM, now ADP) was embarrassed, with nearly zero support in the cities and even suffering major electoral losses in Amhara state to the CUD opposition party, which is now represented by Ginbot 7. For years, the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi supported building up ANDM, because his ultimate success depended on native Amharic speakers buying into ethnic federalism. Yet, ANDM remained the laughing stock of the country for two decades, as it rigged \u2018elections\u2019 to stay in power and serve TPLF. And even when Amharic-speaking Ethiopians were repressed, ANDM did nothing. We\u2019re faced with a half-baked Amhara ethnic identity Even ideologically, the majority of Amharic speakers have been historically affiliated with Ethiopianism, instead of Amhara nationalism. So ethnic Amhara movements didn\u2019t receive grassroots support\u2014until now that is. After 27 years of normalizing ethnic differentiation in Ethiopian society, the resulting growth of identity-based youth movements and the weakening of TPLF have finally provided legitimacy to the ANDM, and thus a fertile ground for organizations like NaMA to promote Amhara nationalism. When it comes to Amhara ethnogenesis, some observers give credit to the forces of \u201cexternal ascription\u201d; claiming that the current Ethiopian young generation grew up only knowing and breathing tribalism, constantly being told \u201cyou are Amhara.\u201d While this is a major factor, Amhara identity also seems to have emerged out of what sociologists like Max Weber credit as victimhood or, both real and perceived, shared persecution. Thus, Amhara identity was born out of a sense of common adversity, despite the concept of an Amhara nation never existing before. Therefore, these social constructionist factors helped to cover up the reality that tens of millions of geographically dispersed Amharic speakers who might otherwise be eligible for \u201cAmhara membership\u201d actually do not have the common ancestry, the common custom, values, religion, appearance etc or even the common polity and sense of national identity that are all necessary ingredients to qualify as a real ethnic group.\u00a0 Their only commonality was facing hardship in the name of Amhara. Nonetheless, we are now faced with a half-baked Amhara ethnic identity, and both ANDM (ADP) and NaMA have become influential independent actors in Ethiopian politics. Can ethnonationalists attract Amharic speakers? Let\u2019s play the devil\u2019s advocate and take these Amhara nationalists at their own word. One of the prime reasons why ADP and NaMA have gained support is reportedly due to the persecution of Amharic speakers nationwide. So, ADP and NaMA claim that they can protect Amhara people from these problems. NaMA has even opened up new branches outside Amhara, in Addis Ababa and other cities, where Amharic speakers reside. Despite their critics blaming the rise in Amhara tribalism for causing more death and displacement to Amharic speakers living outside \u201cAmhara state,\u201d NaMA and ADP are still winning many hearts and minds. Amhara identity protests in Wolkait, Metekel and Raya are some examples of Amhara nationalists demanding their rights outside of Amhara. Accordingly, many Amhara nationalists have been applying a \u2018holier than thou\u2019 approach when it comes to the current Ethiopian constitution. They claim that Amhara state is the most democratic inside the ethnofederal system because minorities have self-administration. The biggest example to support this claim is the Oromia and Agew Awi zones inside Amhara. In the Oromo zone, Afaan-Oromo is the working language and Oromo politicians control local government. Many urban areas in Oromia are dominated by Amhara Thus, Amhara nationalists want reciprocal benefits for their people outside Amhara. The prime candidate where new Amhara zones would be established is in Oromia. Historically, just as Oromo speakers have migrated north, Amharic speakers migrated south, or simply intermarried. Therefore, today, many urban areas in Oromia are dominated by Amhara, especially Addis Ababa and Nazret (Adama). According to the 2007 census,\u00a0about 60 percent of residents in Adama Special Zone had Amharic as their mother tongue.\u00a0Therefore, in a country where language-based federalism is the law, Adama (Nazret) would constitutionally comprise one of the Amhara zones inside Oromia. This eventually might disqualify Adama from being the seat of Oromia parliament. Also in Bishoftu (Debre Zeit) City of Oromia, residents with Amharic mother-tongue makeup even higher proportions:\u00a0at 72 percent.\u00a0And in Jimma city in Oromia, out of 120,000 residents only about 48,000 were native Afaan Oromo speakers. Even in Mejenger Zone of Gambella, the majority by mother tongue is actually Amhara. There are more. Other candidates for Amhara zones include small parts of Hawassa, Assosa and Dire Dawa which contain about 100,000 Amhara residents each. If we include Welkait and other parts of Tigray where a large population of native Amharic speakers live, it is possible to have over a dozen major Amhara zones outside Amhara state. Will ADP and NaMA deliver Amhara zones? Or, as NaMA chairman Desalegn Chane recently said, can they actually restore the \u201cdignity and God given rights of Amhara people\u201d? Of course not. Particularly, Amharic speaking majorities living in urban Oromia and other states are abandoned by Amhara nationalists. Yet, even in rural Oromia districts like Dera Woreda, which is the northernmost district of North Shoa Zone, where Amhara makeup between 45 to 55 percent of the population, thousands of Amhara protested for self-rule last week; but both ADP and NaMA have so far done little to meet their demands. Establishing Amhara zones inside Oromia, Tigray and other regional states is a fantasy, for many reasons. After all, ethnic federalism is created at the expense of both Amhara and multiethnic cosmopolitans, who are either forced to pick a fraction of their ancestral identity during a census or become invisible. First of all, creating Amhara zones, just like Oromo zones, will lead to more ethnic conflict and territorial disputes. Secondly, it will lead to a more dangerous zero-sum game when it comes to ethnic politics, by weakening moderates and empowering extremists. And this threat of civil war is what keeps leaders like Abiy Ahmed up at night. That is why Oromo leaders like Lemma Megersa, and Abiy, preach unity and \u201cEthiopiawinet\u201d whenever they are in front of diverse audience. Abiy did tell the truth about our intertwined history For example, during his speech in Germany, Abiy was questioned about the fate of Amhara living outside Amhara, particularly in Tigray. His instinctive response was to discourage tribalism among Amhara activists. In his answer, Abiy cited historical accounts about Abyssinian kings who were dependent on thousands of Oromo soldiers who marched to Gondar. Abiy said the northern movement of Oromos has resulted in intermarriages and multiethnic mixture. Thus, Abiy concluded that there is no pure Amhara blood today because people were mixed for centuries. While Abiy did tell the truth about our intertwined history, one can only imagine the level of outrage if the roles were reversed, and if an Amhara leader said there is no pure Oromo because of post-conflict ethnic fusion. Such a person would have been crucified by Oromo elites and their social media cheerleaders. It seems like for Oromo nationalists, they embrace history only when it is convenient. Abiy\u2019s speech in Germany was not the first time he rebuked Amhara nationalism. When Abiy was asked about the Welkait-Tsegede issue earlier this year, he was quick to scold and discourage \u201cAmhara tribalism.\u201d Abiy is not alone, although others have different motives. Jawar Mohammed and like-minded influential ethnonationalists turn on and off the Welkait switch as a bargaining chip against TPLF. Otherwise, they prefer not to push Amhara nationalism too hard to the right. For these tribalists, Amhara nationalism is good only to justify the existence of some \u2018foreign\u2019 land where Amharic \u2018settlers\u2019 can go back to. Otherwise, it is something bad, something to be discouraged or shunned, because they know it can ultimately backfire on them. It appears that in the eyes of the Prime Minister, TPLF and most ethnonationalists, the Amhara question of Welkait, Raya and Metekel is dead on arrival. Amhara nationalism is toothless So, one must ask: if Amhara nationalists cannot even achieve their basic responsibility of restoring lands they claim to belong to Amhara, what is the purpose for their existence? If Amhara nationalists cannot establish Amhara zones outside Amhara, what is the point of embracing ethnic federalism? To be blunt, the harsh reality is, the ethnic \u201cScramble for Ethiopia\u201d was supervised by TPLF, OLF and other similarly minded organizations two decades ago to determine who gets which pieces of the pie. Let alone Ethiopian nationalists, even independent Amhara were not invited to that party. Unless Amhara nationalists redraw the maps and declare Addis Ababa, Wolkait, Adama and many areas in other states as Amhara zones, their nationalism is meaningless. It has no purpose. They exist only to facilitate the current ethnofederal system and to justify further persecution of Amharic speakers nationwide. The Amhara revanchists\u2019 rhetoric might appear like an existential threat to neighboring states. But, other than slogans and posters, Amhara nationalism is toothless. So far, Amhara tribalism is only serving its original purpose for its creators: to weaken Ethiopian nationalism. The Amhara protest in Dera Woreda in Oromia What is fascinating about Amhara tribalism is the potential for it to be a double-edged sword for its creators. Meles Zenawi passed away without seeing the fruits of his ethnic federalism vis-a-vis Amhara nationalism. Ironically, he would not have been that excited about the Wolkait rhetoric either. After all, he wanted an Amhara nationalism that he can control and exploit. He wanted Amhara ethnic awareness; not the empowering version, but a self-hating one. He wanted an Amhara population that is forever filled with a sense of imperial guilt. For him and for Oromo nationalists, all historical problems in Ethiopia are pinned on the Amhara. For that to happen, the Amharic speakers who used to only call themselves Gojjame, Wolloye, Shewan, etc must first embrace the Amhara label and then wear the guilty Amhara costume. Once Amhara nationalists digest the reality of their powerlessness and gradually realize that tribalism was never created for their benefit, the next natural step should be to consider the alternative: Ethiopian nationalism and individual rights. By all measures, Amhara nationalism is not the only nationalism that is failing today. Ethnic federalism is slowly unraveling and proving increasingly toxic. Even since Abiy arrived and preached tolerance, peace and democracy, hundreds of deaths and more than a million internal displacements have brought a sense of hopelessness. Hidden behind the media headlines of women appointments is the reality that Ethiopia is now ranked first in the world for the most internal displacement of its own people in the first-half of 2018. As\u00a0Berhanu Nega told Addis Standard recently, Ethiopian society is losing its \u201cmoral compass.\u201d The last seven months have proven that Oromo lives do not even matter to Oromo elites like Jawar who are ignoring the killing of Oromos in Somali region and Kamashi Zone of Benishangul-Gumuz. In the past, every single Oromo death triggered outrage on social media and it was weaponized for propaganda. But today, it seems some Oromo leaders care more about saving the face of the ethnic federalism system than they care about their own people. Behind the scenes, Oromo nationalists are doing the same thing the TPLF did to the Amhara over the last 27 years: shifting the demographics. Now that they have gained some power, Oromo elites don\u2019t even talk publicly about Finfinne anymore because they saw how Addis Ababa residents utterly rejected Oromo nationalism and OLF in September. Individual liberty will lift all boats Their new focus now is changing the demographics of urban Oromia. They are copying the TPLF blueprint of Tigrayan mass resettlement policy in Wolkait by pushing Oromos into urban and suburban areas in Oromia, where they are a minority. That is why we see so many more ethnic conflicts in Dire Dawa, Adama, Harar, etc. News of Qeerroo evicting urban neighborhoods and ethnic cleansing kebeles has become the new normal. Even in Bishoftu (DebreZeit), where virtually all residents are native Amharic speakers, Oromo youths are threatening and disenfranchising local citizens. Therefore, instead of enabling the ethnic-segregation laws of the country, it is now more important than ever that Amharic speakers reject Amhara nationalism, and instead advocate for citizenship-based democracy. Amharic speakers must thus choose the alternative: give more support to groups like Ginbot 7 who promote individual rights and civic nationalism, instead of wasting their capital on supporting Amhara nationalism. In the end, individual liberty will lift all boats, resulting in not only benefiting persecuted Amharic-speaking Ethiopians, but also benefiting all Ethiopians no matter their religion, clan, region or ethnicity. When that time comes when we respect the rights of every individual over the rights of an identity-based political group; we can then regain our moral compass and cherish every human life. For that to happen, let us dream of that future, when all Ethiopians have the right to live anywhere in Ethiopia, when no land has a tribal label on it, and when we all belong everywhere in Ethiopia. That is also when we can unleash our social and economic potential and guarantee our basic rights as human beings. And that will be a country we can be proud of, which we can all call our home.

{"year":"2019","month":"06","event_desc":"22 June  Factions of the Amhara Region's Peace and Security Bureau assassinated the Amhara Regional President Ambachew Mekonnen. An Amhara nationalist bodyguard also assassinated General Se'are Mekonnen, the Chief of General Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, as well as his aide Major General Gizae Aberra.","text":"T he ruling Amhara Democratic Party and the newly established National Movement of Amhara have been working hard to get support from the Amharic-speaking Ethiopian population nationwide. Their key talking points include \u201crestoring\u201d Amhara identity in external territories and providing protection for Amhara living around the country, including by instituting Amhara zones to achieve self-administration. But a big question remains: what is the future of Amhara nationalism, and by extension ethnic federalism, if and when its proponents realize that they can\u2019t deliver on most of their promises to the people? In the past, Amhara nationalism failed, as scholars couldn\u2019t even agree on whether an Amhara ethnicity ever existed. During the 2005 polls, the only relatively free multiparty election in our history, the then-Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM, now ADP) was embarrassed, with nearly zero support in the cities and even suffering major electoral losses in Amhara state to the CUD opposition party, which is now represented by Ginbot 7. For years, the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi supported building up ANDM, because his ultimate success depended on native Amharic speakers buying into ethnic federalism. Yet, ANDM remained the laughing stock of the country for two decades, as it rigged \u2018elections\u2019 to stay in power and serve TPLF. And even when Amharic-speaking Ethiopians were repressed, ANDM did nothing. We\u2019re faced with a half-baked Amhara ethnic identity Even ideologically, the majority of Amharic speakers have been historically affiliated with Ethiopianism, instead of Amhara nationalism. So ethnic Amhara movements didn\u2019t receive grassroots support\u2014until now that is. After 27 years of normalizing ethnic differentiation in Ethiopian society, the resulting growth of identity-based youth movements and the weakening of TPLF have finally provided legitimacy to the ANDM, and thus a fertile ground for organizations like NaMA to promote Amhara nationalism. When it comes to Amhara ethnogenesis, some observers give credit to the forces of \u201cexternal ascription\u201d; claiming that the current Ethiopian young generation grew up only knowing and breathing tribalism, constantly being told \u201cyou are Amhara.\u201d While this is a major factor, Amhara identity also seems to have emerged out of what sociologists like Max Weber credit as victimhood or, both real and perceived, shared persecution. Thus, Amhara identity was born out of a sense of common adversity, despite the concept of an Amhara nation never existing before. Therefore, these social constructionist factors helped to cover up the reality that tens of millions of geographically dispersed Amharic speakers who might otherwise be eligible for \u201cAmhara membership\u201d actually do not have the common ancestry, the common custom, values, religion, appearance etc or even the common polity and sense of national identity that are all necessary ingredients to qualify as a real ethnic group.\u00a0 Their only commonality was facing hardship in the name of Amhara. Nonetheless, we are now faced with a half-baked Amhara ethnic identity, and both ANDM (ADP) and NaMA have become influential independent actors in Ethiopian politics. Can ethnonationalists attract Amharic speakers? Let\u2019s play the devil\u2019s advocate and take these Amhara nationalists at their own word. One of the prime reasons why ADP and NaMA have gained support is reportedly due to the persecution of Amharic speakers nationwide. So, ADP and NaMA claim that they can protect Amhara people from these problems. NaMA has even opened up new branches outside Amhara, in Addis Ababa and other cities, where Amharic speakers reside. Despite their critics blaming the rise in Amhara tribalism for causing more death and displacement to Amharic speakers living outside \u201cAmhara state,\u201d NaMA and ADP are still winning many hearts and minds. Amhara identity protests in Wolkait, Metekel and Raya are some examples of Amhara nationalists demanding their rights outside of Amhara. Accordingly, many Amhara nationalists have been applying a \u2018holier than thou\u2019 approach when it comes to the current Ethiopian constitution. They claim that Amhara state is the most democratic inside the ethnofederal system because minorities have self-administration. The biggest example to support this claim is the Oromia and Agew Awi zones inside Amhara. In the Oromo zone, Afaan-Oromo is the working language and Oromo politicians control local government. Many urban areas in Oromia are dominated by Amhara Thus, Amhara nationalists want reciprocal benefits for their people outside Amhara. The prime candidate where new Amhara zones would be established is in Oromia. Historically, just as Oromo speakers have migrated north, Amharic speakers migrated south, or simply intermarried. Therefore, today, many urban areas in Oromia are dominated by Amhara, especially Addis Ababa and Nazret (Adama). According to the 2007 census,\u00a0about 60 percent of residents in Adama Special Zone had Amharic as their mother tongue.\u00a0Therefore, in a country where language-based federalism is the law, Adama (Nazret) would constitutionally comprise one of the Amhara zones inside Oromia. This eventually might disqualify Adama from being the seat of Oromia parliament. Also in Bishoftu (Debre Zeit) City of Oromia, residents with Amharic mother-tongue makeup even higher proportions:\u00a0at 72 percent.\u00a0And in Jimma city in Oromia, out of 120,000 residents only about 48,000 were native Afaan Oromo speakers. Even in Mejenger Zone of Gambella, the majority by mother tongue is actually Amhara. There are more. Other candidates for Amhara zones include small parts of Hawassa, Assosa and Dire Dawa which contain about 100,000 Amhara residents each. If we include Welkait and other parts of Tigray where a large population of native Amharic speakers live, it is possible to have over a dozen major Amhara zones outside Amhara state. Will ADP and NaMA deliver Amhara zones? Or, as NaMA chairman Desalegn Chane recently said, can they actually restore the \u201cdignity and God given rights of Amhara people\u201d? Of course not. Particularly, Amharic speaking majorities living in urban Oromia and other states are abandoned by Amhara nationalists. Yet, even in rural Oromia districts like Dera Woreda, which is the northernmost district of North Shoa Zone, where Amhara makeup between 45 to 55 percent of the population, thousands of Amhara protested for self-rule last week; but both ADP and NaMA have so far done little to meet their demands. Establishing Amhara zones inside Oromia, Tigray and other regional states is a fantasy, for many reasons. After all, ethnic federalism is created at the expense of both Amhara and multiethnic cosmopolitans, who are either forced to pick a fraction of their ancestral identity during a census or become invisible. First of all, creating Amhara zones, just like Oromo zones, will lead to more ethnic conflict and territorial disputes. Secondly, it will lead to a more dangerous zero-sum game when it comes to ethnic politics, by weakening moderates and empowering extremists. And this threat of civil war is what keeps leaders like Abiy Ahmed up at night. That is why Oromo leaders like Lemma Megersa, and Abiy, preach unity and \u201cEthiopiawinet\u201d whenever they are in front of diverse audience. Abiy did tell the truth about our intertwined history For example, during his speech in Germany, Abiy was questioned about the fate of Amhara living outside Amhara, particularly in Tigray. His instinctive response was to discourage tribalism among Amhara activists. In his answer, Abiy cited historical accounts about Abyssinian kings who were dependent on thousands of Oromo soldiers who marched to Gondar. Abiy said the northern movement of Oromos has resulted in intermarriages and multiethnic mixture. Thus, Abiy concluded that there is no pure Amhara blood today because people were mixed for centuries. While Abiy did tell the truth about our intertwined history, one can only imagine the level of outrage if the roles were reversed, and if an Amhara leader said there is no pure Oromo because of post-conflict ethnic fusion. Such a person would have been crucified by Oromo elites and their social media cheerleaders. It seems like for Oromo nationalists, they embrace history only when it is convenient. Abiy\u2019s speech in Germany was not the first time he rebuked Amhara nationalism. When Abiy was asked about the Welkait-Tsegede issue earlier this year, he was quick to scold and discourage \u201cAmhara tribalism.\u201d Abiy is not alone, although others have different motives. Jawar Mohammed and like-minded influential ethnonationalists turn on and off the Welkait switch as a bargaining chip against TPLF. Otherwise, they prefer not to push Amhara nationalism too hard to the right. For these tribalists, Amhara nationalism is good only to justify the existence of some \u2018foreign\u2019 land where Amharic \u2018settlers\u2019 can go back to. Otherwise, it is something bad, something to be discouraged or shunned, because they know it can ultimately backfire on them. It appears that in the eyes of the Prime Minister, TPLF and most ethnonationalists, the Amhara question of Welkait, Raya and Metekel is dead on arrival. Amhara nationalism is toothless So, one must ask: if Amhara nationalists cannot even achieve their basic responsibility of restoring lands they claim to belong to Amhara, what is the purpose for their existence? If Amhara nationalists cannot establish Amhara zones outside Amhara, what is the point of embracing ethnic federalism? To be blunt, the harsh reality is, the ethnic \u201cScramble for Ethiopia\u201d was supervised by TPLF, OLF and other similarly minded organizations two decades ago to determine who gets which pieces of the pie. Let alone Ethiopian nationalists, even independent Amhara were not invited to that party. Unless Amhara nationalists redraw the maps and declare Addis Ababa, Wolkait, Adama and many areas in other states as Amhara zones, their nationalism is meaningless. It has no purpose. They exist only to facilitate the current ethnofederal system and to justify further persecution of Amharic speakers nationwide. The Amhara revanchists\u2019 rhetoric might appear like an existential threat to neighboring states. But, other than slogans and posters, Amhara nationalism is toothless. So far, Amhara tribalism is only serving its original purpose for its creators: to weaken Ethiopian nationalism. The Amhara protest in Dera Woreda in Oromia What is fascinating about Amhara tribalism is the potential for it to be a double-edged sword for its creators. Meles Zenawi passed away without seeing the fruits of his ethnic federalism vis-a-vis Amhara nationalism. Ironically, he would not have been that excited about the Wolkait rhetoric either. After all, he wanted an Amhara nationalism that he can control and exploit. He wanted Amhara ethnic awareness; not the empowering version, but a self-hating one. He wanted an Amhara population that is forever filled with a sense of imperial guilt. For him and for Oromo nationalists, all historical problems in Ethiopia are pinned on the Amhara. For that to happen, the Amharic speakers who used to only call themselves Gojjame, Wolloye, Shewan, etc must first embrace the Amhara label and then wear the guilty Amhara costume. Once Amhara nationalists digest the reality of their powerlessness and gradually realize that tribalism was never created for their benefit, the next natural step should be to consider the alternative: Ethiopian nationalism and individual rights. By all measures, Amhara nationalism is not the only nationalism that is failing today. Ethnic federalism is slowly unraveling and proving increasingly toxic. Even since Abiy arrived and preached tolerance, peace and democracy, hundreds of deaths and more than a million internal displacements have brought a sense of hopelessness. Hidden behind the media headlines of women appointments is the reality that Ethiopia is now ranked first in the world for the most internal displacement of its own people in the first-half of 2018. As\u00a0Berhanu Nega told Addis Standard recently, Ethiopian society is losing its \u201cmoral compass.\u201d The last seven months have proven that Oromo lives do not even matter to Oromo elites like Jawar who are ignoring the killing of Oromos in Somali region and Kamashi Zone of Benishangul-Gumuz. In the past, every single Oromo death triggered outrage on social media and it was weaponized for propaganda. But today, it seems some Oromo leaders care more about saving the face of the ethnic federalism system than they care about their own people. Behind the scenes, Oromo nationalists are doing the same thing the TPLF did to the Amhara over the last 27 years: shifting the demographics. Now that they have gained some power, Oromo elites don\u2019t even talk publicly about Finfinne anymore because they saw how Addis Ababa residents utterly rejected Oromo nationalism and OLF in September. Individual liberty will lift all boats Their new focus now is changing the demographics of urban Oromia. They are copying the TPLF blueprint of Tigrayan mass resettlement policy in Wolkait by pushing Oromos into urban and suburban areas in Oromia, where they are a minority. That is why we see so many more ethnic conflicts in Dire Dawa, Adama, Harar, etc. News of Qeerroo evicting urban neighborhoods and ethnic cleansing kebeles has become the new normal. Even in Bishoftu (DebreZeit), where virtually all residents are native Amharic speakers, Oromo youths are threatening and disenfranchising local citizens. Therefore, instead of enabling the ethnic-segregation laws of the country, it is now more important than ever that Amharic speakers reject Amhara nationalism, and instead advocate for citizenship-based democracy. Amharic speakers must thus choose the alternative: give more support to groups like Ginbot 7 who promote individual rights and civic nationalism, instead of wasting their capital on supporting Amhara nationalism. In the end, individual liberty will lift all boats, resulting in not only benefiting persecuted Amharic-speaking Ethiopians, but also benefiting all Ethiopians no matter their religion, clan, region or ethnicity. When that time comes when we respect the rights of every individual over the rights of an identity-based political group; we can then regain our moral compass and cherish every human life. For that to happen, let us dream of that future, when all Ethiopians have the right to live anywhere in Ethiopia, when no land has a tribal label on it, and when we all belong everywhere in Ethiopia. That is also when we can unleash our social and economic potential and guarantee our basic rights as human beings. And that will be a country we can be proud of, which we can all call our home.

{"year":"2019","month":"10","event_desc":"5 October  The first ever Irreechaa was celebrated in Addis Ababa's Meskel Square with hundreds of thousands Oromos attended.","text":"Home Ethiopian News Ethnic Oromo Irreecha religious festival celebrated in Addis Ababa Ethiopian News October 5, 2019 Updated: February 28, 2024 Ethnic Oromo Irreecha religious festival celebrated in Addis Ababa October 5, 2019 Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin Telegram Viber Irreecha, ethnic Oromo religious festival, is celebrated in Addis Ababa -a city overy which radical Oromo ethnic nationalists claim ownership right Irreecha celebration in Addis Ababa. Photo \u2013 FBC borkena October 5, 2019 Ethiopia has more than 80 language speaking groups and ethnic Oromo is believed to have the largest number.\u00a0 On Saturday, they celebrated their traditional religious festival, Irrecha, at Meskel Square in the capital Addis Ababa. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Oromos from different parts of the Oromo region of Ethiopia showed up at the Meskel square for the celebration. Security in the city was tight, according to citizens\u2019 reports from the city. Traditionally, the festival is celebrated in Lake Hora in Bishoftu (Debre Zeit) which about 44 kilometers southeast of Ethiopia\u2019s capital Addis Ababa. Irreecha, according to ethnic Oromo traditional religion which is known as waaqeffannaa, is a festival of thanksgiving to Waaqa-which they believe is a monotheistic god.\u00a0 Waqqa is much like what rice growers of the Dioloa community in West Africa call Emitai \u2013 a god associated with sky and giving rain. The Dogon in Mali and Burkina Faso have similar region worshipped among members of the ethnic group. As ethnic Oromos in the Waaqeffannaa faith and elders in the community say, thanksgiving is offered to Waaqa for ending the rainy season. The thanksgiving celebration, traditionally, features followers the faith making a ritual march to Lake Hora in Bishoftu throwing grass to the lake as an offer of thanks to Waqqa, throwing slaughtered rooster to the lake and buttering live trees. All ethnic Oromo parties feature a tree in their party flags and emblems. The traditional Irreecha celebration is now considered as a tool by Oromo political elites and the celebration itself is sounding much like a political event. Apart from weeks of preparations, the celebration is now turned it into a three-day event and taken to the capital Addis Ababa as well. In what seems to be an effort to make the traditional religion, not based on any one of the Abrahamic regions including Islam, cool, organizers seem to be attempting to inject economic and social value to the festival. On Friday, a large open-air festival was organized in Meskel Square where the acting president of Oromo regional state, Shilemes Abdissa made a controversial political speech. Earlier in the week, a fashion show was organized in the capital seemingly to glorify Ireecchaa too. The narratives from radical Oromo ethnic nationalists believe that this ethnic Oromo religious festival used to be celebrated in the capital Addis Ababa 150 years ago and they link the discontinuation of the celebration with the reign of Emperor Menelik in Ethiopia. Shimeles Abdissa, Oromo region president, reportedly told the crowd that tricked down to Meskel Square from different Oromo region of Ethiopia that their struggle\u00a0 broke the ankle of Neftegna ( and they tend to link it to ethnic Amhara, and somewhat to ethnic Tigray too) where the Nefetagna\u2019s broke the ankle of ethnic Oromo in history. Based on simple maths, the claim does not seem to be true. 150 years back from now in the history of Ethiopia roughly coincides with the British invasion of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier\u2019s expeditionary force and the end of the regin of Emperor Tewodros II when he committed suicide rather than surrendering to the British force to which is he lost the war. Emperor Menelik was a teenager at the time and not in power. Following three years of rule under Tekle Ghiorghis,\u00a0 Emperor Yohannes IV, who is from Temben region of Tigray in Northern Ethiopia, ruled Ethiopia for nearly twenty years until his death in 1889. Radical ethnic Oromo Nationalists, although many of them seem to be followers of either Islam or Christianity, tend to think that the traditional Irreeccha religious festival could be polished in a way to be used as a tool to Oromoize Ethiopia by way of creating a core culture. As part of the glorification of effort, eve (as in a new year tradition) put together by organizers in the capital Addis Ababa gave an excuse to the city administration (at the helm of which is believed to be a populist and subtle radical Oromo nationalist) to close major roads in the city \u2013 a matter that has angered thousands of people. On Sunday, the celebration will go back to\u00a0 Bishoftu ( Debre Zeit) \u2013 Hora lake. In 2016, more than 50 people were killed in the same place as government forces used tear gas to suppress political protest staged during the celebration. Irreecha happens about three weeks after the Ethiopian New year and a week after the celebration of the discovery of the true cross, Meskel, a Christian religious holiday celebrated across the country and among many communities including in Oromo communities. This year, authorities in the city banned the celebration of Meskel festival in Bishoftu . They even detained Abune Gorgorios III for several hours. __ Join our Telegram Channel : t.me\/borkena Like borkena on Facebook Join the conversation.

And celebration in Addis Ababa is also legitimate not only for Promos but for every other Ethiopian ethnic background or religious background. What is sad is who the selfish Oromo politicians not in government and opposition have used it. It is false and baseless all the prohibition narrative they have advanced and in fact old Kings were way more tolerant a of any of those celebrations of any ethnic groups  including omotic animist groups.  If some of the Oromos were professing  Orthodox Christian or Muslim in public for social benefit bidding their Irrecha practice that is their personal choice that they are using it now as victim history to lie the youth and use them as a tool. In other hand eventhough are not the elite of the Orthodox Church but people to claim belonging to it circulating posts comparing Irrecha celebration with with devil or similar things is horrendously disrespectful to an entire ethnic group of the Oromo. So grow up and learn to respect your own brothers when you respect other ethinic groups cultures and practices thousands of miles away in other countries. What a shame that you have is only hate when you profess to follow God love doctrine.

Ethiopia has launched its first satellite into space, as more sub-Saharan African nations strive to develop space programmes to advance their development goals and encourage scientific innovation. Before dawn on Friday, senior officials and citizens gathered at the Entoto Observatory and Research Centre just north of the capital Addis Ababa to watch a live broadcast of the satellite\u2019s launch from a space station in China . \u201cThis will be a foundation for our historic journey to prosperity,\u201d deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen said in a speech at the launch event broadcast on state television. The satellite was designed by Chinese and Ethiopian engineers and the Chinese government paid about $6m of the more than $7m manufacturing costs, Solomon Belay, director-general of the Ethiopian Space Science and Technology Institute, told Reuters News Agency. Another eight satellites were put into orbit by the same rocket, including an E arth observation satellite jointly developed by\u00a0China\u00a0and Brazil as part of a bilateral programme, which is seen as a template for broader cooperation among both countries as well as Russia, India and South Africa . The China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite-4A was launched on a Long March-4B rocket in the northern Chinese province of Shanxi, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The satellite was the sixth developed based on the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) programme that began in 1988. The satellites are designed for Earth observation from orbit for non-military use. The CBERS-4A will support the Brazilian government\u2019s monitoring of the Amazon rainforest and changes in the country\u2019s environment, according to Xinhua. Brazil, Russia , India, China and\u00a0South Africa\u00a0\u2013 collectively known as BRICS \u2013 have been in talks on a framework agreement to create a constellation of satellites for Earth remote-sensing and share data obtained by each others\u2019 satellites. Each country will provide one to two satellites to the constellation, according to the China National Space Administration in 2018. The CBERS satellites would be included in the constellation programme. Currently, only South Africa\u00a0in the BRICS bloc does not have satellites of its own. More sub-Saharan African nations have been striving to develop space programmes to advance their development goals and encourage scientific innovation. The African Union adopted a policy on African space development in 2017 and declared that space science and technology could advance economic progress and natural resource management on the continent. \u201cSpace is food, space is job creation, a tool for technology \u2026 sovereignty, to reduce poverty, everything for Ethiopian to achieve universal and sustainable development,\u201d said Belay.

Chairpersons of eight parties who worked under the umbrella EPRDF coalition sign document for that establishes  prosperity party. Photo credit : OPM borkena December 1, 2019 Three former member parties of Ethiopia\u2019s ruling coalition, EPRDF, and five agar (\u201csupport\u201d or ally) parties, as they used to be called during the entire lifetime of the coalition, have inked their signature in the capital Addis Ababa officially signaling that time for Prosperity Party is ushering. Prime minister Abiy Ahmed updated his fans on social media, in three languages, about what is considered to be a milestone moment in Ethiopian politics . He wrote  \u201cA momentous signing occasion marking the unification of our Party. The unification process will continue maintaining legality and due process.\u201d According to a report by state affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporation (FBC), Chairpersons of the parties who approved the merger to form Prosperity Party (PP)\u00a0 have attended the signing ceremony. As well, senior government officials including Demeke Mekonnen, who is Ethiopia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, and Muferiat Kamil, minister for the Ministry of Peace \u2013 one of the most powerful institutions in the country next to the office of the prime minister, have attended the meeting. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed made a speech during the ceremony. He said that Prosperity Party holds two twin agenda item ; development and democracy. \u201cIt is a reliable bridge that is based on truth and knowledge to transit Ethiopia [ to prosperity]\u201d He also mentioned that the party has prepared program and party regulation, which is yet to be made public, and a 10 years plan to usher \u201cEthiopia to prosperity.\u201d The umbrella coalition organization of Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), was composed of\u00a0 four major ethnic-based (except SEPDM) political organizations and five other support organizations. The later groups were marginalized, by design and with party regulations, did not have the power to decide on national matters or to hold the highest office in the country. The new party, Prosperity Party, is organized in a way to\u00a0 end what many members call, rightly, injustice in that regard. Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), a party that engineered and dominated the now phased out coalition, declined to join the new party on alleged grounds that it was formed in a way that violate the political and legal procedures. It said \u201cwhat happened in the name of merger is formation of a new party,\u201d and argued that EPRDF leadership does not have the mandate to abandon \u201crevolutionary democracy.\u201d Individuals figures outside of TPLF have also opposed to the merger. Ethiopia\u2019s Defense Minister, Lemma Megersa , who was also a key ally and former boss of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, stated his opposition to the formation of a singer merged party out of the EPRDF coalition in an interview with VOA Afan Oromo language saying that a) he does not believe in it which seems to imply that he prefers the ethnic-based arrangement b) it\u2019s not timely. Political organizations that formed the Prosperity Party are : Afar National Democratic Party (ANDP) Benishangul-Gumuz Democratic Party (BDP) Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) Amhara Democratic Party (ADP) Southern Ethiopian Peoples\u2019 Democratic Movement (SEPDM) Somali Democratic Party Gambela Peoples Democratic Movement (GPDM) Harari National League (HNL) Join the conversation.

Reply Negesti December 2, 2019\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    3:01 am Ethiopia do not want to travel whether  on a bridge , by land , by air , by water or on a railway , what Ethiopia needs is to remain intact not to get displaced forcefully or not to get forced to lead a life of nomads by being vulnerable to bandits . The only ones that might benefit from all these traveling planned are the ODP affiliated  bandits who ambush the travelers, noonelse. Only Senay Meles Zenawi can bring the country peace back as one , so we can defeat both  the outside and internal enemies of the country. Abiy should apologize to all of TPLF and the Tigray people then Abiy must give the PM post to Senay Meles Zenawi at once before it is too late. Reply Beniomer December 2, 2019\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    4:31 am Same leaders same outcome! Elect different leaders for prosperity! Prosperity is intended for EPRDF cadres military criminals to save their own skins from the public\u2019s uproar by changing their party names hiding in a new party, just so  the political economical and military oppression by them continues under false pretenses. Ethiopians are suffering since 1980s  till the present time by EPRDF, now EPRDF changed the name but it is still the same type of ethnic oppression even worse in some cases for the public , with the public\u2019s  safety not getting enough attention as the cadres safety is getting. TPLF is still in control of the  economic , political and military power through their errand boy Abiy\u2019s team which they entrusted him with their safety .

I guess Ethiopians with stakeholders obviously didn\u2019t think about it. Gragn mohamed\/aba jifar in the making. No wonder, this guy called tolosa on social media  knew, for years he has been distracting Ethiopians with his national flag, and when jawar fakely called  out that he is being surrounded, this tolosa guy quickly switched sides! Saying he is standing by jawar and threw away ethiopias national flag and said he is Oromo first meaning  wahabism  first. Now I understand why. Under the watch dog of their outside masters, tplf \/shabia finally are taking a chance and  succeded installing wahabism in Ethiopia.

As a country, leadership rules a nation and not a smaller region. ALL leaders by their nature for survival of their people expand become inclusive  not exclusive. When it comes to Liberation Fronts, it is the reverse which no nation implement such bizzare system being used for international experiment to disintegrate nations into small enclaves, far away from the concept of federalizm. 2.

They say dozens of people are still missing since the landslide on Saturday night at the Koshe landfill. A resident said 150 people were there at the time. A number of makeshift houses are now buried under tonnes of waste. The area has been a dumping ground for Addis Ababa's rubbish for more than five decades.

{"year":"2017","month":"08","event_desc":"3 August - USAID expands food aid to Ethiopia as well as Kenya to help them against the famine. $137 million has been donated to Ethiopia.","text":"U.S. expands food, health aid to Ethiopia, Kenya amid crisis By Reuters August 3, 2017 7:19 PM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration gave $169 million to feed people facing starvation in Ethiopia and Kenya, USAID said on Thursday, adding to earlier assistance for those suffering from drought and conflict in four other nations. USAID, the U.S. government's humanitarian relief agency, said in a statement that it had provided $137 million in aid for Ethiopia and nearly $33 million for Kenya. The latest funding comes after Trump pledged $639 million last month in urgent food assistance for Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen. Increased aid comes as numerous countries in the region face crisis-level food shortages due to armed conflict, prolonged drought and economic upheaval that have also resulted in a lack of medical care, sanitation, shelter and safety. Meteorologists have blamed a series of severe back-to-back droughts in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region on fluctuations in ocean temperatures known as the Indian Ocean Dipole. While rain is expected early next year in Somalia it is unlikely to offer immediate relief. \"With this new funding, the United States is scaling up emergency food assistance, while providing specialized nutrition supplies to treat malnourished children, and also furnishing safe drinking water and essential health services,\" USAID's statement said. The funds for Kenya would help support refugees fleeing neighboring conflicts as well as Kenyans suffering from drought, the agency said. Rising food prices in Kenya have also been an ongoing concern. The assistance for Ethiopia, which has also been struck by a severe drought, included enough food to feed 3 million people, USAID added. While the hardest-hit area in Somali region of eastern Ethiopia is not plagued by conflict, it is remote with poor infrastructure and hard to reach. \"It is not a famine but it is rising up to the levels of getting close to famine,\" said Matt Nims, acting director of Food for Peace at USAID. \"That is why we want to act now so that we're not into that stage.\" According to the United Nations, 795 million people worldwide are undernourished, mostly in developing countries. It has already warned of mass starvation in Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan. Last month, The United Nations said that while many people in South Sudan are still going hungry, the worst of the famine had eased. In Yemen, a two-year war has increased concerns about mass starvation and disease.

Credit: Jialiang Gao via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) By CNA Staff Adigrat, Ethiopia, Jan 20, 2021 \/\n            17:34 pm At least 750 people are reported dead after an attack on an Oriental Orthodox church in Ethiopia's Tigray region, according to a European watchgroup. On Jan. 9, the Europe External Programme with Africa reported that the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum, about 80 miles west of Adigrat, had been attacked, and that hundreds of people who hid inside were brought out to the front square and shot to death. According to Church Times UK , the attack was carried out by Ethiopian government troops and Amhara militia from central Ethiopia. At least 1,000 people were estimated to be hiding in the church at the time of the attack. Locals have said they believe the church was targeted by raiders of the lost ark. The church is thought to contain the original Ark of the Covenant, a sacred golden chest first mentioned in the book of Exodus that carried the 10 commandments, parts of sacred scripture, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna. They believed the attackers wanted to steal the Ark of the Covenant and take it to the capital city of Addis Ababa, the Church Times reported. This ark is guided by a single priest who never leaves the compound, and it is not allowed to be seen by anyone else, so whether it is really the true Ark has been debated by historians for centuries. The church belongs to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, an Oriental Orthodox Church that is estimated to have about 36 million members. Tigray has been the site of the Tigray War since November of last year. In the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray, the regional government is run by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The group once dominated the ruling coalition of Ethiopia but felt marginalized by Prime Minister Abiy's political changes after he took office in 2018. He dissolved the ruling coalition and merged its ethnicity-based regional parties into a single party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join. Tigrayan leaders have said they were unfairly targeted by political purges and allegations of corruption. They have argued that Abiy's postponement of national elections due to coronavirus have ended his mandate as a legitimate leader, BBC News reported. On Nov. 4 Abiy announced a military offensive in response to an alleged attack on a military base in Mekelle, the capital of Tigray. The prime minister aims to arrest the regional government heads and to destroy its military arsenal. Thousands of people are estimated to have been killed on both sides of the conflict. Each side blames the other for the conflict, and it is difficult to confirm their claims, the Associated Press has said. Tigray's communications have been almost completely cut off, and journalists were reportedly not allowed in the area where the church attack took place. Trending 1 2 3 4 5 Pope Francis and the Catholic bishops of the region called for peace and dialogue as the conflict worsened in November. According to the U.N., tens of thousands have fled the Tigray region for Sudan after the outbreak of the war.

The village of Daletti is located in the Metekel area, where hundreds of civilians have been killed by assailants using guns, knives and other weapons in attacks going back to at least September. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has struggled to impose order in Metekel or explain what is driving the violence, despite visiting the area in December and empowering a command post to take charge of security there. There is no known link between the violence and military operations in Ethiopia's northernmost Tigray region, where Abiy sent in troops in November to detain and disarm leaders of the dissident regional ruling party. Tuesday's attack in Metekel occurred between 5 and 7 am, with victims ranging in age from two to 45, Aaron said. The EHRC, a government-affiliated but independent body, is \"still chasing further details about the perpetrators\" and how the victims were killed, he said. Opposition politicians have described the violence in Metekel as ethnically motivated, alleging a targeted campaign by ethnic Gumuz militias against members of other ethnic groups in the area, including the Amhara, Ethiopia's second-largest group. One survivor of Tuesday's attack, Ahmed Yimam, told AFP Wednesday he had counted 82 bodies and said 22 people were injured. \"The attack was carried out mostly using knives although arrows and firearms were also used,\" he said. \"I fear more attacks as the perpetrators aren't receiving punishment, and there is no functioning government at local and regional level,\" he said. On Monday, state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate reported that \"relative peace has been restored in Metekel\" because of the government's response to the violence, but the EHRC's Aaron said Wednesday that more needed to be done. \"These civilians have barely had a respite from such grim attacks for months. We once again call on federal and regional authorities to enhance their coordination when responding to such incidents to prevent the loss of life in Benishangul-Gumuz,\" he said. \"We remind the authorities that the protection of civilians is the primary duty of the government.\" AFP ","question":"What was the reported death toll in the attack near Daletti village in Ethiopia's Metekel Zone in January 2021?","answer":"Approximately 80 civilians were killed.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u1325\u122d 2021 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1218\u1270\u12a8\u120d \u12de\u1295 \u12a8\u12f3\u120c\u1272 \u1218\u1295\u12f0\u122d \u12a0\u1245\u122b\u1262\u12eb \u1260\u1270\u12a8\u1220\u1270\u12cd \u1325\u1243\u1275 \u12e8\u1270\u1308\u1298\u12cd \u12e8\u121e\u1275 \u1241\u1325\u122d \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u1290\u1260\u122d?","answer_translated":"\u12a880 \u12dc\u130e\u127d \u1308\u12f0\u121b \u1270\u1308\u12f5\u1208\u12cb\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u1325\u122d 2021 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1218\u1270\u12a8\u120d \u12de\u1295 \u12a8\u12f3\u120c\u1272 \u1218\u1295\u12f0\u122d \u12a0\u1245\u122b\u1262\u12eb \u1260\u1270\u12a8\u1220\u1270\u12cd \u1325\u1243\u1275 \u12e8\u1270\u1308\u1298\u12cd \u12e8\u121e\u1275 \u1241\u1325\u122d \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u1290\u1260\u122d \u1265\u1208 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1270 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u1273\u122a\u12ad \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1270 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1240\u1260\u1208 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1275\u122d\u1309\u121d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1270 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u1219","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer does not provide the expected information about the number of deaths in the attack.

More than 80 civilians, including children as young as two years old, have been killed in the latest attack to afflict western Ethiopia, the country\u2019s national human rights commission said on Wednesday. Aaron Maasho, spokesman and senior adviser for the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told Al Jazeera the massacre took place on Tuesday between 5am and 7am in the region of Benishangul-Gumuz, which borders Sudan and South Sudan. \u201cWe received information that over 80 people died whose ages range from 2 to 45 years old,\u201d he said from the capital, Addis Ababa. There was no claim of responsibility and no immediate information about the identity of the attackers. \u201cWe can confirm that the perpetrators of the attack have not been apprehended by the authorities yet,\u201d Maasho said. The attack took place in an area called Daletti, in the Metekel zone of Benishangul-Gumuz, which has been plagued by recurring violence in recent months that has left hundreds of people dead. Some 207 people were killed in one attack on December 23 alone. Maasho said \u201cthousands of people\u201d have been displaced due to the continuing violence in Metekel. \u201cWe call on the federal and regional authorities to strengthen the coordination and measures, including at the district level, to prevent similar attacks against civilians,\u201d added the spokesman of the EHRC, a government-affiliated but independent body.

Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation has been grappling with regular outbreaks of deadly violence since Abiy was appointed in 2018 and accelerated democratic reforms that loosened the state\u2019s iron grip on regional rivalries. Elections due this year have further inflamed simmering tensions over land, power and resources. In a separate part of the country, Ethiopia\u2019s military has been fighting rebels in the northern Tigray region for more than two months, in a conflict that has displaced some one million people. The Ethiopian government said on Wednesday that three officials with Tigray\u2019s former ruling party, including ex Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin were killed after they refused to surrender to the military. The deployment of federal troops in Tigray has raised fears of a security vacuum in other restive regions. Ethiopia is also experiencing unrest in the Oromia region and faces long-running security threats from Somali fighters along its porous eastern border.

Advertisement By AFP More by this Author Addis Ababa . A top-ranking member of Ethiopia's army confirmed that troops from neighbouring Eritrea entered the northern Tigray region during the conflict there, in a video seen by AFP on Wednesday. Ethiopia's federal government has long denied persistent claims that Eritrean troops were in Tigray, where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against dissident regional leaders in November that left thousands dead. But Major General Belay Seyoum, the head of the Ethiopian army's northern division, went against those denials in a video dated from the end of December that emerged on social media Wednesday. \"An unwanted foreign force entered into our territory\" during the fighting in Tigray, he said in the video, in which he spoke with residents of the regional capital Mekele. We can solve our problem by ourselves. Advertisement Eritrea's army \"entered our territory by itself, this has to be made clear,\" he added, without specifying when the soldiers crossed the border, where they went, or whether they were still in Ethiopia. \"The main mission of the Ethiopia Defense Force is safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ethiopia,\" he said. \"My conscience doesn't allow me to ask the Eritrean army to help us. We can solve our problem by ourselves.\" In December the US State Department said it was \"aware of credible reports of Eritrean military involvement in Tigray,\" and called for the troops to be withdrawn. Ethiopia's ambassador to the US Fitsum Arega denied the claim, tweeting: \"Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth!\". Tigray residents also told AFP that Eritrean troops were in the region, accusing them of various abuses and looting. Peace agreement Prime Minister Abiy reached a historic peace agreement with Eritrea shortly after taking office in 2018, winning him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. Abiy's ascension ended decades of federal political dominance by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), sworn enemies of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki after a 1998-2000 war between the two countries. The premier launched the military operation against Tigray's TPLF leaders on November 4, claiming victory when federal forces captured Mekele later that month. Before the conflict began, Tigray was home to 96,000 Eritrean refugees who fled Afwerki's regime in one of the world's most authoritarian states. Reprisal fear The UN is among those to have expressed fear the Eritrean refugees in Tigray could face reprisals from Eritrean troops, or even be forced to return to the country. Also on Wednesday, the council representing Ethiopia's Muslims condemned the partial destruction of one of Africa's oldest mosques in the Tigray fighting. Qassim Mohammed Tajuddin, the secretary of the Ethiopia Islamic Affairs Supreme Council, said the al-Nejashi Mosque had been hit by artillery fire and its materials had been looted. He called on the government \"to bring to justice speedily those entities that committed these shameful acts\". Built in the 7th century, the mosque is considered one of the oldest Muslim burial sites. Muslims believe it houses the tomb of several of Prophet Mohammed's disciples.

The village of Daletti is located in the Metekel area, where hundreds of civilians have been killed by assailants using guns, knives and other weapons in attacks going back to at least September. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has struggled to impose order in Metekel or explain what is driving the violence, despite visiting the area in December and empowering a command post to take charge of security there. There is no known link between the violence and military operations in Ethiopia's northernmost Tigray region, where Abiy sent in troops in November to detain and disarm leaders of the dissident regional ruling party. Tuesday's attack in Metekel occurred between 5 and 7 am, with victims ranging in age from two to 45, Aaron said. The EHRC, a government-affiliated but independent body, is \"still chasing further details about the perpetrators\" and how the victims were killed, he said. Opposition politicians have described the violence in Metekel as ethnically motivated, alleging a targeted campaign by ethnic Gumuz militias against members of other ethnic groups in the area, including the Amhara, Ethiopia's second-largest group. One survivor of Tuesday's attack, Ahmed Yimam, told AFP Wednesday he had counted 82 bodies and said 22 people were injured. \"The attack was carried out mostly using knives although arrows and firearms were also used,\" he said. \"I fear more attacks as the perpetrators aren't receiving punishment, and there is no functioning government at local and regional level,\" he said. On Monday, state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate reported that \"relative peace has been restored in Metekel\" because of the government's response to the violence, but the EHRC's Aaron said Wednesday that more needed to be done. \"These civilians have barely had a respite from such grim attacks for months. We once again call on federal and regional authorities to enhance their coordination when responding to such incidents to prevent the loss of life in Benishangul-Gumuz,\" he said. \"We remind the authorities that the protection of civilians is the primary duty of the government.\" AFP ","question":"What types of weapons were used in the January 2021 attack in Ethiopia's Metekel area?","answer":"The attackers used knives, arrows, and firearms.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12602021 \u1325\u122d \u12c8\u122d \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1218\u1270\u12a8\u120d \u12a0\u12ab\u1263\u1262 \u12e8\u1270\u12ab\u1204\u12f0\u12cd \u1325\u1243\u1275 \u121d\u1295 \u12d3\u12ed\u1290\u1275 \u12e8\u1326\u122d \u1218\u1223\u122a\u12eb\u12ce\u127d \u1325\u1245\u121d \u120b\u12ed \u12cd\u120f\u120d?","answer_translated":"\u1320\u120b\u134a\u12ce\u1279 \u12aa\u1295\u132b \u1363 \u1240\u1235\u1275 \u12a5\u1293 \u12e8\u12a5\u1233\u1275 \u12a0\u12ed\u1290\u1275 \u1218\u1223\u122a\u12eb\u12ce\u127d\u1295 \u1270\u1320\u1245\u1218\u12cb\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u12602021 \u1325\u122d \u12c8\u122d \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1218\u1270\u12a8\u120d \u12a0\u12ab\u1263\u1262 \u12e8\u1270\u12ab\u1204\u12f0\u12cd \u1325\u1243\u1275 \u121d\u1295 \u12d3\u12ed\u1290\u1275 \u12e8\u1326\u122d \u1218\u1223\u122a\u12eb\u12ce\u127d \u1325\u1245\u121d \u120b\u12ed \u12cd\u120f\u120d \u1265\u1208 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1265\u127b \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d. \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228\u1230\u1265 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u121b\u1235\u1270\u12ab\u12a8\u120d \u1270\u124b","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer does not provide any relevant information about the types of weapons used in the attack in Ethiopia in January 2021.

Eduardo Soteras | AFP By AFP Agence France-Presse is an international news Agence France-Presse is an international news agency headquartered in Paris, France.  Addis Ababa . A top-ranking member of Ethiopia's army confirmed that troops from neighbouring Eritrea entered the northern Tigray region during the conflict there, in a video seen by AFP on Wednesday. Ethiopia's federal government has long denied persistent claims that Eritrean troops were in Tigray, where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against dissident regional leaders in November that left thousands dead. But Major General Belay Seyoum, the head of the Ethiopian army's northern division, went against those denials in a video dated from the end of December that emerged on social media Wednesday. \"An unwanted foreign force entered into our territory\" during the fighting in Tigray, he said in the video, in which he spoke with residents of the regional capital Mekele.  We can solve our problem by ourselves. Eritrea's army \"entered our territory by itself, this has to be made clear,\" he added, without specifying when the soldiers crossed the border, where they went, or whether they were still in Ethiopia. \"The main mission of the Ethiopia Defense Force is safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ethiopia,\" he said. \"My conscience doesn't allow me to ask the Eritrean army to help us. We can solve our problem by ourselves.\" In December the US State Department said it was \"aware of credible reports of Eritrean military involvement in Tigray,\" and called for the troops to be withdrawn. Ethiopia's ambassador to the US Fitsum Arega denied the claim, tweeting: \"Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth!\". Tigray residents also told AFP that Eritrean troops were in the region, accusing them of various abuses and looting.  Peace agreement Prime Minister Abiy reached a historic peace agreement with Eritrea shortly after taking office in 2018, winning him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. Abiy's ascension ended decades of federal political dominance by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), sworn enemies of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki after a 1998-2000 war between the two countries. The premier launched the military operation against Tigray's TPLF leaders on November 4, claiming victory when federal forces captured Mekele later that month. Before the conflict began, Tigray was home to 96,000 Eritrean refugees who fled Afwerki's regime in one of the world's most authoritarian states.  Reprisal fear The UN is among those to have expressed fear the Eritrean refugees in Tigray could face reprisals from Eritrean troops, or even be forced to return to the country. Also on Wednesday, the council representing Ethiopia's Muslims condemned the partial destruction of one of Africa's oldest mosques in the Tigray fighting. Qassim Mohammed Tajuddin, the secretary of the Ethiopia Islamic Affairs Supreme Council, said the al-Nejashi Mosque had been hit by artillery fire and its materials had been looted. He called on the government \"to bring to justice speedily those entities that committed these shameful acts\". Built in the 7th century, the mosque is considered one of the oldest Muslim burial sites. Muslims believe it houses the tomb of several of Prophet Mohammed's disciples.  We come to you.

{"year":"2021","month":"01","event_desc":"5 January  The government promises to repair the centuries-old Al Nejashi Mosque and the Orthodox Christian of Saint Emmanuel in Wukro that were damaged in December 2020 during the Tigray conflict in the Tigray conflict.","text":"Tigray crisis: Ethiopia to repair al-Nejashi mosque 5 January 2021 Share Save Share Save Social media Locals believe the al-Nejashi Mosque is the oldest in Africa The Ethiopian government has promised to repair a centuries-old mosque that was damaged  during the conflict in the northern Tigray region. The al-Nejashi Mosque was reportedly shelled. Its dome, the minaret and tombs of Islamic figures were damaged. The government said a nearby church damaged during the conflict would also be repaired. Locals believe al-Nejashi was built by the first Muslims to migrate to Africa during the time of Prophet Muhammad. They had fled persecution in Mecca and were given refuge in what was then the Kingdom of Aksum. Africa Live: Latest updates from around the continent Local Muslims believe that 15 disciples of Prophet Muhammad are buried in the damaged tombs. They also say the mosque is the oldest in Africa, though others believe that title belongs to one in Egypt. The mosque is near Wukro town, some 800km (500 miles) from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. An Orthodox Christian church named Saint Emmanuel was also damaged, but further details are unavailable. A Turkish aid agency launched a project in 2015 to renovate the mosque, saying it wanted to \"preserve the heritage\" of the monument and wanted it to become a major destination for \"religious tourism\". The mosque was renovated with Turkey's help The mosque and church were damaged during the month-long military operation that led to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) being ousted from power in the region on 28 November. What happened to the mosque? A Belgium-based non-profit organisation, Europe External Programme with Africa, reported on 18 December that al-Nejashi Mosque was \" first bombed and later looted by Ethiopian and Eritrean troops \". \"Tigrayan sources are saying that people have died trying to protect the mosque,\" it added. The government has not commented on the reports. Both the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments also deny that Eritrean forces are in Tigray to help in the fight against the TPLF. More about the fighting in Tigray: How a pariah and a Nobel laureate became friends 'How I survived an 11-hour gun battle' 'Why my uncle crossed a river to become a refugee' On Monday, Ethiopian state television quoted residents as saying that TPLF forces had dug trenches around the mosque, without giving any more details. The government has imposed heavy restrictions on the media in Tigray, making it difficult to know what exactly is happening. Access to Tigray has also been restricted for aid workers. In a BBC Amharic interview, the deputy director of the Ethiopian Heritage Preservation Authority, Abebaw Ayalew, said a team would be sent to inspect the damage to both the mosque and church before they are repaired. \"These sites are not only places of worship. It is also the heritage of the whole of Ethiopia,\" he said. Is this the home of the Ark of the Covenant? How bad has the conflict been? It is unclear how many have been killed in the conflict, but Mr Abiy previously said that the military did not kill a single civilian during the operation that led to the TPLF's removal from power. UN and other human rights bodies are calling for an independent investigation into allegations of against all sides, including the massacre of civilians and the shelling and looting of residential areas and a hospital. More than 50,000 people have fled to Sudan to escape the fighting. What is the fighting about? The conflict broke out in early November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. He said he did so in response to an attack on military bases housing government troops in Tigray. The conflict came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of the TPLF - the region's dominant political party. For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined after Mr Abiy took office in 2018 in the wake of anti-government protests. Five things about Tigray: 1. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region. Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires. Getty Images Aksum is believed to have been the home of the biblical Queen of Sheba 2. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site. The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant. 3.

Senior Oromo Federal Congress (OFC) members Bekele Gerba and Jawar Mohammed are among some 20 people facing charges ranging from \u201cterrorism\u201d to illegal possession of firearms in connection with the unrest that followed the murder of a popular Oromo musician last year. Bekele, Jawar and others began the food strike in late January in response to reports of arrests and mistreatment of supporters and family members who attend their courthouse hearings, according to their legal team. \u201cFour of them have already collapsed and have been taken to hospital,\u201d Ibsa Gemeda, one of the defendants\u2019 lawyers, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe others are unable to have conversations or move around. Some of them have serious underlying health issues and we are worried that this could result in their deaths.\u201d Advertisement Jawar himself has been extremely weakened by the strike he launched on January 27 and has since developed unspecified kidney problems, according to his lawyer. . @EthioHRC visited Kaliti Correctional Facility & Kilinto Prison to monitor the situation of Jawar Mohammed & others who have remained on hunger strike since January 27, and the treatment of Colonel Gemechu Ayana & Tilahun Yemi. Our statement below: pic.twitter.com\/qW6Sw93PCA \u2014 Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (@EthioHRC) February 5, 2021 The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) last week said it had visited the defendants and confirmed they were on hunger strike. \u201cVery close supervision is required to prevent any grave threat to their health and life,\u201d Daniel Bekele, EHRC chief commissioner, said in a statement, adding that \u201creasonably justified demands of the prisoners must be addressed\u201d. A court hearing was cancelled last week due to the defendants being too weak to attend. It came as the youth took to the streets of several cities including Ambo and Dire Dawa to protest against the continued detention of the Oromo leaders, with a number of injuries and at least one death reported. \u201cWe are asking for the releases of our political leaders,\u201d Yeroon Tolassa, a student activist who attended last week\u2019s protests, told Al Jazeera from Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa. \u201cOur political leaders and activists are jailed in the thousands.\u201d It was on the back of popular uprisings that first ignited among the ethnic Oromo, who constitute about a third of Ethiopia\u2019s 112 million people, that Abiy Ahmed ascended to the Ethiopian premiership in April 2018. Promising to rid the state of its repressive nature, Abiy \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s first Oromo prime minister \u2013 ordered the release of thousands of political prisoners, promised free and fair elections and later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his landmark restoration of ties with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia fought a bloody border war between 1998 and 2000. Advertisement But for many Oromos, the initial enthusiasm has all but dissipated. Abiy\u2019s opponents accuse him of growing authoritarian tendencies, while rights groups have expressed serious concerns over the detention of dozens of opposition members and journalists and the shutdown of independent media outlets. Jawar, a founder of the United States-based Oromia Media Network, was an ally of Abiy and played a key role in coordinating the protests that catapulted him to power, before becoming a public critic of his administration. He and the others on hunger strike are accused of inciting the wave of violence that followed the June 29, 2020 murder of beloved singer-songwriter Hachalu Hundessa and left hundreds dead. In August, a month before charges were announced, Human Rights Watch said the detentions and investigations were marred \u201cby serious due process violations\u201d while several months and multiple court hearings later, prosecutors have yet to provide evidence linking the defendants to the alleged crimes. \u201cThe charges against them are politically motivated,\u201d said Ibsa. \u201cThe case is motivated by the government\u2019s desire to remove Jawar and others from the political realm, and muzzle opposition in the Oromia state.\u201d Government officials have previously dismissed such claims, while authorities maintain the evidence will be presented in due time. \u201cCriminal charges won\u2019t be issued without evidence proving involving in a crime,\u201d Awel Sultan, communications head at the Ethiopian attorney general\u2019s office, told Al Jazeera. \u201cProsecutors aren\u2019t to speak of the evidence while the court entertains the case. When the court begins hearing witnesses, you\u2019ll begin to understand the nature of the evidence implicating them.\u201d Advertisement Highly anticipated general elections scheduled for last year have been postponed until June 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The OFC wields considerable influence across Oromia and was expected to provide Abiy\u2019s governing Prosperity Party with its stiffest challenge at the polls. Free elections were long portrayed as the end goal of a government that had promised structural changes that would widen the political space. After the uprisings of 2015-16 eventually led former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn to resign in February 2018, Abiy sealed the position on an interim basis, promising to oversee the transition to an all-encompassing democracy. Three years later, there are fears the upcoming polls would mirror those of the past quarter-century, none of which was deemed free and fair by international standards. Over the course of last year, there have been reports of mass arrests of opposition party supporters, while parties have also been prohibited from holding rallies. In addition to key candidates being jailed, analysts say the fact that elections are not expected to be held in the war-hit Tigray region because of security fears, fuels legitimacy doubts. \u201cThe systemic shuttering of the political opposition by arresting candidates, supporters and prohibiting rallies, shows us that the conditions for free and fair democratic elections have not been met,\u201d Awol Allo, lecturer in law at Keele University in the United Kingdom, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe ruling party knows that its ideology doesn\u2019t appeal to the Oromo masses. The only way it could secure victory at the polls would be by eliminating any formidable opposition presence.\u201d Advertisement The country\u2019s National Electoral Board has acknowledged the issue of jailed politicians, but the board\u2019s Chairwoman Birtukan Mideksa recently hinted that it would not be able to intervene on behalf of the jailed hunger strikers. \u201cWe are aware that political candidates have been arrested. We\u2019ve been able to succeed in convincing authorities to free some of them,\u201d Birtukan said at a virtual Q&A session with social media users last week. \u201cBut we have mandate limitations. We cannot intervene on behalf of candidates accused of murder, inciting violence and whose cases are in the courts.\u201d With next court appearances scheduled for March 1, barring additional delays, the case has taken a toll on family members of the detainees, including Arfasse Gemeda, wife of Jawar and a human rights advocate. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult being physically far away,\u201d she told Al Jazeera from the US, where she resides. \u201cEspecially during this hunger strike. As the days go on, I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019m going to hear when I answer the phone or check Facebook. It\u2019s a constant state of trauma,\u201d she added. \u201cAlthough we are not physically in jail, our minds are.\u201d Source : Al Jazeera","question":"Why did Bekele Gerba, Jawar Mohammed, and other OFC members begin a hunger strike in January 2021?","answer":"They began the hunger strike in response to reports of arrests and mistreatment of their supporters and family members who attended their courthouse hearings.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u1240\u1208 \u1308\u122d\u1263\u1363 \u1303\u12cb\u122d \u1218\u1200\u1218\u12f5 \u12a5\u1293 \u120c\u120e\u127d \u12e8\u12a6\u12a4\u134d\u1232 \u12a0\u1263\u120b\u1275 \u1260\u1303\u1295\u12cb\u122a 2021 \u12e8\u1228\u1305\u121d \u133e\u1273 \u12a5\u1295\u130d\u12f3 \u1208\u121d\u1295 \u1300\u1218\u1229?","answer_translated":"\u12e8\u1270\u1308\u1299\u1275\u1295 \u12f0\u130b\u134a\u12ce\u127b\u1278\u12cd\u1295 \u12a5\u1293 \u1264\u1270\u1230\u1266\u127b\u1278\u12cd\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1308\u1299\u1260\u1275 \u12e8\u127d\u120e\u1275 \u1235\u1265\u1230\u1263 \u120b\u12ed \u12a5\u12eb\u1230\u1229 \u12a5\u1293 \u12a5\u12eb\u1233\u12f0\u12f1 \u1218\u1206\u1291\u1295 \u1260\u121a\u12eb\u1218\u1208\u12ad\u1271 \u12d8\u1308\u1263\u12ce\u127d \u121d\u12ad\u1295\u12eb\u1275 \u12e8\u1228\u1305\u121d \u133e\u1273 \u12a5\u1295\u130d\u12f3 \u1300\u1218\u1229\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u1303\u1295\u12cb\u122a 2021 \u12e8\u1228\u1305\u121d \u133e\u1273 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1270 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12ed\u121d \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and repetitive, failing to provide a clear or accurate explanation for why the individuals mentioned started a hunger strike in January 2021.

{"year":"2021","month":"01","event_desc":"3 January  Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia agree to hold further talks this month to resolve their dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile.","text":"The three counties will hold more talks over disputed dam this month after previous negotiations failed to reach a deal. Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia agreed on Sunday to hold further talks this month to resolve their long-running dispute over the Addis Ababa\u2019s huge dam on the Blue Nile, Sudan\u2019s water ministry said. Previous three-way talks have failed to produce an agreement on the filling and operation of the vast reservoir behind the 145-metre (475-foot) tall Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a hydropower project which broke ground in 2011. On Sunday, the three countries held a new round of talks by video conference in the virtual presence of South African officials, as well as other international observers. South Africa currently holds the African Union\u2019s rotating chair. \u201cThe meeting concluded \u2026 that this week will be devoted to bilateral talks between the three countries, the experts, and the observers,\u201d Sudan\u2019s water ministry said in a statement. This week\u2019s talks will pave the way \u201cfor the resumption of tripartite negotiations on Sunday January 10 in the hope of concluding by the end of January\u201d, it noted. The negotiations have centred on the filling and operation of the giant dam. Key questions remain about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multiyear drought occurs and how the three countries will resolve any future disputes. Ethiopia has rejected binding arbitration at the final stage of the project.    Egypt, which depends on the Nile for about 97 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, fears Ethiopia\u2019s dam would severely cut its water share. Sudan \u2013 which boycotted talks in November, urging the African Union to play a greater role in reaching a deal \u2013 hopes the dam will help ameliorate flooding, but has also warned that millions of lives would be at \u201cgreat risk\u201d if no binding agreement was reached. Ethiopia says the hydroelectric power produced at the dam is vital to meet the power needs of its population and insists downstream countries\u2019 water supplies will not be affected. The Nile, the world\u2019s longest river, is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses. Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in the Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.

(AP Photo\/Nariman El-Mofty, File) NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 The United States says it has decided to \u201cde-link\u201d its suspension of millions of dollars of aid to Ethiopia from that country\u2019s dispute with Egypt over a massive hydroelectric dam project. But the State Department early Friday said that does not mean all the roughly $272 million in security and development assistance will immediately start to flow, and it depends on more recent \u201cdevelopments\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the deadly conflict in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region. The State Department said humanitarian assistance remains exempt from the aid suspension. It said it has informed Ethiopia\u2019s government. A spokeswoman for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ADVERTISEMENT Ethiopians were furious after former President Donald Trump last year directed the suspension of aid to their country in a rare example of his direct involvement in an African issue. Ethiopia had left a U.S.-led attempt to mediate the dispute with Egypt, alleging bias. Trump also caused an uproar by saying downstream Egypt would \u201cblow up\u201d the dam project that Cairo considers an existential threat. Ethiopia asserts that the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that it has nearly completed on the Blue Nile River is essential for development and the pulling of millions of people out of poverty. Egypt says it threatens its water supply. The State Department said the pause on aid \u201chas affected approximately $23 million in security assistance, as well as roughly $249 million in development assistance, which includes health, education, economic growth and democracy programs.\u201d Ethiopia is now under pressure from the U.S. and others including the European Union and United Nations over the deadly fighting in its northern Tigray region, where some 6 million people have been largely cut off from the world since fighting began in November between Ethiopian and allied forces and Tigray ones. Witness accounts have emerged of massacres, people beginning to starve to death and the presence of thousands of soldiers from neighboring Eritrea, which Ethiopia\u2019s government has denied. The U.S. has said Eritrean soldiers should \u201cimmediately\u201d leave Ethiopia. And earlier this week, a State Department spokesperson said \u201cwe remain gravely concerned by the widespread humanitarian suffering and reported human rights abuses in the Tigray region.\u201d The spokesperson urged \u201can immediate end to the fighting in Tigray, full and unhindered humanitarian access, an independent investigation into the human rights violations and abuses and for those responsible to be held accountable.\u201d ___ Matthew Lee in Washington contributed.

Read More By\u00a0\n            CARA ANNA Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 A trio of opposition parties in Ethiopia\u2019s embattled Tigray region estimates that more than 50,000 civilians have been killed in the three-month conflict, and they urge the international community to intervene before a \u201chumanitarian disaster of biblical proportion will become a gruesome reality.\u201d The statement posted Tuesday does not say where the estimate comes from, and the parties could not immediately be reached. Communication links remain challenging in much of the region, making it difficult to verify claims by any side. No official death toll has emerged since the fighting began in early November between Ethiopian and allied forces and those of the Tigray region who dominated the government for almost three decades before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018. Each side now views the other as illegitimate. The opposition parties say the international community should ensure the immediate withdrawal of fighters including soldiers from neighboring Eritrea, who witnesses say are supporting Ethiopian forces. The parties also urge an independent investigation into the conflict, dialogue, more humanitarian aid and media access to \u201ccover what is happening.\u201d Civilians throughout Tigray, a region of some 6 million people, have been dying from targeted attacks, crossfire, disease and lack of resources, according to witnesses. Even some of the new administrators appointed by Abiy\u2019s government have warned that people are dying of starvation as vast areas beyond main roads and towns still cannot be reached. The opposition parties assert that the hunger is man-made as cattle have been killed and raided, crops burned and homes looted and destroyed. The statement was signed by the Tigray Independence Party, the National Congress of Great Tigray and Salsay Weyane Tigray. Their statement accuses Ethiopia\u2019s government of \u201cusing hunger as a weapon to subdue Tigray since it has been obstructing international efforts for humanitarian assistance.\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s government, however, has asserted that aid is being delivered and nearly 1.5 million people have been reached. The United Nations and others have pressed for more humanitarian access and a solution to a complicated system of clearances with a variety of authorities, including ones on the ground. \u201cIn 40 years (as) a humanitarian, I\u2019ve rarely seen an aid response so impeded,\u201d the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, tweeted on Monday. U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi after a visit to Tigray told reporters on Monday that the situation is \u201cextremely grave.\u201d He said his team had heard a \u201cvery strong appeal\u201d from appointed authorities in Tigray and Ethiopian ministries for more international help, and he pointed out that the U.N. works in \u201cnorthern Syria, in Yemen, in areas of high insecurity.\u201d The Tigray region hosted 96,000 refugees from Eritrea before the fighting, and Grandi said he had spoken to some who were caught in the crossfire and then resorted to \u201ceating leaves\u201d after being cut off from support for several weeks. Others were forcibly returned to Eritrea by Eritrean forces, he said. It was not clear how many. Two of the refugees\u2019 four camps remain inaccessible, and \u201cmost likely there is no refugee presence here anymore,\u201d he said. Citing satellite imagery, the U.K.-based DX Open Network nonprofit this week reported further destruction at the Hitsats and Shimelba camps in recent weeks by unnamed armed groups, with humanitarian facilities among those targeted. Up to 20,000 of the refugees have been \u201cdispersed\u201d into areas where humanitarian workers don\u2019t have access, Grandi said. The U.N. refugee chief also called for an independent, transparent investigation into alleged abuses. \u201cThe situation is very complex,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a lot of crossfire, a lot of violations on all sides,\u201d including Tigray-allied fighters. Pressure continued Tuesday as Germany said Chancellor Angela Merkel in a phone call with Abiy \u201cunderscored the significance of a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Tigray region and of humanitarian supplies to the people affected.\u201d Merkel added that \u201chumanitarian aid organizations and media must be granted free access.\u201d U.N.

REUTERS\/Tiksa Negeri Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab NAIROBI (Reuters) - Forces fighting Ethiopia's military in the Tigray region laid out eight conditions on Friday for beginning peace talks, including the appointment of an international mediator and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered air strikes and a ground offensive against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - the former ruling party in the northern region - after regional forces attacked federal army bases in the region on Nov. 4. Abiy declared victory less than a month later after the TPLF withdrew from the regional capital, Mekelle, and major towns, but low-level fighting continues. Some senior TPLF members remain at large, though the federal government has captured or killed a number of former officials. TPLF spokeswoman Liya Kassa outlined the group's preconditions for joining talks to end the conflict in a statement on the Facebook page of Dimtsi Weyane TV, a station owned by the former ruling party. Abiy's spokeswoman and the head of the government's taskforce on Tigray did not respond to requests for comment. During the height of the conflict in November, the government said it would not negotiate until its efforts to restore the rule of law were complete. After declaring victory later that month, it has said it is focused on apprehending senior TPLF members who remain at large. Among the points made by the TPLF was a demand that Eritrea withdraw its forces from Tigray. Accusations of an Eritrean military presence are one of the most contentious issues in the conflict. Eritrea and Ethiopia have both previously denied that Eritrean troops operated on Ethiopian territory. Dozens of eyewitnesses have said they have seen Eritrean troops. The TPLF also called for the removal of the interim administration appointed by the federal government as fighting raged in November. It said the officials elected in September in a regional vote that Abiy's government called illegal should be allowed to return. In the region of more than five million people, thousands of people are believed to have died and 950,000 have fled their homes since fighting began. Verifying details of the situation has been difficult because communications to Tigray remain difficult and the government tightly controls access.

Tigray has been the theatre of fighting since early November 2020, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced military operations against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), accusing them of attacking federal army camps. The area was an information black hole for much of that time, with reporting heavily restricted and the internet cut off. Seven international media organisations -- including AFP, the BBC and the Financial Times -- have now been granted accreditation to report from Tigray, but journalists were warned by officials they might face unspecified \"corrective measures\" if they did not meet local standards. Fitsum Berhane and Alula Akalu, who were working as translators for journalists from AFP and the Financial Times, were detained on Saturday, their families said. A third man, a journalist named Temrat Yemane, was also arrested in Mekele, the Tigrayan capital. Late Monday the BBC also said one of its journalists, Girmay Gebru, had been detained by the military in Mekele. Fitsum and Alula are being held at a military college near Mekele University, their families told AFP. Relatives have not been able to see them and no explanation has been given for the arrests. \"They are under investigation. The information we have is that there is already some evidence,\" said Mulu Nega, the leader of the interim administration in Tigray which was appointed by Addis Ababa. Asked what the investigation was about and what the evidence was he said: \"There is no detailed information.\" AFP's global news director Phil Chetwynd called for Fitsum's immediate release. \"We have not been informed of any specific charges against Fitsum Berhane. His collaboration with a media outlet should not be a motive for his arrest,\" he said. The Financial Times said it was taking \"all possible steps\" to secure the release of the translators. \"Our concerns have been raised with the relevant authorities as we work to understand the reasons for the arrests.\" The BBC said it had expressed its \"concern to the Ethiopian authorities\" and was awaiting their response. Media freedom group the Committee to Protect Journalists said the detentions could send a chill through the reporting community. \"The Ethiopian military's arrests of journalists and media workers will undoubtedly lead to fear and self-censorship,\" the group said Monday. \"Ethiopian authorities should release these journalists and media workers immediately and provide guarantees that the press can cover the conflict in Tigray without intimidation.\" The Barron's news department was not involved in the creation of the content above.

{"year":"2021","month":"03","event_desc":"The four media workers in the Tigray Region are freed.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Four media workers freed after being held in Ethiopia Addis Ababa (AFP) \u2013 Issued on: 03\/03\/2021 - 11:22 Modified: 03\/03\/2021 - 11:21 Four media workers recently arrested in Ethiopia's conflict-hit Tigray region were freed Wednesday, said a translator working for AFP who was part of the group held. \"They let us out today. They didn't say anything about why they let us go. But they said they have decided to free us,\" said the translator, Fitsum Berhane. Fitsum and Alula Akalu, a translator working for Britain's Financial Times newspaper, were arrested Saturday after three days of reporting on the conflict in Tigray. The other two detainees were BBC journalist Girmay Gebru and Temrat Yemane, a local journalist. Officials have not given any reason for the arrests and did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday about the decision to free the men. Both AFP and the Financial Times had obtained permission from the Ethiopian Broadcasting Authority and the Ministry of Peace to work in Tigray, where media access has been tightly restricted since hostilities began in November. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize winner, has said the military campaign is targeting leaders of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the region's longtime ruling party. But while Abiy said in late November that military operations were \"completed\" after federal troops entered the regional capital Mekele, top TPLF officials remain on the run and fighting has continued. Meanwhile global concern is mounting amid reports of atrocities against civilians and fears of a spiralling humanitarian catastrophe. The United States voiced concern Tuesday over the arrests of the four media workers, saying the move was inconsistent with the government's commitment to allow international press to operate in Tigray. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said authorities should \"bring credible charges or release\" them. - Arrested at gunpoint - In a telephone interview with AFP on Wednesday, Fitsum described how soldiers barged into his home at around 1.00 am Saturday, accusing him of supporting the TPLF and possessing an unregistered satellite phone. \"They were saying a lot of things about how I am a member of the TPLF and have been helping the party since the war started and giving them information,\" he said. \"But I denied all because I don't know what they are talking about.\" An officer in plainclothes who had entered with the soldiers held a gun to his head as soldiers searched the home, Fitsum said. They seized his cellphones, a laptop and a power bank, as well as 3,800 Ethiopian birr (around $95), he said. So far only the money has been returned, he said. The soldiers then transported Fitsum to a military college near Mekele University, but stopped at one point in the middle of the road on the way, he said. \"They took me down from the car. They said, 'Now you are going to tell us where you put the satellite phone,'\" Fitsum recalled. \"One of them said, 'I can kill you and make up a story about how you weren't respecting'\" the evening curfew currently in effect in Mekele, he said. Eventually they got back in the vehicle, and Fitsum spent the next two nights at the military college, sleeping in a cell alone while handcuffed. By Monday night the handcuffs were removed, and on Tuesday Fitsum and the other media workers were transferred to a prison in Mekele. The day before his arrest, Fitsum had accompanied a team of AFP journalists to the Tigray town of Dengolat to report on a massacre there. Some of the soldiers called him a traitor for working with foreign media and accused him of \"setting up\" the story, he said. \"They said I betrayed my country for a little money,\" he said. \"I said I was only translating. I didn't fix any of the moments. I said everything is recorded and you can check it.\" \u00a9 2021 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The minister, Filsan Abdullahi Ahmed, issued the statement late Thursday after a task force visited Tigray to investigate accounts of sexual assault in a region of some 6 million people that remains largely cut off from the world. \u201cWe await the investigation of these horrible crimes,\u201d the minister said, adding that a team from the attorney general\u2019s office is processing the information. She did not say how many rape accounts the task force members collected or what parts of the Tigray region they visited. ADVERTISEMENT A spokesman for the attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately respond to questions. The minister\u2019s statement came hours after the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission in a new report said 108 rapes had been reported to health facilities in the past two months in the Tigray capital, Mekele, and the communities of Adigrat, Wukro and Ayder. \u201cLocal structures such as police and health facilities where victims of sexual violence would normally turn to report such crimes are no longer in place,\u201d the report said. \u201cHence, there is a possibility that the actual number of cases might be higher and more widespread than the reported cases.\u201d Several witnesses have told The Associated Press about alleged rapes by Ethiopian soldiers or those from neighboring Eritrea, an enemy of the fugitive Tigray leaders and whose presence Ethiopia\u2019s government denies. Last month the United Nations special representative on sexual violence in conflict said \u201cserious allegations of sexual violence\u201d had emerged in Tigray, while women and girls face shortages of rape kits and HIV drugs amid restrictions on humanitarian access. \u201cThere are also disturbing reports of individuals allegedly forced to rape members of their own family, under threats of imminent violence,\u201d Pramila Patten said in the U.N. statement. \u201cSome women have also reportedly been forced by military elements to have sex in exchange for basic commodities, while medical centers have indicated an increase in the demand for emergency contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections.\u201d AP NEWS Top Stories Video Contact Us Cookie Settings Download AP NEWS Connect with the definitive source for global and local news More from AP ap.org AP Insights AP Definitive Source AP Images Spotlight AP Explore AP Books Follow AP The Associated Press About Contact Customer Support Careers Terms & Conditions Privacy All contents \u00a9 copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

The statement by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s office comes days after Ethiopia referred to the killings in Axum as an \u201calleged incident,\u201d and the country\u2019s ambassador to Belgium told a webinar that \u201cwe suspect it\u2019s a very, very crazy idea.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT A growing number of media reports are documenting massacres in other Tigray communities, citing witness accounts, as alarm grows over the fate of the region\u2019s 6 million people. And international pressure is growing on Africa\u2019s second most populous country to allow independent investigations into atrocities committed during the conflict that began in November between Ethiopian and allied forces and those of the now-fugitive Tigray leaders who dominated Ethiopia\u2019s government before Abiy took office in 2018. Some of those allied forces are from neighboring Eritrea, one of the world\u2019s most secretive countries and long an enemy of the former Tigray leaders. Ethiopia\u2019s government denies their presence, even as some of the government-appointed interim Tigray leaders acknowledge it and several witnesses have described the soldiers\u2019 killing and looting. The United States has repeatedly called for Eritrean forces to leave Tigray immediately. In Washington\u2019s strongest statement yet on Tigray, Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the weekend said the U.S. is \u201cgravely concerned by reported atrocities and the overall deteriorating situation.\u201d Ethiopia replied that no foreign country should try to \u201cdictate a sovereign nation\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d The massacre in Axum in late November might be the deadliest of the Tigray conflict, with witnesses saying Eritrean forces killed several hundred people. The AP spoke with a church deacon who said he helped count the bodies, gathered victims\u2019 identity cards and assisted with burials. He believes some 800 people were killed that weekend around the city. ADVERTISEMENT The government-established Ethiopian Human Rights Commission is investigating allegations from Axum and elsewhere, and it has \u201csignaled its willingness to collaborate with relevant U.N. agencies,\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s new statement said. The United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet last week said the office is ready to support the EHRC if its monitors are granted access to the Tigray region. Journalists also have pressed for access to Tigray, but in recent days several Ethiopians working with foreign media outlets were detained shortly after the outlets were allowed to enter.

Demetrius Freeman\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is sending Senator Chris Coons to Ethiopia to meet with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and convey Biden's \"grave concerns\" over the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region, where thousands have died following fighting. Washington also said it will provide nearly $52 million more in aid to address the humanitarian crisis in the region, but called for hostilities to end and human rights abusers to be held accountable. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces, an end to the Ethiopian government's deployment of regional forces in Tigray and increased humanitarian access. \"The humanitarian situation will continue to worsen without a political solution,\" Blinken said in a statement. Fighting between government troops and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million. The United Nations has raised concerns about atrocities being committed in Tigray, while Blinken has described acts carried out in the region as ethnic cleansing. Ethiopia has rejected Blinken's allegation. \"(The accusation) is a completely unfounded and spurious verdict against the Ethiopian government,\" Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry said on March 13, reacting to the allegation of ethnic cleansing. \"Nothing during or after the end of the main law enforcement operation in Tigray can be identified or defined by any standards as a targeted, intentional ethnic cleansing against anyone in the region,\" it said. \"The Ethiopian government vehemently opposes such accusations.\" Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that Coons - a longtime Biden ally who represents the president's home state of Delaware - would also consult with the African Union. \"Senator Coons will convey President Biden's grave concerns about the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses in the Tigray region and the risk of broader instability in the Horn of Africa,\" Sullivan said. The senator serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on Africa and global health policy. Officials in the prime minister's office and at the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Coons said he looked forward to engaging with Abiy and conveying Biden's concern. \"The United States is gravely concerned by the deteriorating situation in the Tigray, which threatens the peace and stability of the Horn of Africa region,\" Coons said in a statement. Ethiopia's federal army ousted the TPLF from the Tigray capital Mekelle in November, after what it said was a surprise assault on its forces in the region bordering Eritrea. The government has said most fighting has ceased but acknowledged there are still isolated incidents of shooting. Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied the involvement of Eritrean troops in the fighting, although dozens of witnesses, diplomats and an Ethiopian general have reported their presence.

Berhane Kidanemariam, the deputy chief of mission at the Ethiopian embassy in Washington, in a strong statement issued on Wednesday slammed Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as a reckless leader who is dividing his country. Kidanemariam is believed to be the first Ethiopian diplomat to resign over concerns relating to the conflict in Tigray. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWith the emergence of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, I, like many other Ethiopians, had big hopes for genuine reforms that could transform our political environment,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, instead of fulfilling his initial promise, he has led Ethiopia down a dark path toward destruction and disintegration. Like so many others who thought the Prime Minister had the potential to lead Ethiopia to a bright future, I am filled with despair and anguish at the direction he is taking our country.\u201d It was not immediately possible to get comment from Ethiopian authorities. The conduct of federal forces and their allies in the Tigray conflict \u2014 including fighters allegedly imported from neighboring Eritrea \u2014 has come under increasing scrutiny amid reports of massacres, rapes and other crimes. After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Abiy to end hostilities and spoke with him earlier this month, the prime minister\u2019s office reversed its skeptical stance on a reported massacre in the holy city of Axum and said it was investigating \u201ccredible allegations\u201d there and elsewhere in the region. The U.S. also has said it wants the Eritreans and troops from the neighboring Amhara region to leave Tigray immediately. Human rights groups and others are calling for independent investigations, ideally led by the United Nations. The resignation of a senior diplomat will pile pressure on Abiy, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to make peace with Eritrea after decades of hostilities. Kidanemariam, who is from Tigray, said in his statement that thousands of ethnic Tigrayans have been harassed, assaulted, and arrested in what he called \u201ca witch-hunt that is taking place against Tigrayans in Ethiopia and in the diaspora.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT He added that Abiy \u201chas deliberately exacerbated hatred between different groups\u201d by deploying outside troops in Tigray. Accounts of atrocities by Ethiopian and allied forces against residents of Tigray have been detailed in reports by The Associated Press and by Amnesty International . Ethiopia\u2019s federal government and regional officials in Tigray both maintain that each other\u2019s governments are illegitimate after the pandemic disrupted elections. The conflict began in November when Abiy sent government troops to Tigray after an attack there on federal military facilities. No one knows how many thousands of civilians have been killed. Humanitarian officials have warned that a growing number of people might be starving to death in Tigray. The fighting, which is ongoing in parts of Tigray, erupted on the brink of harvest in the largely agricultural region and sent an untold number of people fleeing their homes. Witnesses have described widespread looting by Eritrean soldiers as well as the burning of crops. Kidanemariam suggested in his statement that there was no doubt atrocities have been committed in Tigray. \u201cWhile all of this is happening,\u201d his statement said, \u201cthe Ethiopian government is intensifying its campaign of lies and deceit by denying the presence of foreign powers, denying atrocities being committed against the people of Tigray, denying all the crimes it is responsible for while the whole world bears witness.\u201d AP NEWS Top Stories Video Contact Us Cookie Settings Download AP NEWS Connect with the definitive source for global and local news More from AP ap.org AP Insights AP Definitive Source AP Images Spotlight AP Explore AP Books Follow AP The Associated Press About Contact Customer Support Careers Terms & Conditions Privacy All contents \u00a9 copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

Abiy, the winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, ordered a ground and air offensive campaign in Tigray in November 2020 after blaming the region\u2019s governing party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), for attacks on federal army camps. He declared the fighting over in late November with the capture of Mekelle, but it has continued. The exact death toll in the conflict remains unclear, but thousands of people are believed to have been killed. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Residents of Tigray, home to more than five million people, have described massacres , widespread sexual violence and indiscriminate killings of civilians. After months of denials, Abiy admitted on Tuesday that forces from neighbouring Eritrea were in Tigray and conceded that atrocities had been committed. \u201cBattle is destructive, it hurts many, there is no question about it. There have been damages that happened in Tigray region,\u201d he said. Abiy said soldiers who raped women or committed other war crimes will be held responsible, even though he cited \u201cpropaganda of exaggeration\u201d by the TPLF. The prime minister accused the TPLF\u2019s leaders of drumming \u201ca war narrative\u201d while the area faced challenges such as a destructive invasion of locusts and the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThis was misplaced and untimely arrogance,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission corroborated reports by rights groups that a massacre had taken place in Axum in November, saying more than 100 people had been killed by Eritrean troops.

Tigray has been the theatre of fighting since early November 2020, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced military operations against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), accusing them of attacking federal army camps. He declared victory after pro-government troops took regional capital Mekele in late November, though the TPLF vowed to fight on, and clashes have persisted in the region, hampering efforts to deliver sorely-needed humanitarian assistance. In a press statement, the state utility firm Ethiopia Electricity Power (EEP) said TPLF\u00a0\"remnants\" had attacked a high-voltage line carrying electricity to Mekele, \"causing total electricity blackout in the region\". The statement didn't mention the date of the alleged attack, however a resident of Mekele told AFP the power had gone out on Tuesday evening. The resident said fear was growing in the capital of an offensive by the TPLF, with security forces reportedly digging trenches on the outskirts of the city. He said tension was high, with red and yellow flags associated with the TPLF and red and yellow balloons cropping up around the city in recent days. TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda on Tuesday gave an interview to a US-based television station, denying they were planning an imminent offensive. \"Currently, we're not in a hurry to free our cities. The cities are our own. We will do the utmost effort to ensure our cities can't be centres of destruction,\" Getachew told the Tigrai Media House (TMH). Separately on Wednesday, The Tigray council of religious institutions -- representing Ethiopian Orthodox, Catholic, Islamic and evangelical churches -- issued a statement calling for the withdrawal of forces from Eritrea and neighbouring Amhara regional state from the region. Eritrea and Ethiopia deny that Eritrean soldiers are involved in the Tigray conflict. But their presence has been described by residents, aid workers and even some civilian and military officials in Tigray. \"The Ethiopian federal government should force the Eritrean and Amhara region security forces to leave the Tigray region. These two forces have committed widespread rapes, looting, killings as well as engaged in the destruction of infrastructure and religious sites,\" the statement said. It also condemned the partial destruction of al-Nejashi Mosque, one of the oldest mosques on the continent, and referred to alleged damage to Debre-Damo, one of the region's famed clifftop monasteries, believed to date back to the sixth century. Tigray has been cut off from the internet since the start of the conflict. The United Nations' humanitarian agency OCHA said last week that \"much of the rural areas, where 80 percent of the population lived prior to the conflict, remain cut off from humanitarian assistance.\" The Barron's news department was not involved in the creation of the content above.

The facilities were \"deliberately\" attacked to make them \"non-functional\", M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said. The situation was having a \"devastating\" impact on the population, the organisation said in a statement . The Ethiopian authorities say most health services have been restored. Conflict erupted in Tigray on 4 November 2020 when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered an offensive to oust the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), after its fighters had captured federal military bases in the region. Fighting continues despite Mr Abiy declaring victory at the end of November. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent Medics on the run: 'I hid in the woods to flee shooting' How a massacre in Ethiopia\u2019s sacred city unfolded The situation in Tigray \"remains extremely concerning\" and the conflict continues to displace people, the UN's humanitarian affairs agency (OCHA) said last week. It added that although aid workers had now been able to access some parts of the region, \"many people remain in hard-to-reach areas due to insecurity, logistical and administrative hurdles\". Why Sudan is a \"second home\" to these Ethiopian refugees Hundreds of civilians have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in the last five months, a situation that has sparked condemnation around the world. Last month Amnesty International accused troops from neighbouring Eritrea of killing hundreds of people in the ancient city of Aksum on 28 and 29 November, saying the mass killings may amount to a crime against humanity. What is the state of health centres in Tigray? Only 13% of 106 facilities that teams from MSF visited between December and early March were operating normally. They also found destroyed equipment, smashed doors and windows, and medicine and patient files scattered across floors in health centres in Debre Abay and May Kuhli in north-western Tigray. On a visit to a hospital in the central city of Adwa it found medical equipment, including ultrasound machines and monitors, had been deliberately smashed. MSF Tigray's medical system has almost collapsed, MSF warned A hospital in the town of Semema had been set on fire while a delivery room at Sebeya was destroyed after the facility was hit by rocket, MSF reported. Looting of health facilities still continues, the organisation said. The Ethiopian embassy in London told the BBC in a statement that 75% of hospitals in Tigray were now operational and 10% were operating partially. It added that 90% of healthcare workers were providing the required health services and that it had rolled out a Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the region. Who is to blame? MSF did not directly name perpetrators but called on \"armed groups in the conflict\" to respect and protect health facilities and medical staff. It accused Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers of occupying some hospitals. Both government have denied that Eritrean troops went into Tigray despite persistent reports. More on the Tigray conflict: The Nobel Peace Prize winner who sent his troops to battle 'I lost my hand when a soldier tried to rape me' From Ethiopia to Yemen, the dilemma of declaring a famine \"The army used Abiy Addi hospital [in central Tigray] as a military base and to stabilise their injured soldiers,\" says MSF emergency coordinator Kate Nolan. \"During that time it was not accessible to the general population. They had to go the town's health centre, which was not equipped to provide secondary medical care - they can't do blood transfusions, for example, or treat gunshot wounds,\" she added. MSF also accused Eritrean soldiers of using a health facility in Mugulat in east Tigray as their base. It also accused the armed groups of seizing ambulances. But Ethiopian authorities blame TPLF fighters for the damage to health infrastructure. What has been the impact? Tigray used to have one of the best health systems in Ethiopia, with a network of health posts in villages, health centres and hospitals in towns, but the conflict \"has almost completely collapsed\" the system, according to MSF. In the past four months children have gone unvaccinated making them vulnerable to infectious diseases in the future, the charity said. Pregnant women, patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and HIV, as well as psychiatric patients, are going without life-saving drugs, it added. \"Health facilities need to be rehabilitated and receive more supplies and ambulances, and staff need to receive salaries and the opportunity to work in a safe environment,\" said MSF general director Oliver Behn. The Ethiopian embassy in London said MSF's assessment failed to acknowledge the government's efforts to fix the infrastructure and restore the health sector, \"which is rapidly resuming service\".

{"year":"2021","month":"03","event_desc":"11 March  Amhara Region spokesperson Gizachew Muluneh denies that its forces are engaged in ethnic cleansing in the Western Zone of Tigray Region, one day after United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken uses the phrase in tesimony.","text":"FROM AFP NEWS Ethiopia's Amhara Region Rejects Charge Of 'Ethnic Cleansing' In Tigray By Robbie COREY-BOULET March 11, 2021 Order Reprints Print Article Text size Ethiopia's Amhara region denied Thursday that its forces were engaged in \"ethnic cleansing\" in conflict-hit Tigray, one day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken used the phrase in public testimony. Earlier this week, Tigrayan officials accused forces from neighbouring Amhara of kicking thousands of people off land in western Tigray -- a part of the region that ethnic Amharas claim rightfully belongs to them. Appearing before Congress Wednesday, Blinken said \"acts of ethnic cleansing\" had been committed in western Tigray, calling for them to \"stop\" and for \"full accountability\". In an interview with AFP Thursday, Amhara spokesman Gizachew Muluneh dismissed reports of ethnic cleansing and large-scale displacement as \"propaganda\". \"A few Tigrayans may be displaced, a few in number,\" he said. Gizachew also said Blinken's call for Amhara forces to leave Tigray was misguided, claiming the territory where these forces were present would actually be considered part of Amhara from now on. \"There are not any Amhara forces in Tigray region. These areas are not Tigrayan areas, in history,\" Gizachew said. \"If the Secretary [Blinken] is talking about these areas, these areas are not Tigrayan. Our forces are not in the Tigrayan areas, rather our forces are in Amhara region. That is our response.\" Ethiopia is made up of 10 semi-autonomous federal states organised along ethnic lines, and ethnic violence has soared in recent years. Disputed land Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military campaign in Tigray in November after blaming the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), for attacks on army camps. Abiy, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, leaned on forces from Amhara to secure western and southern Tigray once the TPLF retreated from those areas, and Amhara officials set up transitional administrations in multiple cities and towns. It was a sensitive move, given that many ethnic Amharas believe the once-dominant TPLF illegally incorporated the fertile territories after it came to power in the early 1990s -- and that they should fall under Amhara administration. Blinken's remarks Wednesday confirmed the substance of a New York Times report last month that said that an internal US government report determined there was \"ethnic cleansing\" in western Tigray. The report, according to the newspaper, said entire villages had disappeared in an effort to make western Tigray \"ethnically homogeneous through the organized use of force and intimidation.\" Abiy's government has not announced any formal decision on whether western and southern Tigray would be annexed by Amhara. His office on Thursday referred questions to the foreign ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. Fighting continues Abiy declared victory in Tigray in late November after federal forces entered the regional capital Mekele, but TPLF leaders remain on the run and fighting has continued. While Abiy's government says life is returning to normal in much of the region, UN officials fear for a humanitarian catastrophe and estimate that 4.5 million people need assistance. Blinken on Wednesday reiterated Washington's call for the withdrawal of troops from neighbouring Eritrea from Tigray. The Eritreans stand accused of multiple massacres and widespread acts of sexual violence, though Addis Ababa and Asmara officially deny they are present in Tigray at all. A statement from the ousted Tigray government, posted Thursday on Twitter by TPLF senior official Getachew Reda, praised the administration of US President Joe Biden \"for their principled position against war crimes and all forms of impunity\". It also said pro-TPLF forces would keep up their fight \"until such time that our people are fully liberated from occupation.\" The Barron's news department was not involved in the creation of the content above.

Federal forces as well as Amhara regional troops were involved in fighting Tigray rebels on three fronts, an Amhara official told the BBC. This is despite the government saying a unilateral ceasefire declared last month had not been suspended. All sides have accused each other of escalating the conflict. The situation has intensified since the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) rebels recaptured much of Tigray in a spectacular offensive against the national army in June. Authorities around the country have been mobilising to join the fight, with rallies being held nationwide to encourage people to enlist. Food supplies in Tigray - where an estimated 400,000 people are living in famine conditions - will run out on Friday, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) has warned . All roads into Tigray from the Amhara region - which lies to the west and south of the war-torn northern state - remained closed, the WFP said. The only aid route through the Afar region, which borders Tigray to the east, became inaccessible last week following an attack on a WFP convoy. The state broadcaster says the army and its allies have \"annihilated\" a rebel division in battles over the last week in Afar. There is no independent confirmation of this claim. Some WFP aid trucks in Afar have set off to try to get to Tigray, where the UN is calling for basic services like electricity to be restored. The Tigray rebels have been calling for a negotiated truce, with conditions including the complete withdrawal of Eritrean troops who have been fighting alongside Ethiopian forces since November. The TPLF was Tigray's governing party until it was ousted by the national army in November. It has been designated a terrorist organisation by the Ethiopian government. But the rebels say they are the legitimate regional government of Tigray. It fell out with the prime minister over his political reforms, though the TPLF's capture of federal military bases in Tigray was the catalyst for the invasion.

{"year":"2021","month":"06","event_desc":"8 June  Ethiopia begins filling the Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD).","text":"Egypt Fumes as Ethiopia Plans Second Filling of Nile Dam M. Gerth-Niculescu\/Deutsche Welle A view of a wall of Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam. 8 June 2021 The Nation (Nairobi) By Tesfa-Alem Tekle Ethiopian authorities say they are ready to start the second filling of the Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD), despite warnings from Egypt over the Blue Nile project. The second filling was scheduled for June, and it came nearly two months after talks between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt failed to reach a solution on what to do about Africa's largest dam. Ethiopia is determined to march forward with opening GERD, which the Horn state sees as a pathway to providing greater access to electricity in the country and a prosperous future, but which Egypt fears will lead to chronic water shortages downstream. Egypt relies on the Nile's waters for agriculture and has previously indicated that it will do whatever is necessary to protect its rights to it. After Ethiopia filled the dam last year, Sudan's Irrigation and Water Resources Ministry raised alarm over declining water levels on the river. Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been locked in talks for nearly a decade over the dam, after Addis Ababa broke ground on the project in 2011. Shuttle diplomacy Now, as the latest tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia mount, Cairo is renewing its shuttle diplomacy with East African countries, seeking to stop Addis. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's visit to Djibouti last week on Thursday is seen as part of Cairo's new diplomatic attempts to forge more alliances with Ethiopia's neighbours. Al-Sisi became the first Egyptian president to visit Djibouti since the tiny Red Sea nation gained independence in 1977. A dispatch from Djibouti indicated that Al-Sissi and Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guelleh agreed that the Ethiopian dam should be filled and operated according to \"a fair and binding legal agreement\" in order to maintain regional stability and preserve the interests of all parties. \"I stressed Egypt's opposition to any attempt to impose a [different] reality on the ground through unilateral decisions that do not consider the interests and rights of the river's two downstream countries,\" said the Egyptian president in a joint news conference in Djibouti. Ethiopia's deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen told local media that \"Egypt and Sudan are attempting to exert unnecessary pressure on Ethiopia through different means including the internationalisation and politicisation of technical issues which will only undermine trust among the three countries.\" He further reiterated that the second filling of GERD will continue according to schedule. More dams? Tension between the two countries reached a higher point on Sunday when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced that Ethiopia will build more than 100 small and medium-sized dams in different parts of the country. \"The country is scheduled to build more than 100 small and medium dams in several regions of the country as part of the budget plan for the next Ethiopian year,\" he said. \"Working hand in hand is the only way to resist any forces against Ethiopia,\" he added. PM Abiy, however, didn't mention if building more dams along the Nile River is part of his ambitious plan. In response, Egypt on Monday denounced the prime minister's plan to build dams, saying the statement was a continuation of \"a regrettable approach\" that disregards international law. Metta-Alem Sinishaw, a senior political analyst and researcher on Ethiopia and the East African region, told Nation.Africa that Ethiopia's declared intention to build 100 small and medium-size dams across the country was a likely strategy to fight back Egyptian influence. \"It sounds more like a counter-offensive against growing Egyptian military penetration in the Horn that could isolate Ethiopia, especially through military alliances with Sudan and the broader East African region,\" he said. 'A mockery' The perception in Addis Ababa is that the Ethiopian government was only bluffing about putting up more dams. \"Abiy's remark is a mockery to the more than 100 million Ethiopians,\" said Melaku Enshaw, a shoe shiner in Addis Ababa. \"Let alone building 100 dams. We are witnessing how the country is having difficulty completing GERD.\" Students outside Unity University told Nation.Africa that PM Abiy's announcement is only part of his spat with Egypt to leverage bargaining power in the ongoing tripartite negotiations between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. Other players in the country reckon that it is a part of PM Abiy's propaganda tactics in the run-up to national elections due to be held June 21. The leader of Egypt's main opposition party, Salvation Front, reportedly said recently: \"We must destroy the Ethiopian Dam before Ethiopia starts the second filling.\" He argued that \"if we fail to do this, Egypt will face the greatest defeat in history.\" As well as new military cooperation agreements with east African countries, Egypt has also started military exercises. On Monday, members of the Sudanese and Egyptian armed forces concluded a joint military exercise that took place over six days in Sudan. Fears of war There are growing fears that the ongoing row between the two Nile basin countries could lead to a potential war. Metta-Alem, however, says that a military confrontation between Ethiopia and Egypt is unlikely, even though it may weaken Ethiopia's own alliances.

As the Egypt-Sudan regional ambition projects military influence in Kenya, Djibouti, Uganda... etc. and elsewhere in East Africa.\" \"The Ethio-Eritrean partnership will emerge a formidable challenger in the Horn region in which global powers and regional actors will intervene to prevent a full-fledged war that could adversely affect the Red Sea shipping lanes,\" he added. Some are asking whether the water dispute will eventually affect Ethiopia's diplomatic ties with neighbouring countries and how it could affect regional peace and security \"Ethiopia's relations with its neighbours will be determined by the degree to which Abiy builds internal political harmony since the disintegration of the ethno-nationalist camp,\" said Metta-Alem. The growing tension between the Ethiopian-Eritrean convergence and the Egypt-Sudan alliance will also play a significant role, he added, referring to a collaboration between Ethiopian and Eritrean forces in Tigray. \"Although it is too early to state which direction Ethiopia will lean, increasing pressure from the West and their continued support for the Egyptian side will only push Ethiopia to the edge, (worsen) stability in the Red Sea and increase ... Horn proxy confrontations among powers,\" Metta-Alem stated. Read the original article on Nation .

Photograph:  Finbarr O\u2019Reilly\/The New York Times A column of triumphant fighters paraded into the city just after dawn on Tuesday, led by a woman in camouflage who brandished a Kalashnikov and the flag of the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , while people poured onto the streets to welcome them \u2013 cheering, weeping with relief and chanting \u201cVictory is ours!\u201d It had been eight months since the government of Ethiopia mounted an offensive in the country\u2019s Tigray region, unleashing civil war, atrocities and famine in Africa\u2019s second most populous country, and creating what is now one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. More than 1.7 million people have been displaced, and as many as 900,000 are suffering from famine, according to US officials. But on Monday, Ethiopian troops suddenly withdrew from Mekelle, the capital city of Tigray, as well as other towns in the region, ahead of advancing Tigrayan fighters. The fall of Mekelle signalled a turning point in a war that has plunged Ethiopia into chaos and threatened to destabilise the wider Horn of Africa region. It was also a stunning blow to the authority of the country\u2019s leader, Abiy Ahmed, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 and a year later gambled his power and reputation on what he said would be a brief, decisive campaign to bring the restive Tigray region under control. When he took office just three years ago, Abiy promised to unite his fractured country. Now he is left reeling from a seismic military loss to Tigrayan leaders he has derided as a \u201ccriminal clique\u201d. With Tigrayan forces on the offensive and ethnic conflicts flaring in other parts of Ethiopia, the very fabric binding his ancient country lies in tatters. A girls hands out food to Tigray Defence Forces fighters in Mekelle. Photograph: Finbarr O\u2019Reilly\/The New York Times From the outset, the war threatened to upend countries in the Horn of Africa: Eritrea , Ethiopia\u2019s neighbour to the north, joined forces with Abiy\u2019s government and sent troops into Tigray; Tigrayan refugees streamed into Sudan , to the west; Ethiopia drew down its peacekeeping forces in Somalia , to the east; and ethnic Amhara militias from within Ethiopia attacked Tigray from the south. Wider conflict The spectre of a wider conflict grew significantly on Tuesday, as Tigrayan leaders threatened to take the war against the invading forces into neighbouring Eritrea and the Amhara region of Ethiopia. \u201cWe want to degrade as many enemy capabilities as possible,\u201d Getachew Reda , a spokesman for the Tigrayan leadership, said that even if that requires going all the way to the Eritrean capital, Asmara . The Ethiopian government has said it withdrew its forces voluntarily, for humanitarian reasons, as part of a unilateral ceasefire declared on Monday, but the military had steadily lost ground in recent days to fighters from Tigray, now calling themselves the Tigray Defence Forces. Getachew accused the Ethiopian troops, on their retreat, of robbing banks, looting and cutting off electricity and telecommunications. He said that Tigrayan leaders would consider a ceasefire and negotiate with Abiy\u2019s government only if services were restored and Tigrayan territory returned. \u201cYou cannot cut off electricity and services and expect to make peace,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot expect to make peace while you are robbing our banks.\u201d As Tigrayan fighters filed through Mekelle on Tuesday, jubilant young men jogging alongside them shouted, \u201cThe Woyane have won!\u201d using a term for revolutionaries. The massacres, ethnic cleansing, mass rape and famine that have accompanied the war have not only shredded Abiy\u2019s reputation as a peacemaker \u2013 he won the Nobel for ending Ethiopia\u2019s long conflict with Eritrea \u2013 but also sowed the seeds of this week\u2019s setbacks by uniting Tigrayans against a government they blame for their pain. Rights abuses The worst atrocities have been blamed on the Eritrean and ethnic Amhara forces, although there have been human rights abuses on both sides. The violence has driven masses of people from their homes in Tigray \u2013 some of whom see glimmers of a possible return in the Tigrayan advance \u2013 and an unknown number have died, either killed by fighters or perished as they fled on foot. People silhouetted against the Tigrayan flag celebrate the departure of Ethiopian troops in Mekelle. Photograph: Finbarr O\u2019Reilly\/The New York Times The United Nations and humanitarian groups say nearly the entire population of the region is in dire need of aid. Ethiopian troops have both looted emergency food aid and blocked relief workers from reaching hard-hit areas. As the atrocities mounted, support for Ethiopia\u2019s central government in Addis Ababa inexorably drained in Tigray, and the ranks of the Tigray Defence Forces swelled with new recruits. Now, for fighters and civilians alike in Mekelle, the message is clear: after eight months of fighting their own government, they need to be rid of it \u2013 perhaps even strike out on their own. \u201cTigray should be an independent country,\u201d Andinet Negessa, a rebel commander, said as his fighters chewed bread and drank water proferred by women who embraced and kissed them. The war is far from over, and most of Tigray remains in the hands of the Tigrayans\u2019 enemies \u2013 Eritreans to the north and Amhara militias to the west. The notion of independence for Tigray \u2013 a largely highland, landlocked region wedged between hostile forces \u2013 seems fanciful. But on Tuesday, even after Ethiopia\u2019s government cut mobile phone networks and electricity to Mekelle, its residents exulted in a rare moment of joy. Outside a yard where, a day earlier, relief workers had been distributing sacks of donated wheat to hungry townspeople, people hoisted aloft a fighter in stonewashed jeans and a leather grenade belt. The fighter, Guesh Girmy \u2013 a 51-year-old former police commander \u2013 soaked up the adulation, kissing his rifle and then blowing kisses into the crowd. Several men responded with raised fists. \u201cAbiy lives for his stomach,\u201d they chanted. \u201cTigrayans live for their country.\u201d Miscalculations The rebel capture of Mekelle followed a string of insurgent victories in the surrounding countryside over the past 10 days. But they were also propelled by Abiy\u2019s own miscalculations. Until the war erupted in November, Tigrayans were divided over the region\u2019s ruling party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front, which was engaged in an explosive feud with Abiy. But once the war started and the human rights abuses mounted, many Tigrayans united against a government in Addis Ababa that they now saw as an existential threat. In interviews, recruits said they were driven to join the TDF by the suffering they witnessed \u2013 relatives who had been slaughtered, priests gunned down in churches, sisters and mothers sexually assaulted. In Mekelle, meanwhile, the government\u2019s grip had steadily weakened in recent months, government officials said. Police officers defected to the rebels, vanishing with weapons, vehicles or even prisoners sprung free from jail. Young doctors from the city\u2019s Ayder Hospital, which has treated civilians blown up in Ethiopian air strikes, or gang raped by Eritrean soldiers, slipped over to the rebel side. A centre treating sexual assault survivors at the Ayder Hospital has had 585 patients since December, said its director, Mihira Redae. About 1,500 more patients had been registered at four centres across Tigray, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just violence against individual women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s against the Tigrayan people.\u201d On the edge of Mekelle on Tuesday, young men looted deserted Ethiopian military camps, collecting abandoned Ethiopian uniforms that they tied to the back of trucks and rickshaws and dragged through the streets. A fire smouldered next to the command headquarters, near the city airport, where piles of military documents had been burned. A handful of surviving documents showed lists of soldiers and officers. Across the road, near the airport runway, the body of an elderly man lay dumped on the edge of a dirt track. A bullet hole pocked his hip. Residents who found him said they did not know how he had died, but that several residents had vanished into military custody during what they called the Ethiopian occupation. \u2013 New York Times Topics: Ahmed Abiy Getachew Reda Tigray People S Liberation Front United Nations Addis Ababa Africa Asmara Eritrea Ethiopia Somalia Sudan Tigray \u0100mara Read More Actor Allison Mack to be sentenced for role in NXIVM cult Average death rate doubles as British Columbia in Canada suffers extreme heat Severe weather could hinder Miami building collapse rescue effort North Korea reports a \u2018great crisis\u2019 in its Covid response Rescuers redouble efforts at collapsed Florida building, 150 still missing \u2018All political rights are in danger\u2019: One year of Hong Kong\u2019s security law US poised to speed up visa process for Afghan citizens due to safety fears Germany\u2019s Left Party convulsed by effort to expel internal critic Ethiopia: Tigrayan forces say government troops on the run Israel\u2019s foreign minister opens embassy in UAE in \u2018historic moment\u2019","question":"What event marked a turning point in the Ethiopian civil war in June 2021?","answer":"The withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, and the subsequent takeover by Tigrayan forces marked a turning point in the war.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12e8\u1230\u121c\u1295 \u1326\u122d\u1290\u1275 \u12c8\u1245\u1275 \u1260\u1301\u1295 2021 \u12e8\u1208\u12cd\u1325 \u1290\u1325\u1265 \u121d\u1295 \u1290\u1260\u122d?","answer_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1220\u122b\u12ca\u1275 \u12a8\u1325\u120b\u12ed \u12cb\u1293 \u12a8\u1270\u121b \u1218\u1240\u120c \u121b\u1348\u1295\u1308\u1325 \u12a5\u1293 \u1260\u128b\u120b \u1260\u1325\u120b\u12ed \u1283\u12ed\u120e\u127d \u12e8\u1270\u12eb\u12d8\u12cd \u1266\u1273 \u1260\u1326\u122d\u1290\u1271 \u12c8\u1245\u1275 \u12e8\u1208\u12cd\u1325 \u1290\u1325\u1265 \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260 \u1233 \u1265\u122d \u1260 \u1260\u12a9\u120b \u1240\u12f0 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260 \u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u120b\u12ed \u1260 \u1233 \u1265\u122d \u1260 \u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u1260 \u1260\u12a9\u120b \u1240\u12f0 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1270 \u1260 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u121a\u1292\u1235\u1275\u122d \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1260 \u1260\u12a9\u120b \u1240\u12f0 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u120b\u12ed \u1260 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u121a\u1292\u1235\u1275\u122d \ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and does not provide any meaningful information related to the question.

Now, for fighters and civilians alike in Mekelle, the message is clear: after eight months of fighting their own government, they need to be rid of it \u2013 perhaps even strike out on their own. \u201cTigray should be an independent country,\u201d Andinet Negessa, a rebel commander, said as his fighters chewed bread and drank water proferred by women who embraced and kissed them. The war is far from over, and most of Tigray remains in the hands of the Tigrayans\u2019 enemies \u2013 Eritreans to the north and Amhara militias to the west. The notion of independence for Tigray \u2013 a largely highland, landlocked region wedged between hostile forces \u2013 seems fanciful. But on Tuesday, even after Ethiopia\u2019s government cut mobile phone networks and electricity to Mekelle, its residents exulted in a rare moment of joy. Outside a yard where, a day earlier, relief workers had been distributing sacks of donated wheat to hungry townspeople, people hoisted aloft a fighter in stonewashed jeans and a leather grenade belt. The fighter, Guesh Girmy \u2013 a 51-year-old former police commander \u2013 soaked up the adulation, kissing his rifle and then blowing kisses into the crowd. Several men responded with raised fists. \u201cAbiy lives for his stomach,\u201d they chanted. \u201cTigrayans live for their country.\u201d Miscalculations The rebel capture of Mekelle followed a string of insurgent victories in the surrounding countryside over the past 10 days. But they were also propelled by Abiy\u2019s own miscalculations. Until the war erupted in November, Tigrayans were divided over the region\u2019s ruling party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front, which was engaged in an explosive feud with Abiy. But once the war started and the human rights abuses mounted, many Tigrayans united against a government in Addis Ababa that they now saw as an existential threat. In interviews, recruits said they were driven to join the TDF by the suffering they witnessed \u2013 relatives who had been slaughtered, priests gunned down in churches, sisters and mothers sexually assaulted. In Mekelle, meanwhile, the government\u2019s grip had steadily weakened in recent months, government officials said. Police officers defected to the rebels, vanishing with weapons, vehicles or even prisoners sprung free from jail. Young doctors from the city\u2019s Ayder Hospital, which has treated civilians blown up in Ethiopian air strikes, or gang raped by Eritrean soldiers, slipped over to the rebel side. A centre treating sexual assault survivors at the Ayder Hospital has had 585 patients since December, said its director, Mihira Redae. About 1,500 more patients had been registered at four centres across Tigray, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just violence against individual women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s against the Tigrayan people.\u201d On the edge of Mekelle on Tuesday, young men looted deserted Ethiopian military camps, collecting abandoned Ethiopian uniforms that they tied to the back of trucks and rickshaws and dragged through the streets. A fire smouldered next to the command headquarters, near the city airport, where piles of military documents had been burned. A handful of surviving documents showed lists of soldiers and officers. Across the road, near the airport runway, the body of an elderly man lay dumped on the edge of a dirt track. A bullet hole pocked his hip. Residents who found him said they did not know how he had died, but that several residents had vanished into military custody during what they called the Ethiopian occupation. \u2013 New York Times Topics: Ahmed Abiy Getachew Reda Tigray People S Liberation Front United Nations Addis Ababa Africa Asmara Eritrea Ethiopia Somalia Sudan Tigray \u0100mara Read More Actor Allison Mack to be sentenced for role in NXIVM cult Average death rate doubles as British Columbia in Canada suffers extreme heat Severe weather could hinder Miami building collapse rescue effort North Korea reports a \u2018great crisis\u2019 in its Covid response Rescuers redouble efforts at collapsed Florida building, 150 still missing \u2018All political rights are in danger\u2019: One year of Hong Kong\u2019s security law US poised to speed up visa process for Afghan citizens due to safety fears Germany\u2019s Left Party convulsed by effort to expel internal critic Ethiopia: Tigrayan forces say government troops on the run Israel\u2019s foreign minister opens embassy in UAE in \u2018historic moment\u2019","question":"What event marked a turning point in the Ethiopian civil war in June 2021?","answer":"The retreat of Ethiopian forces from Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, ahead of advancing Tigrayan troops.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12e8\u1230\u121c\u1295 \u1326\u122d\u1290\u1275 \u12602021 \u1230\u1294 \u12c8\u122d \u121d\u1295 \u12ad\u1235\u1270\u1275 \u12c8\u1233\u129d \u1208\u12cd\u1325 \u12a0\u121d\u1325\u1277\u120d?","answer_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1220\u122b\u12ca\u1275 \u12a8\u1325\u130b\u1265 \u12ad\u120d\u120d \u12cb\u1293 \u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12a8\u1218\u1250\u1208 \u1260\u1325\u130b\u1263\u12cd\u12eb\u1295 \u1220\u122b\u12ca\u1275 \u134d\u1208\u130b \u1208\u134a\u1275 \u1218\u12bc\u12f5 \u1290\u12cd\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12e8\u1230\u121c\u1295 \u1326\u122d\u1290\u1275 \u12602021 \u1230\u1294 \u12c8\u122d \u121d\u1295 \u12ad\u1235\u1270\u1275 \u12c8\u1233\u129d \u1208\u12cd\u1325 \u12a0\u121d\u1325\u1277\u120d \u1265\u127b \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d \u1260 \u1275\u12ad\u12ad\u1208 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260 \u1275\u12ad\u12ad\u1208 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d. \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260 \u1275\u12ad\u12ad\u1208 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d \u1265\u127b, \u12602021 \u1230\u1294 \u12c8\u122d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260 \u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1270\u1290\u1233 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d. \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and does not provide any meaningful information related to the question.

{"year":"2021","month":"08","event_desc":"5 August  Tigrayan rebels capture the city of Lalibela.","text":"Lalibela: Ethiopia's Tigray rebels take Unesco world heritage town 5 August 2021 Share Save Share Save Getty Images The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are a Unesco world heritage site Rebels from Ethiopia's northern Tigray region have taken control of the town of Lalibela, a Unesco world heritage site in neighbouring Amhara region. Lalibela, home to 13th Century churches hewn from rock, is a holy site for millions of Orthodox Christians. Residents have been fleeing the rebel advance, local officials told the BBC. Thousands have been killed since war broke out last November. Fighting is now spreading into Amhara and Afar, another region bordering Tigray. Millions of people have also been displaced. Both the Tigray rebel forces and the Ethiopian army and its allies have been accused of committing human rights abuses and war crimes. Ethiopia\u2019s miraculous underground churches - BBC Travel The deputy mayor of Lalibela, Mandefro Tadesse, told the BBC that the town was under the control of the Tigray rebels. He said there had not been any shooting, but residents were fleeing from the town and he was concerned about the safety of the historic churches. Four facts about the Lalibela churches There are 11 medieval monolithic cave churches in Lalibela carved out of rock that date from the 12th and 13th Centuries They were built as a substitute for pilgrimages to the Holy Land, which was unreachable at the time The churches were designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1978 They are tended to by priests of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church \"This is the world's heritage, and we must cooperate to guarantee that this treasure is preserved,\" Mr Mandefro said. The US State Department called on Tigrayan forces to respect the cultural heritage of Lalibela, as Washington becomes increasingly concerned over the the conflict. The spreading fighting follows significant territorial gains made by the rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in June, including capturing the Tigray regional capital Mekelle after Ethiopian troops withdrew and the government declared a unilateral ceasefire. The TPLF was the regional government of Tigray until it was ousted by federal forces last November. It has been designated a terrorist organisation by the Ethiopian government. However, the rebels say they are the legitimate regional government of Tigray. Earlier this week a rebel general told the BBC that the group aimed to force the federal government to lift a blockade in the region and agree to a political solution to the crisis. The government denies there is a blockade and has ruled out talks. However the TPLF's push into Amhara and Afar has drawn international criticism, and both the UN and the US this week called for all parties to stop fighting. The Ethiopian government says more than 300,000 people have been displaced in Amhara and Afar. Separately the UN said 175 lorries carrying humanitarian aid had arrived in Tigray. But the head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) warned that more than 100 lorries were needed every day to reach the millions who were in need. Aid workers have struggled to get access to much of Tigray due to insecurity and bureaucratic hurdles.

{"year":"2021","month":"08","event_desc":"10 August  Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed calls on civilians to join the war in Tigray.","text":"Ethiopia PM Abiy Ahmed calls on civilians to join Tigray war 10 August 2021 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Tigrayan rebel forces have made big gains since June Ethiopia's prime minister has called on civilians to join the army in its fight against rebels in the Tigray region. Abiy Ahmed asked \"all capable Ethiopians\" to \"show their patriotism\" by joining the war, which is raging across the north of the country. Fighting has escalated since June when the rebels, led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), recaptured much of Tigray in an offensive. This came after the federal army had withdrawn and declared a ceasefire. In his statement, Mr Abiy - a Nobel Peace Prize winner - said the whole country had to get behind the battle to defeat the TPLF. \"The media, artists and social activists are expected to contribute towards strengthening the people's support for the country,\" he said. \"Every Ethiopian must work closely with the security forces in being the eyes and ears of the country in order to track down and expose spies and agents of the terrorist TPLF.\" The TPLF has been designated a terrorist organisation by the government. But the group says it is the legitimate regional government of Tigray. Fighting broke out in November 2020 between government troops and the TPLF, which ruled Ethiopia for decades and now controls Tigray. The conflict has forced over two million people to flee their homes, with hundreds of thousands pushed into famine conditions. Six weeks ago, the government announced a unilateral humanitarian ceasefire, after losing control of key areas including the regional capital, Mekelle. It said the ceasefire would stay in place until the farming season ended. The main planting season runs from June to September. Last week, the rebels' commander told the BBC that his fighters' incursion into the neighbouring regions was aimed at removing a federal blockade that has prevented aid from coming through. But the prime minister's statement accused the rebels of stopping aid and not allowing farmers to plant crops. \"It has become apparent that Tigrayan farmers will not be able to farm safely unless the people of Tigray are forever separated from the terrorist group,\" Mr Abiy said. The statement also took aim at some in the international community. The prime minister blamed them for the \"machinations of foreign hands\" in the war, and alleged some had been caught \"red-handed supporting the [Tigray forces] under the disguise of humanitarian aid.\" Under pressure, Abiy makes bold shift Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC Africa Correspondent Ethiopia's government once called the conflict in Tigray a \"law and order operation\", and in November declared victory. But it is a sign of a significant shift that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is now calling for every Ethiopian of age to sign up. It is no longer just Tigray that is at stake for the federal government. The neighbouring Afar and - crucially - Amhara regions appear to be increasingly under threat. Last week, Tigrayan forces captured the ancient city of Lalibela in Amhara - seemingly without a fight. Fighting has also been reported in the strategic city of Weldiya. While regional forces and militia have continued fighting the government insists the federal army stopped taking part in active conflict at the end of June - adhering to a unilateral ceasefire for humanitarian reasons. But its losses in Tigray before the announcement were significant and thousands of its troops were captured. A national \"call to arms\" is a bold statement but there are questions about what underpins it and the true strength of the federal military.

{"year":"2024","month":"03","event_desc":"1 March  Heavy fighting between the Fano militia and the federal government breaks out in Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara Region.","text":"Iran joins BRICS group formally in 2024 Politics January 1, 2024 - 22:43 TEHRAN- South Africa\u2019s representative in the BRICS group of emerging economies, Anil Sooklal, has stated that Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Ethiopia will join the bloc on January 1, 2024. At the recent BRICS meeting, which took place in Durban, South Africa, early in December, Sooklal underlined \u2014referring to the attendance of high-ranking representatives of Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Ethiopia\u2014 that the number of BRICS members will double with the addition of these nations. He went on to add that the next conference of the economic group is scheduled for January 30 in Moscow, and it is expected that representatives of the new BRICS members will be there. In a recent interview with Sputnik, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, Ali Bagheri Kani, emphasized Iran's commitment, alongside other BRICS members, to actively pursue de-dollarization across various economic sectors. Bagheri Kani highlighted the focus on trade, economic collaborations, and financial exchanges within this influential coalition of major economies. He emphasized ongoing initiatives and expressed optimism about reinforcing these efforts to swiftly achieve their objectives. Bagheri Kani underscored the importance of collaborative efforts, signaling a unified commitment within BRICS to reducing dependency on the dollar. He clarified that the initiatives aim to establish a framework fostering economic autonomy and resilience among member nations. The BRICS group, comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, established in 2009, has emerged as a significant force shaping global economic discussions. Iran, alongside Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, has received an invitation to join this influential bloc. Their anticipated full membership, official from January 1, 2024, marks a substantial shift in the geopolitical landscape. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergey Ryabkov, provided insights into BRICS countries accelerating the transition to national currencies. This strategic shift aligns with the shared vision of establishing a more balanced and resilient global economic framework, reducing vulnerabilities associated with a singular currency. BRICS has announced plans to introduce a gold-backed currency for settling international trade payments, challenging the global reserve status of the U.S. dollar. This decision adds momentum to the ongoing de-dollarization trend unfolding in the global economy.

It reported successfully foiling nearly 28,000 cyber-attack attempts since 2022. Nonetheless, the bank said the recent incident, which led to customers withdrawing large amounts of cash from the bank\u2019s ATMs and digitally transferring millions, was caused by an internal \u201csystem glitch\u201d rather than a cyber-attack. Early Saturday, customers, mainly university students, were able to withdraw cash while others digitally transferred large sums of money due to the \u201cglitch\u201d caused by a \u201csystem upgrade\u201d implemented hours before the incident. The bank did not disclose the amount of loss it incurred as a result, but indicated that 490,000 transactions, both legal and illegal, were completed during the incident, which lasted from around midnight to dawn. The bank\u2019s in-person and digital services were inaccessible on Saturday until late afternoon. Abe Sano, CEO of the Bank, told journalists on Monday that efforts to recoup the lost money are underway, without stating the amount that has been recovered so far. He added that the bank has also started identifying those who transferred large sums of money to hold them criminally accountable. A local newspaper reported that approximately 2.4 billion birr was withdrawn or transferred to other banks and mobile money platforms. The bank stated that the root cause of the problem and the total loss it incurred would be communicated upon the completion of an ongoing investigation.

Bate was fatally shot on Tuesday night in his hometown, Meki, situated in the East Shewa zone of the Oromia region. In a statement on Wednesday , Cardin expressed condolences to Bate\u2019s family and urged Ethiopian authorities to allow an independent international body to thoroughly probe the circumstances surrounding his death. \u201cThe killing of Bate Urgessa on Tuesday night was shocking and upsetting. I offer my deepest condolences to the family for their loss and urge Ethiopian authorities to allow a credible, neutral international body to conduct a thorough investigation into Bate\u2019s death,\u201d Cardin stated. The senator criticized the Ethiopian government\u2019s actions against political opposition figures, media personnel, and dissenting voices, stating these measures have contributed to insecurity and instability in the country. \u201cExtrajudicial killings, harassment, and political repression have, for far too long, been commonplace in Oromia.

In contrast, the armed group Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) alleged in a statement that Urgessa was \u201ctaken from his room by security forces during midnight hours and executed point-blank.\u201d The OLA further accused government security forces of \u201cpreventing the recovery of his body and later inhibiting the conduct of further autopsies.\u201d Addis Standard reported that Bate was shot dead on Tuesday night, and his body was found dumped by the road early on Wednesday in Meki. A family member told Addis Standard that a group of people who \u201clooked like government security forces\u201d took Bate out of his hotel room around midnight on Tuesday, and they discovered his body by the road the next morning.

{"year":"2024","month":"01","event_desc":"Ethiopia announces an agreement with Somaliland to use 20 kilometers of coastline, including the port of Berbera, in exchange for eventual recognition of the Somaliland Declaration of Independence, which would make it the first country to do so.","text":"Somalia calls Ethiopia-Somaliland agreement act of aggression 2 January 2024 Share Save Mohamud Abdiaziz Abdisamad & Kalkidan Yibeltal BBC News, Mogadishu & Addis Ababa Share Save Reuters Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud addressed MPs following Ethiopia's agreement with Somaliland Somalia has described an agreement that landlocked Ethiopia made with the self-declared republic of Somaliland over sea access as an act of \"aggression\". Somaliland seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but is not recognised internationally. It said that Ethiopia agreed to recognise its independence at some point in the future in exchange for military access to the coast. Ethiopia has not confirmed this aspect of Monday's contentious deal. Instead, the office of Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said it signed what is known as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) \"to secure access to the sea and diversify its access to seaports\". Mr Abiy had previously described sea access as an \"existential issue\" for his country. His national security adviser, Redwan Hussein, also said on X that the arrangement could enable Ethiopia to access a \"leased military base\" on the sea, but gave no further details. An MoU is regarded as a statement of intent and can lead to a legally binding treaty. The development is being portrayed by both sides as a major diplomatic step. Somalia, however, has reacted angrily to the MoU as it sees Somaliland as part of its territory. It said it was recalling its ambassador to Ethiopia. The government said the agreement was \"null and void\" and a violation of its sovereignty. In a statement it added that it \"considers this action as an aggression and... is an impediment to the good neighbourliness, peace and stability of the region which [is] already struggling with many challenges\". Somalia's Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Bare urged people to remain calm. \"I want to assure them that we are committed to the defence of the country. A part of our land, our sea and our air cannot be violated and I will defend it in every legal way,\" he said at a hastily arranged press conference. The Reuters news agency reports that addressing parliament later on Tuesday, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said that \"no-one has the power give away a piece of Somalia\". \"Somaliland, you are the northern regions of Somalia. Ethiopia has no recognition for you,\" he added. Somalia also said it wanted the UN Security Council and the African Union to discuss the issue. The exact details of Monday's agreement that was signed by Prime Minister Abiy and Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, are not known. Mr Abdi said the agreement included a section stating that Ethiopia would at some point in the future recognise Somaliland as an independent country. Somaliland's foreign ministry said in a statement that the \"agreement ensures Ethiopia's access to the sea for their naval forces, reciprocated by formal recognition of the Republic of Somaliland, marking this as a significant diplomatic milestone for our country\". It quoted the president as saying that recognition would be in \"exchange for 20km (12 miles) sea access for the Ethiopian naval forces, leased for a period of 50 years\".

Samuel Fola, zone chief administrator of Wolaita, said more than 300 people have been evacuated from the area in Kindo Didaye district and that the number of those unaccounted for remains unknown. \u201cChildren are among the dead,\u201d said Fola. \u201cWe have now evacuated more than 300 people as a precaution and in anticipation of yet another likely major landslide.\u201d A frantic rescue effort was underway in the Wolaita area, according to the regional government. Monday\u2019s landslide appeared to be less deadly than one that occurred last month in another area in southern Ethiopia where more than 200 people were killed. Landslides are common during Ethiopia\u2019s rainy season, which started in July and is expected to last until mid-September. With little infrastructure, the mountainous areas of Wolaita have been prone to such accidents.

He said Ethiopian Airlines had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Dubai-based consulting company Dar to develop the design for the airport, which will have four runways. It will be built in Bishoftu, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of the capital Addis Ababa, and stretch across 35 square kilometres (13.5 square miles), he said. \"The first phase includes the construction of the airport facility with a capacity of 60 million passengers per year and the completion of phase two of the airport project will grow to handling more than 100 million passengers per year,\" Mesfin said, according to state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate.

Mamo Mihretu, governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia, said in a televised address Monday that the reforms \u201cwill introduce a competitive, market-based determination of the exchange rate and address a long-standing distortion within the Ethiopian economy.\u201d Commercial banks can set the price of foreign exchange and non-bank entities are permitted to operate forex bureaux for the first time, a historic change in a country where the government for decades fixed those prices, allowing a black market to flourish. The International Monetary Fund approved a four-year credit facility worth $3.4 billion to coincide with Ethiopia\u2019s reforms. It pledged to disburse $1 billion immediately to address pressing needs, with Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describing the reforms as a \u201clandmark moment for Ethiopia.\u201d Ethiopia expects a total of around $13.5 billion in new funding, including from the World Bank and currency swap agreements with foreign governments. RELATED COVERAGE An Ethiopian church in Washington preserves an ancient language and Orthodox tradition People detained in Myanmar after release from scam compounds attempt an escape War in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region has left many disabled veterans without care Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a statement that the new exchange rate regime is \u201ccritical to relieving (forex) shortages, removing constraints to private sector investment and growth, and aligning the prices of imported and exported goods and services with market realities.\u201d The Ethiopian currency, known as the birr, was one of the weakest in the region in recent months. Still, one of the immediate consequences of the exchange rate policy change was a sharp rise in inflation, and some businesspeople in Addis Ababa, the capital, were complaining Tuesday. Following the currency float, the birr depreciated by 30% in the official market against major foreign currencies. \u201cI wanted to purchase concert speakers last week and I was quoted about 100,000 birr ($1400), and today the same product is being sold 25% more,\u201d said Yonas Anberber, a wedding planner. The government has promised to subsidize fuel and raise the salaries of civil servants to help people adjust to the reforms. In Merkato, Addis Ababa\u2019s biggest open-air market, many stall owners decided to hoard the bulk of their goods, hoping for price stability in the near future. \u201cThe market for goods and services will react in the coming days, which may significantly have negative repercussions on the cost of living for many households,\u201d Abdulemnan M. Hamza, an economic analyst in Addis Ababa, told the AP. \u201cAs a result, the urban poor, the lowly paid employees, the pensioners will suffer the most.\u201d Most of Addis Ababa\u2019s real-estate companies, which import many raw materials and make transactions based on an exchange rate fixed by authorities, were among the first to adjust their prices, increasing them by roughly 30%. Ethiopia has long faced a critical shortage of foreign currency. For over a year, the gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel market rate soared, a disparity the government expects to narrow after the reforms. \u201cThe floating was overdue as the parallel black market had reached its ceiling due to cash shortages in the economy,\u201d said Samson Berhane, an economist based in Addis Ababa. \u201cLocal banks have some room to maneuver the rate until it reaches equilibrium, but the disadvantage is that it comes with the risk of inflation that is likely to increase.\u201d","question":"What major economic reform did the National Bank of Ethiopia implement in July 2024?","answer":"The National Bank of Ethiopia introduced a flexible exchange rate policy for the Ethiopian birr, allowing commercial banks to set foreign exchange prices and permitting non-bank entities to operate forex bureaus.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1265\u1214\u122b\u12ca \u1263\u1295\u12ad \u1260\u1301\u120b\u12ed 2024 \u12d3.\u121d \u121d\u1295 \u12cb\u1293 \u12e8\u12a2\u12ae\u1296\u121a \u121b\u123b\u123b\u12eb \u12a0\u12cd\u1325\u1277\u120d?","answer_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1265\u1214\u122b\u12ca \u1263\u1295\u12ad \u1208\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1265\u122d \u1270\u1208\u12cb\u12cb\u132d \u12e8\u121d\u1295\u12db\u122a \u1270\u1218\u1295 \u1356\u120a\u1232 \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12cb\u12cd\u124b\u120d\u1362 \u12ed\u1205\u121d \u1290\u130b\u12f4 \u1263\u1295\u12ae\u127d \u12e8\u12cd\u132d \u121d\u1295\u12db\u122a \u12cb\u130b\u12ce\u127d\u1295 \u12a5\u1295\u12f2\u12eb\u12d8\u130b\u1301 \u12a5\u1295\u12f2\u1201\u121d \u12e8\u1263\u1295\u12ad \u12eb\u120d\u1206\u1291 \u1270\u124b\u121b\u1275 \u12e8\u12cd\u132d \u121d\u1295\u12db\u122a \u1262\u122e\u12ce\u127d\u1295 \u12a5\u1295\u12f2\u1220\u1229 \u12eb\u1235\u127d\u120b\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u1201\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1328\u121b\u122a \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1265\u1214\u122b\u12ca \u1263\u1295\u12ad \u1260\u1301\u120b\u12ed 2024 \u12d3.\u121d \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u121b\u123b\u123b\u12eb \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1270\u12f0\u130b\u130b\u121a \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1275\u122d\u1309\u121d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u121b\u1228\u130b\u1308\u132b \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u121b\u123b\u123b\u12eb \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1265\u127b \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u1290\u1223 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d. \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1232\u1206\u1295, \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and does not provide any clear or relevant information about the economic reform introduced by the National Bank of Ethiopia in July 2024.

The incident happened on Saturday, as a group of 26 was traveling to a funeral on a home-made wooden vessel on the Tekeze River, near Ethiopia\u2019s border with Eritrea. Efforts are underway to retrieve the victims\u2019 bodies, with only two recovered so far, according to the Ethiopian Press Agency. There was no comment from Ethiopian authorities Monday. The Tekeze is a gateway for illegal migrants and civilians escaping conflict in Amhara and the neighboring region of Tigray. At the peak of the Tigray civil war , thousands of Ethiopians crossed to Sudan using the river. Boats regularly capsize on the river as smugglers transport illegal migrants to the Gulf of Aden and onwards to Middle East and Europe. Refugees often report sighting dead bodies floating on the river. An ongoing conflict in Amhara, pitting Ethiopian federal forces against an Amhara nationalist group known as FANO, has escalated the displacement of civilians. Many have been embarking on risky migrations to escape the violence. The boat accident happened as Ethiopians mourn the deaths last week of at least 257 people in mudslides in a remote part of the country\u2019s south. Lawmakers declared a three-day period of national mourning that began on Saturday.","question":"How many people died in the boat accident on the Tekeze River in Ethiopia's Amhara region in July 2024?","answer":"19 people died in the boat accident.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12a0\u121b\u122b \u12ad\u120d\u120d \u1270\u12a8\u12dc \u12c8\u1295\u12dd \u120b\u12ed \u1260\u1301\u120b\u12ed 2024 \u1260\u1270\u12a8\u1230\u1270\u12cd \u12e8\u1263\u122d\u12ab \u12a0\u12f0\u130b \u1235\u1295\u1275 \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u121e\u1270\u12cb\u120d?","answer_translated":"\u1260\u1263\u122d\u12ab \u12a0\u12f0\u130b\u12cd 19 \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u121e\u1270\u12cb\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future-specific information without access to current web data.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"19 August  Heaven Awot, a seven-year old girl is revealed to have been brutally raped, mutilated and murdered by her mother's landlord Getnet Baye in Bahir Dar, Amhara Region in .","text":"Outcry at sentence for man who raped and killed girl of 7 19 August 2024 Share Save Kalkidan Yibeltal BBC News, Addis Ababa Share Save Courtesy of the family Heaven Awot (R) with her mother Abekyelesh Adeba Warning: This article contains distressing detail about rape and sexual assault The brutal rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl has sparked outrage in Ethiopia, with many saying the sentence given to her attacker is too lenient. Heaven Awot was sexually assaulted, mutilated and killed by her mother\u2019s landlord Getnet Baye last August in the north-western city of Bahir Dar in Amhara region. Getnet was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The case attracted widespread attention after he recently launched an appeal, and the case is now adjourned until October. The mother of the girl, Abekyelesh Adeba, tells the BBC that losing her child has left her feeling \"lifeless\". More than 200,000 people have so far signed an online petition demanding a review of the sentencing \"to reflect the gravity of the crime\" and to offer support for the grieving mother. One of the largest women\u2019s rights advocacy groups in the country, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA), released a statement saying they believe the sentencing was \"very light\", adding \"the murder by itself should have been enough to sentence him to life imprisonment or to death\u2026 It\u2019s specially sickening and outrageous when such a horrendous crime is committed against children.\" Senior government officials have joined the chorus of criticism, with Minister for Women and Social Affairs Ergogie Tesfaye writing on her Facebook page that the crimes committed against Heaven were \"inhumane\" and saying her office would pursue the case with stakeholders. The brutal attack has triggered heated discussions about the safety of vulnerable women and young girls in Ethiopia. According to a report released in May by Human Rights Watch, conflict-related sexual violence \"has reached alarming levels in Ethiopia\". The lack of accountability for perpetrators is seen by some as one contributing factor for its prevalence. Thousands of women and young girls are reported to have been raped during a devastating two-year war in Tigray , the country\u2019s northernmost region. Before being raped and killed, Heaven saw the breaking up of her family because of that war. Her father, an ethnic Tigrayan, was imprisoned for months at the height of the conflict. He was never charged. When he was released, he left Amhara - where he felt there was still hostility and suspicions towards him - for Tigray. Heaven\u2019s mother, Ms Abekyelesh, a nurse, was left to raise her and her younger sister alone. Being on friendly terms with their landlord who lived with his family within the same compound, Ms Abekyelesh told the BBC that she never felt any threat to her children. She was related to the landlord\u2019s wife which made her feel even more at ease. When Heaven was attacked, Ms Abekyelesh was at work and the girl's aunt was babysitting her. Her aunt says Heaven told her she was going to the bathroom, and did not return. Wondering why she was taking so long, the aunt says she went to look for the girl but did not find her. She believes Getnet had snatched her away. Later that day, Heaven's mutilated body was found in front of her home with clear marks of being strangled. Her mother tells the BBC that she believes the attacker dropped the body there. \"If our children can't be safe in our homes, where else can we go?,\" she says. \"Should we stop work and spend all our time with them? How can we feed them?\" In the following months, Ms Abekyelesh faced added ordeals as she grieved her murdered daughter. She had to go into hiding, fearing for her own and her other daughter\u2019s safety, after the attacker - Getnet - escaped from custody. He fled from the police station in Bahir Dar where he was being detained last August, after local Amhara militias battling the army broke into that facility to free their fellow fighters who were held there. Now on the loose, Getnet came looking for Heaven's mother with a gun. He was not rearrested for close to a month. She says she felt that security forces were reluctant to detain him, and had to beg them to re-arrest him. All the while Getnet was threatening her. It left Ms Abekyelesh feeling unsafe, and as a result she has moved homes and jobs repeatedly in the year since. Ms Abekyelesh feels that the justice system failed her. She does not believe the 25-year sentence for Getnet was enough. But she is more concerned about him winning his appeal and getting an early release. \"I have lost my Heaven... I am lifeless,\" she tells the BBC. Yet as a health worker, she says she knows of countless more women and young girls who have been sexually assaulted. \"I know there are so many Heavens.\" If you have been affected by the issues in this story and need support, you could speak to a health professional, or an organisation that offers support.

Ethiopia extreme weather: At least 157 people killed after two landslides More than 200 people have been killed in two landslides in southern Ethiopia, authorities said. The first landslide, triggered by heavy rains in a remote region of Gofa zone, occurred on Monday and was followed by a second one that buried people who had gathered to help, state officials said on Tuesday. At least 148 men and 81 women were killed after the disaster struck in the Kencho-Shacha locality in the Gofa Zone on Monday, the local Communications Affairs Department said in a statement. Alemayehu Bawdi, Southern Regional State representative, confirmed the death toll and said \u201csearch and rescue efforts are ongoing\u201d. Five people were pulled alive from the mud and were receiving treatment at medical facilities, the government-owned Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) reported earlier. It cited local administrator Dagemawi Ayele as saying that most of those killed were buried after they went to help the inhabitants of a house hit by an initial landslide. \u201cThose who rushed for live-saving work have perished in the disaster including the locality\u2019s administrator, teachers, health professionals and agricultural professionals,\u201d EBC quoted Dagemawi as saying. Gofa is part of the state known as the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples\u2019 Region (SNNPR), located about 320km (199 miles) southwest of the capital, Addis Ababa. Kemal Hashi Mohamoud, a parliamentarian, told Al Jazeera from Addis Ababa that the second landslide happened \u201ca few minutes\u201d after the first. \u201cPeople are preparing shelter and giving them food,\u201d he said. Images shared on social media by the state-affiliated media outlet Fana Broadcasting Corporate showed hundreds of people near the devastating scene of tumbled soil, using their hands to dig through the dirt. The state has been battered by the short seasonal rains between April and May that caused flooding and mass displacement, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). It said in May that \u201cfloods impacted over 19,000 people in several zones, displacing over a thousand and causing damage to livelihoods and infrastructure\u201d. The southern region has experienced landslides previously, with at least 32 people killed in 2018 after two separate incidents within a week of each other. The flooding and landslides occurred even as other parts of the country are facing severe drought, which has prompted traditional herding communities to explore alternative food production methods. The UN reports that millions in the country face malnutrition due to recent climate-related challenges.

The attack resulted in the deaths of nine police officers, injuries to four others, and the capture of several soldiers. Lawyer Muhyeldin Adam, a member of the Refugee Committee at Kumer camp, reported to Radio Dabanga that a Sudanese refugee child was critically injured during the attack, which happened in very close proximity to the. He also noted that the national army arrived hours after the incident, and ambulances transported the bodies and the wounded. Reports have not yet confirmed whether the armed assailants who attacked the police station belonged to the FANO militia, who are particularly active in the Amhara region . Another spokesperson for the refugees described an ongoing exchange of fire between the armed attackers and the army near the camp, creating a state of terror and panic among the residents. Images received by Radio Dabanga depicted the bodies of police officers next to refugee tents before being removed by the military. Refugees highlighted that the camp is precariously situated between the conflicting parties. Nine policemen dead in armed attack on police station near Kumer camp (Photo: RD) Medical staff, comprised of refugee women, managed the initial emergency response and ambulance operations until the army\u2019s arrival over two hours later. For over two months, thousands of refugees have staged a sit-in near the Ethiopian police station , demanding relocation to a safer area. Some have taken refuge in the nearby Ulala forests, enduring harsh humanitarian conditions. Lawyer Adam added that the authorities had proposed relocation to an area near Gonder in Amhara province. However, refugees declined due to similar security concerns in that region. Refugees continue to face unlawful killings and detentions by local militants called shifta in the area), citing the death of a refugee in June, another injury from a gunshot, and the kidnapping of a person in early July for ransom, who remains missing. Refugee violations The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission\u2019s recent annual report earlier this month, documented a surge in kidnappings for ransom in the Oromia and Amhara regions. The report cited a significant increase in violent incidents, including the kidnapping of refugees. A memorandum from refugee representatives, obtained by Radio Dabanga, revealed that over 10 per cent of refugees at the Kumer camp have been victims of violent crimes since the camp\u2019s establishment in May 2023. This includes 743 reported incidents of gun threats, forced searches, kidnappings, murders, and robberies. In response to ongoing threats, Sudanese refugees at the Kumer and Awlala camps have rejected an Ethiopian government offer to relocate them to the Kokit area, situated 30km west of the town of Shahidi. The refugees have maintained a sit-in protest in the Awlala border camp , approximately 64km from the Sudanese border, for the past few months. The camp currently houses 6,000 refugees. Hundreds of Sudanese fled the Awlala camp in light of the deteriorating health and security conditions and the spread of diseases, especially among children, such as cholera, infections, and fevers. Almost 135,000 people have fled Sudan to Ethiopia since April 15, 2023, according to the latest data from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).

{"year":"2024","month":"12","event_desc":"12 December    Ethiopia and Somalia have signed a joint declaration in Ankara, Turkey, to resolve the disputed sovereignty over Somaliland and Ethiopia's access to the Port of the Red Sea.","text":"Ethiopia and Somalia agree to end bitter Somaliland port feud 12 December 2024 Share Save Kalkidan Yibeltal in Addis Ababa & Basillioh Rukanga in Nairobi BBC News Share Save Reuters President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (C) said the agreement was \"the first step towards a new beginning\" Ethiopia and Somalia have agreed to end their bitter dispute over Addis Ababa's plans to build a port in the breakaway republic of Somaliland following talks in Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the \"historic agreement\", which he said would eventually ensure landlocked Ethiopia's access to the sea. At the press conference he held hands with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who both agreed to respect one another's \"sovereignty\". The two neighbours have been at loggerheads since January when Ethiopia signed a maritime deal with Somaliland - which Somalia considers as part of its territory. It prompted fears of a wider regional conflict as Egypt has been backing Somalia - largely due to its anger with Ethiopia for building a dam on the River Nile. Turkey has in recent years become an important geopolitical player in the Horn of Africa as it has close economic ties with Addis Ababa and security deals with Mogadishu. Ethiopia-Somaliland deal: Can the Horn of Africa rift be healed? Ethiopia warns against invasion amid regional tensions Why Ethiopia is so alarmed by an Egypt-Somalia alliance Erdogan said the agreement - announced on Wednesday night in the Turkish capital, Ankara - was \"the first step towards a new beginning\". \"I congratulate both my brothers for reaching to this historic reconciliation with devotion and thank them for their constructive attitude,\" he said. President Mohamud said his country was \"ready to work with the Ethiopian leadership and the Ethiopian people\". While Prime Minister Abiy insisted Ethiopia's efforts to secure and reliable access to the sea did not threaten Somalia and the two had \"addressed the misunderstandings that have occurred over the past year\". The feud began on New Year's Day, when Abiy signed a controversial deal with Somaliland to lease a 20km (12-mile) section of its coastline for 50 years to set up a naval base. In exchange, Ethiopia - the world's most-populous landlocked nation - was to reportedly recognise Somaliland as an independent country, although Addis Ababa never explicitly confirmed this. Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia more than 30 years ago, has long been pushing for recognition - but Mogadishu described the move as an act of \"aggression\". According to the Ankara joint declaration, the two Horn of Africa neighbours are to reconvene in February to hold \"technical talks\". In the interim they will strive to reach \"mutually beneficial commercial arrangements\" to ensure Ethiopia gains access to the sea \"under Somalia's sovereignty\". It is not clear if Ethiopia has discarded the deal it signed with Somaliland - something demanded by Somalia at earlier mediation efforts. Last month, Somaliland elected a new president - former opposition leader Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi - who promised to \"review\" the maritime deal. During his inauguration speech on Thursday morning he made no mention of it. Somaliland is located in a strategic part of the world, and is seen as a gateway to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.

Segments of active extension occur from the Indian Ocean west to Botswana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  It is the only rift system in the world that is active on a continent-wide scale, providing geologists with a view of how continental rifts develop over time into oceanic spreading centers like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Rifting in East Africa is not all coeval: volcanism and faulting have been an ongoing phenomenon on the continent since the Eocene (~45 Ma).  The rifting began in northern East Africa, and led to the separation of the Africa (Nubia) and Arabia plates in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and in the Turkana area at the Kenya-Ethiopia border.  A Paleogene mantle superplume beneath East Africa caused extension within the Nubia plate, as well as a first order topographic high known as the African superswell which now includes most of the eastern and southern segments of the Nubia plate. Widespread volcanism erupted onto much of the rising plateau in Ethiopia during the Eocene-Oligocene (45 \u2013 29 Ma), with chains of volcanoes forming along the rift separating Africa and Arabia. Since the initiation of rifting in northeastern Africa, the system has propagated over 3000 km to the south and southwest, and it experiences seismicity as a direct result of the extension, as well as active magmatism. Today extension and magmatism are localizing in distinct eastern, western, and southwestern branches, marking the edges of two or more microplates between the sub-parallel zones of extension in East Africa.  The borders of the microplates (known as Victoria and Rovuma) with the Nubia plate to the west and Somalia plate to the east now represent the most seismically active zones on the continent where normal faulting earthquakes occur on a monthly basis. They are also the sites of volcano-tectonic earthquakes. Along the rift, models of sparse GPS data and earthquake slip vectors predict average spreading rates of 1-4 mm\/yr, increasing from north to south in the western branch, and increasing from south to north in the east. The three limbs of the Afar triple junction zone experience major earthquakes, as well as frequent volcanic eruptions and dike intrusions.  The magnitude of earthquakes during volcano-tectonic events is usually less than M 6, but large volumes of magma accommodating plate opening may occur during these intense, smaller magnitude swarms.  The largest earthquakes recorded in this area occurred in a swarm, along a section of the evolving Arabia-Nubia plate boundary in Afar in August 1989.  Studies of this earthquake swarm show that the events occurred as a result of slip on conjugate normal faults bounding the narrow Dobi graben.  The swarm, made up of 25 M \u2265 4.2 earthquakes, occurred over 48 hours from 11:17 UT August 20, 1989.  The events were all shallower than 15 km as a result of the thin crust beneath the triple junction compared to the surrounding continental crust. Conversely, the deepest earthquake ever recorded on the African continent (~62 km) also occurred beneath the Afar triple junction on November 8th, 1978.  This M 4.9 earthquake occurred beneath an active spreading segment, and was probably associated with the movement of magma at depth during the rifting episode. The western branch is divided into three main segments.  The northern and middle segments border the Nubia - Victoria microplate boundary, and the southern segment borders the Nubia - Rovuma boundary.  The northern segment comprises the West Nile region (WNR), and Lakes Albert, Kivu, and Edward (LAKE); the middle segment includes Lakes Tanganyika and Rukwa (LT, LR); and the southern segment encompasses Lake Malawi and central Mozambique (LM). The two largest instrumentally recorded events in Africa occurred ~ 300 km north of Lake Albert, in an area of Mesozoic (250-65 Ma) rifting.  These M 7.1 earthquakes struck four days apart in May 1990, both at ~ 15 km depth.  Their tectonic relationship to the Albert rift system or Mesozoic faults remains unclear. The most recent major earthquake to strike the region occurred on February 22nd, 2006.  This M 7.0 event struck at a depth of 11 km in central Mozambique around midnight local time, killing two and injuring 15.  The earthquake was felt in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, South Africa, and Zambia, but no major structural damage was reported.","question":"What was the magnitude of the earthquake that occurred near \u0100wash, Ethiopia, on September 30, 2024?","answer":"The earthquake had a magnitude of 4.5 on the Richter scale.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12e82024 \u1234\u1355\u1274\u121d\u1260\u122d 30 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12a0\u12cb\u123d \u12a0\u12ab\u1263\u1262 \u12e8\u1270\u12a8\u1230\u1270\u12cd \u12e8\u1218\u122c\u1275 \u12a5\u1295\u1245\u133d\u1245\u1335 \u1218\u1320\u1295 \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u1290\u1260\u122d?","answer_translated":"\u12e8\u1218\u122c\u1275 \u12a5\u1295\u1245\u133d\u1245\u1331 \u1218\u1320\u1295 \u1260\u122a\u12ad\u1270\u122d \u121a\u12db\u1295 4.5 \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12a5\u1295\u12f0 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1218\u122c\u1275 \u12a5\u1295\u1245\u133d\u1245\u1355 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u12602024 \u1234\u1355\u1274\u121d\u1260\u122d 30 \u1260\u12a0\u12cb\u123d \u12a0\u12ab\u1263\u1262 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1218\u1320\u1295 \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u12a5\u1295\u12f0 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1240\u12f0\u121d \u1232\u1273\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1240\u12f0\u121d \ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and does not provide any meaningful information related to the question.

This morning and throughout the year I have the opportunity to reflect back to you broader human rights developments, which are by no means exhaustive, that require particular attention, with a view to finding solutions. Solutions that stem from rights that are universal while being tailored to the specific circumstances of each country. Solutions which bring forward our longstanding experience in difficult settings, and our work as bridge-builders between civil society, human rights defenders and institutions of the State. Full cooperation with my Office and our field presences \u2013 as well as with the various human rights mechanisms \u00a0\u2013 is about just that: solutions. It's about results. It is not a lightning rod for criticism. And it is not just engagement for engagement's sake. It's about concrete results for the lives of people. That kind of cooperation is the mark of a State that honourably seeks to live up to its human rights commitments. Over the course of this year I will provide an update on cooperation, and non-cooperation, with the different human rights mechanisms. I am aware that discussions of complex human rights issues may be difficult or sensitive, for some. Others may feel they are best whispered behind closed doors. Yet, we need to regain the space where we can discuss them in a constructive and open spirit, undisturbed by the tug of geopolitics and bearing in mind that nobody is perfect. In the spur of the moment you may not like what you hear but over time you may appreciate what we had to say. My only consideration, and in fact my duty, is to stay true to the mandate, the normative human rights framework and the imperative of improving people's lives. Mr President, Contempt for the human being reaches agonizing levels when war breaks out, and violence becomes a daily occurrence. One quarter of humanity is living today in places affected by conflict, and it is civilians who suffer the most. Peace is precious and it is fragile \u2013 and we must nurture it. First and foremost, by respecting the Charter of the United Nations and international law, including international human rights law. The war in Ukraine has led to civilian casualties and destruction of a shocking magnitude. The rights of Ukrainians will be harmed for generations to come, and the war\u2019s impact on fuel and food prices, as well as geopolitical tensions, are impacting negatively on people in every region of the world. That such damage could once again be done across the world by warfare in Europe is a betrayal of the promises of transformative change made at our foundation over 75 years ago. I will be speaking in detail on the situation in Ukraine at the end of March. Twelve long years of excruciating bloodshed: Syria is a microcosm of the wounds inflicted by utmost contempt for human rights. Last month's earthquakes have added to this tragedy. The only way forward must be through respect for human rights, and proper accountability of all those who have committed atrocity crimes \u2013 both of which Syria has long lacked. I fully support calls for a new institution that is focused on clarifying the fate and whereabouts of missing persons, and providing support to victims, and I urge the Government \u2013 as well as other Member States \u2013 to cooperate with it, if it is indeed established. The security situation in Mali is particularly alarming in the central part of the country and the border area between Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. In this area, numerous armed groups are capitalizing on intercommunal hostility, and the absence of State authorities to expand their influence and carry out attacks against civilians. Armed non-state groups have perpetrated most violations and abuses. Serious violations have also been committed by the Malian Armed Forces, in some instances accompanied by foreign military and security personnel. I am also very worried by hate speech on ethnic grounds, as well as threats, intimidation, and attacks against civil society and media by State and non-state actors,\u00a0leading to an increasing fear of speaking out. This is particularly concerning given that the country is embarking on an electoral process where a free debate of ideas should flourish. I am concerned about the prospect of deepening instability in Burkina Faso. Over the last six months of 2022, my Office documented at least 1,076 victims of violations and abuses. That toll almost doubled in the months between October and December, compared to the previous three months. Armed groups are responsible for most of these incidents, but the military's operations take a growing toll on civilians. I have urged the authorities to listen to the grievances people have regarding impunity, and to investigate such allegations. It is critical to reverse the course of ever-increasing violence, and to allow civil society and political parties to thrive. In Ethiopia , the welcome implementation of the cessation of hostilities agreement needs to be fully effected, including on transitional justice. I am glad to report that National Consultations on Transitional Justice Policy Options opened yesterday, with the support of my Office; to be followed by consultations across the country with people who have been affected by the conflict. Despite this progress, we have received reports of the continued presence in Tigray of the Amhara Regional Forces and Fano militia, as well as Eritrean Defence Forces, which have reportedly perpetrated very serious violations. There is a clear need for continued monitoring and reporting. There also needs to be tangible progress on accountability regarding conflict-related violations and abuses \u2013 including in implementation of the report by my Office and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. The human rights situation in other regions of Ethiopia is also of great concern, particularly Oromia. In addition to Eritrea \u2019s continued military presence in Tigray, we have received reports that Eritrea is further increasing its use of forced and prolonged conscription, a practice that is akin to enslavement and the main driver of refugee outflows. This needs to be reversed, urgently, for the country to be placed on a path for sustainable development. In Yemen, the parties need to heed the calls of a population exhausted by eight years of brutal warfare, and move decisively towards a UN-led peace process. For any peace agreement to be durable, transitional justice and accountability are fundamental, and women must be able to participate fully in such talks. Two UN staff members \u2013 one from UNESCO and one from my own Office \u2013 have been detained for 16 months and must be released at once. In Libya , widespread violence by armed actors, a longstanding political impasse, and an increasingly restrictive civic space continue to destroy lives and severely harm rights. The Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya will present its final report at the end of this session, and it is urgent for the authorities to implement its recommendations without delay. On Western Sahara, my Office continues remote monitoring of the human rights situation. Given that the most recent visit by the Office took place almost eight years ago, it is crucial for my Office to be able to undertake again meaningful missions to the region. In recent months, I have had the opportunity to discuss the worrying human rights situation in Kashmir with both India and Pakistan . Progress on human rights, and justice for the past, will be key to advancing security and development. I will continue to explore how my Office can assist, including through meaningful access to the region. The people of Haiti endure conditions of nightmarish violence. Heavily armed gangs control services and access in large sections of the capital and the country \u2013 perpetrating frequent killings, abductions, random sniper attacks and a horrifying level of sexual violence. The situation calls for a combination of responses: turbo-charging the political process towards free and transparent elections; fully implementing the arms embargo; effective sanctions against those who sponsor and direct armed gangs; and international support to build up the capacity of Haiti\u2019s police and judicial systems to fight pervasive impunity and corruption; as well as the deployment of a time-bound specialized support force, with human rights safeguards. We must keep Haiti in our focus, including in support to my Office\u2019s work on the ground. Mr President, Discrimination and racism are virulent threats, both to human dignity and to our relationships as human beings. They weaponize contempt. They humiliate and violate human rights, fuelling grievances and despair, and obstructing development. I am shocked to the core by the contempt for women, and women's equality, that is spawned across the Internet by some so-called \u201cinfluencers\u201d, feeding social attitudes that make it possible to ignore, or even condone, gender-based violence, and the pervasive commodification of women. More generally, the scope and magnitude of discrimination against women and girls makes this one of the most overwhelming human rights violations worldwide, and dismantling it will be a major focus of our work. The repression of women in Afghanistan is unparalleled, contravening every established belief system. Women and girls\u2019 rights to make choices about their lives and participate in public life have been, or are being, eliminated as we speak. This repression and persecution of women constitute a clenched fist around Afghanistan\u2019s economy and its future. Such a tyranny must not escape accountability. We will not give up; we will continue to fight for respect for the rights and freedoms of every Afghan woman and girl. In Iran, it is urgent for the authorities to act on the demands of protestors, in particular women and girls, who continue to endure profound discrimination. I remain deeply concerned\u00a0about 17\u00a0protestors\u00a0who have reportedly been sentenced to death; 4 have been executed so far, and more than 100 currently face charges that carry the death penalty.\u00a0The recently announced pardons are a welcome first step. I continue to urge the immediate\u00a0and unconditional\u00a0release of all those arbitrarily detained in the context of the protests and more generally \u2013 including foreign and dual nationals.\u00a0All Iranians \u2013 including all women and girls\u00a0\u2013 must be free to make their own choices, express their views and exercise their rights. I welcome the new law passed by Sierra Leone in November that prohibits gender discrimination; mandates at least 30 percent women in Parliament, the diplomatic corps, local councils and the civil service; and establishes equal pay for women, among a host of other steps. Many far more wealthy States could learn from this example. I also welcome Spain \u2019s adoption last month of legislation to uphold essential sexual and reproductive rights, including by removing restrictions on access to safe abortion. The new measures also address access by all women to assisted reproduction, as well as violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity; and they ban so-called \"conversion therapies\" and the genital mutilation of babies who are born intersex. Vicious hate speech is not only directed at women and girls, but also people of African descent; Jews; Muslims; LGBTIQ+ people; refugees; migrants; and many other people from minority groups. Deliberate provocations, such as recent incidents of burning the Qu'ran, are intended to drive wedges between communities. And this is dangerous. The violence that is so disproportionately inflicted on people of African descent by law enforcement officers is an example of the deep structural harm rooted in racial discrimination . My Office and UN human rights mechanisms have repeatedly highlighted excessive use of force, racial profiling and discriminatory practices by police, most recently in Australia , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom . In Brazil, overall deaths in encounters with police fell in 2021 for the first time in 9 years, with a 31% drop for \"white\" people, according to one source \u2013 but a rise of almost 6% in the number of deaths of Afro-descendants. In the United States, people of African descent are reportedly almost three times more likely to be killed by police than are \"white\" people. The brutal death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis two months ago stood out not just because of the severity of the violence caught on tape, but because it was followed by immediate action to prosecute the officers involved, while generally only a fraction of such cases lead to those responsible being brought to justice. In the US and all other countries, swift and determined action to hold perpetrators accountable in each case should be the rule, not the exception. Structural safeguards must be set up, including independent oversight, effective complaint procedures, and robust legislative reform. But even the strongest actions within law enforcement will not fully succeed unless further concrete steps are taken to address racism and the structures that perpetuate it throughout our societies. Police forces need to serve and protect everyone in society. In the Philippines , where killings in drug-related police operations still occur, my Office is working with security actors to strengthen accountability and promote human rights in drug enforcement. The Government has announced steps to vet senior police officers for corruption, and I hope there will be rapid progress in prosecuting human rights violators. While I welcome recent acquittals of human rights defenders, there must be an end to other politically motivated charges, and a safer environment for civil society. Mr President, Structural injustices, abject poverty and skyrocketing inequalities constitute pervasive human rights failures. I\u2019d like to mention a few examples. Lebanon is in the throes of one of the worst economic crises in modern history, with more than half of the population now said to be living below the poverty line, and two million people facing food insecurity. Many public sector services have been halted; access to education and healthcare are becoming luxuries; and electricity is scarce. I urge stronger efforts to fight corruption, anchor economic and financial regulation in the rule of law, and firmly embed accountability and transparency into all economic measures. Serious investigation into the explosion of August 2020 is urgently needed, without political interference or further delay. In Sri Lanka, debilitating debt, and economic crisis, have sharply restricted people's access to fundamental economic and social rights. Recovery policies will need to redress inequalities, and invest in social protections and other levers of economic resilience. They should also tackle underlying issues of corruption, transparency and accountability in governance, as well as entrenched impunity. The reliance on draconian security laws, as well as the harassment and surveillance of civil society and victims, must end. My Office remains committed to supporting a genuine and comprehensive approach to transitional justice. Many countries in southern Africa have been hard-hit by successive economic blows, including from COVID-19; rising food, fuel and fertilizer prices due to the war in Ukraine; and spiralling debt repayment. In a region that is the world's most unequal, these shocks are pushing millions more people into poverty. Surging inflation in Mauritius , for example, has led to unprecedented public protests. Energy shortages have led to severe power cuts in several countries, with negative impact on business, healthcare and water supplies. South Africa last month declared its energy crisis a national state of disaster. At the same time, courts in South Africa are helping to chart a way forward on the legal foundation of economic, social and cultural rights. While numerous countries in the Global North are also experiencing poverty, people in the United Kingdom are currently experiencing a cost of living crisis that may result in the largest drop in living standards on record. Racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected. I welcome measures taken by the Government to provide some relief from increased fuel costs and raise the minimum wage, but I encourage more dialogue with striking workers, and with people living in poverty, as well as reforms that advance economic, social and cultural rights. To face these challenges of structural injustice and inequalities, we need to build economies that build trust in government and advance people\u2019s rights and well-being. A human rights economy is one in which the aim of advancing human rights informs all national economic, fiscal, monetary, investment and business decisions. Such national measures will bring immense benefit to millions of people. But they cannot hope to address the global debt emergency that has hit developing countries, in particular, like a runaway train. The impact on their people is crushing hopes and lives. Dramatically scaled-up financing, as well as reforms of the international financial institutions, are urgently needed to meet these challenges, and my Office will strongly advocate human rights-based change. The Bridgetown Initiative by Barbados stands out for its clear vision of economic justice and new methods for international financing bodies. Mr President, Harsh restriction of the civic space is the Achilles heel \u2013 the fatal weakness \u2013 of governance. If I have one message to deliver to every Head of State or Government it is this: listen to the people \u2013 and in particular, to victims and defenders of human rights. These are people who have the deepest experience of these issues, and they have something to say that you need to hear. I am alarmed by the number and range of countries in which I must report steps that undercut institutions of justice, media freedoms, and the space for fundamental civic freedoms. Allow me to begin on a positive note. In Tanzania, progress has been made in opening up civic and democratic space over the past two years. Bans on media outlets and political rallies have been lifted, and reform of restrictive legislation is promised. Tanzania still faces many challenges, and I welcome the President's commitment to dialogue. More needs to be done to address accountability and other human rights issues, including the Ngorongoro and Loliondo situations. Zambia has also taken positive steps towards greater respect for human rights and the rule of law. They include numerous amendments and enactments of legislation, among them abolition of the death penalty and removal of provisions that criminalise \u201cdefamation of the President\u201d. I look forward to working with the National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up,\u00a0and encourage measures to foster peaceful dialogue between political parties. I also urge both political leaders and the media to back away from increasing polarisation and ethnic division. International financial institutions must recognize that Zambia \u2013 like several other countries \u2013 urgently needs debt relief to consolidate its progress. In Kenya , some advances have been made towards accountability for serious human rights violations. I encourage more concrete progress to deliver justice, in line with the Government\u2019s commitments. Yet, in the Russian Federation , I am deeply concerned by multiple trends. The closures of the newspaper Novaya Gazeta and the Moscow Helsinki Groups are another sign of the demise of Russia's civic space. Constant pro-war messages on State media feed stereotypes and incite hatred and violence. Over 180 criminal cases have been opened on charges related to alleged defamation of the Armed Forces; those convicted so far include a journalist and a municipal councillor. Since December, any person or entity considered to be \u201cunder foreign influence\u201d \u2013 an overly wide and vague qualification \u2013 can be designated as a \"foreign agent\u201d and subjected to numerous restrictions. In December, in a troubling development, legislation prohibiting so-called \u201cpropaganda of non-traditional relationships\u201d was extended, to cover information, to anyone, about LGBTIQ+ relationships and sexuality, as well as gender transitioning. I am also worried by growing agitation against the rights of LGBTIQ+ individuals in many countries, mostly recently in East Africa \u2013 including rhetoric by politicians that incites hatred, and crackdowns on LGBTIQ+ organisations. Last week a very troubling draft so-called \"Anti-Homosexuality\" Bill was tabled in Uganda 's Parliament, while in Burundi , 24 people were arrested in a crackdown, many of them engaged in AIDS education. It is unthinkable that we are facing such bigotry, prejudice and discrimination in the 21 st century, holding back development of all members of society. In Tajikistan , independent journalists and bloggers have been sentenced to between 7 and 21 years in jail, on charges related to terrorism and extremism, in a deepening crackdown on freedom of expression. The trials were closed, but do not appear to have presented substantial evidence of any crime. In Bangladesh , I regret the increasing incidence of political violence, coupled with arbitrary arrests of political activists, and ongoing harassment of human rights defenders and media personnel in the build up to the elections this year. Following lengthy consultations with my Office on the Digital Security Act, I urge that it be amended, as criminal sentences continue to be handed down against those exercising their rights to free expression and belief. In Cambodia, the Government continues to suppress political opposition, human rights defenders and independent media. This has been exemplified by the closure of the Voice of Democracy media outlet and the extraordinarily heavy sentence imposed last week on opposition leader Kem Sokha, on questionable charges. These actions seriously undermine the civic and political space, including the environment for free and fair elections in July. In Tunisia , I am concerned by recent harsh crackdowns in which judges, media, civil society actors, opposition members and labour leaders have been prosecuted \u2013 including\u00a0before military courts \u2013 for allegations that include national security crimes and terrorism.\u00a0This trajectory of shrinking civic space, and the space for trade unions to defend workers' rights, must be reversed. More recently, a country-wide wave of arrests and attacks, coupled with dehumanising and racist rhetoric, has targeted migrants,\u00a0mostly coming from south of the Sahara. I acknowledge the authorities have announced two days ago some measures to support migrants. \u00a0In addition, I urge full investigation of all attacks, as well as a halt to xenophobic hate speech. In Egypt ,\u00a0continuing restrictions on civic space include crackdowns on dissent,\u00a0 arbitrary detention, and action to censor and block websites.\u00a0Lengthy sentences were\u00a0handed down two days ago to several people\u00a0carrying out human rights advocacy,\u00a0in proceedings on\u00a0questionable terrorism-related charges which also raised fair trial concerns. Building on Egypt's National Strategy\u00a0for Human Rights,\u00a0I urge the authorities to release all those arbitrarily detained, and to lift restrictions on civic space. In Peru , at least 60 people were killed and over a thousand injured in clashes with security forces and at roadblocks during recent protests. The underlying grievances, including discrimination and exclusion, particularly affect indigenous peoples, rural campesino s and the urban poor. Recent initiatives by the Government, such as the creation of a commission to provide economic support to families of those killed and injured, should be expanded to ensure accountability, truth and full reparation for all victims. My Office is ready to support meaningful dialogue about the underlying issues. Regarding China, we have opened up channels of communication with a range of actors to follow up\u00a0on a variety of human rights issues, including the protection of minorities, such as for Tibetans, Uyghurs and other groups. In the Xinjiang region, my\u00a0Office has\u00a0documented grave concerns \u2013 notably large-scale arbitrary detentions and ongoing family separations \u2013 and has made important recommendations that require concrete follow-up.\u00a0We also have concerns about the severe restrictions of civic space\u00a0more generally, including the arbitrary detention of\u00a0human rights defenders and lawyers; and the impact of\u00a0the National Security Law\u00a0in Hong Kong. Mr President, Combatting climate change and upholding the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment are the defining struggles of our generation. Again, I would like to share a few examples. Somalia is currently enduring a historic drought, with agonizing impact on the lives and rights of millions of people. Last year, almost 1.2 million Somalis left their homes because of lack of rain. Competition among pastoralists for scarce natural resources is a driver of conflict: since 2020 at least 237 people have been killed in clan violence related to land, pasture or water. The situation is exacerbated by the Al-Shabaab armed group, which targets water sources and infrastructure to punish communities perceived to support the Government . In all, a projected 8.3 million people across Somalia are expected to be in acute need of food assistancem or other assistance, between April and June this year. In the Sahel region , a recent report by my Office outlines the profound impact of climate change-related soil degradation and declining food production on income, health, resource competition, conflict, and displacement \u2013 a vicious cycle that now spins deeper with every planting season. Temperatures in the Sahel are rising much faster than the global average; even if the global temperature rise is kept to an unlikely 1.5 degrees, the impact on the people of the Sahel will be permanent and devastating. Iraq is also suffering profound damage from climate change, with sharply increasing temperatures, less rainfall, and more dust storms. Water flow in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers has decreased by 29 percent and 73 percent respectively, with dam projects in the region an additional factor. According to technical experts at the Second Baghdad Water Conference last year, 7 million Iraqis risk being unable to meet their water needs in the near future. I am also concerned about the shrinking space for free expression in the country. Pacific Island States and other small island developing countries have led the world in advocating for climate action, including a\u00a0regional framework to prevent and respond to displacement, which my Office is helping to support. I note in particular Vanuatu \u2019s initiative to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice\u00a0on the obligations of States to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse effects of climate change. Transparent governance is critical, to repair harms and build resilience. Climate finance funds need to reach those most affected and most vulnerable, and they need to build in strong human rights safeguards. And we must call out fake climate solutions. I deplore the attempts by the fossil fuel industry at global climate talks and elsewhere to greenwash their reputation and derail our goal of decarbonization. This must be averted at the upcoming COP28 in Dubai , and we need inclusive, safe and meaningful participation of civil society. In every country, I strongly encourage the following. Public access to information on environmental risks and Government policies. Full participation and consultation on environmental laws and measures \u2013 notably for indigenous peoples and others who are first in line for climate harms. And protection of those who raise concerns over environmental crimes, or policies that result in harm. Bashing climate protests; designing laws that unfairly restrict activities that call the public's attention to climate harms; and allowing attacks on activists to go unpunished : these are tactics that harm all States and all human beings. And they need to be addressed, urgently. Mr President, Conflict, discrimination, poverty, restrictions on civic space and the triple planetary crisis. We face the compounding effects of all these crises \u2013 while also confronting a surge of new human rights challenges, notably in the digital realm and involving artificial intelligence and surveillance. Fresh thinking, political leadership, renewed commitments, and dramatically scaled-up financing \u2014 with the centrality of human rights at their core \u2014 are urgently needed to meet these challenges. Let us use this year of human rights anniversaries to go the extra mile. Thank you.

{"year":"2023","month":"02","event_desc":"50 ethnic Amharas killed by Oromo militants in the Oromia region.","text":"Ethiopia commission accuses Oromiya rebels of killing 50 people By Reuters February 21, 2023 6:41 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link ADDIS ABABA, Feb 15 (Reuters) - (This Feb. 15 story has been corrected to say the commission report indicated members of the Amhara ethnic group were targeted in the attack) At least 50 people were killed in Ethiopia's Oromiya region this month in an attack by a banned rebel group, the state-appointed human rights commission said on Wednesday. Sign up here. Oromiya is home to Ethiopia's largest ethnic group and has experienced unrest for many years, rooted in grievances about political marginalisation and neglect by the central government. The killings on Feb. 2 mainly targeted internally displaced persons from the Amhara ethnic group in the town of Ano, about 380 km (235 miles) west of the capital Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said in a report. The report, which cited families of the victims, witnesses and government bodies, blamed the attack on the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). The Amhara, whose region borders Oromiya, are Ethiopia's second-biggest ethnic group. There has been tit-for-tat violence perpetrated by Oromo and Amhara militias in recent years, often targeting civilians. The OLA did not respond to a request for comment. The OLA is an outlawed splinter group of the Oromo Liberation Front, a formerly banned opposition party that returned from exile after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018. Ethiopia government spokesman Legesse Tulu also did not respond to a request for comment. The violence in Oromiya is separate from the two-year conflict between the federal government and forces in the northern Tigray region, which ended in November following a peace agreement between the government and Tigray forces.

The violence erupted against a backdrop of tensions in the ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church after rebel bishops created their own synod in Oromia, the country's most populous region. Abune Henok, Archbishop of Addis Ababa Diocese, described the incidents in the Oromia city of Shashamene as \"shameful and heart-wrenching,\" according to the Church-affiliated Tewahedo Media Center (TMC). The TMC said two Orthodox Christian youths had been killed, and another four people injured, when Oromia special forces attacked the church in Shashamene, which lies about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Addis Ababa. It later said there had been sniper fire on the church from nearby high-rise buildings that had killed a woman and injured others. It was not possible to independently verify the reports. Henok called on the authorities in Oromia, also the largest geographic region in Ethiopia, to stop the \"persecution\" of Orthodox Christians, according to the TMC. A statement issued by the Holy Synod later urged clergy and the faithful to wear black in protest and called for peaceful demonstrations at churches at home and abroad on February 12. The unity of the Ethiopian Church, one of the oldest in the world and which accounts for about 40 percent of the country's 115 million population, is under threat after the move by the rebel clergy last month. The Church, headed by Patriarch Abune Mathias for a decade, has declared the breakaway synod illegal and excommunicated the bishops involved. It has also accused the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of interfering in its affairs and making comments that effectively recognized the \"illegitimate group.\u201d Addressing cabinet members earlier in the week, Abiy \u2014 who is himself from the Oromo community \u2014 called for the rivals to engage in dialogue and said both sides had their \"own truths.\u201d The breakaway bishops accuse the church of discrimination and linguistic and cultural hegemony, saying congregations in Oromia are not served in their native language, claims rejected by the patriarchate. Orthodox leaders have long complained of religious persecution, including the burning of churches several years ago, and relations with the government have been tense in the past, including over the Tigray conflict. The World Council of Churches issued a statement Friday voicing \"deep concern\" about the developments in the Ethiopian institution. \"We call upon all political leaders in Ethiopia to support the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in its efforts to achieve unity and peace among its members,\" WCC general secretary Jerry Pillay said.

Violence erupted at the border of North Shewa and Oromia special zones in Amhara region last week, resulting in days of violence and at least 98 reported fatalities. According to a local administrator in Oromia special zone, on 20 January, Amhara regional special forces shot and killed seven ethnic Oromo youths in Muti Fata village (identified as Jawaa by some sources), near Senbete in Jile Timuga woreda, following a disagreement and accusation that they were connected with the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF)-Shane. The next day, Oromo gunmen suspected to have links with the OLF-Shane attacked Jewaha Negeso kebele in Eferatana Gidem woreda, North Shewa zone. Clashes between the group and state security forces and their affiliated forces lasted for two days and reportedly resulted in the killings of at least 28 members of Amhara regional special forces and six members of the federal police. On 23 January, the conflict expanded to neighboring areas. In Oromia special zone, armed clashes between armed factions were recorded in Senebet, Majete, Chire, Chefa Robit, and around Kemise town, while in North Shewa zone, armed clashes were recorded in Ataye and Shewa Robit towns and their surrounding areas, as well as Balchit, Mesino Hagere Mariam kebele, Chekchek Kebele, Jewaha Negeso kebele, and Kewet (see map below). The fighting continued until 25 January. According to the administrator of Jile Timuga woreda, 98 civilians were killed, and 155 people were injured in Oromia special zone alone. Additionally, around 1,930 houses were damaged due to violence in the area last week. Following the violence, the Amhara regional government vowed to take retaliatory actions against the \u201canti-peace forces\u201d that had attacked both security forces and civilians. In a statement, the OLF party accused government forces of instigating the violence when they allegedly opened fire at farmers in Jile Timuga woreda in Oromia special zone. The OLF party representative called for a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d as, according to the party, the conflict in this area is a \u201cpolitical conspiracy.\u201d Moreover, the spokesperson of the OLF-Shane \u2013 also known as the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) \u2013 stated that the OLF-Shane does not have forces in the area and refuted the accusation that forces from the group had attacked Amhara regional special forces. He also blamed Amhara regional special forces and Fano militias for instigating the violence. Similarly, the National Movement of Amhara blamed \u201cforces which are supported by government institutions\u201d for attacking the security forces and condemned the Amhara regional government for failing to protect civilians and \u201cfor not finding a sustainable solution to resolving the conflict\u201d in the area. However, Enat Party, All Ethiopian Unity Party, and Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party accused the OLF-Shane of instigating the recent round of violence in the region. The Oromia special zone of Amhara region is a site of frequent violence. The special zone is inhabited and administered by ethnic Oromos despite being located within Amhara region, a point of contention between residents of nearby towns and villages. EPO has tracked and reported on multiple rounds of violence in this area since 2021 (see EPO Weekly: 16-22 April 2022; EPO Weekly: 10-16 April 2021; and EPO Weekly: 1-7 May 2021). In 2021, the area was briefly controlled by OLF-Shane and Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front forces in a rare joint operation. The complete picture of the most recent round of violence and its consequences are unknown due to reporting delays. But it is reported that hundreds of thousands of civilians were forced to flee their homes following the violence. The main road connecting Addis Ababa to Dessie (A2 highway) was closed for days. Reports indicate that the violence has since subsided and the area is currently calm. In Oromia region, on 24 January, an unidentified armed group burned Bato Degaga Saint Gorgis Church around Awash Melkasa in East Shewa zone. ACLED has recorded no other events in the region last week. In Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples region (SNNPR), on 25 January, the OLF-Shane entered and attacked Gedeb town in Gedeo zone, released prisoners from two prisons, looted weapons, and broke into six banks. The attack continued into the early morning hours of the next day. Five people, including a police officer and four civilians, were killed due to this attack. The spokesperson of the OLF-Shane (OLA) confirmed that OLF-Shane forces conducted an attack against the federal and regional forces\u2019 camp in Gedeb. Lastly, on 27 January, a traditional conflict resolution ceremony was held between Burji and Borena communities. On 4 June 2022, ethnic Burji rioters beat to death 10 ethnic Oromo civilians from Guji zone and injured 20 others at Soyama town market in Burji special woreda in SNNPR. Since this incident, the road connecting the communities has been closed, and interactions between the two communities have been limited. During the ceremony, the traditional leaders agreed to open the road and allow the two communities to resume attending markets together.

He was not in the fighting zone nor was he fighting.\u201d Another resident of Haro town, Yesuf Tesfaye (name changed) recounted the incident as follows: \u201cThey (OSF) attacked us from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm. They killed our people (Amharas), too many to count using dishka and brail. Even women and children who could not fight were hit by mortar [shells] in the middle of the town. Among the dead, I knew Ismail (40-years old) who was killed by mortar shells while staying in the town and Suleiman Indris (15 years-old) who was killed by heavy artillery. We have counted 25 dead people so far. Many more were injured. 12 heavily injured people are being taken to Amhara Region on foot. We are still hearing that they (OSF) are preparing to come and attack us again.\u201d Haile Getachew (name changed), a severely wounded survivor and hospitalized at Tibebe Ghion Hospital (Bahir Dar city, Amhara Region) recounted the situation to AAA\u2019s investigators as follows: \u201cFighting began when they (the OSF) came and attacked the town (Haro). The fighting took place on the outskirts of the town. We went there to help defend the town. We started heading back to town thinking they (the OSF) had retreated and the attack had ended. Suddenly, they (the OSF) shot my friend, Yimene (deceased). As I was dragging him to safety, a brail bullet shot me in my leg below the knee. I fell on my back and a second bullet hit me on the same part. A third bullet struck me on the edge of my testicle and went up around my kidney. Now my leg is broken. Another guy named Ismail was shot dead in front of me. Dessalegn Tibebu, who is here (Tibebe Ghion Hospital), was shot in the mouth next to me. I saw the fighters who shot us all. They wore the special police (OSF) uniforms, their weapons were mostly brail but also had dishka, snipers, and even mortars.\u201d Read Full Report ...

{"year":"2023","month":"02","event_desc":"Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed met with officials of the Tigray People's Liberation Front for the first time since the signing of a peace treaty in November.","text":"Ethiopia PM holds first meeting with Tigray leaders since peace deal Nairobi (AFP) \u2013 Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and other government officials on Friday held their first meeting with Tigrayan leaders since a November peace deal, officials and state media said. Issued on: 03\/02\/2023 - 18:10 Modified: 03\/02\/2023 - 18:08 1 min Advertising Read more The two sides evaluated \"actions carried out on the implementation of the Pretoria and Nairobi peace agreements so far\" and discussed issues that \"need further attention,\" the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation said. The meeting took place at a resort in southern Ethiopia, it said. A peace deal between Abiy's government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) signed in South Africa's capital Pretoria in November last year silenced the guns in northern Ethiopia. Under the terms of the agreement, the TPLF agreed to disarm and re-establish the authority of the federal government in return for the restoration of access to Tigray, which was largely cut off from the outside world during the two-year war. Abiy's national security adviser Redwan Hussein said on Twitter that Abiy and other government officials \"met today and held discussion with TPLF delegation regarding the progress of the peace process.\" \"As a result, PM Abiy passed decisions about increasing Flights, Banking & other issues that would boost trust & ease lives of civilians,\" he tweeted. Since the deal was signed, there has been a limited resumption of aid deliveries to Tigray, which has long faced dire shortages of food, fuel, cash and medicines. Basic services such as communications, banking and electricity are slowly being restored to the stricken region of six million people, with the national carrier Ethiopian Airlines resuming commercial flights between Addis Ababa and Tigray's capital Mekele last month. While the TPLF announced it has begun disarming, local residents and aid workers say the Eritrean army and forces from the neighbouring region of Amhara remain in parts of Tigray and accuse them of murder, rape and looting. Access to Tigray is restricted, and it is impossible to independently verify the situation on the ground. \u00a9 2023 AFP Share :","question":"What were the key agreements discussed during the meeting between Abiy Ahmed and Tigrayan leaders in February 2023?","answer":"They discussed the implementation of the Pretoria and Nairobi peace agreements, including increasing flights, banking access, and other measures to improve civilian life.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u134c\u1265\u1229\u12cb\u122a 2023 \u12a0\u1262\u12ed \u12a0\u1205\u1218\u12f5 \u12a5\u1293 \u12e8\u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed \u12a0\u1218\u122b\u122e\u127d \u1218\u12ab\u12a8\u120d \u1260\u1270\u12f0\u1228\u1308\u12cd \u1235\u1265\u1230\u1263 \u12cd\u1235\u1325 \u12e8\u1270\u12c8\u12eb\u12e9\u1275 \u1241\u120d\u134d \u1235\u121d\u121d\u1290\u1276\u127d \u121d\u1295 \u1290\u1260\u1229?","answer_translated":"\u12e8\u1355\u122c\u1276\u122a\u12eb \u12a5\u1293 \u12e8\u1293\u12ed\u122e\u1262 \u12e8\u1230\u120b\u121d \u1235\u121d\u121d\u1290\u1276\u127d\u1295 \u1275\u130d\u1260\u122b \u1260\u1270\u1218\u1208\u12a8\u1270 \u1270\u12c8\u12eb\u12ed\u1270\u12cb\u120d\u1362 \u12ed\u1205\u121d \u12e8\u12a0\u12e8\u122d \u1260\u1228\u122b\u12ce\u127d\u1295 \u1218\u1328\u1218\u122d\u1363 \u12e8\u1263\u1295\u12ad \u12a0\u1308\u120d\u130d\u120e\u1275 \u1218\u12f3\u1228\u123b \u12a5\u1293 \u12e8\u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u1291\u122e\u1295 \u1208\u121b\u123b\u123b\u120d \u12e8\u121a\u12eb\u1235\u127d\u1209 \u120c\u120e\u127d \u12a5\u122d\u121d\u1303\u12ce\u127d\u1295 \u12eb\u12ab\u1275\u1273\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u134c\u1265\u1229\u12cb\u122a 2023 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1232\u1273\u12e9 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u12f0\u1228\u1308\u12cd \u1235\u1265\u1230\u1263 \u1260\u12a0\u1262\u12ed \u12a0\u1205\u1218\u12f5 \u12a5\u1293 \u12e8\u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed \u12a0\u1218\u122b\u122e\u127d \u1265\u1214\u122b\u12ca \u1218\u12ab\u12a8\u120d \u1270\u12f0\u1228\u130b \u1241\u120d\u134d \u1235\u121d\u121d\u1290\u1276\u127d \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u12f0\u1228\u1308 \u1235\u1265\u1230\u1263 \u1270\u1240\u1263\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u12f0\u1228\u1308 \u1235\u1265\u1230\u1263 \u1270\u1240\u1263\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and repetitive, failing to provide any clear or relevant information about the key agreements discussed in the meeting between Abiy Ahmed and Tigrayan leaders in February 2023.

{"year":"2023","month":"03","event_desc":"OCHA classified locations (woredas) occupied by 600,000 Amhara IDPs as hotspots.","text":"Ethiopia Ethiopia - Situation Report, 20 Mar 2023 Format Situation Report Source OCHA Posted 20 Mar 2023 Originally published 20 Mar 2023 Attachments Download Report (PDF | 5.75 MB) HIGHLIGHTS Resumption of banking, telecommunication, and fuel services expanding in geographic coverage and scope in Tigray. Tens of thousands of displaced families in North Shewa and Oromo Special Zone, Amhara Region remain in critical need of urgent humanitarian assistance. At least 23 woredas in Afar have reportedly exceeded the malaria monthly average threshold of the last five years. A 30 per cent increase in cholera cases in Oromia and Somali seen in January alone. Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) disease outbreak reported in Southern Region. Situation Overview People in need in northern Ethiopia continue to receive food and non-food item assistance, notwithstanding challenges to reach many. In Tigray, at least 5.2 million people have received food assistance between early October 2022 and 13 February, while a new cycle of food distribution that started on 30 December 2022 has reached 16 per cent of the targeted 5.4 million people as of 15 February. Timely verification and inclusion of vulnerable caseloads in food assistance has been one of the main challenges, particularly for urban displacement in the region. This is due to fluid population movements, high number of displaced people, unreachability of certain areas, and lack of documentation among affected populations, among others, causing delays in food distribution in some locations. Partners are also working to rehabilitate food distribution and storage facilities that were destroyed by the conflict in newly accessible areas so that communities can receive their food without traveling long distance to reach alternative distribution points. Meanwhile, merely 1.77 million people in Amhara Region (out of the targeted 2.55 million) have been receiving food assistance since mid-November 2022. Delayed relief food distribution and incomplete baskets continue to be a challenge in some areas of the region. The Government and partners are working to address issues of varying capacities and efficiency of the relief responses of operational partners that cover different geographic areas. In Afar Region, nearly 596,700 people (out of the targeted 664,339 people) have been receiving food assistance since November 2022. In Tigray, humanitarian access continues to gradually improve since November 2022 allowing partners to reach more people. A joint rapid response delivered non-food humanitarian supplies in the Eastern Zone (parts of Fatsi, Zalanbesa, and Erob) while some kebeles remain hard to reach as of 9 February. The resumption of some services has also continued and is expanding in geographic coverage and scope across Tigray. Mobile (telecom) services have resumed in nearly all towns, pending in some border towns or areas where infrastructure maintenance is ongoing, including Fatsi, Zalambesa, Dowhan, Rama, Chila and Grehu Sirnay.Government and private banks have also started banking services in major towns as of 7 February. Government and partners have jointly reported that as of 6 February, more than 4,088 trucks of humanitarian cargo and fuel had arrived in Tigray, and more than half of the gas stations in Mekelle are reported to have resumed services. Moreover, the price of consumer supplies in Mekelle and other towns is stabilising, as commercial trucks continue to enter the region. Humanitarian partners reported incidents related to the presence of unexploded ordnances (UXOs) early February in two sites in Adihageray and two others in Egela Woreda resulting in several casualties and three deaths. Partners in collaboration with regional mine action support have increased awareness activities to ensure safety of the affected people including women and children. OCHA is coordinating support from national defence authorities and regional bureaus for IDP site clearing and mobilizing humanitarian partners for mine awareness creation and response. Population displacements have reached a new high in Amhara, since January 2023 leaving 169,686 people displaced in four woredas of Oromia Special Zone (Wello) and 213,000 in five woredas of North Shewa Zone. According to authorities, tens of thousands of families are in critical need of shelter and non-food-item (NFI) assistance. While an estimated 20,000 people have received about 3,000 quintals of food in North Shewa, the majority in the two zones still require support, including water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), as well as food, shelter and non-food items and protection services. The Jara IDP site in North Wello Zone, Amhara continues to receive more displaced people (now at 8,000 people). Response with water, food and basic health and nutrition assistance remains limited in partner number and scale of assistance. In addition, intercommunal fighting had built up near the site early February. Alternative site options as well as a scale-up of humanitarian assistance are required. Similarly, further support is needed for IDPs in other parts of Amhara. In Wag Hamra Zone, partners have commenced humanitarian assistance in Beltarf village, Abergele woreda, whereby more than 550 households (HHs) consisting of IDPs and host community are presumed to have access to clean and safe water from a borehole rehabilitated in February. Complementarily Wag Hamra zonal authorities have commenced the return of 1,200 IDPs to accessible kebeles, including Saqa and 03-Debre Birhan, in Abergele Woreda as of 15 February 2023. Return facilitation including support to return voluntariness, transportation, shelter rehabilitation and reconstruction, agriculture, and adequate public services remain as key areas for intervention in return areas. It is noted, however, that further returns are on hold until adequate return responses are prepared. Food, NFI, cash support, functional social services are identified as critical conditions pre and post return. Afar continues to grapple with a Malaria epidemic with more than 3,600 confirmed cases reported in 36 woredas in several zones as of 7 February, a 7 per cent increase in cases in just one week. Similarly, at least 23 woredas(including in zones 1, 2, and 4) have reportedly exceeded the malaria monthly average threshold of the last 5 years.Insecticide-treated nets (ITN), diagnostic tests (RDTs) and effective medication like Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) are insufficient or not available and need to be mobilized.

A viable peace process must address humanitarian crisis, political conflict and atrocities all at once. Friday, March 17, 2023 \/ By: Susan Stigant Publication Type: Analysis and Commentary Share This Print the Page Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s talks in Ethiopia and his announcement of new U.S. aid this week advance vital steps for building peace in the country and greater stability in East Africa. Yet those tasks remain arduous and will require difficult compromises on all sides in Ethiopia\u2019s conflicts. U.S. and international policymakers face a tough calculation over how to mesh critical goals: restoring full trade and economic assistance to help Ethiopia meet its people\u2019s needs while also pressing all sides to advance justice and reconciliation to address the atrocities committed and damage caused during the war. Tigrayan rebels march defeated Ethiopian troops through Tigray\u2019s regional capital in 2021, amid the civil war that has now seen a truce. Atrocities committed in the war complicate efforts toward a full peace accord. (Finbarr O'Reilly\/The New York Times) Blinken met Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and signatories of the truce that was reached in November to end the two-year civil war between the central government and the northern region of Tigray. These included Ethiopia\u2019s national security advisor, Redwan Hussein, and the spokesperson of the Tigrayan authorities, Getachew Reda. Blinken stressed \u201cthe importance of accountability for the atrocities perpetrated by all parties\u201d in the war, and since the truce, which included killings, sexual violence and starvation of civilians, according to U.N. factfinders . Economic recovery, including an International Monetary Fund loan and a resumption of duty-free exports to the United States under its African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), is a priority for the Ethiopian government. Blinken expressed U.S. readiness to advance those goals in tandem with steps by Ethiopia and the Tigrayan leadership to consolidate peace. And he announced a new $331 million in U.S. humanitarian aid to support the process. Blinken, who also met African Union leaders, is the latest in a steady stream of high-level U.S. official visitors in Africa \u2014 a sign of the sustained, high-level U.S. engagement that\u2019s needed both to advance peace in Ethiopia and for the U.S.-proclaimed effort to build a broad , new partnership with the continent. Since hosting December\u2019s U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the U.S. government has sent Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen , U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield , First Lady Jill Biden and other senior State Department officials on tours in Africa. Vice President Kamala Harris this week announced a tour in coming days to Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia, and President Biden and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo have announced plans to visit later this year. Amid East Africa\u2019s web of conflicts, many of them at least indirectly connected, difficult but vital steps remain to convert Ethiopia\u2019s cease-fire in Tigray into a sustainable, nationwide peace, according to Susan Stigant, who directs USIP programs in Africa. This truce between Ethiopia and the Tigrayan forces is about four months old. What steps are next to consolidate it? The truce was an important step. It silenced the guns. It opened a pathway to address critical humanitarian needs. For those most directly impacted by the violence over two years, this cannot be understated. Going forward it\u2019s important to remember the complexity of this conflict, which has included not just those two forces, but also troops from Eritrea and fighters from Ethiopia\u2019s Amhara region fighting alongside the government, against the Tigrayan forces. All of those forces need to move to agreed areas and keep the guns silent. Forces are made up of people \u2014 and those people need to be fed and their basic needs provided for. In the medium term, many of the young people who took up arms will need to transition back to life as normal. To do this, they must have confidence that their families and communities are safe \u2014 which means having trust that leaders can reach a deal on the many political questions facing Tigray. These include the formation of its interim administration, its relationship with Ethiopia, and Ethiopia overall. People leaving forces also need jobs and a way to make sense of and deal with the violence that they witnessed or were involved in. The necessary next steps are also complex. As so often in peace processes, the combatants and those facilitating their process will need to take multiple steps at once. Actually, to help focus American efforts in this overall direction, USIP convenes a bipartisan Senior Study Group on Peace and Security in the Red Sea Arena that has noted the need to simultaneously advance an Ethiopian peace process through negotiations among the direct combatants, marshalling a region-wide commitment to support that process, and surge humanitarian and economic support into a country facing widened impoverishment and vast damage to the economy. Analysts note that the Eritrean government of President Isaias Afewerki could prove obstructive if it sees developments as contrary to its interests. A particular conundrum for U.S. and international policymakers is how to time, sequence and calibrate the restoration of economic assistance, including an Ethiopian return to the AGOA trade opportunity, in tandem with the absolutely critical need to end and address human rights violations. Obviously, that problem becomes more acute when the atrocities have been so pronounced and widespread \u2014 and tragically, this has been the case in this war. There is no simple answer here; there is a need for justice based on documentation, investigation, and fair processes. And there is a need for reconciliation that allows Ethiopians to find a way to live together in the future. It\u2019s going to be a complex problem of management, which I think Secretary Blinken just signaled in his talks this week. Beside those twinned issues is an imperative for humanitarian assistance, including the reopening of all of Tigray to access that aid. The United States highlighted this need \u2014 and the needs in other parts of the country impacted by the war, other conflicts and climate-induced drought \u2014 with its new commitment this week. This new aid brings the U.S. total of humanitarian assistance since 2020 to $3 billion. Looking beyond Tigray, another complexity is that the war there was not the only conflict in Ethiopia. The central region of Oromia is seeing violence and human rights abuses in the conflict between the central government and the Oromo Liberation Army \u2014 and the same need to end violence and advance peace will apply there as in Tigray. You\u2019ve talked in the past of the ways that East Africa\u2019s various conflicts affect each other. What is happening now at that regional level? Well, especially for those unfamiliar with the region, just a glance at the map is helpful. Of Ethiopia\u2019s six immediate neighboring states, nearly all are involved in conflicts that have triggered violence over recent years or have been impacted by refugees fleeing violence. The high-level diplomatic travel of the past weeks reflects the interconnectedness of peace and security in the region. Prime Minister Abiy was just in South Sudan meeting with the leaders of its two main factions, which recently recently extended their own peace deal through 2024. The president of Somalia was just in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. The deputy head of Sudan\u2019s military government was there as well. These meetings are indicative of the ongoing negotiations of alliances, interests and roles in the region \u2014 and the uncertainty around the truce in Ethiopia, the ongoing negotiations between the military and civilians in Sudan, and the fluid political transitions in Somalia and South Sudan. In the region, there are also clear signs of leadership for peace. Notably, Kenya\u2019s new government has taken an active role as part of the African Union efforts to advance a settlement in Ethiopia and to host talks to reduce violence in the conflicts in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. You wrote an essay a year ago that underscored the way that East Africa and its conflicts are affected, and at times fueled, by wider global rivalries. What is the current version of that picture?

Despite ongoing human rights violations in parts of the country, EHRC is encouraged by the Pretoria Peace Agreement for Lasting Peace and Cessation of Hostilities. EHRC particularly welcomes the Agreement\u2019s provision to establish a comprehensive national Transitional Justice Policy aimed at accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims, reconciliation, and healing. We are further encouraged by the launching of national consultations in Ethiopia on Transitional Justice Policy Options. This fully aligns with the EHRC\/ OHCHR Joint Investigation Report recommendation on Transitional Justice. Between July and December 2022, EHRC\/ OHCHR spoke to over 700 victims of human rights violations, their families, internally displaced persons, and community leaders on their views and aspirations on accountability, truth, reparations, and guarantees of non-repetition. We have published the key findings of these community consultations and wish to echo what they indicated as their primary needs, which include to live without fear, to have peace and security and reparations to get their lives back. EHRC therefore, urges the Human Rights Council and the international community to support and coordinate efforts towards the proper designing and effective implementation of a genuine, human rights compliant, holistic, and victim-centred Transitional Justice Policy for Ethiopia.

{"year":"2023","month":"03","event_desc":"Finance minister stated that minimum of USD20\u00a0billion is needed to rebuild the devastated northern part of Ethiopia which includes the Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions.","text":"News Finance minister reveals USD 20 billion required for war recovery Finance minister reveals USD 20 billion required for war recovery By Ashenafi Endale March 18, 2023 Share Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Telegram Portion of the finance needed for rehabilitation of 250,000 ex-combatants A minimum of USD20 billion is required over the next five years to rebuild the northern part of Ethiopia that has been devastated by war in the last two years, said Ahmed Shide, Minister of Finance. It is almost equal to a fifth of the country\u2019s GDP. As part of an effort to mobilize the required funds, the Ethiopian government strongly urged its international partners to contribute financial assistance. Ahmed, in his discussion with Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, indicated the figure is a \u2018conservative estimation\u2019. Unofficial estimates place the figure at USD28 billion. Over 23 million people are in in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the war and drought in Ethiopia. \u201cWe have begun implementing immediate recovery interventions primarily using our own resources and by support of the World Bank.\u00a0 But we cannot do this alone as the financing need for the post-conflict reconstruction is substantial,\u201d said Ahmed. - Advertisement - The conflict severely ravaged Tigray regional state, as well as Amhara and Afar regional states, before it was brought to an end after the cessation of hostility agreement was signed in Pretoria in November 2022. Among the most critical needs in the region are immediate humanitarian assistance, the reconstruction of health centers, education, infrastructure, and the restoration of essential services. Furthermore, rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants will necessitate significant financial investment. According to Ahmed, this duty must also be completed promptly in order for the peace pact to be successful. The government has formed the National Rehabilitation Commission to reintegrate ex-Tigray Defense Force combatants (TDF). Last week, officials from the federal government and UNDP arrived to Mekele, led by Teshome Toga (Amb. ), the commissioner, to begin the rehabilitation program for disarmed Tigrayan combatants. The commission\u2019s rehabilitation program will include nearly 250,000 ex-combatants, according to Ahmed. \u201cI want to stress the criticality of timely reintegration of ex-combatants, which in turn we contribute to the peace consolidation,\u201d Ahmed told Blinken. The ministries of finance and planning and development have been meeting with donors to determine how to mobilize the funding needed for rehabilitation. Unfortunately, no significant pledges have been made thus far. On his arrival in Addis Ababa on March 14, Secretary Blinken announced a new assistance package at USD331 million. This brings the US investment to Ethiopia to USD3 billion since 2020. Blinken also committed to provide additional support for approximately 13 million people in need of urgent humanitarian aid owing to the ongoing drought. After two years of chilly diplomatic relations, Blinken\u2019s visit is widely regarded as a step forward for the two countries\u2019 diplomatic re-engagement. Yet, before completely re-engaging with Addis Ababa, the US wanted accountability for war atrocities. The extent of accountability to transitional justice and accountability will also decide the reinstatement of AGOA. In return, Ahmed offered Ethiopian government is undertaking bold economic reforms. \u201cDespite the headwinds of historic proportions, we preserve it with implementation of our key reforms, including financial market revitalization, telecom sector revitalization, subsidy for enhancing agricultural productivity, and debt management.\u00a0 We know that much more needs to be done, and we are ready to take bold actions on the most transformative reforms,\u201d said Ahmed.

Despite ongoing human rights violations in parts of the country, EHRC is encouraged by the Pretoria Peace Agreement for Lasting Peace and Cessation of Hostilities. EHRC particularly welcomes the Agreement\u2019s provision to establish a comprehensive national Transitional Justice Policy aimed at accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims, reconciliation, and healing. We are further encouraged by the launching of national consultations in Ethiopia on Transitional Justice Policy Options. This fully aligns with the EHRC\/ OHCHR Joint Investigation Report recommendation on Transitional Justice. Between July and December 2022, EHRC\/ OHCHR spoke to over 700 victims of human rights violations, their families, internally displaced persons, and community leaders on their views and aspirations on accountability, truth, reparations, and guarantees of non-repetition. We have published the key findings of these community consultations and wish to echo what they indicated as their primary needs, which include to live without fear, to have peace and security and reparations to get their lives back. EHRC therefore, urges the Human Rights Council and the international community to support and coordinate efforts towards the proper designing and effective implementation of a genuine, human rights compliant, holistic, and victim-centred Transitional Justice Policy for Ethiopia.

{"year":"2023","month":"04","event_desc":"From   New wave of crackdown and arbitrary arrests primarily against ethnic Amhara journalists and activists by the government.","text":"Share this: Bluesky Facebook LinkedIn X WhatsApp Email Nairobi, April 14, 2023\u2013Ethiopian authorities should cease arbitrarily detaining journalists during times of political tension and investigate allegations that security officers attacked members of the press, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Friday. Between April 3 and April 13, security personnel in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, arrested at least six journalists and allegedly assaulted two while in custody, according to multiple news reports and statements from local rights groups . Two other journalists were arrested in separate incidents in the Amhara and Oromia states. Six of the journalists\u2013Amara Media Center chief editor Abay Zewdu; Arat Kilo Media editor Dawit Begashaw; Ethio Selam editor Tewodros Asfaw; Yegna Media reporter Genet Asmamaw; Negere Wolkait Media editor Assefa Adane; and Ethio Nikat Media founder and editor Meskerem Abera\u2013remain behind bars as of Friday, April 14, facing allegations which include inciting violence.\u00a0All six publish reporting and commentary for privately owned YouTube-based outlets. Abay, Genet, Assefa, and Meskerem mainly report and commentate on political and social issues affecting the Amhara ethnic group, the second-largest in Ethiopia. Their arrests come amid political unrest in Amhara state, as protesters oppose government plans to dissolve regional forces. \u201cThe latest spate of arrests in Ethiopia, in which at least eight journalists have been arrested since April 3, paints a deeply depressing picture of the state of press freedom in the country,\u201d said Muthoki Mumo, CPJ\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa representative. \u201cAuthorities should release all detained journalists, investigate allegations that some members of the press have been mistreated or assaulted while in state custody, and ensure that journalists do not operate in an environment of fear.\u201d The first arrest came on April 3, when two men who identified themselves as National Intelligence and Security Service members approached Yeayeneabeba Gizaw, managing editor of the privately owned magazine Yehabesha Wog, while she was running errands in Addis Ababa and forced her into a waiting vehicle, according to the journalist\u2019s phone interviews with CPJ and privately owned satellite broadcaster Ethiopia Media Service (EMS) and a statement by independent watchdog Ethiopia Human Rights Council. The men drove Yeayeneabeba to an unmarked detention facility in Lebu, an outskirt neighborhood of Addis Ababa, where she was held in a room with nine other women. On April 4, a man and woman questioned her about her work in Oromia state, slapped her face, kicked one of her legs, and accused her of using Yehabesha Wog to defame Oromia state officials and the Addis Ababa mayor. She was released unconditionally on April 5. Yeayeneabeba did not suffer significant injury, she said, adding that her abduction was particularly unexpected because the magazine suspended printing in September 2022 due to the prohibitive cost. They plan to resume on a bi-monthly basis when they can, she said. On April 4, Oromia state police arrested Samuel Assefa, an EMS reporter, while he covered demolitions in the town of Legetafo-Legedadi, on the outskirts of the capital, according to EMS editor Wosenseged Gebrekidan, who spoke to CPJ by messaging app, and an Ethiopia Human Rights Council statement . Samuel appeared at the Legetafo-Legedadi town First Instance Court on April 5 and was accused of incitement and attempting to report without authorities\u2019 permission, according to Wosenseged. The court granted the police an additional five days to hold Samuel, and on April 11, the court closed the case. Samuel was released on April 13 after paying bail of 10,000 Ethiopian birr (US$185). In separate incidents on April 6, federal police officers arrested Abay and Assefa, who is also a professor at Kotebe Metropolitan University, according to a report by Abay\u2019s outlet and Abay\u2019s sister, Zoma Zewdu, who communicated with CPJ via messaging app. Later that day, Abay and Assefa appeared at the Arada branch of the Federal First Instance Court in Addis Ababa alongside seven other people, and were accused of using social media platforms to organize youth violence, according to Zoma and court documents reviewed by CPJ. They were remanded to police custody for 10 more days, pending police investigations. Around 5 p.m. on April 6, five federal police officers arrested Genet, according to her lawyer, Henok Aklilu, and her brother, Andualem Demissie, who spoke to CPJ by phone. In an audio published by several media outlets and authenticated by Henok, an officer says, \u201cBeat her; kick her,\u201d and Genet says, \u201cDo not beat me. Why are you hitting me? Why are you kidnapping me without a court order?\u201d In an appearance at the Federal First Instance Court on April 7, Genet was accused of inciting violence on social media and other platforms and mobilizing young people to overthrow the government, according to Henok. The court granted police 10 days to hold her in custody pending further investigation. Genet complained to the court about abusive treatment by police, and the court ordered the federal police to investigate, according to Henok. Around 6 p.m. on April 9, 10 federal police officers arrested Meskerem, according to Henok, who represents her, and the journalist\u2019s husband, Fitsum Gebremichael, who spoke to CPJ by phone. The Federal First Instance Court extended her detention by 13 days on April 11, giving police time to investigate allegations that she incited violence and riots through social media platforms and provided shooting training to unspecified informal groups, according to CPJ\u2019s review of court documents. Meskerem was previously detained in May 2022 for 23 days and in December 2022 for three weeks. Ethio Nikat announced a hiatus after her December detention, and Meskerem had announced their return to air a week before her arrest. On the evening of Wednesday, April 12 , Ethiopian National Defense Force soldiers arrested Dawit, while he was with friends at a hotel in Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara state. Dawit was transported to the Federal Police detention center in Addis Ababa. In videos published by Arat Kilo before Dawit\u2019s detention, the journalist vehemently criticized Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and spoke out against the disbandment of the Amhara special force. On the morning of April 13, two federal police officers and two plain-clothes security officers arrested Tewodros at his home on unspecified allegations, according to news reports , and his wife, Enat Tamirat, who spoke to CPJ by phone. Enat said officers searched their home, confiscated his passport and cell phone, and took Tewodros to the federal police detention center. In February, Tewodros was detained for eight days and released on bail. CPJ\u2019s text and email to federal police spokesperson Jeylan Abdi and CPJ\u2019s email, Facebook messages, and queries sent through the website of the Addis Ababa mayor\u2019s office did not receive a response. Emails to the Federal Ministry of Justice, National Intelligence and Security Service, Oromia Communication Bureau, and Amhara Communication Bureau were unanswered or returned error messages.

{"year":"2023","month":"03","event_desc":"In May 2021, the Council of ministers designated the TPLF as a terrorist group. Following the peace agreement, the Parliament voted in  to remove TPLF from the list of terrorist organisations.","text":"Council Of Ministers Approves Resolution Designating TPLF And Shene As Terrorist Organizations (May 1, 2021) May 1, 2021 \/ 0 Comments \/ in Uncategorized \/ by Embassy Content Editor The Council of Ministers has approved a resolution designating the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and Shene as terrorist organizations. In a statement issued today, the Council blamed the two organizations for the attacks carried out in various parts of the country targeting civilians to derail the reforms introduced over the past three years. In the last three years, there have been a number of attacks on civilians in various parts of the country to reverse the reforms that have taken place through the demands and struggles of the Ethiopian people for democracy and human rights. As a result, many lives have been lost and maimed, citizens have been displaced and properties were destroyed. These attacks have left society in constant anticipation of danger and tear, undermine trust in the government and among the people. Various evidences point to the existential threat faced by the state as a result of these organized actions. These attacks have been perpetrated against innocent civilians and through the destruction of public infrastructure for political purposes and to achieve political goals or objectives. These attacks, which have been taking place in different parts of the country, have had different perpetrators. But behind the attacks are groups that have played a leading role in orchestrating, funding, providing ideas, training culprits, providing media coverage and assistance. It is also clear that these groups are being exploited by foreign forces seeking to weaken, disrupt and dismantle Ethiopia. The crimes that these entities have committed and perpetrated are acts of terrorism. It is easy to see that these activities fully comply with the definition of terrorism under Article 3 of Proclamation No. 1176\/2020 on the Prevention and Suppression of Terrorism Crimes. Instead of individually holding accountable members and supporters of these organizations for their terrorist activities, designating the organizations as terrorist organizations according to the law is deemed more practical to better control and prevent acts of terrorism. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 18 and 19 of Proclamation No. 1176\/2020 on the Prevention and Suppression or Terrorism Crimes, and since \u201cTgray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF)\u201d and \u201cShene\u201d operate as terrorists and their management or decision-makers have acknowledged or are leading destructive activities on the nation, and since terrorism is a general feature of the organizations, a resolution has been tabled to designate these organizations as terrorist organizations. In accordance with Article 23 of Proclamation No. 1176\/2020 on the Prevention and Suppression of Terrorism Crimes, this decision will become applicable to organizations and individuals who collaborate, have links with or relate to the ideas and actions of the designated terrorist organizations and others who have engaged in similar activities.

The recent bouts of climate shocks have hit hard already vulnerable communities that have not had the time to recover from previous shocks, including previous droughts, conflicts and desert locust. Livelihoods are being decimated with more than 6.8 million livestock deaths since 2021. The WASH situation is of particular concern, with inadequate water trucking and growing pressure on remaining water sources, while health risks related to complications from malnutrition and severe water shortages have multiplied, including a cholera outbreak. With limited resources, humanitarian partners continue to make difficult decisions of prioritizing the most critical areas requiring the most urgent response in an integrated manner. Accordingly, of 13 million people targeted in 2023, 3.2 million people located in the most affected areas of Bale, Borena, East Bale, Guji, West Guji (Oromia), Afder, Daawa, Liban (Somali), Konso and South Omo (SNNP) require urgent assistance in the first half of the year. Critical priority response activities have also been identified across sectors (see table below). These are captured in the Government and partners\u2019 four-months Drought Response Operational Action Plan targeting the most affected areas and most critical sectors for priority intervention.

{"year":"2023","month":"03","event_desc":"ReliefWeb reported the critical needs of tens of thousands of Amhara IDPs in North Shewa and other parts of the Amhara Region. It also highlighted the widespread malaria cases in Afar\u2014 the highest in the past five years. The resumption of services in Tigray was also covered in the report.","text":"Ethiopia Ethiopia - Situation Report, 20 Mar 2023 Format Situation Report Source OCHA Posted 20 Mar 2023 Originally published 20 Mar 2023 Attachments Download Report (PDF | 5.75 MB) HIGHLIGHTS Resumption of banking, telecommunication, and fuel services expanding in geographic coverage and scope in Tigray. Tens of thousands of displaced families in North Shewa and Oromo Special Zone, Amhara Region remain in critical need of urgent humanitarian assistance. At least 23 woredas in Afar have reportedly exceeded the malaria monthly average threshold of the last five years. A 30 per cent increase in cholera cases in Oromia and Somali seen in January alone. Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) disease outbreak reported in Southern Region. Situation Overview People in need in northern Ethiopia continue to receive food and non-food item assistance, notwithstanding challenges to reach many. In Tigray, at least 5.2 million people have received food assistance between early October 2022 and 13 February, while a new cycle of food distribution that started on 30 December 2022 has reached 16 per cent of the targeted 5.4 million people as of 15 February. Timely verification and inclusion of vulnerable caseloads in food assistance has been one of the main challenges, particularly for urban displacement in the region. This is due to fluid population movements, high number of displaced people, unreachability of certain areas, and lack of documentation among affected populations, among others, causing delays in food distribution in some locations. Partners are also working to rehabilitate food distribution and storage facilities that were destroyed by the conflict in newly accessible areas so that communities can receive their food without traveling long distance to reach alternative distribution points. Meanwhile, merely 1.77 million people in Amhara Region (out of the targeted 2.55 million) have been receiving food assistance since mid-November 2022. Delayed relief food distribution and incomplete baskets continue to be a challenge in some areas of the region. The Government and partners are working to address issues of varying capacities and efficiency of the relief responses of operational partners that cover different geographic areas. In Afar Region, nearly 596,700 people (out of the targeted 664,339 people) have been receiving food assistance since November 2022. In Tigray, humanitarian access continues to gradually improve since November 2022 allowing partners to reach more people. A joint rapid response delivered non-food humanitarian supplies in the Eastern Zone (parts of Fatsi, Zalanbesa, and Erob) while some kebeles remain hard to reach as of 9 February. The resumption of some services has also continued and is expanding in geographic coverage and scope across Tigray. Mobile (telecom) services have resumed in nearly all towns, pending in some border towns or areas where infrastructure maintenance is ongoing, including Fatsi, Zalambesa, Dowhan, Rama, Chila and Grehu Sirnay.Government and private banks have also started banking services in major towns as of 7 February. Government and partners have jointly reported that as of 6 February, more than 4,088 trucks of humanitarian cargo and fuel had arrived in Tigray, and more than half of the gas stations in Mekelle are reported to have resumed services. Moreover, the price of consumer supplies in Mekelle and other towns is stabilising, as commercial trucks continue to enter the region. Humanitarian partners reported incidents related to the presence of unexploded ordnances (UXOs) early February in two sites in Adihageray and two others in Egela Woreda resulting in several casualties and three deaths. Partners in collaboration with regional mine action support have increased awareness activities to ensure safety of the affected people including women and children. OCHA is coordinating support from national defence authorities and regional bureaus for IDP site clearing and mobilizing humanitarian partners for mine awareness creation and response. Population displacements have reached a new high in Amhara, since January 2023 leaving 169,686 people displaced in four woredas of Oromia Special Zone (Wello) and 213,000 in five woredas of North Shewa Zone. According to authorities, tens of thousands of families are in critical need of shelter and non-food-item (NFI) assistance. While an estimated 20,000 people have received about 3,000 quintals of food in North Shewa, the majority in the two zones still require support, including water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), as well as food, shelter and non-food items and protection services. The Jara IDP site in North Wello Zone, Amhara continues to receive more displaced people (now at 8,000 people). Response with water, food and basic health and nutrition assistance remains limited in partner number and scale of assistance. In addition, intercommunal fighting had built up near the site early February. Alternative site options as well as a scale-up of humanitarian assistance are required. Similarly, further support is needed for IDPs in other parts of Amhara. In Wag Hamra Zone, partners have commenced humanitarian assistance in Beltarf village, Abergele woreda, whereby more than 550 households (HHs) consisting of IDPs and host community are presumed to have access to clean and safe water from a borehole rehabilitated in February. Complementarily Wag Hamra zonal authorities have commenced the return of 1,200 IDPs to accessible kebeles, including Saqa and 03-Debre Birhan, in Abergele Woreda as of 15 February 2023. Return facilitation including support to return voluntariness, transportation, shelter rehabilitation and reconstruction, agriculture, and adequate public services remain as key areas for intervention in return areas. It is noted, however, that further returns are on hold until adequate return responses are prepared. Food, NFI, cash support, functional social services are identified as critical conditions pre and post return. Afar continues to grapple with a Malaria epidemic with more than 3,600 confirmed cases reported in 36 woredas in several zones as of 7 February, a 7 per cent increase in cases in just one week. Similarly, at least 23 woredas(including in zones 1, 2, and 4) have reportedly exceeded the malaria monthly average threshold of the last 5 years.Insecticide-treated nets (ITN), diagnostic tests (RDTs) and effective medication like Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) are insufficient or not available and need to be mobilized.

HIGHLIGHTS Since the last update, the cholera outbreak has further spread to East Bale, Guji and Borena zones of Oromia and Daawa Zone of Somali regions, including Ginir and Negele zonal capitals. As of 23 March 2023, 2,276 cholera cases \u2013 of whom 50 per cent women - were reported in 177 kebeles across 22 woredas with 50 associated deaths. Close to 3.3 million people are at high-risk in the affected woredas. The total cholera caseload has doubled since the end of January 2023. During the Epidemiological Week #11 2023 (12-18 March), the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) reported 363 new cholera cases, the highest numbers reported since the beginning of the outbreak, last August. With the limited Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV) doses available, the vaccination campaign has prioritized IDP sites and woredas having the highest caseload and with limited WASH services, reaching 100,713 persons to date. A strained global supply of cholera vaccines has led a global strategy to temporarily suspend the standard two-dose vaccination, using instead a single-dose approach. During a drought period, water scarcity can force people to consume water from unsafe sources and practice poor hygiene behaviors such as reduced handwashing, thereby increasing the risk of cholera transmission during an outbreak. Urgent additional funds are required to scale up cholera response and preparedness efforts, including increasing water trucking services, rehabilitation of water systems where possible as well as increase hygiene promotion activities\/campaigns amongst others. SITUATION OVERVIEW Since the first cholera case was reported in Harana Buluk Woreda of Bale Zone of Oromia on 27 August 2022, the outbreak has spread into bordering zones of Guji, West Arsi and East Bale of Oromia Region and Liban Zone of Somali Region. More recently, cases have been confirmed in Moyale, both from Oromia (Borena) and Somali (Daawa) sides. As of 23 March 2023, 2,276 cholera cases \u2013 of whom 50 per cent women \u2013 were reported in 177 kebeles across 22 woredas (of whom 18 in Oromia) with 50 associated deaths (Cumulative Case Fatality Rate CFR - of 2.19 per cent). The total cholera caseload has doubled since the end of January 2023 with new daily cases reported and new patients admitted in several areas in Guji, East Bale zones, including the zonal capital Ginir and Negele towns. During the Epidemiological Week #11 2023 (12-18 March), EPHI reported 363 new cholera cases, the highest numbers reported since the beginning of the outbreak. The reported deaths mostly fall within the age range of 0 to 14 years (of which 16 per cent are children under two years old). Out of the total caseload, almost 56 per cent of patients experienced severe dehydration symptoms, while another 29 per cent had low-to medium symptoms. Out the total caseload, more than 86 per cent have not received any doses of Oral Cholera Vaccination (OCV). Among all fatalities, 90 per cent of cholera related deaths were patients that had not been vaccinated. The outbreak has so far been controlled in five woredas only. With limited OCV doses and inadequate coverage of WASH services, more than 3.3 million people remain at high-risk in the 22 affected woredas.

Situation Overview Close to 7501 people arrived at the Metema crossing border point on 9 May, out of which 70 per cent were Ethiopian returnees and the remaining of other nationalities. This brings the total number of people who arrived in Ethiopia via Metema to 17,500. Needs and Response As multifaced needs rise by the day at the Metema crossing border point of Ethiopia, Government and humanitarian partners are striving to scale up the response in terms of pace and number of partners. An emergency coordination meeting led by the Mayor of Metema on 9 May, highlighted the need to respond to several unmet needs and enhance preparedness efforts. Construction of temporary shelters for returnees is also under consideration to allow people to move from the border point to areas with better access to basic services until transportation is provided for onward movement to their respective destinations. Dignity kits and sanitary materials are among non-food items requested by women and girls at the border point. Gendawuha zonal authorities have also requested for water treatment chemicals in the provision of water for arriving people. Responses by government and partners to the people that have arrived in Metema have included emergency shelter, medical assistance and supplies, food and water, and transportation services as well as non-food items, registration and visa services and family reunification activities.

{"year":"2023","month":"04","event_desc":"From   Protests across the Amhara Region erupted following governments' announcement to disband the Amhara Regional forces. Prosperity Party has been accused of enforcing measures to disband the Amhara forces while the controversial disarmament of Tigray forces remained unresolved, and the Oromia regional forces still heavily armed. Both have been taken as major threat for the Amhara.","text":"Ethiopia's Amhara region hit by protests over move to dissolve regional forces 10 April 2023 Share Save Kalkidan Yibeltal BBC News, Addis Ababa Share Save Getty Images Amhara forces played a crucial role in the war against Tigrayan rebels Huge protests have taken place in Ethiopia's Amhara region for the fifth consecutive day against government moves to dissolve a paramilitary force. Demonstrators blocked roads with rocks and burning tyres to prevent the military from travelling around. Protesters fear that the government's decision would leave them exposed to attacks by neighbouring regions. Ethiopia's regional states have their own special forces to protect their borders, and to fight rebels. The government announced last week that it wants the special forces to be integrated into the federal army or police force in order to promote national unity. The decision has faced strong opposition in Amhara, with huge protests in cities and towns across the region. It has led a partial curfew being imposed in the historic city of Gondar, while clashes have been reported between protesters and the military in Kobe town, near the border with the neighbouring Tigray region. On Sunday, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed vowed to press ahead with his plan even if \"a price had to be paid\". In the capital Addis Ababa, the arrest of Amhara-linked journalists, commentators and community organizers has intensified in recent days. On Sunday, Meskerem Abera became the fourth media personality to be detained in less than a week. The Amhara special forces helped the Ethiopian army fight Tigrayan forces who launched a rebellion in 2020 against Mr Abiy's government. The conflict ended with the signing of a peace accord last year between the federal government and Tigrayan forces. Now tension is growing between the Amhara and federal authorities. Some in Amhara say the federal government's decision will prevent the region from providing armed resistance to any future threat. They also doubt that the Tigrayan forces have fully disarmed, despite the peace accord requiring them to do so. There have been historic tensions between the Amhara and Tigrayan ethnic groups, with the two often competing for power, land and resources. Amharas gained control of agriculturally fertile land in Tigray in the recent war. Both claim that the land historically belonged to them, and the dispute has not yet been resolved. The fighting is over.

REUTERS\/Tiksa Negeri\/Pool\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies Food diverted in 'coordinated campaign' Donors' report: Aid thought to be going to military No comment from military, ministry investigating NAIROBI, June 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said on Thursday it was suspending food aid to Ethiopia because its donations were being diverted from people in need. A spokesperson said USAID had determined, in coordination with the Ethiopian government, that a \"widespread and coordinated campaign is diverting food assistance from the people of Ethiopia\". Sign up here. The statement did not say who was behind the campaign. The United States is by far the largest humanitarian donor to Ethiopia, where more than 20 million people need food aid, most of them due to drought and a recently-concluded war in the northern Tigray region. According to an internal briefing by a group of foreign donors to Ethiopia seen by Reuters, USAID believes the food has been diverted to Ethiopian military units. \"The scheme appears to be orchestrated by federal and regional government entities, with military units across the country benefiting from humanitarian assistance,\" said the document from the Humanitarian and Resilience Donor Group (HRDG), which includes USAID. A spokesperson for the military did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \"The two governments are conducting investigations so that the perpetrators of such diversion are held to account,\" USAID and Ethiopia's foreign affairs ministry said in a joint statement. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the issue on Thursday with Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen on the margins of a conference in Saudi Arabia. The State Department said afterwards that Blinken welcomed a commitment by Ethiopia's government to work with the United States to conduct a full investigation. The USAID spokesperson said the agency intended to resume food assistance as soon as it was confident in the integrity of the system. USAID and the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) had already suspended food aid to the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray last month in response to information that large amounts of aid there were being diverted. A two-year war in Tigray between the federal government and forces led by the region's dominant political party ended in a truce in November after killing tens of thousands of people and creating famine-like conditions for hundreds of thousands. In the 2022 fiscal year, USAID disbursed nearly $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, most of it food aid. The HRDG briefing document, which was circulated among donors on Wednesday, recommended that Ethiopia's government allow donors to deliver aid through \"alternative modalities\" like cash transfers. It also urged donors to call on Ethiopia's government to make a public statement condemning the diversion and demanding that aid workers not be harassed. Ethiopia's food crisis has deepened in recent years as a result of the war in Tigray and the Horn of Africa's worst drought in decades. The WFP is also investigating \"systemic\" food diversion across Ethiopia, according to an email sent last week by the agency's deputy director to staff in Ethiopia. A WFP spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The group also condemned what they called the \u201csummary expulsion of hundreds of Eritreans\u201d by Ethiopia at the end of June. \u201cCollective expulsions are prohibited under international law,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cDeporting migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers without conducting an individual and objective risk assessment of their exposure to human rights violations, including torture and enforced disappearance, upon return is refoulement.\u201d Under international human rights law, the principle of non-refoulement guarantees that no one should be returned to a country where they would face abuse or punishment.

USAID suspended aid delivery in June due to allegations of diversion.","text":"NEWS US says to resume food aid across Ethiopia after monitoring agreement FILE PHOTO: Ethiopian refugees of the Qemant ethnic group queue for food at a camp in the village of Basinga. (Photo by ASHRAF SHAZLY \/ AFP) Agence France-Presse Published on : 15 Nov 2023, 01:11 Copied The United States said Tuesday it would resume delivering food aid across conflict-ridden Ethiopia after the government agreed to allow monitoring following allegations of diversion to soldiers. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said it would restart food deliveries next month for an initial year, during which it will verify whether the government keeps its promises. USAID said that Ethiopia agreed in negotiations to enhanced monitoring including tracking of donated food. \"These widespread and significant reforms will fundamentally shift Ethiopia's food aid system and help ensure aid reaches those experiencing acute food insecurity,\" USAID spokeswoman Jessica Jennings said. \"Given the significant number of people in need of food assistance in Ethiopia, we are pleased these important reforms will allow the delivery of food assistance to those who need it most,\" she said. USAID halted all food aid to Ethiopia in June, alleging a \"widespread and coordinated\" campaign to divert donated supplies. The United States has not publicly named the culprits, but aid groups have blamed both the federal and regional authorities, with soldiers benefitting from the resale of donated food. USAID partly resumed aid delivery in October but only to refugees on Ethiopian soil as aid workers could better monitor the assistance. The United States has strongly criticized Ethiopia, which it had considered an ally, over its two-year military campaign in the Tigray region that came after an attack on a military camp. US officials have alleged that the government deliberately withheld food, using hunger as a weapon of war. The government and Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) signed a peace deal a year ago in South Africa to end the conflict although fighting remains in other parts of Africa's second most populous country.

It was devastating and heartbreaking news. The young generations have to be taught to be respectful of each other and pay special, exclusive homage to women regardless of age and all types of social status. The guy uses a bomb to kill his victim, which is unimaginable. People are still living in the 10th century, and they want to die or kill their partner when their proposal is rejected. Primitive men still exist among Ethiopians. Whatever his reasons, no amount of dismay justifies the killing of a human being. This made people live with uncertainty and fear. Regional administrators should intervene and take swift action to prevent any sort of potential harm before it is too late, and retired or former members who left the service must hand over their tools to the state. It is disappointing to see that pastors and religious leaders frequently put more emphasis on publicizing festivities during monthly and yearly religious feasts than on teaching the next generation important moral values. These leaders pass up a crucial opportunity to strengthen the social fabric and deal with urgent concerns like crime rates and societal challenges by failing to place a strong emphasis on morality. \u201c\u201d\u1233\u12ed\u122d\u1245 \u1260\u1245\u122d\u1261 \u1233\u12ed\u12f0\u122d\u1245 \u1260\u1245\u122d\u1261  or \u201c\u120d\u1305\u1295 \u1260\u1321\u1275 \u12a5\u1205\u120d\u1295 \u1260\u1325\u1245\u121d\u1275\u201d \u120d\u1305 \u1260\u1215\u1343\u1295\u1290\u1271 \u1260\u12c8\u1309\u1293 \u1260\u1225\u122d\u12d3\u1271 \u12ab\u120d\u12eb\u12d9 \u12ab\u120d\u1218\u1308\u1261\u1275\u1363 \u12a5\u1205\u120d\u1295\u121d \u1260\u1325\u1245\u121d\u1275 \u12ab\u120d\u1246\u1320\u1261\u1275 \u120d\u1301\u121d \u1232\u12eb\u12f5\u130d \u1218\u120d\u12ab \u12dc\u130b \u12a0\u12ed\u1206\u1295\u121d\u1363 \u201c\u201d Sewaswe \u120d\u1306\u127d \u1260\u1235\u1290\u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1270\u12ae\u1275\u12a9\u1270\u12cd \u12a5\u1295\u12f2\u12eb\u12f5\u1309 \u12e8\u1203\u12ed\u121b\u1296\u1275 \u12a0\u1263\u1276\u127d \u1365\u12e8\u1230\u1295\u1260\u1275 \u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1264\u1276\u127d\u1365 \u12e8\u12d8\u1218\u1293\u12ca \u12e8\u1235\u1290\u12dc\u130b \u1218\u121d\u1205\u122b\u1295 \u12c8\u12d8\u1270 \u12a0\u1325\u1265\u1240\u12cd \u120a\u1230\u1229 \u12ed\u1308\u1263\u120d\u1365\u1365\u1260\u121d\u12d5\u122b\u1261 \u12d3\u1208\u121d \u1260\u12e8\u1275\u121d\u1205\u122d\u1275 \u1264\u1271 \u1208\u12c8\u120b\u1306\u127d \u122a\u1356\u122d\u1275 \u12e8\u121a\u12eb\u12f0\u122d\u1309 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u122b\u12ca \u1230\u122b\u1270\u129b(\u1236\u123b\u120d \u12c8\u122d\u12a8\u122d\u1235) \u12e8\u12ad\u134d\u120d \u1203\u120b\u134a\u12ce\u127d \u12c8\u12d8\u1270\u12a8\u12c8\u120b\u1306\u127d \u130b\u122d \u12e8\u121a\u1230\u1229  \u12a5\u1295\u12f0\u121a\u1296\u1229 \u12ed\u1273\u1218\u1293\u120d \u1364\u1364\u12e8\u1200\u1308\u122d \u1218\u1220\u1228\u1275 \u1260\u1218\u1206\u1291 \u1365\u12e8\u120d\u1306\u127d \u1324\u1295\u1290\u1275\u1365\u12f0\u1205\u1295\u1290\u1275  \u1235\u12ac\u1275 \u12e8\u12a0\u1265\u122e\u1290\u1275 \u1235\u121c\u1275 \u12dc\u130d\u1290\u1275 \u12c8\u12d8\u1270 \u120b\u12ed \u1273\u120b\u1245 \u1270\u1345\u12d5\u1296 \u1235\u120b\u1208\u12cd \u12ed\u1230\u1229\u1260\u1273\u120d\u1364\u1364\u1203\u12ed\u121b\u1296\u1275 \u1263\u1208\u1260\u1275 \u12e8\u12ad\u122d\u1235\u12eb\u1295\u12f0\u1234\u1275 \u1260\u121d\u1275\u1263\u1208\u12cb \u1200\u1308\u122d \u130d\u134d\u1293 \u132d\u12ab\u1294 \u1232\u1260\u122b\u12a8\u1275 \u121b\u12e8\u1275 \u12a5\u1305\u1309\u1295 \u12eb\u1233\u12dd\u1293\u120d\u1365\u1365\u1353\u1235\u1270\u122e\u1279 \u12c8\u12f4\u1275 \u12a0\u1209 \u121d\u1295\u1235 \u12a5\u12e8\u1230\u1229 \u1246\u12e9 \u12f5\u130d\u1235 \u12a5\u1293 \u12f0\u121e\u12db\u1278\u12cd\u1295 \u1208\u121b\u12f3\u1260\u122d \u1232\u1295\u1308\u120b\u1271 \u12a8\u121b\u12e8\u1275 \u1260\u1240\u122d \u1235\u1208\u120c\u120b \u12e8\u121a\u1218\u1220\u12ad\u122d\u120b\u1278\u12cd \u12a0\u12eb\u1308\u1299\u121d\u1364\u1364\u12a5\u1295\u12f4\u1275 \u1262\u1263\u120d \u12a8\u12f0\u1305\u1205 \u12a5\u12e8\u12cd \u1290\u12cd \u1290\u1308\u1229\u1364\u1364\u12a0\u1293\u12f3\u1295\u12f6\u1279\u121b \u1230\u120b\u121d\u1295 \u12e8\u121a\u1230\u1265\u12a9 \u1326\u122d\u1290\u1275 \u12ed\u1241\u121d \u12dc\u130b \u1270\u1328\u1348\u1328\u1348 \u12e8\u121a\u1209  \u1233\u12ed\u1206\u1295 \u120b\u1295\u12f5 \u12c8\u1308\u1295 \u12e8\u121a\u12eb\u12f0\u1209 \u12a0\u12ad\u1272\u126a\u1235\u1275 \u1206\u1290\u12cb\u120d\u1364\u1364 ++++Fannos, who ran away from ENDF and entered areas where Gumuz people lived in mass, are targeting these people and torturing and killing them.

August 27, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    1:26 pm Dear TPLF-supporting writers, Please attempt to send a letter that has just one sentence requesting that the TPLF mafia and violent Tigrayan businessmen cease stealing food supplies, resulting in the starving deaths of large numbers of children and patients. And again, another warning to the TPLF to put an end to those thieves who kill women while stealing their valuables and phones. It should be emphasized that a significant portion of crimes against women have involved Tigrayan youth. When foreigners were fighting a brutal war in Tigray, Tigrayans attacked Tigrayans and committed serious crimes against women. While it is evident that Eritreans and Fannos committed severe crimes in Tigray in a 2-year-long war that still continues to loom over Tigray, don\u2019t hold Eritreans or Amhara solely responsible for all crimes. According to rough estimates made by observers and caseworkers who asked to remain anonymous, nearly 15% of crimes against women are committed by Tigrayans themselves. Don\u2019t lie. It is shameful, and you cannot hide it for so long. A lady has been subjected to atrocities and killed recently in Tigray. The region has a violent background when it comes to atrocities against women and against people of various regions and woredas. Things will not be kept under wraps for so long and will be itching and exposing themselves in various ways. NB: Please invite those TPLF-supporting hooligans here and help them read out loud and translate them, as they cannot understand their own faults and serious crimes; they suffer from self-serving bias or confirmation bias, attributing every failure to Amharas and fanno criminals, who have the same traits too.

Reply Ittu Aba Farda August 28, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t    At\t\t\t\t\t\t    1:42 am This is what you get when you produce a generation primed for killing others and wanton violence.  This is just a harbinger of lawlessness that will engulf regions that had their own armed militia fighting for liberating this or that nonsense.  Some of those regions had\/have battle hardened riff raffs with a history of being demonically sadists to others who labeled enemies by their bigot leaders.  Tigray, Oromia, Benishangul, Gambela and Amhara regions seem to be awash with such brutes.  The sight of gushing human blood is like the unfurling of a red rose bud.  I hope my fear will be wrong and unqualified but unless some efficient mitigating steps are taken and taken now that country could go Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador soon.  Some areas in Oromia, Amhara, Gambela and Benishangul are as such already.  They will come and kidnap or even worse kill you.  There is no capable justice system in place in those areas to hold perpetrators accountable avenge you.  You are just one worthless and expendable object.  There is no fearless gunslinger Wyatt Earp to gun down your killers in a duel. That is why I\u2019m having beef with those of you who have been inflaming the situation over there.  You gonna answer for all of that on The Judgment Day.  You must be ashamed of yourself.

REUTERS\/Tiksa Negeri\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab GENEVA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Fighting between Ethiopia's military and militiamen in the Amhara region has killed at least 183 people, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday, providing the most comprehensive independent death toll to date of the month-long conflict. More than 1,000 people have been arrested nationwide, many of them reported to be young people of ethnic Amhara origin, under a state of emergency the government decreed to respond to the violence, the UN added in a statement. Sign up here. Ethiopia's government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The conflict has been fuelled by accusations among many in Amhara, Ethiopia's second most populous region, that the government is trying to undermine its security. The government denies the accusation. Government forces reclaimed major towns and cities across the region earlier this month after initially being chased out by the militiamen, but the conflict has ground on. \"With federal forces reasserting their presence in certain towns and Fano militias reportedly retreating into rural areas, we call on all actors to stop killings, other violations and abuses,\" the UN statement said. At least four people were killed in fresh fighting that erupted in the town of Debre Tabor on Sunday, two doctors said. The clashes broke out about a week after Ethiopia's military entered the town, one of the doctors said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. One of the doctors said he had seen the bodies of four people killed in the clashes and many wounded, including his father-in-law, who he said was shot in the chest by an unknown gunman near his house. The other doctor said at least seven people had died - three civilians and four police officers, who were fighting in support of the military.

REUTERS\/Tiksa Negeri\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Companies State of emergency applies to Amhara, could be extended elsewhere if needed Order follows days of clashes between military, militia ADDIS ABABA, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Ethiopia's government declared a six-month state of emergency on Friday in the country's second-largest region, Amhara, following days of clashes between the military and local Fano militiamen, giving it powers to impose curfews, restrict movement and ban gatherings. The fighting that broke out earlier this week has quickly become Ethiopia's most serious security crisis since a two-year civil war in Tigray region, which neighbours Amhara, ended in November. Sign up here. Amhara's regional government requested additional help from federal authorities on Thursday to reimpose order. \"It was found necessary to declare a state of emergency as it had become difficult to control this outrageous activity based on the regular legal system,\" Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office said in a statement. The unrest is the latest spasm of violence to hit the country, the second most populous in Africa after Nigeria, since Abiy took office in 2018. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his peacemaking efforts with Eritrea. Friday's order gave the government powers to impose curfews, restrict movement, ban the carrying of guns and other sharp objects, ban public gatherings, and to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants. The government could also close or limit the movements of media outlets it deems to be operating contrary to the emergency orders, the Government Communication Service said in a posting on the messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter. The orders applied to Amhara for now, but could be imposed in other areas if needed, the government said. SOURED RELATIONS Fano, a part-time militia that draws volunteers from the local population, was a key ally of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) during the Tigray war. But the relationship has soured, in part over recent efforts by federal authorities to weaken regional paramilitary groups. Some activists say this has left Amhara vulnerable to attack by neighbouring regions. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke of progress in implementing the cease fire in the north but expressed concern about the situation in Amhara and Oromo regions in a call with Abiy on Friday, the State Department said. They discussed establishing a humanitarian aid distribution system with strengthened oversight to allow food aid to resume, it said. Concerns that food was being diverted prompted the United States to suspend such aid to Ethiopia in June. Two residents of Amhara's second-biggest city, Gondar, said on Friday that intense fighting took place the previous day near the university. \"ENDF first controlled the university, but they were pushed back by Fano. They were trying to advance to the centre of the city, but they couldn't,\" said one resident. The other, a local official, said the military had pulled back from the university but did not say why. Both asked not to be named for security reasons. A Fano member, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the militiamen were trying to encircle Amhara's capital Bahir Dar. He said they had captured Merawi, a town 30 km (18 miles) south of Bahir Dar. Reuters could not independently confirm his claims. An ENDF spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. However, Education Minister Berhanu Nega told a news conference that 16,000 students in Gondar were unable to do their leaving exams on Thursday. Mobile internet remained down in the region, residents said. Ethiopian Airlines cancelled flights to three of the four airports it flies to in Amhara, an airline spokesperson said. Violent protests erupted across Amhara in April after Abiy ordered that security forces from Ethiopia's 11 regions be integrated into the police or national army. Protesters said the order was meant to weaken Amhara. The federal government denied this and said the objective was ensuring national unity. Since coming to power, Abiy has tried to centralise power in a country whose regions each have a measure of autonomy. The war in Tigray was rooted in tensions between regional and federal authority as well as old grievances between ethnic groups. Tens of thousands of people were killed and millions forced from their homes before a truce was signed.

She, along with the delegates she led,\u00a0 are\u00a0 also scheduled to visit\u00a0 social projects and hold a meeting with the private sector representatives in the country, according to the Ministry of Finance. It is unclear how the representatives were elected. Last month the IMF executive board\u00a0 decided to release $US 248 million to Ethiopia after evaluating the implementation of the reform measures.

In July 2024, his government passed decision to depreciate Ethiopian currency. In the same month, $US 1 was exchanging for 57 Ethiopian birr.

{"year":"2025","month":"03","event_desc":"11 March  Fighters loyal to Tigray People's Liberation Front leader Debretsion Gebremichael take control of Adigrat, Tigray Region.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Fears grow of renewed conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray Addis Ababa (AFP) \u2013 Infighting between rival factions in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray has raised the spectre of a fresh war between Ethiopia and neighbouring Eritrea, analysts and residents said Thursday. Issued on: 13\/03\/2025 - 12:31 Modified: 13\/03\/2025 - 12:29 3 min Infighting between rival factions in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray has raised the spectre of a fresh war \u00a9 EDUARDO SOTERAS \/ AFP\/File The region's embattled administrator has appealed for help from the federal government as a rival faction has challenged his power and international embassies called for \"urgent dialogue\" to de-escalate tensions. Tigray was the scene of one of the most devastating wars of the century between 2020 and 2022, having claimed as many as 600,000 lives, according to some estimates. It pitted local forces against the federal government, allied militias and Eritrean soldiers. Despite a November 2022 peace agreement, the region has not found stability. Disputes between rival factions have intensified recently, with deteriorating relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia coming soon after the deal. The federal government appointed veteran Tigray politician Getachew Reda as head of an interim regional administration. But he has been challenged by his former ally, the leader of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, Debretsion Gebremichael. On Tuesday, forces loyal to Debrietson took control of Adigrat, Tigray's second-largest city. \"The town is under renewed tension, the population fears a return to the bad old days of the war,\" one local resident told AFP on condition of anonymity. 'Close' to new conflict Getachew ordered the suspension of three generals of the Tigray Defence Forces, accusing the rival faction of trying to \"take over the whole of Tigray\" in an interview with Tigrai Mass Media Agency. There is growing fear that Ethiopia's neighbour and historic rival, Eritrea, may take advantage of the situation to launch an invasion. \"We have been close to a new conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia for the past two years,\" Kjetil Tronvoll, Oslo University professor specialising in the region, told AFP. \"We just do not know what will be the triggering factor.\" Afwerki's dissatisfaction with the 2022 peace agreement, Abiy's ambitions for a Red Sea port, and geopolitical interest from the Middle East have all played into the deteriorating tensions, he argued. That has left the \"two countries inching closer to a new war\", he added. \"The situation in Tigray can be the triggering factor.\" Rising tension Relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea have seen extreme highs and lows since the latter's independence in 1993. A bloody two-year war pitted the countries against each other over territorial disputes, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths between 1998 and 2000. Abiy was lauded, including winning the Nobel Peace Prize, for finally reaching a peace agreement with Eritrea when he came to power in 2018. It briefly allowed borders to reopen to the isolated country, which Afeworki has ruled virtually unchallenged since 1993. However, relations have strained since the end of the Tigray war in 2022. Eritrea claimed in February that Ethiopia was waging an \"intense campaign\" against it. \"A war between Ethiopia and Eritrea could break out at any moment,\" said General Tsadkan Gebretensae, senior strategist for the Tigray forces in Getachew's administration, in remarks published earlier this week. 'Ongoing clashes' A group of Western embassies, including the United States, Britain, Japan and the European Union issued a statement saying there must be \"no return to violence\". \"We strongly urge all parties to protect the (2022) Agreement by de-escalating and engaging in urgent dialogue,\" they said in a post on the US embassy X account. France earlier called on its nationals in Tigray to \"stock up on emergency supplies (food, water, medicine, and possibly fuel) and to exercise utmost caution.\" \"Given the ongoing internal clashes in Tigray, particularly in Adigrat and in the regional capital, Mekele, all travel throughout the Tigray region is now formally discouraged,\" its foreign ministry said. Getachew's administration asked the Ethiopian government on Wednesday to \"provide necessary assistance\", though he told reporters that the assistance he had requested was not military. Federal authorities in the capital Addis Ababa have not yet commented. \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Mohamud made a visit to Ahmed in Ethiopia on Jan. 11, 2025. (Presidential Press Office via Reuters) Share Somali president makes surprise visit to Ethiopia amid strained relations share Print Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud arrived in Ethiopia\u2019s capital on Saturday, exactly a month to the day since the two countries\u2019 leaders reached an agreement aimed at ending a bitter, yearlong dispute. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he received Mohamud at the Addis Ababa airport. The Somali president\u2019s office earlier published a statement confirming Mohamud\u2019s visit to Addis Ababa at the invitation of Ethiopia\u2019s leader. \u201cThe discussions with the Ethiopian leadership aim to strengthen bilateral relations and advance shared priorities,\u201d the statement said. Ethiopia and Somalia reached a diplomatic agreement on Dec. 11 called the \u201cAnkara Declaration\u201d following a heated diplomatic dispute ignited over a controversial maritime access deal between Ethiopia and the breakaway Somalian region of Somaliland. Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding on Jan. 1, 2024, with Somaliland allowing it to lease 20 kilometers of seafront for 50 years in return for diplomatic recognition, Somaliland officials said. The Somali government rejected the deal, calling it \"null and void,\" and accused Ethiopia of \"blatant violation\" of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Under the Ankara Declaration, mediated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia reaffirmed their respect and commitment to one another\u2019s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. In addition, the two sides also agreed to work together to finalize \"mutually advantageous commercial arrangements through bilateral agreements, including contract, lease and similar modalities, which will allow the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to enjoy reliable, secure and sustainable access to and from the sea, under the sovereign authority of the Federal Republic of Somalia.\" In the streets of Addis Ababa, photos of the Somali leader were posted on electronic boards on major streets, according to a VOA reporter in Addis Ababa. \"Welcome President Sheikh Mahmoud,\u201d was written under one of the photos. The flags of Somalia and Ethiopia were flown. The roads leading from Bole Airport to the palace were guarded by Ethiopia\u2019s Federal Police. Somalia said Mohamud\u2019s visit, which is his first since alleging he was \u201cprevented\u201d from entering the African Union headquarters in February 2024 by Ethiopian security forces, \u201cbuilds on\u201d the Ankara agreement. In April, Somalia expelled Ethiopian Ambassador Muktar Mohamed Ware, alleging \"internal interference\" by Ethiopia. In October, Somalia declared a counselor working at the Ethiopian Embassy in Mogadishu persona non grata and ordered him to leave. Somalia also ordered the closure of Ethiopian consulates in Hargeisa, Somaliland; and Garowe, Puntland \u2014 although both remained open. In a joint communique issued Saturday evening, the two leaders said they agreed to \u201crestore and enhance\u201d their bilateral relations through full diplomatic representation in their respective capitals. \u201cThe leaders reaffirmed that the stability of the region requires strong cooperation between the two countries based on mutual trust, confidence and respect,\u201d the communique said. Prior to the trip to Addis Ababa, Mohamud visited Kampala, Uganda, for a continental summit on agricultural development, where he met with President Yoweri Museveni and Kenyan President William Ruto, two leaders who at one point attempted to mediate between Somalia and Ethiopia before the Ankara Declaration emerged. \u201cThe president\u2019s diplomatic engagement are part of a broader regional tour, which includes recent productive visits to Eritrea and Djibouti,\u201d the statement from Villa Somalia said. Commenting on the meeting with Mohamud, Ruto said relations between the two countries have \u201cprogressively deepened\u201d since Somalia joined the regional economic bloc East African Community last year. \u201cOur two countries are doing more business than before, with Somalia buying goods worth KSh5 billion [$38 million] in the first nine months of 2024,\u201d he posted. \u201cOn peace and security, Kenya, and indeed the region, will continue to be engaged in collaborative efforts to ensure stability in Somalia,\u201d Ruto said.

Her planned visit was announced over a week or so ago. The Ministry of Finance has announced that she will be meeting with Abiy Ahmed and other senior government officials.

She, along with the delegates she led,\u00a0 are\u00a0 also scheduled to visit\u00a0 social projects and hold a meeting with the private sector representatives in the country, according to the Ministry of Finance. It is unclear how the representatives were elected. Last month the IMF executive board\u00a0 decided to release $US 248 million to Ethiopia after evaluating the implementation of the reform measures. Economists criticize Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s administration for being submissive to the IMF conditionalities for the fund. In July 2024, his government passed decision to depreciate Ethiopian currency. In the same month, $US 1 was exchanging for 57 Ethiopian birr. Within two weeks it started to see free fall and now it is exchanging up to 130 Ethiopian birr in banks and 150 in the parallel market. __ Subscribe : https:\/\/borkena.com\/subscribe-borkena\/ Join our Telegram Channel : t.me\/borkena Like borkena on Facebook Add your business to Ethiopian Business Listing \/ Ethiopian Business Directory\u00a0 Business Listing Toronto Join the conversation.

Details are only just emerging of the kidnappings, which took place earlier this week. The incident happened in Ali Doro, which is near an area where around 100 university students were similarly abducted as they were heading home from their campus last July. Survivors and local authorities blamed those abductions on the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group that operates in the area. The group denied involvement at the time. Referring to this week's incident, the OLA has said it had received reports of the abductions and that it was \"conducting an investigation\". According to one report by a local media organisation, the passengers were heading to Debre Markos, a town in the country's Amhara region, when they were attacked by the armed men, who exchanged fire with local security forces. Another report said several buses were attacked, during which at least one person died. The number of abductees could be as high as 50, according to this report. The government has not yet said anything about the kidnappings, and the BBC's attempts to get an official response have been unsuccessful. Abductions of civilians - including passengers - have become increasingly common in the area. Armed groups here have in the past demanded ransoms for the release of the people they hold. The OLA says it is fighting for the self-determination of Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo. It has been classified as a terrorist organisation by the federal parliament and operates in various areas in Oromia, including the district where Ali Doro is located.

(Hasnoor Hussain\/Pool Photo via AP, File) By SAMUEL GETACHEW Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) \u2014 Ethiopia\u2019s parliament on Thursday introduced a new tax for all workers as part of measures to fill the financial gap left by the USAID funding pause. The funds collected will go to a new Ethiopian Disaster Risk Response Fund to pay for projects previously funded by USAID, Ethiopia\u2019s biggest partner for development and humanitarian efforts. Ethiopia is facing recurring conflict in some of its regions including Tigray, which is recovering from a two-year conflict , Amhara and Oromia. The conflicts have left millions of people in need of food aid and healthcare. The new tax will apply to people employed in both the private and public sectors. A mandatory contribution will also be asked of companies across sectors such as banking and hospitality. The new bill has been forwarded to a parliamentary committee for deliberation on the percentages to be contributed. Ethiopia with its population of over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year.

{"year":"2025","month":"03","event_desc":"22 March  The Ethiopian Army kills over 300 Fano fighters in renewed clashes in Amhara Region. Fano disputes the army's claims, alleging significant casualties on the military.","text":"The armed group contradicts the army\u2019s claim of having \u2018destroyed\u2019 the former ally in the Amhara region. Ethiopian troops have killed more than 300 Fano armed group fighters, former allies against rebels in the Tigray region, in two days of renewed clashes in the northern Amhara region, according to the army. The military claimed in a statement on Friday that the fighters had carried out attacks in various zones of the Amhara region before being \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the army. The statement said that 317 Fano fighters were killed and 125 others injured. However, Abebe Fantahun, spokesperson of Amhara Fano in Wollo Bete-Amhara, contradicted the tally, telling the Reuters news agency late on Friday the army had not killed even 30 of their fighters. Yohannes Nigusu, spokesperson for Fano in Gondar, Amhara region, said 602 federal army soldiers were killed in the fighting and 430 wounded, while 98 soldiers had been captured and weapons had been seized by the fighters. The Fano fighters fought alongside the Ethiopian army and Eritrean forces in a two-year war against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front, which controls the northern Tigray region. Since then, Eritrea and Ethiopia have fallen out, with the former excluded from peace talks to end that war in November 2022. Fighting between the army and the Fano fighters broke out in July 2023, following Amhara\u2019s sense of betrayal regarding the terms of the 2022 peace deal. Last year, the TPLF split into two factions led by Debretsion Gebremichael and Getachew Reda, each claiming party control. The army\u2019s statement on Friday accused Brigadier General Migbey Haile, a senior military official allied with Debretsion\u2019s faction, of supporting the Fano fighters\u2019 attacks in the Amhara region. \u201cBrigadier General Migbey Haile is an anti-peace and anti-development promoter who has a history of putting the people of Tigray into war without any military knowledge,\u201d the army said. However, Abebe told Reuters that that was a \u201clie\u201d and denied the general had any links to the Fano fighters. Fears of a new war emerged in recent weeks after Eritrea reportedly ordered a nationwide military mobilisation and Ethiopia deployed troops towards their border. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch has accused the Ethiopian military of human rights abuses and committing war crimes during its ongoing fight against the Fano fighters. Last year, Human Rights Watch found that several dozen civilians were executed in the town of Merawi in Ethiopia\u2019s northwestern Amhara region. \u201cThe Ethiopian armed forces\u2019 brutal killings of civilians in Amhara undercut government claims that it\u2019s trying to bring law and order to the region,\u201d deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch, Laetitia Bader, said. \u201cSince fighting began between federal forces and the Fano militia, civilians are once again bearing the brunt of an abusive army operating with impunity,\u201d she added.

{"year":"2025","month":"03","event_desc":"Fighters loyal to Tigray People's Liberation Front leader Debretsion Gebremichael seize the mayor's office in Mekele.","text":"Rival forces seize mayor's office in key Ethiopian town amid fears of new conflict 14 March 2025 Share Save Kalkidan Yibeltal BBC News, Mekelle Share Save Amensisa Ifa \/ BBC Mekelle, a key city in northern Ethiopia, is still reeling from the two-year conflict A dissident faction of the main political party in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray has seized control of key offices and a radio station in the regional capital, Mekelle, amid growing fears of a fresh conflict. It follows a deepening power struggle within the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which has raised concerns of a return to civil war. One Mekelle resident told the BBC that people were withdrawing money from their bank accounts, fearing the security situation could deteriorate. On Tuesday, the same faction took control of Adigrat, Tigray's second-largest city. Getachew Reda, president of Tigray's interim administration, has accused the rival group, led by Debretsion Gebremichael, of attempting to forcefully remove him from office. Getachew became Tigray's leader following a 2022 peace deal ending two years of conflict in the region, which killed an estimated 500,000 people. Debretsion Gebremichael was previously the region's leader but over the past year, relations have soured with the man who replaced him. On Thursday, members of Debretsion's faction accompanied by armed soldiers took control of Mekelle FM radio station and the mayor's office in the city. Gunshots were heard on Wednesday night in Adi-Gudem, a town near Mekelle,  when forces from the dissident faction attempted to occupy a government building. The forces reportedly arrested the town's mayor and took control of the office. Getachew has suspended three generals of the Tigray Defence Forces, accusing the rival faction of trying to destabilise the region. On Wednesday, Getachew asked the Ethiopian government to \"provide necessary assistance\", without specifying the kind of support. He is currently in the country's capital Addis Ababa for \"consultations with the federal authorities\" but he told the BBC that he intends to return to Tigray. Federal authorities in Ethiopia have not yet commented. In a press statement on Thursday, Getachew accused his rivals of colluding with neighbouring Eritrea, which was involved in Tigray's civil war and has a fractious relationship with Ethiopia's government. \"We have reason to believe external actors are involved,\" he said, accusing Eritrea of being among those who think \"they would benefit from turmoil in Tigray\". Eritrea denies any such intention but its army fought in the previous war, where it was accused of mass killings and rape. Two close allies of Debretsion have rejected the accusation they are linked to Eritrea, and downplayed the possibility of another round of conflict. Speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme, Getachew accused high-ranking Tigrayan military officers of attempting to orchestrate an \"open coup\". The tensions have sparked fresh anxiety in the region, which is yet to recover from the conflict that ended in 2022 after the TPLF and the Ethiopian government signed a peace deal. The agreement led to the creation of the interim administration, which is supposed to govern Tigray until regional elections are held. But delays in implementing the agreement have fuelled sharp divisions within the TPLF. Several countries including the US, Britain and the European Union have warned about the escalating tension, saying there must be \"no return to violence\". On Thursday, France called on its nationals in Tigray to \"stock up on emergency supplies and to exercise utmost caution\". In a statement, the African Union said it was following events in Tigray with \"deep concern\".

At least 31 people have died from a \u201crapidly spreading\u201d cholera outbreak that has sickened more than 1,500 people in Ethiopia \u2018s Gambella region over the past month, according to Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF. The international medical charity said on Friday that the situation has worsened with the arrival of people fleeing violence in neighbouring South Sudan . \u201cCholera is rapidly spreading across western Ethiopia and in parallel, the outbreak in South Sudan is ongoing, endangering thousands of lives,\u201d MSF said in a statement. Several regions of Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation with about 120 million people, are battling cholera outbreaks, with Amhara \u2013 its second-largest region \u2013 among the hardest hit. Cholera is an acute intestinal infection spread through food and water contaminated with the vibrio cholerae bacterium, often of faecal origin. In South Sudan\u2019s Akobo County, located in the Upper Nile region, 1,300 cholera cases have been reported in the past four weeks, according to MSF. It said recent violence around the Upper Nile between the South Sudanese government and armed groups is \u201cworsening the outbreak\u201d. \u201cThousands are being displaced, losing access to healthcare, safe water, and sanitation,\u201d MSF said. South Sudan, the world\u2019s youngest nation and still hit by chronic instability and poverty, declared a cholera epidemic in October last year. \u201cIn Ethiopia, we are treating patients, providing clean water, and raising awareness about the disease. In South Sudan, we are delivering lifesaving care,\u201d MSF reported. \u201cAn urgent support to health facilities, provision of safe water and cholera vaccination campaign is needed in the affected areas to stop the spread of the disease.\u201d According to the World Health Organization, about 4,000 people have died from the \u201cpreventable and easily treatable disease\u201d in 2023, up 71 percent from the previous year, mostly in Africa . The threat of the spread of cholera in Ethiopia is further complicated by the brewing tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which observers said could result in an armed conflict. The warnings stem from new instability in northern Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region, where a civil war from 2020-2022 killed hundreds of thousands of people.

Abiy is the first Oromo to lead Africa's second-most populous country [File: EPA] Published On 2 Apr 2018 2 Apr 2018 Ethiopia\u2019s parliament has elected Abiy Ahmed as the new prime minister, a week after the ruling coalition nominated him to succeed Hailemariam Desalegn. Abiy was sworn in on Monday shortly after his election to become Africa\u2019s second-most populous country\u2019s 16th prime minister and the first Oromo to hold Ethiopia\u2019s top seat. Hailemariam resigned in February, following months of protests in the Oromia and Amhara region that led to the deaths of hundreds of people. The protests , which initially began over land rights, but later broadened to include calls for greater political representation at the national level, met a harsh government response. Abiy, 41, a former lieutenant-colonel in the army and head of Ethiopia \u2018s\u00a0science and technology ministry, has a reputation as an effective orator and reformer. \u2018Historic moment\u2019 Ahmed Adam, a research associate at University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies\u00a0(SOAS), told Al Jazeera on Monday that he believed things would change under Abiy. \u201cThis is a very historic moment for Ethiopia and for the ruling coalition in the country. He is the first Oromo PM. This will pave the way for the stability and unity of the country,\u201d he said. Advertisement \u201cAbiy is a part of the establishment of course, but he\u2019s a reformist and came from a mixed religious background with a Christian mother and a Muslim father. \u201c Merara Gudina, a p rominent opposition leader, expressed cautious optimism over Abiy\u2019s election. \u201cWhat he aims to achieve depends on what his party allows him to do,\u201d Merara said, adding that Abiy was elected by Ethiopia\u2019s ruling party and not directly by the population through a general election. \u201cBut still it goes without saying that a change in personalities within the leadership may bring changes in terms of bringing better ideas that may ultimately lead to national reconciliation.\u201d Ethiopia in February declared its second state of emergency in two years amid the ongoing protests that effectively crippled transportation networks and forced the closure of businesses. On Saturday, Ethiopian officials said that more than 1,000 people have been detained since the latest emergency rule was put in place.

{"year":"2018","month":"01","event_desc":"22 January  Seven people die in clashes over the weekend in Woldiya, Amhara Region between security forces and Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers taking part in the ceremony of Timkat.","text":"Weekend clashes during Ethiopia religious festival leave seven dead By Aaron Maasho January 23, 2018 7:41 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least seven people died after clashes broke out between security forces and worshippers taking part in a religious ceremony marking Epiphany in northern Ethiopia over the weekend, officials said. Authorities in the Horn of Africa country's Amhara region said they were yet to determine the causes of the violence that first erupted on Saturday in the town of Woldiya, more than 500 kilometres north of the capital Addis Ababa. \"Attempts to unblock roads and prevent the destruction of property are still ongoing. The situation has improved (since Sunday) but we are still having to undertake such measures,\" said Amare Goshu, a police commissioner of the district. One member of security forces deployed to quell the violence was among the dead, he said. Orthodox Christians use Epiphany celebrations to mark the baptism of Jesus Christ. It was not immediately clear if the violence is related to unrest that plagued the country in 2015 and 2016. In Ethiopia's central Oromiya province, hundreds were killed over that period in violence triggered by allegations of land grabs, with protests then broadening into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses. Protests had also previously taken place in the Amhara region, with dozens dying in violence sparked by a territorial dispute. Ethiopia is a Western ally against Islamist militants in neighboring Somalia and an economic power seen as a centre of relative stability in a fragile region. The government in Addis Ababa has sought to calm political turmoil by announcing reforms and releasing dissidents. Last week, a senior opposition leader jailed for collusion with anti-government rebel groups was freed alongside 114 other inmates.

{"year":"2018","month":"02","event_desc":"15 February  Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned from office, becoming the first politician to resign from office in modern Ethiopian history.","text":"Ethiopia PM Hailemariam Desalegn in surprise resignation 15 February 2018 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Hailemariam Desalegn had been Ethiopia's prime minister since 2012 Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has resigned unexpectedly, saying he hoped to end years of unrest and political upheaval. In a televised address, he said his resignation was \"vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy\". Mr Hailemariam, who has led the country since 2012, also stepped down as chairman of the ruling coalition. Hundreds of people have died in three years of anti-government protests. Demonstrations first spread across the country in 2015 amid calls for political and economic reform and an end to state corruption. Africa Live: Latest updates Ethiopia country profile What is behind Ethiopia's wave of protests? Most of the unrest has centred on Ethiopia's two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara. A 10-month national state of emergency that ended last year failed to stop the protests, as did the release of thousands of opposition supporters from jail last month. . \"Unrest and a political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many,\" Mr Hailemariam said. \"I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy.\" Leaders of the governing coalition - the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) - held an emergency meeting following the announcement, the Addis Standard website reported. Getty Images Protesters are calling for reforms and an end to government corruption BBC Africa Correspondent Alastair Leithead says Ethiopia's economic growth has been impressive but its steamroller approach to development has sparked years of regional, ethnic-based protest. The old guard that runs Ethiopia is now afraid its federal, Soviet-style system could collapse, he adds, leaving two possible solutions - to crack down harder on dissent or to try political reform. Can Ethiopia be Africa's leading manufacturing hub? Mr Hailemariam said he will stay on as a caretaker prime minister until parliament and the EPRDF accept his resignation and choose a replacement. Why did Hailemariam resign? Analysis by Kalkidan Yibeltal, BBC Amharic Service, Addis Ababa Since coming to power, Mr Hailemariam has been seen by the political elite as weak and lacking in leadership. His resignation could be a move by the coalition to find a stronger leader, or it could signal divisions among the constituent parties along ethnic lines. Particularly visible is the tension between the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, which has seen its dominance and influence wane, and the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation, which is becoming increasingly more assertive. Replacing Mr Hailemariam might also be one way to meet the demands of Oromo protesters who have accused the authorities of marginalisation. Getaneh Balcha, of the opposition Blue Party, said Mr Hailemariam's resignation was \"great news for Ethiopians\". \"This is the beginning. Other officials also need to follow this and transfer the power to the public,\" he said. Mr Hailemariam, a trained engineer, took office following the death of Meles Zenawi who had ruled since 1991. However, while the former deputy prime minister was a close ally of Mr Meles, he struggled to gain approval of the other EPRDF leaders in order to assume his role.

Police autopsy concluded Simegnew died from gunshot wound and a handgun was retrieved.","text":"Why Ethiopia is grieving for 'hero' dam engineer Simegnew Bekele 29 July 2018 Share Save Tara John BBC News Share Save Getty Images The death of Simegnew Bekele, the project manager of the multi-billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, has been met by an outpouring of grief in Ethiopia. Condolences flooded social media from journalists, businessmen academics, ambassadors and even flag-carrying Ethiopian Airlines after it was reported that Mr Simegnew's body was found in a car in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday.

Accept and continue The police are investigating the circumstances of his death. He died as a result of a bullet wound and a hand gun was found in his car, which was parked in Meskel Square in the city centre. By the afternoon, hundreds had taken to the streets in the capital, as well as Mr Simegnew's hometown of Gondar, with protesters demanding \"justice\" for the late engineer. To understand why a project manager has managed to elicit such shock and widespread mourning - normally seen in other countries after the death of royalty, celebrities or politicians - one has to look at what the Grand Ethiopian Dam has come to represent. 'Patriotic ambitions' Straddling the Nile, the dam has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent. Once built, the 1.8km (1.1 mile) wide and 155m (500ft 5in) high dam will triple the country's electricity production. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is set to be Africa's biggest hydropower plant, is one of a number of large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at putting Ethiopia on course to become a middle-income nation by 2025. Its scale and potential has brought rare unity in the country, which has faced political and ethnic strife over the years, Beletu Bulbula Sorsu, editor of BBC's Afaan Oromo Service, says. \"The project unites Ethiopians,\" she says. The authorities says Mr Simegnew is going to get a funeral \"a national hero deserves\" Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who knew Mr Simegnew, says he has come to represent these patriotic ambitions. \"He was someone who was extremely patriotic and had devoted his life to the betterment of his country,\" she told the BBC'S Focus on Africa radio programme. \"He seemed to have devoted his entire life to Ethiopia's future by contributing what he could, which was his engineering skills.\" Not a 'big man' The 53-year-old gained his degree in civil engineering from Addis Ababa University and went on to to lead two other dam projects - Gilgel Gibe I and Gilgel Gibe II dams. The new dam will regulate the flow of the Nile He came to the public's attention in 2011, when he was put in charge of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ms Beletu says he was frequently interviewed by the press and was widely perceived as being uncorrupted, modest and accessible. \"He was not a 'big man,'\" she says of Mr Simegnew's honest nature. \"He behaved as if he was one of the the labourers working on the project.\" Read more Will Ethiopian dam dry up the Nile? Why the Nile could see a 'water war' Abiy Ahmed - the man changing Ethiopia Can Ethiopia be Africa's leading manufacturing hub? Tibebeselassie Tigabu, from the BBC's Amharic Service, interviewed Mr Simegnew days before he died. \"He gave his life for the dam,\" she says, explaining that he spent most of his time around the dam, which was located in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region near Sudan, nearly 1,000km north-west of his home in Addis Ababa. \"It is a difficult place to live and he had been there for more than six years,\" she adds. A man of symbols Mr Simegnew became the symbol of the dam and his death might become emblematic of the problems facing the project. \"He was the spokesman for the project, he was the front man and I am not sure how that will be replaced so easily,\" Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. The dam is believed to be 60% complete, but there has been growing anger over delays. In the last week of July, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said that at the current pace of construction the dam might not be completed in the next 10 years. Ethiopians are proud of the fact that the dam is a largely self-financed project. But a dollar shortage crisis has slowed down its construction, Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. Then there is geopolitical tension the dam has created downstream with Egypt worried that the infrastructure project will put a strain on its water supply. \"While the project is coming into trouble for practical reasons, I also see his death as a real blow to the symbolism of this project and how it was recorded in the psyche of normal Ethiopians,\" she says. Mr Simegnew was expected to be buried a day after his death. But a statement by a national committee set up to organise his funeral said it had postponed the burial. They have instead made arrangements for a bigger funeral on Sunday 29 July \"that a national hero like him deserves\". Will Ethiopian dam dry up the Nile?

{"year":"2018","month":"07","event_desc":"14 July  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed made landmark visit to Eritrea and welcomed by Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.","text":"Eritrea's Isaias Afwerki in historic Ethiopia visit 14 July 2018 Share Save Share Save Reuters Mr Afwerki arrived in Ethiopia on Saturday - his first visit to the country in two decades Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki is visiting Ethiopia for the first time since the start of the two countries' border war in 1998. The three-day visit aims to cement ties just days after the two neighbours declared their \"state of war\" over. Mr Afwerki was welcomed on arrival by Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Thousands of people, many waving Eritrean flags, lined the streets of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to mark the historic visit on Saturday. Mr Afwerki, whose visit is the latest in a string of moves towards reconciliation between Africa's erstwhile bitter enemies, was also greeted by dozens of traditional Ethiopian dancers while a brass band performed for him as he walked the red carpet. Reuters Some residents painted their faces for the welcome ceremony for Mr Afwerki AFP People sang and waved Ethiopian flags from their balconies Along the main road from the airport, thousands of Ethiopians gathered to celebrate with both Ethiopian and Eritrean flags waved side-by-side. Speaking at a lunch hosted by Mr Abiy, Mr Afwerki said history was being made following an agreement that will see diplomatic and trade relations restored and lead to the resumption of flights between the two countries. \"Words cannot express the joy we are feeling now,\" he said. Reuters People lined roads in Addis Ababa wearing T-shirts emblazoned with images of both leaders Last week Mr Abiy travelled to Eritrea's capital, Asmara, where the two leaders signed a pact formally ending the state of war while agreeing to re-establish diplomatic and trade ties after two decades of hostility. Since taking office in Ethiopia in April, Mr Abiy has announced a series of reforms, and spoken of mending ties with Eritrea. 'I only live to see my daughters again' Is this the man to change Ethiopia? An improved relationship between the two could also see the reunification of families who have been divided by the conflict. Why is this a big deal? The two countries have been in a state of \"no war, no peace\" since 2000, when a peace deal ended a war in which tens of thousands of people were killed. A border commission set up under the peace agreement ruled that the town of Badme, the flashpoint for the conflict, was part of Eritrea but Ethiopia refused to accept this and so normal relations were never resumed. The two leaders have now committed to fully implementing the commission's decision. The rivalry affected the whole region. The countries took rival sides in Somalia's long conflict - Eritrea was accused of backing Islamist groups, while Ethiopia, a US ally, supported the internationally recognised government. Until now, Eritrea has said that war could resume at any time and this is why it has national conscription, or compulsory military service, which could last indefinitely. It is one of the main reasons why so many Eritreans try to leave the country and seek asylum in Europe. Making peace with Africa's North Korea Behind the smiles of Eritrea's president Mr Afwerki's visit is a remarkable turnaround for the 72-year-old independence leader who has been isolated diplomatically and seen as secretive and paranoid. Why is this happening now? As well as his overtures to Eritrea, Mr Abiy has lifted a state of emergency, freed political prisoners and announced economic reforms. He inherited a country that has seen some of the fastest economic growth in the world in recent years, but has also been riven by years of protests by people who feel marginalised. Mela Gebre Medhin Jubilant Eritreans took to the streets of the capital, Asmara, last week as Ethiopia's prime minister visited The previous government was accused by many of human rights violations - including torture and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents. Mr Abiy is the country's first Oromo leader - the ethnic group at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests, which have left hundreds of people dead. What will change? Along with diplomatic and trade ties, transport and telephone links will also be re-established. The first flights between the two countries in two decades are expected to begin next week - over the past 20 years it has been impossible to travel directly from one nation to the other. This raises the possibility that families who have been divided by the conflict could finally be reunited.

{"year":"2018","month":"08","event_desc":"1112 August  Paramilitaries from Somalia reportedly attacked the East Hararghe Zone in Oromia Region, killing at least 40 people.","text":"At least 40 killed by paramilitaries in eastern Ethiopia -official By Aaron Maasho August 14, 2018 7:22 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 40 people were killed by paramilitary forces in eastern Ethiopia over the weekend, in the latest spate of violence driven by ethnic divisions, a senior regional official said on Monday. The unrest along the border of the country's Somali and Oromiya provinces has displaced nearly a million people. On Monday, the Oromiya regional administration's spokesman Negeri Lencho said \"heavily-armed\" members of a paramilitary force from the Somali region had carried out cross-border attacks in Oromiya's East Hararghe district. \"We still do not know why Liyu forces raided the areas on Saturday and Sunday,\" he said, referring to the paramilitary soldiers. \"But we know that all the victims were ethnic Oromos. At least 40 were killed in the attacks.\" A week earlier, mobs looted properties owned by ethnic minorities in the Somali region's capital Jijiga. The central government said the unrest had been stoked by regional officials who had fallen out with central authorities trying to address rights abuses in the region. He said the officials claimed the government was illegally forcing them to resign, and that paramilitaries had taken part in the attacks under their orders. Officials in Oromiya blamed the Liyu force for repeated attacks last year. Authorities in the Somali region were not immediately available for comment. Ethnic violence has spread since protests broke out in the Oromiya region over land rights in 2015. Hundreds were killed by security forces over a two-year period.

The U.S. crafted a draft deal on the filling and operation of the dam based on proposals by legal and technical teams from all three countries and with input of the World Bank, according to a statement by U.S. Treasury Steven Mnuchin Egypt signed the deal, Ethiopia skipped the talks and Sudan, which attended, did not sign the U.S.-crafted deal.

{"year":"2020","month":"02","event_desc":"20 February  The Netherlands returns a stolen crown to the Government of Ethiopia.","text":"Dutch government returns stolen 18th-century 'precious crown' to Ethiopia By Bukola Adebayo, CNN Updated 1531 GMT (2331 HKT) February 20, 2020 Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed receives the 18th-century crown from the Dutch. (CNN) The Dutch government returned a stolen ceremonial crown to the Ethiopian government Thursday. The 18th-century crown, which has great religious significance, went missing from a church in Ethiopia 21 years ago, the Dutch government said in a statement. Sirak Asfaw, a Dutch national of Ethiopian origin who emigrated to the Netherlands in the late 1970s, said in a video recording that the crown \"came into his hands\" in 1998. Asfaw, a former refugee, told the AFP in an interview that he found the crown in a suitcase left behind by a guest to his apartment. However, he kept the priceless object hidden for 21 years. Read More He said he was reluctant to return \"looted heritage to the same regime as the one during which it was stolen...That is why I have waited for 21 years and have safeguarded it all those years,\" he said in a video posted when news of the crown emerged in October 2019. CNN was not able to reach Asfaw for comment before publishing. Special handover ceremony Asfaw added that he was also concerned that the Dutch authorities would offer to loan the crown to Ethiopia, as happened with a Nigerian Benin bronze which the British Museum had offered to return temporarily to its owners. However, last year Asfaw approached the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to let them know he was in possession of the object. \"Last year Asfaw got in touch through the mediation of art detective Arthur Brand, to discuss how to return this important cultural artefact to Ethiopia,\" the Ministry said in a statement . This kick-started a series of conversations that culminated in a special handover ceremony on Thursday where the Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed officially received the artifact. He thanked the Dutch government for bringing the \"precious crown\" home at an event that was also attended by Asfaw and Sigrid Kaag, Netherlands foreign trade and development cooperation minister. Kaag said the government was pleased to have expedited the \"rightful return\" of the artifact to Ethiopia. \"We're honoured and delighted to have been able to facilitate the rightful return. This is the crowning achievement of returning this heritage to its rightful place,\" Kaag said in a statement. More western governments have pledged to return stolen African artifacts that were looted from the continent centuries ago. In November, France handed a historical sword stolen from Senegal to the government and it says i t plans to permanently repatriate more artifacts looted from Africa during its colonial rule to their original owners. French collections house at least 90,000 pieces originating from sub-Saharan Africa with around 70,000 works in Paris' Quai Branly museum alone, according to a 2018 report on stolen artifacts from the continent.","question":"When did the Netherlands return the stolen 18th-century crown to Ethiopia?","answer":"The Netherlands returned the crown to Ethiopia in February 2020.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1294\u12d8\u122d\u120b\u1295\u12f5 \u12e818\u129b\u12cd \u12ad\u134d\u1208 \u12d8\u1218\u1295 \u12e8\u1270\u1230\u1228\u1240\u12cd\u1295 \u12a0\u12ad\u120a\u120d \u1208\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1218\u127c \u1218\u1208\u1230?","answer_translated":"\u1294\u12d8\u122d\u120b\u1295\u12f5 \u12a0\u12ad\u120a\u1209\u1295 \u1208\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1260\u134c\u1265\u1229\u12cb\u122a 2020 \u1218\u1208\u1230\u12cd\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u12a5\u1295\u12f0 \u1270\u1320\u122a \u1260\u1294\u12d8\u122d\u120b\u1295\u12f5 \u1270\u1230\u1228\u1240 \u12a5\u1295\u12f0 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1270\u12f0\u130b\u130b\u121a \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1270\u12f0\u130b\u130b\u121a \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1270\u12f0\u130b\u130b\u121a \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1270\u12f0\u130b\u130b\u121a \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1270\u12f0\u130b\u130b\u121a \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u124b\u121d \ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is incoherent and does not provide any meaningful information related to the question.

Oromia demonstrations broke out after assassination of well-known singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa. The military has been deployed in the Ethiopian capital on Wednesday as violence broke out in some neighbourhoods in a second day of unrest that claimed more than 80 lives. Popular musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa was shot dead on Monday in what police said was a targeted killing. Protests following the killing \u2013 spurred by a building sense of political marginalisation \u2013 broke out the next morning in the capital and other towns in the surrounding Oromia region. The assassination of Haacaaluu, a member of the country\u2019s largest Oromo ethnic group, stoked tensions that threaten to derail the country\u2019s democratic transition. \u201cSo far, 81 people have been killed, including three Oromia special police force members,\u201d said Bedassa Merdasa, the Oromia police chief. Gunshots echoed through many neighbourhoods and gangs armed with machetes and sticks roamed the streets. Witnesses described a situation pitting youths of Oromo origin against some of the city\u2019s other ethnic groups, and where both sides skirmished with police. \u201cWe had a meeting with the community, and we were told to arm ourselves with anything we have, including machetes and sticks. We no longer trust the police to protect us, so we have to prepare ourselves,\u201d said one Addis Ababa resident \u2013 who, like others interviewed, asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. The military had been deployed in some areas, three witnesses said. One described a street littered with rocks that anti-Oromo protesters had thrown at police Many residents feared Haacaaluu\u2019s funeral \u2013 scheduled for Thursday in his home town of Ambo \u2013 could ignite more violence. \u201cSecurity forces have invaded our town, we can\u2019t go out to mourn. No vehicles are moving around except security patrols with machine-guns,\u201d Chala Hunde, 27, said from Ambo, 100km (60 miles) west of Addis Ababa. \u201cThe security forces are putting a finger in our wound.\u201d A tussle over whether to bury Haacaaluu in Ambo or Addis Ababa laid bare the political tensions fanning the protests, said Professor Awol Allo at Britain\u2019s Keele University. \u201cIt\u2019s very contentious. Oromos claim the city [Addis Ababa] to be theirs as it lies fully within the Oromo regional state,\u201d he said. But the capital is under federal, not regional control. The state broadcaster reported the arrest of prominent journalist and activist Eskinder Nega, a former political prisoner who runs a pressure group opposed to what it describes as Oromo attempts to dominate the capital. A policeman was also killed in Addis Ababa, and three explosions there caused an unspecified number of deaths. Prominent Oromo opposition leader Bekele Gerba and media mogul Jawar Mohammed, along with 34 other people, were also arrested when Jawar\u2019s bodyguards refused to disarm during a standoff with police. Haacaaluu provided a soundtrack to a generation of young protesters. Their three years of bloody street demonstrations forced the unprecedented resignation of the previous prime minister and the appointment of Abiy Ahmed in 2018. Abiy, Haacaaluu and Jawar are all Oromo, Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic group, which has long complained of being excluded from power. Jawar was a prominent supporter of Abiy\u2019s appointment but became more openly critical last year. His popular Oromia Media Network gives him the ability to mobilise support quickly across Oromia and his power base could pose a significant challenge to Abiy\u2019s party in next year\u2019s elections. Ethiopia, an ethnic melting pot of 100 million people, has battled deadly intercommunal tensions in recent years, a major threat to efforts by Abiy to bring about democratic reforms in a country long ruled with an iron fist from Addis Ababa. \u201cThe assassination of an important Oromo musician, subsequent protests which have in places involved property destruction and security forces using lethal force, and the arrest of Oromo leaders, creates a dangerous situation and is another blow to Ethiopia\u2019s troubled transition,\u201d said William Davison, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. Officials say paramilitary forces from the Somali region carried out cross-border attacks in Oromia\u2019s East Hararghe. Ethiopian government says it has launched an investigation into the violence in Hawi Gudina and Daro Lebu districts.","question":"What triggered the protests in Ethiopia in July 2020?","answer":"The protests were triggered by the assassination of Ethiopian singer and activist Hachalu Hundessa.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e\u12ce\u127d \u1260\u1301\u120b\u12ed 2020 \u12e8\u1270\u1290\u1233\u12cd \u121d\u1295 \u1290\u1260\u122d?","answer_translated":"\u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e\u12ce\u1279 \u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb\u12ca\u12cd \u12d8\u134b\u129d \u12a5\u1293 \u12a0\u121d\u1262\u1233\u1270\u129b \u1200\u132b\u1209 \u1201\u1295\u12f4\u1233 \u1218\u130d\u12f0\u120b\u1278\u12cd \u1270\u1290\u1235\u1270\u12cd \u1290\u1260\u122d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u12e9\u1292\u1268\u122d\u1232\u1272 \u1241\u1325\u122d \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u12602020 \u121a\u12eb\u12dd \u1270\u1290\u1233 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12ed\u121d \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e \u1270\u1290\u1233 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u120b\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e \u1260 \u121a\u12eb\u12dd \u1260 \u1215\u130b\u12ca \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228\u1230\u1265 \u1270\u1230\u121d\u1276 \u1270\u1290\u1233 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u121a\u12eb\u12dd \u1260 \u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e \u1270\u1290\u1233 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u120b\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u1243\u12cd\u121e \u1260 \u1215\u130b\u12ca \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228\u1230\u1265 \u1270\u1230\u121d\u1276 \ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The expected answer clearly states that the protests in Ethiopia in July 2020 were triggered by the killing of the Ethiopian singer and activist Hachalu Hundessa.

Police and immigration authorities stopped the truck en route from Malawi in the early hours of Tuesday morning in the province of Tete, bordered by Malawi on one side and Zimbabwe on the other. Amelia Direito, spokeswoman for Tete migration services, said the officials checked the container after hearing banging coming from inside. They found 14 people alive among the bodies of 64 who had died from suspected asphyxiation. \u201cThe truck driver and his assistant (both Mozambicans) have been arrested by the police,\u201d Direito said. She added the driver told police he had been promised 30,000 meticais (about $500) to transport the men. Police have launched a manhunt for \u201cthe intermediary who facilitated the illegal entry of the Ethiopians into the country,\u201d she said. The foreign ministry in Addis Ababa said it had \u201cconfirmed through the Ethiopian embassy in South Africa that many Ethiopians travelling inside a vehicle from Malawi to Mozambique have died\u201d. It said it was working to establish the numbers of the dead and their identities. \u201cThe ministry expresses deep sadness at the tragedy and extends a message of strength to the family and friends of the deceased,\u201d it said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the survivors were being treated for severe dehydration and exhaustion.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds\/Pool via AP) DAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrives in Africa this weekend as the first U.S. cabinet official to visit in more than 18 months, and he is certain to face questions about the U.S. military\u2019s future on the continent and new U.S. visa restrictions against millions of Africans. Pompeo is visiting Senegal, Angola and Ethiopia as the Trump administration tries to counter the growing interest of China, Russia and other global powers in Africa and its booming young population of more than 1.2 billion. ADVERTISEMENT His visit comes as the U.S. military considers reducing its presence in West Africa\u2019s Sahel region while extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group expand their reach, killings hundreds of civilians. Pompeo last year said the Sahel should be the next focus of the global coalition against IS outside the group\u2019s core region. In one surprising case an al-Qaida-linked group, JNIM, and an IS-linked group, The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, are cooperating, something the commander of Special Operations Command Africa told reporters he hasn\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s largely due to personal connections but \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting phenomenon that we\u2019re watching,\u201d Brig. Gen. Dagvin Anderson said Thursday. Also raising concerns is the Trump administration\u2019s announcement last month that it will no longer be issuing immigrant visas to citizens of Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation with an estimated 200 million people and a large, often high-achieving diaspora. New visa restrictions also were imposed on Eritrea, Tanzania and Sudan. \u201cThis is the challenge Pompeo\u2019s facing in Africa, explaining the contradictory messages out of Washington,\u201d Mike O\u2019Hanlon, director of the Brookings Africa Security Initiative, said in a briefing this week. Some African leaders have bristled at what they perceive as the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cus or them\u201d narrative around China and Russia, especially after President Donald Trump made derogatory comments about Africa. Other leaders have said competition is welcome if it brings more investment to the continent. O\u2019Hanlon said most African leaders are pragmatic and \u201cvery keen to work with the U.S. and if offered a White House meeting, they would take it.\u201d Pompeo will meet with the countries\u2019 leaders and businesspeople. His first stop in long-stable Senegal is aimed at solidifying ties with the one West African Sahel country that has avoided the extremist attacks that target Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. military this month holds its annual Flintlock exercises in Senegal and neighboring Mauritania to help train regional armies to counter extremism. There are signs, though, that U.S. military interest could be waning. Late last year the U.S. switched to a strategy of merely trying to contain extremist groups in the Sahel instead of weakening them, according to a new report by the Pentagon inspector general. Meanwhile the U.S. has begun replacing some combat troops in Africa with military trainers. Worried French officials have lobbied the U.S. not to reduce its presence in the Sahel, where France\u2019s largest overseas military operation leads the fight against extremists and is adding hundreds of troops. A senior State Department official insisted, however, that the military issue is separate from Pompeo\u2019s visit. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with department protocol, referred questions to the Pentagon. \u201cAn awful lot of the security programs that we conduct in the Sahel are actually paid for by U.S. State Department funds,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe absolutely plan to continue those programs.\u201d After Senegal, Pompeo will stop next week in Angola, an oil-rich but largely impoverished country where President Joao Lourenco is making strides against corruption, including actions against close relatives of the former leader. Then Pompeo heads to Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation with more than 100 million people and the headquarters of the African Union. Ethiopia, a key U.S. security ally in the Horn of Africa, has undergone dramatic political reforms since Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018. The loosening of repressive measures has been exploited by some with long-held grievances, leading to sometimes violent ethnic tensions that threaten a national election later this year. Even Abiy\u2019s close advisers acknowledge the challenges ahead. \u201cThis election is not just a normal election, it\u2019s actually a referendum on whether to live together or not,\u201d Lencho Bati, a senior foreign policy adviser, told an audience at the United States Institute of Peace on Thursday. He noted that Ethiopia, a country of more than 80 ethnic groups, is a \u201cfragmented society\u201d and \u201chighly politicized,\u201d and he called on the opposition to practice civil politics. \u201cEthiopia, I would argue, is the most important country on the continent today,\u201d Witney Schneidman, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told a Brookings Institution briefing this week. Schneidman views Pompeo\u2019s Africa visit as an effort to \u201cestablish a positive tone on the continent,\u201d albeit a belated one. Trump has yet to visit Africa, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross was his last cabinet official to do so in 2018. Pompeo needs to convey that the continent is a priority for the U.S., and that America remains committed to economic development and security, Schneidman said. \u201cIf he can cut through and promote those messages clearly, then I think his trip will be successful.\u201d ___ Associated Press Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington and Cara Anna in Johannesburg contributed.

{"year":"2020","month":"04","event_desc":"24 April  One million people in Ethiopia face hunger due to crop destruction by locust swarms. Swarms have been reported in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Tanzania.","text":"How do you fight a locust invasion amid coronavirus? By Catherine Byaruhanga BBC News, Kampala Published 25 April 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics East Africa locust swarm image copyright EPA A second invasion by desert locusts has hit East Africa in just a few months, as younger and more aggressive swarms hatch and spread across a region already battling hunger and coronavirus, which has made it more difficult to get supplies to kill the crop-devouring pests. Currently, Africa's second most-populous state, Ethiopia - along with regional economic powerhouse Kenya and politically unstable Somalia - have been worst hit . The UN estimates the swarms could be up to 20 times bigger than during the first invasion -and they could become 400 times bigger by June. \"We found locusts on bushes, on pasture, irrigation plantations, even in forests,\" said Meseret Hailu, an Ethiopian government official who assessed the devastation caused by the latest invasion in the country's northern Amhara region. The staple grain teff - along with vegetables such as onions - have been devoured by the pests, she added. Reuters Desert locusts: Basic facts Usually lead shy, solitary lives When they get crowded together they become gregarious mini-beasts Colour changes from brown  to pink (immature) and yellow (mature) Swarm can be the size of Paris or New York 40 million eat the same amount of food daily as three million people Crops are destroyed and livelihoods threatened Source: UN Food and Agriculture Organisation Towards the end of 2019, a major upsurge of swarms was seen in Ethiopia, as well as its neighbours Eritrea and Djibouti, and continued to spread, taking hold in Somalia, Kenya and even reaching Uganda, South Sudan and Tanzania though in smaller numbers. Governments, which have not been confronted with such large invasions for at least a quarter of a century, have had to scramble for  pesticides, protective clothes, fumigators and aircraft to fly above the locust swarms, and spray them dead. \"The scale-up of the operation has been the biggest difficulty,\" said Cyrill Ferrand from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). \"That first generation reproduced then laid eggs on the ground, and then we have this second generation that is now maturing.\" media caption Locust swarms are adding concerns to food security in Africa during the pandemic. The  younger creatures are much more aggressive in devouring vegetation. These swarms are now reported to be spreading along the borders of Kenya and Somalia and into Ethiopia. By the start of April, they began to fly into Uganda once again - a local official estimated that just one swarm was spreading across five sq km (1.9 sq miles). Mass breeding in Kenya The short rainy season from February to May is the perfect time for farmers to plant their seeds in the ground in the hope of a bumper harvest in June. Following the droughts of recent years, there have been good rains this time. But the moist, humid conditions are also perfect for locust eggs to hatch. Northern and central Kenya are not a traditional habitat for the pests. The country has not experienced a major upsurge for more than 70 years but  farmers are witnessing the mass breeding of locusts. Jude Musili Mkulima, who lives in the town of Mwingi in central Kenya, is worried things will only get worse. \"The mother locusts came and left eggs. After two weeks now, they have already hatched. They are millions more than their mothers. These small ones are eating everything, even pastures for our cows,\" said Mr Mkulima, echoing the words of Ms Meseret in Ethiopia. Pilots need quarantine To bring the invasion under control, pesticides and the more environmentally friendly bio-pesticides are needed. They are sourced from countries such as Japan, the Netherlands and Morocco. But with the coronavirus pandemic grounding most flights, cargo supply chains have become less reliable and more expensive.

And when you are late with spraying, you know the consequences - the insects will increase. That situation has particularly hit Kenya,\" said Dr Stephen Njoka, the executive director at the Desert Locust Control Organisation for East Africa. Helicopters needed to track the locusts movements have also faced delays getting into the region - a shipment from Canada has not arrived yet - and pilots have to undergo quarantine when they arrive. Protective clothes for fumigators - including overalls, boots, goggles and masks similar to those worn by teams disinfecting streets and other public places to curb the spread of the virus - come mainly from China. UN FAO regional spokeswoman Judith Mulinge said they currently had enough stocks, but were concerned about running out if delays in deliveries persist. image copyright Getty Images image caption Ugandan soldiers have helped to curb the locust invasion The UN  predicts if the outbreak is not brought under control soon, the size of swarms could grow 400 times by June, affecting mid-year harvests. \"When the plants are emerging, desert locusts are going to eat into these very young plants, which means that all the effort to grow crops will be vanished. We could have people with zero harvests, up to 100% losses,\" said Mr Ferrand. In one of the worst-hit countries, Ethiopia, the insects devoured about 200,000 hectares of cropland and more than a million hectares of pasture. The FAO estimates that about one million people in the country have already been pushed into hunger by the locust infestation. This worries regional experts, who point out that hunger caused by the infestation - along with lockdowns in place because of coronavirus - could have a devastating effect on poverty levels. Jasper Mwesigwa, a food security analyst with the regional inter-governmental body Igad, said that 25 million people in the eight states that make up the group were currently struggling to feed themselves and a further five million could be threatened by hunger if the locust invasion was not contained. \"That would be the highest number of food insecure people this region has had,\" he added.

REUTERS\/Tiksa Negeri\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's northern Tigray region will head to the polls on Wednesday in defiance of the federal government, the latest challenge to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed from a slew of regional leaders flexing their muscles ahead of next year's national elections. Abiy has overseen sweeping democratic reforms since taking power in Africa's second most populous nation two years ago. But the federal government - and major opposition parties - agreed to postpone national and regional elections due in August until the COVID-19 pandemic was under control. Tigray, whose leaders dominated the previous administration and have often bitterly denounced Abiy, announced it would hold elections anyway. \"We know there is an open threat by Abiy to militarily intervene against Tigray and to cut funds, but we will still go ahead with the vote,\" said Getachew Reda, a former federal information minister and now a spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front. \"We know there will be consequences.\" Abiy has given little away about his plans. A spokeswoman for his office said in a text message that the vote would provoke \"a constitutional response\" and referred Reuters to parliament. The spokesman for parliament, Ato Gebru Gebresilasie, did not return calls seeking comment, but a report by the International Crisis Group think tank warned last month that the two sides were on a \"collision course\" and said: \"If Tigray proceeds, Abiy's government is ready to consider any new regional administration illegitimate.\" Tigrayans are only a small minority in the Horn of Africa nation of 110 million, but dominated power since 1991, when the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front drove a Marxist military dictator from power. The Front was a coalition of four ethnically-based parties, including the Tigray People's Liberation Front. Last year, three of the four parties in the coalition joined to create the new Prosperity Party under Abiy. The Tigrayans refused. Some said they felt persecuted - many former officials who have appeared on trial since Abiy took power are Tigrayan. But in a dynamic playing out all over Ethiopia, the long-ruling regional party is itself facing pressure from more zealous ethnic nationalists. A new party is openly pushing Tigrayan secession from Ethiopia, a polyglot nation of more than 80 ethnic groups. For now, that's a fringe idea, said Dr Asnake Kefale, associate professor of political science at Addis Ababa University. \"Among the people there isn't a will to become independent,\" he said. \"It's an idea that is played with by the elites.\" Reporting by Giulia Paravicini, Editing by William Maclean Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: World Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next China category White House would consider cutting China tariffs as part of talks, source says 4:18 PM UTC India category India downgrades ties with Pakistan after attack on Kashmir tourists 4:10 PM UTC category Powerful earthquake shakes Istanbul, dozens hurt jumping from buildings 2:03 PM UTC Europe category Thousands honour Pope Francis in St. Peter's Basilica 6:11 PM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago","question":"Why did the Ethiopian federal government and major opposition parties postpone national and regional elections originally scheduled for August 2020?","answer":"They postponed the elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u12e8\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u134c\u12f4\u122b\u120b\u12ca \u1218\u1295\u130d\u1235\u1275 \u12a5\u1293 \u12cb\u1293 \u12cb\u1293 \u1270\u1243\u12cb\u121a \u1353\u122d\u1272\u12ce\u127d \u1260\u130d\u1295\u1266\u1275 2020 \u12d3.\u121d. \u1208\u121a\u1308\u1299\u1275 \u1265\u1214\u122b\u12ca \u12a5\u1293 \u12ad\u120d\u120b\u12ca \u121d\u122d\u132b\u12ce\u127d \u1208\u121d\u1295 \u12a0\u1246\u12e9?","answer_translated":"\u1260\u12ae\u126a\u12f5-19 \u12c8\u1228\u122d\u123d\u129d \u121d\u12ad\u1295\u12eb\u1275 \u1290\u12cd \u12eb\u1246\u12e9\u1275\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1260\u130d\u1295\u1266\u1275 2020 \u12d3.\u121d. \u1232\u1308\u129d \u1265\u1214\u122b\u12ca \u12a5\u1293 \u12ad\u120d\u120b\u12ca \u121d\u122d\u132b\u12ce\u127d \u1232\u1273\u12e9 \u1260\u1270\u1243\u12cb\u121a \u1353\u122d\u1272\u12ce\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1201\u1294\u1273 \u1260\u1270\u1243\u12cb\u121a \u1353\u122d\u1272 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u1219 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1201\u1294\u1273 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1201\u1294\u1273 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1201\u1294\u1273 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1201\u1294\u1273 \u1270\u12f0\u122d\u130b","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer does not provide a clear or coherent explanation for why the elections were postponed.

{"year":"2020","month":"09","event_desc":"7 September  Journalists are banned from observing the elections in Tigray. The government says the elections are illegal.","text":"Ethiopia bars journalists from flying to Tigray regional vote -passengers By Reuters September 7, 2020 11:16 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 12 people, including four journalists and a senior think tank analyst, were barred on Monday from flying to Tigray, four of the passengers said, after Ethiopian security officials said the region's elections later this week were illegal. Ethiopia's upper house said on Saturday plans by the Tigray region to hold an election on Sept.9 for regional parliament and other positions were unconstitutional, setting up a potential clash between the central government and the powerful Tigray People's Liberation Front. The TPLF, which runs the northern province, has said the vote will go ahead despite pressure from the central government. Several of those barred from flying to Tigray said the action appeared intended to prevent coverage of the election. Those barred from the flight also had their phones and laptops confiscated, one of the passengers said. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office did not respond to requests for comment. Elias Mehari, a 35 year-old businessman was heading home to Tigray regional capital Mekelle to see his wife and son when two plain clothed security agents prevented him from boarding his flight in Addis Ababa on Monday. \"They thought I was a journalist, they took my ID and violently prevented me from boarding the flight,\" he told Reuters over the phone. \"Now they locked us up as they claim the elections are illegal, but I was just going home to see my family.\" Hager Teklebirhan, a journalist with Ethiopia media Awlo was among the journalists stopped from going to Mekelle. \"We were heading to Tigray to cover the elections, but security officers stopped us at the gate, took our IDs and we were prevented from boarding,\" he told Reuters. At least three other journalists received a phone call from Ethiopian authorities over the weekend warning them not to travel to Mekelle, they said. William Davison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, was also stopped from flying, he said. Abiy has overseen sweeping democratic reforms since taking power in Africa's second most populous nation two years ago. But the federal government - and major opposition parties - agreed in March to postpone national and regional elections due in August until the COVID-19 pandemic was under control. A new date still has to be set. Tigray, whose leaders dominated the previous administration and have often bitterly denounced Abiy, announced it would hold elections anyway.

{"year":"2020","month":"11","event_desc":"4 November  \"Scores, probably hundreds\" of civilians are killed in Aksum in the Tigray conflict, northern Ethiopia.","text":"Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: 'Civilians massacred', says Amnesty International Published 13 November 2020 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Reuters Image caption, Troops loyal to the government ride in trucks to face Tigray People's Liberation Front forces \"Scores and probably hundreds\" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says. Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved. Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week. Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict. There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces. As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. What has Amnesty said? In a statement it said it could confirm that \"scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November\". It had seen and \"digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers\". This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a \"horrific tragedy\" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access. Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds \"inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes\". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there. In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had \"liberated\" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control. He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of \"cruelty\", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they \"found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied\". What is the background? The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked. There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains. The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party. Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption. Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being \"fugitives from justice\" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run.

{"year":"2020","month":"11","event_desc":"25 November  The Organization of African Unity sends ex-presidents Joaquim Chissano (Mozambique), Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia), and Kgalema Motlanthe (South Africa) to Addis Ababa to negotiate a peace.","text":"African envoys head for Ethiopia as ultimatum expires for assault By Reuters November 25, 2020 7:29 PM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link ADDIS ABABA\/NAIROBI (Reuters) - African envoys went to Ethiopia to plead for peace on Wednesday, hours before an ultimatum was to expire for Tigrayan forces to surrender or face an assault on the northern region's capital that rights groups fear could bring huge civilian casualties. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government set a 72-hour ultimatum on Sunday for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) to lay down its arms or face an assault on Mekelle, the highland regional capital city of 500,000 people. Human Rights Watch said both sides must avoid putting civilians in danger. The government's warning did not absolve it \"of its duty to take constant care to protect civilians when carrying out military operations in urban areas\". \"We are also concerned by reports that the TPLF has deployed its forces in heavily populated areas. They need to ensure the safety of civilians under their control,\" it said. Thousands of people are already believed to have died and there has been widespread destruction from aerial bombardment and ground fighting since the war began on Nov. 4. Around 42,000 refugees have fled over the border to Sudan. TPLF rockets have hit neighbouring Eritrea. With phone and internet connections to Tigray largely down and access to the area strictly controlled, it has been impossible to confirm basic details about the situation on the ground. Both sides have described battlefield victories in which they have killed large numbers of enemy fighters, though little firm evidence has emerged. Tigray's regional state television reported on Wednesday that fighters had destroyed a large force of Eritrean troops moving towards a town 70 km north of Mekelle. It provided no evidence. If confirmed, the presence of Eritrean ground forces would amount to a major escalation of the conflict. Eritrea has denied in the past that it is involved in the fighting. Reuters has not been able to reach Eritrean officials for comment in more than two weeks. The Tigrayan forces, which have been hostile to Eritrea for decades, have fired rockets across the frontier. AMMA news agency, run by authorities in Ethiopia's Amhara region who back Abiy, said that more than 10,000 Tigrayan \"junta forces\" had been \"destroyed\". There was no immediate response from the TPLF. A senior diplomat involved in the peace effort said he had not seen evidence of battles on a large enough scale to kill that many fighters, although he could not rule it out. The conflict pits Ethiopia's central government against the TPLF, which dominated the country for decades until Abiy took power two years ago. Ethiopia is a federation of 10 regions run by separate ethnic groups. Tigrayans make up around 5% of the population but had outsized influence as the most powerful force in a multi-ethnic ruling coalition from 1991-2018.

Abiy, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade standoff with Eritrea, has said he will receive them but not talk with TPLF heads until they are defeated or give up. The senior diplomat told Reuters that foreign concern was growing at indications of both \"clear ethnic violence\" and \"Eritrean involvement in some way\". Both sides have accused the other of ethnic-based killings, while denying responsibility for carrying them out. FUEL LINES U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's appointee as national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, urged dialogue. \"I'm deeply concerned about the risk of violence against civilians, including potential war crimes, in the fighting around Mekelle in Ethiopia,\" he tweeted. On the ground, long lines of cars formed at fuel stations in Mekelle, where there has been rationing, according to Nov. 23 satellite images provided to Reuters by Maxar Technologies. In Tigray, satellite images showed Ethiopian troops in the ancient town of Axum and trenches dug across the local airport's runway. Axum's history and ruins give Ethiopia its claim to be one of the world\u2019s oldest centres of Christianity. Abiy repeated his position on Wednesday that the Tigray fighting was an internal law enforcement matter. \"Because the Ethiopian government has painted this as a domestic, criminal situation, they are shunning the type of diplomacy and international mediation efforts that they are typically a part of themselves in offering to regional states,\" said Grant Harris, ex-senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council in Barack Obama's U.S. administration.

{"year":"2020","month":"11","event_desc":"3 November  At least dozen of peoples were massacred in ethnic violence in Gawa Qanqa, southwest Ethiopia.","text":"By\u00a0\n            ELIAS MESERET Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) \u2014 Survivors of a massacre by rebels in western Ethiopia on Sunday counted 54 bodies in a schoolyard, the latest attack in which members of ethnic minorities have been deliberately targeted, Amnesty International said Monday. Human rights groups are asking why federal soldiers left the area just hours before attackers moved in and targeted ethnic Amharas. Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, denounced the killing of people based on identity, adding that security forces had been deployed to the area and \u201cstarted taking measures.\u201d Ethnic violence in Ethiopia is posing the greatest challenge yet to the prime minister, who was last year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize winner for his sweeping political reforms. \u201cEthiopia\u2019s enemies are vowing either to rule the country or ruin it, and they are doing everything they can to achieve this,\u201d Abiy said in a Facebook post. \u201cOne of their tactics is to arm civilians and carry out barbaric attacks based on identity. (For me) this is heartbreaking.\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s government blamed a rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Army, for the attacks in the far western part of Oromia, in an area bordering South Sudan and a few hundred kilometers from the capital, Addis Ababa. The head of the Oromia region police commission, Ararsa Merdasa, told the state broadcaster the death toll was 32 and \u201csome 200 families have fled the area.\u201d Survivors of the attack in Guliso District of West Wellega Zone told Amnesty International that federal troops had withdrawn unexpectedly and the rebels arrived hours later, identifying themselves as the OLA and announcing that they now controlled the area. \u201cMilitants gathered people who did not manage to flee, mainly women, children and the elderly, and killed them,\u201d the Amnesty statement said. Survivors hid in a forest nearby. One told the human rights group he found the bodies of his brother, sister-in-law and three children in the schoolyard with bullet wounds. \u201cThe fact that this horrendous incident occurred shortly after government troops abruptly withdrew from the area in unexplained circumstances raises questions that must be answered,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s regional director Deprose Muchena. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission in its own statement noted the government\u2019s death toll of 32 but said preliminary evidence it obtained \u201cindicate the number is very likely to exceed that tally.\u201d Attackers numbered up to 60, the commission said, citing sources. Ethnic Amharas \u201cwere dragged from their homes and taken to a school, where they were killed.\u201d The commission urged the federal government to \u201cshed light on the reasons behind the military\u2019s withdrawal from an area long known to be vulnerable to attacks\u201d and to make sure civilians are protected. Amharas are the second most populous ethnic group in Ethiopia after Oromos. They also have been targeted by gunmen in the Western Benishangul Gumuz and Southern regions in recent weeks, leaving several dozen dead. The Oromia region\u2019s communications office in a statement called the latest assault a \u201cbrutal terror attack.\u201d Getachew Balcha, the region\u2019s spokesman, said it was aimed at creating havoc and putting psychological pressure on citizens. \u201cThe armed group gathered 200 people for a meeting around 5 p.m., and then started shooting at them,\u201d the Amhara region\u2019s affiliated broadcaster, Amhara Mass Media Agency, quoted one survivor as saying. The survivor said a school and some 120 houses were burned. \u201cThe government has failed in its duty to protect the safety of citizens,\u201d Dessalegn Chanie, a senior member of the opposition National Movement of Amhara party, told The Associated Press, adding that Ethiopia\u2019s language-based federal system is the main cause for the killings: \u201cEthnic Amharas residing outside of the Amhara region are being labeled as outsiders and are exposed to repeated attacks.\u201d Under the system, Afan Oromo speakers generally live in Oromia, Amharic speakers generally live in the Amhara region and so on. The structure gives locals more say in local affairs. The Oromo Liberation Army hasn\u2019t commented on the attack allegations. It has denied similar reports in the past. The rebel group, a splinter wing of the Oromo Liberation Front party, has used the western Oromia region as its base since its members returned to Ethiopia after Abiy shortly after taking office in 2018 invited once-banned groups to return home from exile.","question":"How many people were reported killed in the ethnic violence in Guliso District, Ethiopia, in November 2020?","answer":"At least 54 people were reported killed in the massacre.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u1296\u126c\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1309\u120a\u1236 \u12c8\u1228\u12f3 \u1260\u1265\u1204\u122b\u12ca \u130d\u132d\u1275 \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u1218\u1308\u12f0\u120b\u1278\u12cd \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d?","answer_translated":"\u1260\u1245\u120c\u1271 \u12cd\u1235\u1325 \u1262\u12eb\u1295\u1235 54 \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u1218\u1308\u12f0\u120b\u1278\u12cd \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u1296\u126c\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1309\u120a\u1236 \u12c8\u1228\u12f3 \u1260\u1265\u1204\u122b\u12ca \u130d\u132d\u1275 \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u1218\u1308\u12f0\u120b\u1278\u12cd \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d \u1265\u1208 \u1270\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1245\u122d\u133e\u127d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1218\u1228\u1303 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f \u1270\u12f0\u121d\u130b\u1321 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1218\u1228\u1303 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f \u1270\u12f0\u121d\u130b\u1321 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1218\u1228\u1303 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f \u1270\u12f0\u121d\u130b\u1321 \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer does not provide the specific number of people reported killed in the conflict in Guliso district, Ethiopia, in November 2020.

Witnesses say security forces and their allies attacked civilians in Mai-Kadra with machetes and knives or strangled them with ropes. The stench of bodies lingered for days during the early chaos of the Ethiopian government\u2019s offensive in the defiant Tigray region last month. Several mass graves have been reported. What happened beginning Nov. 9 in the agricultural town near the Sudanese border has become the most visible atrocity in a war largely conducted in the shadows. But even here, much remains unclear, including who killed whom. Witnesses in Mai-Kadra told the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and Amnesty International that ethnic Tigrayan forces and allies attacked Amhara \u2014 one of Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic groups but a minority in Tigray. In Sudan, where nearly 50,000 people have fled, one ethnic Amhara refugee gave The Associated Press a similar account. But more than a dozen Tigrayan refugees told the AP it was the other way around: In strikingly similar stories, they said they and others were targeted by Ethiopian federal forces and allied Amhara regional troops. It\u2019s possible that civilians from both ethnicities were targeted in Mai-Kadra, Amnesty now says. \u201cAnyone they found, they would kill,\u201d Tesfaalem Germay, an ethnic Tigrayan who fled to Sudan with his family, said of Ethiopian and Amhara forces. He said he saw hundreds of bodies, making a slicing gesture at his neck and head as he remembered the gashes. But another refugee, Abebete Refe, told the AP that many ethnic Amhara like him who stayed behind were massacred by Tigrayan forces. \u201cEven the government doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re alive, they thought we all died,\u201d he said. The conflicting accounts are emblematic of a war about which little is truly known since Ethiopian forces entered Tigray on Nov. 4 and sealed off the region from the world, restricting access to journalists and aid workers alike. For weeks, food and other supplies have run alarmingly low. This week Ethiopia\u2019s security forces shot at and briefly detained U.N. staffers making the first assessment of how to deliver aid, a senior Ethiopian official said. Ethiopia\u2019s government and the Tigray one have filled the vacuum with propaganda. Each side has seized on the killings in Mai-Kadra to support its cause. The conflict began after months of friction between the governments, which now regard each other as illegitimate. The Tigray leaders once dominated Ethiopia\u2019s ruling coalition, but Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sidelined them when he came to power in 2018. Long-held tensions over land in western Tigray, where Mai-Kadra is located, between Tigrayans and Amhara have added fuel to the fire. Amnesty International said it confirmed that at least scores, and likely hundreds, of people were killed in Mai-Kadra, using geolocation to verify video and photographs of the bodies. It also remotely conducted \u201ca limited set of interviews.\u201d But Mai-Kadra \u201cis just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Amnesty researcher Fisseha Tekle told an event on Tuesday as fears grow about atrocities elsewhere in Tigray. \u201cOther credible allegations are emerging ... not only in Mai-Kadra but also\u201d in the nearby town of Humera, the town of Dansha and the Tigray capital, Mekele. In Mai-Kadra, witnesses told the visiting Ethiopian rights commission they saw police, militia and members of a Tigray youth group attack Amhara. \u201cThe streets were still lined with bodies yet to be buried\u201d days later, the commission said. One man who looked at identity cards of the dead as he cleared away the bodies told Amnesty International that many of them said Amhara. But several ethnic Tigrayans who have fled blamed Ethiopian and allied Amhara regional forces for killings in the same town at the same time, saying some asked to see identity cards before attacking. In some cases, they said they recognized the killers as their neighbors. Samir Beyen, a mechanic, said he was stopped and asked if he was Tigrayan, then beaten and robbed. He said he saw people being slaughtered with knives, and dozens of rotting corpses. \u201cIt was like the end of the world,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe could not bury them because the soldiers were near.\u201d Cut off from their homes, refugees now wait in Sudan in bare concrete houses or under shelters lashed together from plastic and branches, playing checkers with Coca-Cola bottle caps or stretching out on mats to sleep, seeking a brief escape from ghastly memories. The AP has been unable to obtain permission to travel to the Tigray region and has been unable to independently verify the reports of the massacre. Neither Amnesty International nor the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission agreed to requests to speak with witnesses they interviewed. The Ethiopian commission, an entity created under the country\u2019s constitution, called its findings preliminary. Its researchers were allowed by the federal government to visit Mai-Kadra, but when asked whether it was being allowed to also investigate other alleged atrocities, spokesman Aaron Maasho replied, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201d The U.N. human rights office this week called for independent investigations into the conflict, but Ethiopian officials have rejected what they call interference, saying this week the government doesn\u2019t need a \u201cbabysitter.\u201d To assume the government can\u2019t do such work itself \u201cis belittling,\u201d senior Ethiopian official Redwan Hussein told reporters on Tuesday. The prime minister has called the killings in Mai-Kadra \u201cthe epitome of moral degeneration\u201d and even expressed suspicion that the perpetrators may have fled to Sudan and could be hiding among the refugees. Abiy offered no evidence, only pointing to the number of young men among the refugees \u2014 though roughly half are women. The prime minister also has rejected allegations of abuses by the Ethiopian defense force, saying it \u201chas not killed a single person in any city\u201d during the conflict. But the Tigray leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, blamed the \u201cinvading\u201d federal forces for the killings, telling the AP that \u201cwe\u2019re not people who can commit this crime, ever.\u201d The ethnic frictions and profiling must stop, the U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned this week, saying they are \u201cfostering divisiveness and sowing the seeds for further instability and conflict\u201d \u2014 in a region already rife with both. ___ Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Haleluya Hadero in Atlanta contributed.","question":"What was the estimated number of civilians killed in the massacre in Mai Kadra in November 2020?","answer":"Up to 500 civilians were alleged to have been killed.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u1296\u126c\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u1260\u121b\u12ed \u12ab\u12f5\u122b \u1270\u1348\u1338\u1218\u12cd \u12e8\u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u132d\u134d\u1328\u134b \u12e8\u1270\u1308\u1218\u1270\u12cd \u12e8\u121e\u1271 \u12dc\u130e\u127d \u1241\u1325\u122d \u1235\u1295\u1275 \u1290\u1260\u122d?","answer_translated":"\u12a5\u1235\u12a8 500 \u12dc\u130e\u127d \u12a5\u1295\u12f0\u121e\u1271 \u12ed\u1290\u1308\u122b\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u1296\u126c\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u1260\u121b\u12ed \u12ab\u12f5\u122b \u1270\u1348\u1338\u1218\u12cd \u12e8\u1215\u12dd\u1265 \u132d\u134d\u1328\u134b \u1260 \u1260\u1270\u1308\u1218\u1270 \u1260 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1260 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1218\u1290\u123b \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1275\u122d\u1309\u121d \u120b\u12ed \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1270\u1348\u1320\u1229 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1270\u1240\u1263\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1270\u1240\u1263\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u124b\u121d \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228 \u121d\u130d\u1263\u122d \u1270\u1240\u1263\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer does not provide a clear or coherent response to the question.

People have sought shelter amid reports of a heavy build-up of tanks and artillery around regional capital Mekelle, following the Ethiopian Government\u2019s ultimatum to forces loyal to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) to surrender, which has reportedly expired. On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General\u00a0Ant\u00f3nio Guterres expressed deep concern over the unfolding situation, before urging\u00a0\u201cthe leaders of\u00a0Ethiopia\u00a0to do everything possible to protect civilians, uphold human rights and ensure humanitarian access for the provision of much-needed assistance\u201d. In a statement, the UN chief also called for the \u201cfree and safe movement of people searching for safety and assistance, regardless of their ethnic identity, across both national and international borders\". In a note to journalists released on Friday by the UN Spokesperson's Office, Mr. Guterres said he contining to closely follow \u00a0developments in the Tigray region,\u00a0\"as well as its regional impact\". He welcomed the meeting between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the African Union Special Envoys on Friday, offering\u00a0\"the full support of the United Nations to the African Union initiative\", urging the parties to\u00a0\"embrace this vital opportunity to peacefully resolve the conflict.\" \"The Secretary-General underlines the need to ensure the protection of civilians, human rights and access for humanitarian assistance to the affected areas and appreciates the statement by Prime Minister Abiy today reaffirming the Federal Government\u2019s utmost commitment to these obligations.\" Echoing the Secretary-General\u2019s message, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, warned that both sides were using rhetoric that was \u201cdangerously provocative and risks placing already vulnerable and frightened civilians in grave danger\u201d. Even before violence erupted in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region causing mass displacement, Sudan was already home to nearly one million refugees, mainly from South Sudan. In eastern Sudan, UNHCR has continued to step up its relief effort, together with national and local partners. \u201cAid is being mobilized to help refugees, almost half of whom are children\u201d, Mr. Baloch said, citing \u201ccomplex logistical challenges\u201d. To date the agency has helped to relocate nearly 10,000 refugees to Um Rakuba site, 70 kilometres inside Sudan, as work continues to put up shelters and improve services. Family tracing services have been established and these have already reunited many separated refugees. Mr. Baloch noted that although humanitarian agencies continue to provide shelter and other facilities to help refugees, \u201cmore resources are required and Sudan needs international support urgently\u201d. Inside Tigray, concerns continue to grow for the safety of civilians in Mekelle, home to more than 500,000 people, and some 96,000 Eritrean refugees based in four camps. \u201cWithout humanitarian access, it\u2019s very hard to say what is actually going on, on the ground but there were worrying reports that fighting was getting closer to these refugee camps\u201d, Mr. Baloch told journalists via video link at a regular UN Geneva briefing. Before the conflict erupted, UNHCR had \u201cregular access to the refugees\u201d, the UNHCR official continued, but \u201csince the start of it, we have lost access\u201d. Highlighting the refugees\u2019 reliance on humanitarian distributions, Mr. Baloch said that \u201caccording to what they have had\u2026they will be running out of food as of Monday\u201d. The UN's top human rights official has called on the parties to the conflict in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region to give \u201cclear and unambiguous orders\u201d to their forces not to target civilians, and protect them from assault. The UN on Monday said it was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d over the safety of civilians across Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region, as fighting between Government troops and those loyal to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) reportedly continued, with the Ethiopian Prime Minister having called on opposition forces to surrender the capital Mekelle, by Wednesday.

{"year":"2020","month":"11","event_desc":"15 November  25,000 refugees flee from Tigray, to Sudan while the Federal Ethiopian Government invades the Ethiopian region of Tigray.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Nearly 25,000 Ethiopians flee to Sudan: state media Khartoum (AFP) \u2013 Issued on: 15\/11\/2020 - 13:26 Modified: 15\/11\/2020 - 13:25 Around 25,000 Ethiopians fleeing conflict in the Tigray region have crossed into neighbouring Sudan, state news agency SUNA reported, as the UN said it was working to find them shelter. \"The number of Ethiopian refugees who have arrived in Gadaref and Kassala states since Saturday has reached 24,944,\" the agency said. Sudan's commissioner for refugees Abdullah Suleiman toured the border region on Saturday with UN refugee agency assistant representative in Sudan Jan Hansmann to discuss the influx. Hansmann, quoted by SUNA, said the priority of the UNHCR was to provide the refugees with shelter, food and water and then to transfer them to regions far from the border \"for security reasons\". He said the UN refugee agency was working to establish new camps in Sudan for the Ethiopians. Sudan has already said it would shelter thousands of Ethiopians fleeing the conflict at the Um Raquba camp, which in the 1980s hosted thousands of Ethiopian fleeing famine. Over the past week, exhausted refugees have streamed across the border into Sudan after walking for two-days through searing heat, many of them barefoot. Some arrived on scooters and other cycled, while others boarded makeshift boats to cross a river into Sudan to flee intense fighting at home. Suleiman called on the international community to pitch in with aid for the refugees. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced November 4 he had ordered military operations in Tigray in a dramatic escalation of a long-running feud with the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). UNHCR said it expected the number of refugees to grow if the conflict in neighbouring Ethiopia worsens. The leader of the Tigray region on Sunday claimed responsibility for rocket strikes on the airport of neighbouring Eritrea's capital, sparking fears that the conflict could widen. A Sudanese government source said up to 200,000 Ethiopians could seek shelter in Sudan. \u00a9 2020 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

{"year":"2020","month":"11","event_desc":"2829 November  Seven to eight hundred civilians are massacred by the Ethiopian National Defense Force and Eritrean Army in the Aksum massacre.","text":"Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: How a massacre in the sacred city of Aksum unfolded 26 February 2021 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Aksum is said to be the birthplace of the biblical Queen of Sheba Eritrean troops fighting in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray killed hundreds of people in Aksum mainly over two days in November, witnesses say. The mass killings on 28 and 29 November may amount to a crime against humanity, Amnesty International says in a report. An eyewitness told the BBC how bodies remained unburied on the streets for days, with many being eaten by hyenas. Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane G Meskel has dismissed the accusations as \"preposterous\" and \"fabricated\". In a tweet , he suggested that the eyewitnesses quoted were militiamen allied to Tigray's former ruling party, the TPLF, whose dispute with Ethiopia's federal government led to the conflict in the region. Ethiopia's government has promised a joint investigation with international actors. While it cast questions on Amnesty's methodology, it admitted \"serious issues that should be of great concern\" were raised. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea deny that Eritrean forces have been involved in the Tigray conflict. BBC Africa Live: Updates from the continent The Nobel Peace Prize winner who sent his troops to battle The conflict erupted on 4 November 2020 when Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the TPLF after its fighters captured federal military bases in Tigray. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, told parliament on 30 November that \"not a single civilian was killed\" during the operation. But witnesses have recounted how on that day they began burying some of the bodies of unarmed civilians killed by Eritrean soldiers - many of them boys and men shot on the streets or during house-to-house raids. Google \u00a9 2021 Maxar Technologies Amnesty's report has high-resolution satellite imagery from 13 December showing disturbed earth consistent with recent graves at two churches in Aksum, an ancient city considered sacred by Ethiopia's Orthodox Christians. A communications blackout and restricted access to Tigray has meant reports of what has gone on in the conflict have been slow to emerge. In Aksum, electricity and phone networks reportedly stopped working on the first day of the conflict. How was Aksum captured? Shelling by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces to the west of Aksum began on Thursday 19 November, according to people in the city. \"This attack continued for five hours, and was non-stop. People who were at churches, cafes, hotels and their residence died. There was no retaliation from any armed force in the city - it literally targeted civilians,\" a civil servant in Aksum told the BBC. Amnesty has gathered similar and multiple testimonies describing the continuous shelling that evening of civilians. Once in control of the city, soldiers, generally identified as Eritrean, searched for TPLF soldiers and militias or \"anyone with a gun\", Amnesty said. \"There were a lot of... house-to-house killings,\" one woman told the rights group. There is compelling evidence that Ethiopian and Eritrean troops carried out \"multiple war crimes in their offensive to take control of Aksum\", Amnesty's Deprose Muchena says. What sparked the killings? For the next week, the testimonies say Ethiopia troops were mainly in Aksum - the Eritreans had pushed on east to the town of Adwa. A witness told the BBC how the Ethiopian military looted banks in the city in that time. AFP The conflict has left Tigray's population in dire need of humanitarian aid The Eritrean forces reportedly returned a week later. The fighting on Sunday 28 November was triggered by an assault of poorly armed pro-TPLF fighters, according to Amnesty's report. Between 50 and 80 men from Aksum targeted an Eritrean position on a hill overlooking the city in the morning. A 26-year-old man who participated in the attack told Amnesty: \"We wanted to protect our city so we attempted to defend it especially from Eritrean soldiers... They knew how to shoot and they had radios, communications... I didn't have a gun, just a stick.\" What did Eritrean troops do? It is unclear how long the fighting lasted, but that afternoon Eritrean trucks and tanks drove into Aksum, Amnesty reports. Witnesses say Eritrean soldiers went on a rampage, shooting at unarmed civilian men and boys who were out on the streets - continuing until the evening. More on the Tigray conflict: 'I lost my hand when a soldier tried to rape me' Medics on the run: 'I hid in the woods to flee shooting' From Ethiopia to Yemen, the dilemma of declaring a famine A man in his 20s told Amnesty about the killings on the city's main street: \"I was on the second floor of a building and I watched, through the window, the Eritreans killing the youth on the street.\" The soldiers, identified as Eritrean not just because of their uniform and vehicle number plates but because of the languages they spoke (Arabic and an Eritrean dialect of Tigrinya), started house-to-house searches. \"I would say it was in retaliation,\" a young man told the BBC. \"They killed every man they found. If you opened your door and they found a man they killed him, if you didn't open, they shoot your gate by force.\" He was hiding in a nightclub and witnessed a man who was found and killed by Eritrean soldiers begging for his life: \"He was telling them: 'I am a civilian, I am a banker.'\" Getty Images Witnesses says roads in Aksum were littered with bodies Another man told Amnesty that he saw six men killed, execution-style, outside his house near the Abnet Hotel the following day on 29 November. \"They lined them up and shot them in the back from behind. Two of them I knew. They're from my neighbourhood\u2026 They asked: 'Where is your gun' and they answered: 'We have no guns, we are civilians.'\" How many people were killed? Witnesses say at first the Eritrean soldiers would not let anyone approach the bodies on the streets - and would shoot anyone who did so. One woman, whose nephews aged 29 and 14 had been killed, said the roads \"were full of dead bodies\". Getty Images Many of the burials are reported to have taken place at Aksum's Arba'etu Ensessa church Amnesty says after the intervention of elders and Ethiopian soldiers, burials began over several days, with most funerals taking place on 30 November after people brought the bodies to the churches - often 10 at a time loaded on horse- or donkey-drawn carts. At Abnet Hotel, the civil servant who spoke to the BBC said some bodies were not removed for four days. \"The bodies that were lying around Abnet Hotel and Seattle Cinema were eaten by hyenas. We found only bones. We buried bones. \"I can say around 800 civilians were killed in Aksum.\" This account is echoed by a church deacon who told the Associated Press that many bodies had been fed on by hyenas. He gathered victims' identity cards and assisted with burials in mass graves and also believes about 800 people were killed that weekend. The 41 survivors and witnesses Amnesty interviewed provided the names of more than 200 people they knew who were killed. What happened after the burials? Witnesses say the Eritrean soldiers participated in looting, which after the massacre and as many people fled the city, became widespread and systematic. What does the future hold for Ethiopia, and what challenges remain in the Tigray region? The university, private houses, hotels, hospitals, grain stores, garages, banks, DIY stores, supermarkets, bakeries and other shops were reportedly targeted. One man told Amnesty how Ethiopian soldiers failed to stop Eritreans looting his brother's house. \"They took the TV, a jeep, the fridge, six mattresses, all the groceries and cooking oil, butter, teff flour [Ethiopia's staple food], the kitchen cabinets, clothes, the beers in the fridge, the water pump, and the laptop.\" Getty Images Shops in the city have reportedly been stripped bare The young man who spoke to the BBC said he knew of 15 vehicles that had been stolen belonging to businessmen in the city. This has had a devastating impact on those left in Aksum, leaving them with little food and medicine to survive, Amnesty says. Witnesses say the theft of water pumps left residents having to drink from the river. Why is Aksum sacred? It is said to be the birthplace of the biblical Queen of Sheba, who travelled to Jerusalem to visit King Solomon. They had a son - Menelik I - who is said to have brought to Aksum the Ark of the Covenant, believed to contain the 10 commandments handed down to Moses by God. It is constantly under guard at the city's Our Lady Mary of Zion Church and no-one is allowed to see it. Getty Images Aksum's Our Lady Mary of Zion Church is a site of pilgrimage for many Ethiopian Orthodox Christians A major religious celebration is usually held at the church on 30 November, drawing pilgrims from across Ethiopia and around the world, but it was cancelled last year amid the conflict. The civil servant interviewed by the BBC said that Eritrean troops came to the church on 3 December \"terrorising the priests and forcing them to give them the gold and silver cross\". But he said the deacons and other young people went to protect the ark. \"It was a huge riot. Every man and woman fought them. They fired guns and killed some, but we are happy as we did not fail to protect our treasures.\" The holy city where mosques are banned Ethiopia country profile Eritrea country profile Amnesty International Ethiopian civil war Ethiopia Eritrea","question":"How many civilians were reportedly killed in the Aksum massacre in November 2020?","answer":"Between 700 and 800 civilians were reportedly killed.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u1296\u126c\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u1260\u12a0\u12ad\u1231\u121d \u12e8\u1270\u1348\u1338\u1218\u12cd \u132d\u134d\u1328\u134b \u1235\u1295\u1275 \u1232\u126a\u120d \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u12a5\u1295\u12f0\u121e\u1271 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d?","answer_translated":"\u1260700 \u12a5\u1235\u12a8 800 \u1232\u126a\u120d \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u12a5\u1295\u12f0\u121e\u1271 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u1296\u126c\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u1260\u12a0\u12ad\u1231\u121d \u12e8\u1270\u1348\u1338\u1218\u12cd \u132d\u134d\u1328\u134b \u1235\u1295\u1275 \u1232\u126a\u120d \u1230\u12ce\u127d \u12a5\u1295\u12f0 \u1273\u120b\u1245 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d \u1265\u120e \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb \u1232\u1273\u12ed \u1232\u1206\u1295 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1348\u1338\u1218 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u121b\u1205\u1260\u1228\u1230\u1265 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d \u1265\u1278 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d. \u1260\u12da\u1205 \u1273\u122a\u12ad \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u129d\u1277\u120d \u1265\u120e \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u1270\u1308\u120d\u133f\u120d \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u1308\ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer does not provide a clear or accurate number of civilian deaths as stated in the expected answer.

Violence broke out in Tigray in early November when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched military operations targeting Tigray's ruling party. In Ethiopia itself, $25 million will go toward the purchase of medicine and medical gear to help sick or wounded civilians, and to buy food and provide drinking water, the UN said. In neighboring Sudan, where more than 50,000 people have fled to escape the fighting, another $10.6 million is being disbursed to help these refugees. \"After six weeks of conflict, the civilian toll is mounting. Women and children arrive in Sudan with disturbing stories of violence, deprivation and abuse,\" said UN emergency relief coordinator Mark Lowcock. \"We need unfettered access now,\" he said. Tigray, an impoverished region of about six million people, faced formidable food security challenges before the conflict began, compounded this year by the coronavirus pandemic and the worst desert locust infestation in decades. Now aid agencies fear the fighting -- which has reportedly killed thousands and displaced many thousands more -- could tip the region into catastrophe Tensions over aid access have been mounting in recent weeks between Abiy, last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, and humanitarian officials. \u00a9 2020 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The attack in Metekel zone of Benishangul-Gumuz region occurred a day after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the region and spoke about the need to end such massacres. Ethnic tensions are a major challenge as he tries to promote national unity in a country with more than 80 ethnic groups. The attacks are separate from the deadly conflict in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, where Ethiopian forces and allied regional forces began fighting Tigray regional forces in early November. Some people in remote villages remained encircled and under threat on Wednesday evening, with the death toll thought to be above 200, Belete Molla, head of the National Movement of Amhara political party, asserted after speaking with residents. Amnesty International, which spoke with five survivors, said members of the ethnic Gumuz community attacked the homes of ethnic Amhara, Oromo and Shinasha, setting them on fire and stabbing and shooting residents. The Gumuz see minorities as \u201csettlers,\u201d the rights group said. Dozens of people are still unaccounted for, Amnesty said.

The commission said a total of 123 people were killed and at least 500 were injured.","text":"Ethiopian rights body says security forces killed at least 76 in summer unrest after musician's killing By Reuters January 2, 2021 8:32 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link NAIROBI(Reuters) - Ethiopia's state-appointed human rights commission said on Friday that security forces killed at least 76 people and wounded nearly 200 during violent unrest in June and July that followed the killing of a popular singer. The commission also detailed brutality by civilians involved in the clashes, saying some attackers beheaded and tortured people after dragging them from their homes and using ethnic slurs. The \"widespread and systematic attack\" on civilians by attackers constituted crimes against humanity, the commission said. Its report on the violence, some of the worst in Ethiopia since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018, said a total of 123 people were killed and at least 500 injured. Abiy's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Ethnic violence has surged in many parts of Ethiopia, Africa's second-most populous nation, since Abiy took office and lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between more than 80 ethnic groups. Abiy has urged national unity, but powerful ethnic-based movements are opposed to this. The summer violence began amid protests triggered by the killing of Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, a popular singer from the Oromo ethnic group, the country's largest. Oromos, including Haacaaluu himself, were a strong force in the anti-government protests that piled pressure on the former ruling coalition and eventually led to Abiy being selected as premier in 2018. The street protests after the singer's death spread from the capital Addis Ababa to the surrounding Oromiya region. The commission's report found that attackers \"moving in groups and armed with knives, stones, flammables, electric cables, sticks, axes and machetes; beat, injured and killed people in a gruesome manner, including through torture and beheading.\" In October, Ethiopia's attorney general charged four suspects with terrorism in connection with the killing of the singer. [L8N2GT3HK] The rights commission the proportionality of the force employed in some parts of the response by security forces to the unrest was \"highly questionable\". The violence in June and July was not related to a conflict since November between federal forces and a rebellious force in the northern Tigray region that is believed to have killed thousands and displaced around 950,000 people.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, speaking after the conclusion of a meeting of regional leaders on Sunday evening, said Ethiopia\u2019s military campaign in its Tigray province was \u201clegitimate for all states.\u201d The humanitarian suffering of the conflict is cause for concern, he said. \u201cIt cannot be denied, however, that the crisis in Tigray has provoked large scale displacement ... Particular attention should be paid to refugees and displaced people,\u201d he said in a tweet . He was speaking following a meeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which brought together the leaders of Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and Sudan, as well as officials from other neighboring countries. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed thanked the regional leaders for \u201cunderstanding and acknowledging our law enforcement measures as legal and legitimate,\u201d in a tweet. In early November, Ethiopia\u2019s federal government launched a military attack on Tigray\u2019s provincial leaders saying they had provoked the federal forces. The Tigray leaders remained defiant and are still at large. The Ethiopian government is offering a reward for information leading to their capture. Abiy declared victory in early December but local reports suggest there are still some clashes in areas of Tigray. Thousands of people are feared to have died in the conflict that pitted Ethiopia\u2019s federal government against the Tigray Peoples\u2019 Liberation Front, a party that dominated Ethiopian politics for 27 years until the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Abiy came to power in April 2018. The conflict in Tigray has alarmed the international humanitarian community, as communications have been cut off with large parts of the region. The U.N. refugee agency said more than 50,000 Ethiopians, mainly from Tigray, have fled across the border to Sudan. The Tigray region continues to open up slowly allowing aid to arrive but various reports suggest full access is not yet available.","question":"How many Ethiopians had fled to Sudan due to the Tigray conflict by December 2020?","answer":"More than 50,000 Ethiopians, mostly from Tigray, had fled to Sudan by that time.","region":"Ethiopia","question_translated":"\u1260\u12f2\u1234\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u12f5\u1228\u1235 \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb\u12cd\u12eb\u1295 \u1260\u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed \u130d\u132d\u1275 \u121d\u12ad\u1295\u12eb\u1275 \u12c8\u12f0 \u1231\u12f3\u1295 \u1270\u1230\u12f0\u12f1?","answer_translated":"\u12a850,000 \u1260\u120b\u12ed \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb\u12cd\u12eb\u1295\u1363 \u12a0\u1265\u12db\u129b\u12ce\u1279 \u12a8\u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed \u12ad\u120d\u120d \u12e8\u1218\u1321\u1363 \u1260\u12da\u12eb\u1295 \u130a\u12dc \u12c8\u12f0 \u1231\u12f3\u1295 \u1270\u1230\u12f0\u12f1\u1362","model_answer":" Answer: \u1260\u12f2\u1234\u121d\u1260\u122d 2020 \u12f5\u1228\u1235 \u121d\u1295 \u12eb\u1205\u120d \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb\u12cd\u12eb\u1295 \u1260\u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed \u130d\u132d\u1275 \u121d\u12ad\u1295\u12eb\u1275 \u12c8\u12f0 \u1231\u12f3\u1295 \u1270\u1230\u12f0\u12f1 \u1265\u1278 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u12f0\u1293 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u12f0\u1293 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u12f0\u1293 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u12f0\u1293 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \u1270\u12f0\u1293 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u1270\u1208\u12e8 \u1230\u12d3\u1275 \u120b\u12ed \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1270\u12f0\u1293 \u1270\u1218\u1233\u1233\u12ed \u1260\u121b\u1208\u1275 \ufffd","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer is a nonsensical repetition of phrases and does not provide any coherent or relevant information to the question.

The senior government official, Redwan Hussein, told reporters that the U.N. employees \u201cbroke\u201d two checkpoints and were trying to go through a third when they were fired upon. He said the staffers have since been released. \u201cThey were told in some areas they were not supposed to move. But they indulged themselves in a kind of adventurous expedition,\u201d he said. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric called the report \u201calarming\u201d and said U.N. officials \u201care engaging at the highest level with the federal government to express our concerns and avoid any such incidents in the future.\u201d He said the four U.N. staffers on Sunday had been trying to assess roads, a key step before larger aid convoys can go in. Another U.N. spokesman, Farhan Haq, said the staffers were stopped at a military checkpoint near Sheraro. The town is near the Eritrean border. Ethiopia\u2019s government is making it clear it intends to manage the flow of humanitarian aid, but the U.N. has openly sought unfettered and neutral access according to international principles. \u201cThe situation on the ground is complicated\u201d at the local level, Dujarric said, and discussions continue with the government \u201cto try to get where we want to be.\u201d Crucially, the deal allows aid only in areas under Ethiopian government control. The government on Tuesday said 44 truckloads of food aid had been delivered to Shire, the main town near the refugee camps. Ethiopia\u2019s government late last month declared victory in the conflict in the Tigray region against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front. The government asserts that the fighting has stopped except for some \u201csporadic shootings,\u201d but the TPLF has said fighting continues. The TPLF leaders are on the run. Food, medicines and other aid for some 6 million people \u2014 some 1 million of them now displaced \u2014 are in the balance. Of special concern are camps that are home to nearly 100,000 refugees from Eritrea amid reports that they have been attacked and abducted. The camps are near the border with Eritrea, which some fleeing people have accused of entering the conflict, a charge that Ethiopia denies. Food ran out at the camps days ago. \u201cRegaining access to refugees and others in need is urgent and critical for UNHCR and humanitarian organizations,\u201d the head of the U.N. refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, tweeted Tuesday. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, said his organization is \u201cdeeply concerned to find that humanitarian access to the region is still significantly constrained. ... These people can no longer be made to wait. Aid must not be left at a standstill. We have been standing ready to deliver food, emergency shelter and other essential materials for weeks, and we expected this deal to clear the way.\u201d The U.N. announced the deal with Ethiopia\u2019s government last Wednesday, saying it was signed on Nov. 29. The fighting in the region erupted Nov. 4 between Ethiopia\u2019s government and the government of the Tigray region following months of rising tensions. Since then, aid-laden trucks have waited at the borders of Tigray, even as warnings have become increasingly dire about the lack of food, fuel, clean water, cash and other necessities. \u201cFull access for humanitarian actors must be guaranteed,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted Tuesday. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s office said Monday it was working with the U.N. and others to extend humanitarian assistance \u201cwith a well-coordinated framework led by the federal government.\u201d On Tuesday, Redwan repeated that message and added: \u201cNo entity, multilateral or unilateral, is supposed to supplant the government. ... We, the government, would call the shots.\u201d Humanitarian assistance must be escorted by defense forces, he said. Even after Abiy declared victory on Nov. 28 in what he called a \u201claw enforcement operation\u201d against a Tigray government he now considers illegitimate, fighting has been reported in parts of the region, further complicating access for aid. Thousands of people are thought to have been killed in the power struggle between the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front, which dominated Ethiopia\u2019s government and military for more than a quarter-century, and the government of Abiy, who sidelined the TPLF soon after taking power in 2018 and introduced dramatic political reforms that won him the Nobel Peace Prize. Now Abiy rejects dialogue with the TPLF. Both sides began the conflict heavily armed, leading to fears of another drawn-out conflict in the strategic Horn of Africa nation that is the continent\u2019s second-most populous country. Nearly 50,000 Ethiopians have fled into neighboring Sudan, where another humanitarian crisis is growing as aid workers set up food, shelter and other care from scratch. \u201cIt has been a month since I have taken my pills,\u201d said one refugee, Aksamaweet Garazgerer, who said she has HIV and needs antiretrovirals. \u201cI would go every day (to the clinic) and they say tomorrow it will come, the day after tomorrow it will come. But it has not come yet.\u201d ___ Edith M.

For most Ethiopians, these elections are a non-event. Ethiopia's elections are just an exercise in controlled political participation | Jason Mosley Read more The one potential dividend of these sham polls, however, is the international attention they will garner for the government\u2019s growing political repression . The blatant disregard for internationally recognised standards for free and fair elections just might convince Ethiopia\u2019s largest donors that it is time to rethink their relationship with an increasingly authoritarian government. As long as democratic governance and respect for human rights are pushed aside by donors in favour of economic development and security cooperation, Ethiopia\u2019s long-term stability is at serious risk. Since 2005, the ruling Ethiopian Peoples\u2019 Revolutionary Democratic Front \u2019s (EPRDF) has cracked down on independent media and human rights groups. In 2009, parliament passed the charities and societies proclamation , which placed restrictive regulations on non-government organisations, including limitations on foreign funding. Today,only a handful of these groups exist, and most are struggling to survive. The preferred government strategy for eliminating independent media is to file criminal charges against publishers, and to impose hefty fines and prison terms. When lawsuits do not succeed, the government simply arrests journalists, as occurred last year when bloggers and journalists affiliated with the Zone 9 blogging collective were apprehended. The group remains imprisoned and charged as terrorists. Post-election, the EPRDF, secure in its hold on power, might be willing to allow a small degree of dissent: Ethiopian officials are increasingly wary of reactions by the international community to the crackdown on critics and in 2013 published a national human rights action plan . What causes conflict and how can it be resolved? \u2013 podcast Read more The US, UK and European Union \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s largest donors \u2013 need to increase their support for democracy and human rights because much can be done right now. Despite years of political repression, a new generation of human rights defenders is slowly emerging. The Zone 9 bloggers represented this new generation, using new technologies to educate fellow Ethiopians on exercising and defending their rights. The human rights and democracy groups that remain are finding creative ways to conduct their work. This includes working with traditional development organisations, which the government generally tolerates, or focusing on seemingly apolitical issues, such as government accountability and corruption, that are important in strengthening Ethiopia\u2019s democracy. Donor countries fall short in their support for these groups. In the US, President Barack Obama\u2019s latest budget request includes some $400m (\u00a3257m) in assistance to Ethiopia \u2013 but only $2m of it is for democracy and human rights programming. The UK is equally parsimonious in democracy support. One reason is that the EPRDF makes it difficult for domestic groups to accept outside aid. Donors could take concrete action right now. First, supporting off-shore programming allows activists to travel outside Ethiopia to get technical and strategic advice. Second, donors\u2019 strategies for Ethiopia should include funds specifically dedicated to strengthening independent media outlets and journalists; the EU intends to take this step after the election.

Photograph: Stephen Chung\/Alamy Also, donors can find ways around foreign funding restrictions by pushing for the creation of funding pools considered local under Ethiopian law. The EU did this in 2011, when it created the Civil Society Fund , providing assistance to local human rights and democracy groups. The US should use its economic and diplomatic leverage to do likewise, a move that would provide a much-needed lifeline for these groups. Greater funding for human rights will be vital for Ethiopian activists, whose reach has been limited by the charities and societies proclamation. Before that came into being six years ago, the country\u2019s leading human rights organisation, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), operated with a budget of $400,000 and 60 employees . Today, its budget is less than half that figure, and staffing is down 80%. The only thing keeping EHRCO alive is financial aid from the EU Civil Society Fund. Ethiopia receives nearly $4bn in official development assistance. This is more than any other country in Africa and makes up a significant portion of the government\u2019s annual budget. If the US, UK, EU and Canada coordinated policies, Ethiopia would have to respond to their human rights and democracy concerns. Ethiopia\u2019s election should be a wake-up call for the international community. With each successive election that does not allow genuine choice, both apathy and resentment grow, and Ethiopia risks falling prey to the same instability that has plagued its neighbours.

Ethiopian meteorology officials expect further floods as heavy showers are forecast over the next few days [Getty\/Dean Krakel] Published On 6 Apr 2016 6 Apr 2016 Seasonal rains have come early to parts of Ethiopia, causing deadly floods in places. The state broadcaster, the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation told the Associated Press news agency that 28 people have been killed in two remote regions of the country. Addis Ababa recorded more than a quarter of the April average rainfall earlier this week with 23mm of rain falling on Sunday. The entire month would normally expect 86mm. Just 60km to the southeast of the capital, Harar Meda reported 54mm of rain in the following 24 hours. Meanwhile, further south in the Great Rift Valley, Awassa had 49mm in the same period. The majority of deaths occurred in the city of Jijiga in eastern Ethiopia where the river burst its banks. It left 23 people dead and 84 injured. The intense downpours caused flooding in the drought-stricken region of Afar. Five people were killed as waters rose across what is the lowest point in Ethiopia and one of the lowest in Africa.

The Oromo and the Amhara make up about 60% of the population. They complain power is held by a tiny Tigrean elite. Violence has intensified since last Sunday when at least 55 people were killed in clashes between police and protesters at an Oromo festival. Hundreds have died in months of protests, human rights groups say. Tens of thousands have also been detained, they say. Are Ethiopian protests a game changer? What do Oromo protests mean for Ethiopian unity? What is behind wave of protests? Declaring the state of emergency, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said in a televised address: \"We put our citizens' safety first. Besides, we want to put an end to the damage that is being carried out against infrastructure projects, education institutions, health centres, administration and justice buildings.\" The state of emergency will last for six months. BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper says the violent protests are the most serious threat to Ethiopian stability in a quarter of a century. Ethiopia's ethnic make-up Oromo - 34.4% Amhara - 27% Somali - 6.2% Tigre - 6.1% Sidama - 4% Gurage - 2.5% Others - 19.8% Source: CIA World Factbook , external estimates from 2007 The protesters have been attacking foreign companies, she says, threatening Ethiopia's reputation as a growing economy, ripe for international investment. The details of the state of emergency remain unclear, but she adds that protesters have already shown they will not back down when faced with force. Many roads into and out of the capital, Addis Ababa, are blocked by protesters. The protests since last November are for manifold reason, and include: Farmers displaced to make way for commercial agriculture Amhara communities opposed to their inclusion in Tigray rather than the Amhara region Discontent among groups in various parts of the vast Oromia region Muslims unhappy at the imposition of government-approved leaders In the most recent unrest in Oromia, at least 55 people were killed in a stampede. Opposition activists blame the police for causing panic at the annual Ireecha celebrations - a traditional Oromo religious festival. The government blames \"anti-peace forces\" demonstrating in the crowd. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters angered at their handling of the event, witnesses told the BBC. Protesters say violence by the security forces led to the stampede, but the PM denied security forces had opened fire. Correspondents say that while the ruling coalition has some solid achievements to show for its 25 years in power, it has been unable to manage the transition from being a secretive revolutionary movement to running an open, democratic government.

Some died in a stampede after police employed tear gas, rubber bullets and baton charges, witnesses said. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said rioters had caused \"pre-planned mayhem\" that led people to fall to their deaths in ravines. He denied reports that the security forces had opened fire. In a national address on state TV, he praised their \"great efforts\" to protect the public and blamed \"evil forces\" for the deaths, vowing to bring to justice those responsible.. Thousands had gathered for the religious festival in Bishoftu, 40km (25 miles) from the capital Addis Ababa. Some reports said police responded after anti-government protesters threw stones and bottles, but others said demonstrators were entirely peaceful. An Oromo activist, Jawar Mohamed, was quoted as saying that nearly 300 people had been killed and many more injured. He said troops and a helicopter gunship had opened fire, driving people off a cliff and into a lake.

What is behind wave of protests? What do Oromo protests mean for Ethiopian unity? Crowds at Sunday's Oromo festival, which AP news agency said had attracted two million people, chanted \"We need freedom\" and \"We need justice\", witnesses said. Some participants crossed their wrists above their heads, a gesture that has become a symbol of Oromo protests. The unrest was sparked last November by a plan to expand the capital into Oromia. This led to fears that farmers from the Oromo ethnic group, the largest in Ethiopia, would be displaced. The plan was later dropped but protests continued, highlighting issues such as marginalisation and human rights.

However, an American women is killed during protests.","text":"Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line opens Published 5 October 2016 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, AFP Ethiopia and Djibouti have launched the first fully electrified cross-border railway line in Africa. It links Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to the Red Sea port of Djibouti - a stretch of more than 750km (466 miles). Travelling at 120km\/h, the new service cuts the journey time down from three days by road to about 12 hours. The $3.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.7bn) project was built with the help of funding from a Chinese bank and will have Chinese staff. Africa Live: More on this and other stories The track runs parallel to the abandoned Ethio-Djibouti railway, built more than 100 years ago. Image source, AFP Image caption, Chinese conductors are at the helm of the new fleet The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in Addis Ababa says the new track will initially only run freight services. The passenger trains - which will run each way daily - are to start in three months' time and ticket prices will be announced nearer the time. 'It will transform my business' Getachew Betru, chief executive of Ethiopia Railways, says it will be much cheaper and more reliable than travelling to Djibouti by road. \"In Ethiopia currently if you want to bring your container from Hong Kong to Djibouti it will take you maybe two, three weeks. But it will take you more than that to take it from Djibouti to Addis Ababa. It will now take us one day or more,\" he said. At the opening ceremony on Wednesday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said that the rail line would be a boost to the economy. \"It will provide huge benefits to the industrial parks and modern farms that will be built in the future,\" he said. Image caption, In a test run on Wednesday, invited guests were taken on a short ride of one of the trains A businessman at the opening told the BBC that the railway \"would transform\" his trade in transporting livestock. \"It will be easier, more efficient,\" he said. The railway was 70% financed by China's Exim Bank and built by China Railway Group and China Civil Engineering Construction. Chinese controllers, technicians and station masters are among those staffing the services for the next five year after which Ethiopians will be employed. Mr Getachew told the AFP news agency that their local counterparts are in training. Image source, AFP Image caption, Chinese staff are contracted to manage the trains for five years Image source, AFP Image caption, Local counterparts will be trained during that time Djibouti is important to landlocked Ethiopia which currently imports and exports nearly 90% of its goods through its port. Before construction was completed freight services transported food to areas affected by drought last year. Image source, AFP Image caption, The rail line starts off with freight services The railway is the first step in a vast 5,000km-long network of rail which Ethiopia hopes to build by 2020, connecting it to Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan. The dream is that one day the railway will extend from Djibouti's coast all the way across Africa to the Atlantic Ocean.

Hassen Hussein, an Oromo rights activist, told Al Jazeera he expected the protests to continue. \u201cIt appears that hell has broken loose in Oromia and Amhara,\u201d he said. \u201cThe air is filled with death and mourning for so many people whose lives have been cut short by the security forces.\u201d At the weekend, protesters chanted anti-government slogans and waved dissident flags.

A government statement says 21 died of suffocation after a stampede while two others were killed as they tried to escape. Some local media have disputed the account, citing unnamed witnesses who say prisoners were shot by the wardens. There has been an unprecedented wave of protests in Ethiopia in recent months. More on this and other African stories What is behind Ethiopia's wave of protests? Endurance test for protesting Ethiopian Olympian The identity of the prisoners has not been made public. Sustained gunfire could be heard coming from Qilinto prison, on the outskirts of the capital Addis Ababa, after the fire broke out on Saturday, local media reported. TV footage and photos posted on social media showed plumes of smoke rising from the prison compound. Image source, ESAT Image caption, A TV station based outside Ethiopia broadcast footage of the fire Reports that the fire was started deliberately as part of an attempted jailbreak have not been independently verified. There have been numerous protests in the Oromia region by members of the country's largest ethnic group since November 2015. Inside Qilinto prison by Tesfalem Waldyes Qilinto is a remand prison, where people can be held for three years or more as they await trial. The prison is divided in four zones made up of brick walls and tin-roofed cells. The prison hosts around 3,000 inmates at a time who are held in cells measuring 24m by 12m. Each cell holds between 90 and 130 inmates. It is a highly secured prison with surveillance cameras installed on many corners. All types of prisoners are held there but it is where political prisoners including bloggers, journalists and activists are usually sent. Political prisoners usually mix with other criminals but they are usually locked up in a designated \"Kitat Bet\" (punishment house) or \"dark house\" if they complain about mistreatment. Inmates can be exposed to communicable diseases due to overcrowding and get poor medical attention. Due to the bad quality of food provided by the prison administration, prisoners mainly depend on food brought by their families. Tesfalem Waldyes is an Ethiopian journalist who was held in Qilinto prison for a year before being released in July 2015. Many Oromo activists are being held at the Qilinto facility, according to pro-opposition media.

BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper says the violent protests are the most serious threat to Ethiopian stability in a quarter of a century. The protests in recent months have been over a series of frustrations including attempts by the governments to reallocate land in the Oromo region. Rights groups say that more than 500 people have died following clashes between police and protesters. Activists among the Oromo and Amhara communities complain that they are being politically excluded. The Oromo and the Amhara make up about 60% of the population.

Ethiopia's Information Minister Getachew Reda described the clashes in the Tsorona area as \"an Eritrean initiative\". Earlier, the Eritrean government said that Ethiopia had \"unleashed\" the attack. A peace deal in 2000 ended the countries' two-year war border war but it has not been fully implemented. Ever since, the countries have been in a state of \"neither war nor peace\", says the BBC's Ethiopia correspondent Emmanuel Igunza. Residents on the Ethiopian side of the border reported hearing gunfire and seeing a large movement of troops and artillery towards the frontier on Sunday. There were reports that clashes continued into Monday morning. \"There were significant casualties on both sides, but more on the Eritrean side,\" Mr Getachew told the AFP news agency. Eritrea has not mentioned any casualty figures. Africa Live: BBC news updates Why so many people try to flee Eritrea Eritrea celebrates 25 years of independence What sparked the clashes? Emmanuel Igunza, BBC Ethiopia correspondent: Image caption, Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki was critical of Ethiopia at the recent independence celebrations It's not clear why the fighting has erupted now. But in recent months both sides have upped the rhetoric with the latest verbal salvo coming from Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki during celebrations to mark 25 years of the country's independence. He accused Ethiopia of being hostile to Eritrea's sovereignty. Earlier this year, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said his country was ready to take \"proportionate military action against Eritrea\" for what he described as \"continuous acts of provocation and destabilisation of Ethiopia\". Eritrea says the tense relations with Ethiopia are why it has national conscription, which can last for decades. The 1998-2000 conflict, over the exact location of the border led to the deaths of an estimated 80,000 people. Two versions Mr Getachew told BBC Focus on Africa radio that the Eritrean action \"was met by an overwhelming force\". \"Fighting was heavy enough to result in significant damage to Eritrean forces... which will hopefully make it think twice about its dangerous moves,\" he added. Speculating on why Eritrea would launch the attack, the information minister said that the country was trying to deflect attention away from a recent UN human rights report , external which accused Eritrea of committing crimes against humanity - charges it denies. In a short statement issued on Sunday night, the Eritrean government , external said Ethiopia had \"unleashed an attack against Eritrea on the Tsorona Central Front. The purpose and ramifications of this attack are not clear.\" Timeline - A history of tension 1991 - Eritrea gains independence from Ethiopia after long civil war 1998-2000 - border war leaves an estimated 80,000 dead 2002 - boundary commission draws border and puts hotly-disputed Badme in Eritrea 2004 - Ethiopia accepts border ruling \"in principle\" but calls for dialogue with Eritrea 2006 - boundary commission gives the countries a year to implement ruling 2008 - UN ends peacekeeping mission without border demarcated 2012 - Ethiopia attacks positions inside Eritrea targeting \"subversive groups\" 2016 - Ethiopia and Eritrea blame each other for border clash As part of the Algiers peace agreement signed in 2000 both countries agreed to accept the ruling of an independent boundary commission over the location of the frontier as \"final and binding\". But after the commission ruled that the disputed town of Badme, where the conflict began, was in Eritrea. Ethiopia at first refused to agree to the border demarcation and then called for dialogue before it would implement the decision. This was rejected by Eritrea and there has been an impasse ever since, although clashes have been rare.

That plan has since been dropped, but the protests have continued. There have also been demonstrations in the country's Amhara region. The state of emergency was declared on 9 October a week after at least 55 people died in a stampede during an Oromo religious festival which turned into a protest. Activists blamed the security forces for causing the panic, but the government said protesters in the crowd were responsible. Human rights groups have in the past criticised Ethiopia for suppressing dissent. In last year's general election, every seat was won by either a member of the governing EPRDF coalition or one of the party's allies.

The Vintage Air Rally planes crossed \"illegally\" into Ethiopian from Sudan, officials say, and are currently impounded at an airport in Gambela. The rally has been suspended while talks take place to try to resolve the situation. Earlier, a UK pilot who went missing during the rally was found safe. On its Facebook page , external , Vintage Air Rally said that Maurice Kirk, 72, was with other pilots in Gambela who were all \"safe and accounted for\". Africa Live: Updates on this and other news stories The planes, dating from the 1920s and 1930s, took off from the Greek island of Crete on 12 November on a 13,000km (8,000 mile) journey to Cape Town. However, the head of Ethiopia's civil aviation authority, Wosenyele Hungnall, told the BBC that the aircraft had crossed illegally into Ethiopian airspace from Sudan. He said the pilots had been detained and investigators were travelling to the area. It is understood that those detained have had to surrender their mobile phones and other equipment, so details are unclear. Image source, AFP Image caption, The planes date from the 1920s and 1930s A rally spokesman told AFP news agency the problem may relate to landing permits, although he believed that all flight paths had been approved beforehand. The aviators are being accommodated at Gambela airport, the rally said, instead of at a hotel where they had made bookings. The UK's foreign and commonwealth office (FCO) is among several foreign diplomatic services now involved in the situation. An FCO spokeswoman said: \"We are in contact with the local authorities regarding a group who have been prevented from leaving Gambela airport, Ethiopia.\" A search and rescue operation was launched for Mr Kirk, from Somerset, after his aircraft went missing on Monday somewhere between Sudan and Ethiopia. Rally organisers later confirmed that he was safe. They said that he had been asked to withdraw from the event because of a lack of satellite tracking or a working compass on his 1943 Piper Cub plane. Mr Kirk, a former friend of the late actor Oliver Reed, previously reported suffering two engine failures, but had apparently decided to continue.

{"year":"2022","month":"10","event_desc":"25 October - Tigray War peace talks mediated by the African Union is formally being held for the first time in Johannesburg, South Africa.","text":"Ethiopia peace talks start in South Africa By Anait Miridzhanian and Bhargav Acharya October 26, 2022 10:34 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link A destroyed tank is seen in a field in the aftermath of fighting between the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in Kasagita town, in Afar region, Ethiopia, February 25, 2022. REUTERS\/Tiksa Negeri \/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab JOHANNESBURG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The first formal peace talks aimed at ending two years of war between the Ethiopian army and forces from the country's northern region of Tigray started in South Africa on Tuesday and will end on Sunday, the South African government said. At stake is an opportunity to end a conflict that has killed thousands, displaced millions and left hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine in Africa's second most populous nation, destabilising the wider Horn of Africa region. Sign up here. The talks, mediated by the African Union, begin as the government has been making significant gains on the battlefield, capturing several large towns in Tigray over the past week. The government offensive, conducted jointly with allied troops from neighbouring Eritrea, has raised fears of further harm to civilians, leading African, U.S. and European leaders and Pope Francis to call for a ceasefire and urgent talks. The African Union said its chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat, was \"encouraged by the early demonstration of commitment to peace by the parties\", without elaborating. South Africa \"hopes the talks will proceed constructively and result in a successful outcome that leads to lasting peace for all the people of our dear sister country Ethiopia,\" said Vincent Magwenya, spokesperson for President Cyril Ramaphosa. The African Union mediation team is led by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, supported by former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Deputy President of South Africa Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. United Nations and the United States representatives participated as observers, the African Union said. \"We are looking very eagerly at Pretoria to the talks. That's the only way forward,\" Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told a press conference on Tuesday evening in Nairobi. \"If the parties do not really engage meaningfully in a negotiated solution we'll be in this situation forever.\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the parties to engage seriously and agree an immediate truce. \"These talks represent the most promising way to achieve lasting peace and prosperity for all Ethiopians,\" he said in a statement. 'MAN MADE FAMINE' The conflict stems from grievances dating back to the nearly three decades when the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a rebel movement-turned-political party, dominated Ethiopia's ruling coalition until 2018. The party lost power at the national level after falling out with the government led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed but continued to dominate its northern stronghold. The government has accused the TPLF of seeking to restore its national dominance, which it denies, while the TPLF has accused the Abiy government of oppressing Tigrayans and over-centralising power, which it denies. The Tigrayan delegation has said its focus at the talks in South Africa would be on an immediate cessation of hostilities, unfettered access to Tigray for humanitarian aid, and the withdrawal of Eritrean forces. The government has said it views the talks as an opportunity to resolve the conflict and \"consolidate the improvement of the situation on the ground\", apparently a reference to its military advances in Tigray. The war has compounded other serious problems in Ethiopia including a drought, the worst in four decades, that has caused a food crisis and damaged the economy. Earlier on Tuesday, World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is from Tigray and served as a minister in the Ethiopian government in the past, issued the latest in a series of public criticisms of the current government's actions. \"Due to the siege in #Tigray, Ethiopia, many people have died of starvation, man made famine & lack of access to essential health care in past 2 years,\" Tedros wrote on Twitter. The Ethiopian government has denied allegations from humanitarian organisations that it was blocking them from accessing Tigray. It has accused Tedros of trying to secure arms and diplomatic backing for Tigray forces, which he denies.

By Alexa Phillips, news reporter Saturday 8 January 2022 23:48, UK Image: At least 30 people were injured in the airstrike Why you can trust Sky News At least 56 people have been killed in an airstrike on a camp for internally displaced people in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray, according to Reuters. There were at least 30 others injured in the bombing on Friday night, two aid workers told the news agency, citing local authorities and eyewitness accounts. The workers, who asked not to be named because they did not have permission to speak to the press, sent Reuters pictures of people wounded in hospital, including many children. Image: Survivors are receiving treatment at the Shire Shul General Hospital One of them visited Shire Shul General Hospital, where the injured were treated, and said the camp hosts many old women and children. \"They told me the bombs came at midnight,\" the worker said. \"It was completely dark and they couldn't escape.\" The camp that was hit by the strike is in the town of Dedebit in the northwest of the region, near the border with Eritrea, and the number of casualties was confirmed by local authorities, they said. The government has been accused of targeting civilians in the 14-month conflict with rebellious Tigrayan forces - which it has previously denied.

(photo credit: REUTERS\/GIULIA PARAVICINI\/FILE PHOTO) At least 53 people died in western Ethiopia after an unidentified armed group attacked a civilian convoy and its military escort in a region plagued by ethnic violence, a rights body appointed by the government said on Sunday. The previously unreported attack occurred on March 2 in Metekel, in the Benishangul-Gumuz region, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said. Twenty soldiers and three civilians were killed in the ambush, while 30 attackers died during the day-long gun battle that followed. Eleven more people were killed the following day - including one who was burned alive - as security forces rounded up suspects and carried out summary killings, according to the rights group. The commission investigated the incident after a video posted on social media on Friday showed armed men, some in military uniforms, using a stick to poke a man back onto a burning pile of bodies after he tried to escape. The government said on Saturday it would act against the perpetrators.

(credit: REUTERS\/BAZ RATNER\/FILE PHOTO) According to the commission, the government soldiers stopped a bus, pulled out eight ethnic Tigrayan civilians who had just been released from prison and accused them of orchestrating the attack. Security officers detained and beat the men, then they shot them, along with two men from the local Gumuz ethnic group, and burned their bodies, the commission said. Security officers told the commission that they found cash and a satellite phone with the Tigrayan suspects. Security forces discovered another Tigrayan man hiding in a car, tied him up and threw him onto the pyre, the commission said, noting the presence of Ethiopian soldiers and uniformed forces from the Amhara region and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples' Region. The rights body did not say which security force killed the civilians. Spokesmen for the two regions were not available for comment. A military spokesman and government spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The violence in the Benishangul-Gumuz, home to several ethnic groups, is separate from the war in Tigray, a northern region that has been fighting central government rule for more than 16 months. The United Nations has said at least 15,000 Tigrayan civilians were arrested or detained in connection with a state of emergency declared in November and lifted last month.
