Their extent was not immediately clear.\n\nPolice have accused a 27-year old local of deliberately starting it, and Zelenskiy's office said officers had detained suspected arsonists near two points where the fire broke out.\n\nParliament voted on Monday to increase fines for arson.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine occurred on April 26, 1986. It was caused by a botched safety test in reactor and sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe.\n\nThe plant and the abandoned nearby town of Pripyat have become a draw for tourists, especially since a critically acclaimed U.S. television miniseries about the accident was aired last year.","question":"What action did Ukraine's parliament take in response to the Chernobyl-area fires in July 2020?","answer":"Parliament voted to increase fines for arson.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0456 \u0434\u0456\u0457 \u0432\u0436\u0438\u0432 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0436\u0456 \u0432 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0456 \u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0443 \u043b\u0438\u043f\u043d\u0456 2020 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u041f\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0443\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432 \u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0448\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0456\u0432 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0438.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0423 \u043b\u0438\u043f\u043d\u0456 2020 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0436\u0456 \u0432 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0456 \u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0443\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d, \u044f\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044e\u0454 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u043b\u0456\u0441\u0430\u0445, \u0437\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0443 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u043e\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f. \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0454 \u0437\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0448\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0456\u0432 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u0456\u043d\u0448\u0456 \u0434\u0456\u0457, \u0449\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0436, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044e \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0438.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides a detailed explanation of the actions taken by the Ukrainian parliament in response to the fires in the Chernobyl zone in July 2020, specifically mentioning the adoption of a law that increases penalties for arson and other actions that could lead to fires, as well as enhanced control over fire safety rules.

Firefighters said they had managed to put out the smaller of two forest fires that began at the weekend, apparently after someone began a grass fire, and had deployed more than 100 firefighters backed by planes and helicopters to extinguish the remaining blaze. The fire had caused radiation fears in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, which is located about 60 miles south of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Government specialists on Monday sent to monitor the situation reported that there was no rise in radiation levels in Kyiv or the city suburbs. 'A horrible way to die': how Chernobyl recreated a nuclear meltdown Read more \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of opening your windows and airing out your home during the quarantine,\u201d wrote Yegor Firsov, head of Ukraine\u2019s state ecological inspection service, in a Facebook post about the results of the radiation tests. As of Monday afternoon, the country\u2019s emergency ministry said that the remaining fire in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone covered about 20 hectares and was still being extinguished. Footage released by the ministry showed firefighters dousing flames on the forest floor, and clouds of smoke rising. Police have arrested a suspect believed to have caused the blaze, a 27-year-old man from the area who reportedly told police he had set grass and rubbish on fire in three places \u201cfor fun\u201d. After he had lit the fires, he said, the wind had picked up and he had been unable to extinguish them. An earlier post by Firsov had warned about heightened radiation levels at the site of the fire, which he said had been caused by the \u201cbarbaric\u201d practice of local grass fires often started in the spring and autumn. \u201cThere is bad news \u2013 radiation is above normal in the fire\u2019s centre,\u201d Firsov wrote on Sunday. The post included a video with a Geiger counter showing radiation at 16 times above normal. The fire had spread to about 100 hectares of forest, Firsov wrote. Tourists flock to Chernobyl \u2013 in pictures Read more The country\u2019s emergency ministry put out a warning for Kyiv on Monday about poor air quality but said it was related to meteorological conditions, and not to the fire. The service had said on Saturday that increased radiation in some areas had led to \u201cdifficulties\u201d in fighting the fire, while stressing that people living nearby were not in danger. On Monday, it said that gamma radiation levels had not risen near the fire. Chernobyl polluted a large area of Europe when its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986 , with the region immediately around the power plant the worst affected. People are not allowed to live within 30km of the power station. The three other reactors at Chernobyl continued to generate electricity until the power station finally closed in 2000. A giant protective dome was put in place over the fourth reactor in 2016 . Fires are common in the forests near the disused power plant.

Published Dec. 24, 2020.   Updated Dec. 24 at 10:34 am People walk on Esplanadna Street in Kyiv on Dec. 16, 2020. Photo by Oleh Petrasiuk Ukraine has registered 11,490 new cases of COVID-19 as of 9 a.m. on Dec. 24, bringing the total number of cases in the country since the start of the pandemic to 1,001,132. Curr ently, there are 352,302 active cases across the country. In the past 24 hours, 2,721 people were hospitalized, while 15,775 h a ve recovered. Ukraine has registered 223 deaths in the past 24 hours. A total of 631,435 patients have recovered and 17,395 have died in Ukraine since the beginning of the pandemic. The largest numbers of new cases have been recorded in the city of Kyiv (1,377), Zaporizhia Oblast (774), Odesa Oblast (676), Kyiv Oblast (666) and Donetsk oblast (636). Ukraine\u2019s daily COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries from Nov. 1 to Dec. 23, 2020. All data were released by the Ministry of Health. In the past 24 hours, Ukrainian laboratories have carried out 42,132 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and 24,226 antibody tests. Ov er 5.4 million PCR tests have been conducted since the start of the pandemic. Ukraine\u2019s daily new COVID-19 cases and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the most accurate way of diagnosing the novel coronavirus, between Nov. 1 and Dec. 23, 2020. On Dec. 22, Ukraine approved its national vaccination program against COVID-19 , which will begin in the first quarter of 2021 and take place in four stages. The country has not yet received vaccines against the coronavirus. As of Dec. 23, there are 64,111 hospital beds allocated for COVID-19 patients and over 40,000 beds supplied with oxygen. As of Dec. 21, almost 41% of hospital beds allocated for COVID-19 patients are currently occupied. On Dec. 19, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health changed its testing approach. Now patients with symptoms of any severe respiratory disease have to be tested with a PCR test. Before that, only those who have exhibited COVID-19 or pneumonia symptoms were checked via PCR tests by state lab centers. Patients with suspected COVID-19 cases and those returning from countries with rapid spread of the infection will be tested with antigen tests. These tests use a nasal swab to detect the infection and can produce results in 15 minutes. If patients test positive for the coronavirus with an antigen test, they will also need to confirm it with a PCR test. On Dec. 14, Ukraine\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers approved new pandemic restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country. Starting on Dec. 19, Ukraine will forbid holding mass events in educational institutions that involve more than one group or class, as well as holding celebrations, banquets, master classes, and public events in entertainment venues and restaurants. Payment transactions in restaurants will only be allowed until 10 p.m. The government will also ban having more than one person per 10 square meters in museums, exhibitions, and galleries. Holding religious events indoors with more than one person per 5 square meters or outdoors if there is not 1.5 meter in between participants also won\u2019t be allowed. Previous restrictions will also remain in force. In particular, Ukrainians must wear masks in public transport and public spaces and carry identification when outside their homes. The number of passengers in all public transport besides the metro must be limited to the number of available seats. Cinemas and other cultural venues can only be filled to half-capacity, while gyms and fitness centers can operate if they have less than one person per 20 square meters. On Dec. 17,\u00a0 the Ukrainian parliament passed a law to fine business owners if their employees or customers don\u2019t wear face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. According to the law initiated by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, when employees notice a customer isn\u2019t wearing a mask, they have to stop servicing them and call the police if the person refuses to put on their mask.

Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times By Andrew E. Kramer Feb. 18, 2020, 12:26 p.m. ET Russian-backed separatists tried on Tuesday to break through the trench line in the stalemated war in eastern Ukraine , killing one government soldier and wounding four others, the Ukrainian military said. In the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the attack was seen more as a diplomatic feint than a military assault, an effort to gain leverage during talks to end the war. In response, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky , convened an emergency meeting of his national security council. The Kremlin denied any involvement. After a phase of widespread violence in 2014 and 2015, the war settled into a dreary back-and-forth along a frontier consisting of about 270 miles of trenches. Despite a negotiated cease-fire, skirmishes break out daily, most of them with long-distance artillery. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported nearly 300,000 cease-fire violations by both sides last year, counting every explosion or burst of gunfire its monitors hear along the front.

It was the first such attack in two years, the military said. Mr. Zelensky called the action an \u201cattempt to disrupt the peace process\u201d but did not directly blame the Russian government.

Genya Savilov\/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The Ukrainian army said it began with an artillery barrage near the village of Krymske, followed by the unsuccessful attempt to overrun its trenches, but the military provided no further details. The fighting killed one separatist soldier and wounded five others. The attack, carried out just a few miles from a \u201cdisengagement zone\u201d where Ukrainian troops had pulled back from the front, seemed to have been calculated to create political problems for Mr. Zelensky. Creating these sites has been a signature policy of the Ukrainian president, who won an election last year promising to negotiate an end to the war. But the voluntary pullbacks have incensed his Ukrainian nationalist opposition at home. The escalation near the disengagement zone in the town of Zolote was intended to \u201cforce Zelensky into talks in an unfavorable position\u201d at home politically, said Yevhan Mahda, an analyst in Kyiv. \u201cUnfortunately, the Kremlin feels the weakness of Ukraine\u2019s leadership in its unwillingness to raise the stakes,\u201d Mr. Mahda said. \u201cZelensky came to power on a program of peace, and the Kremlin understands this.\u201d The fighting on Tuesday came three days after Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government rejected a 12-point plan to reduce tensions, a proposal promoted by former Russian, European and American government officials at a security conference in Munich, Germany.

It also suggested that Ukraine should engage in a national debate about \u201cthemes of history and national memory, language\u201d and identity that would include Russian perspectives, something also sure to enrage the nationalist opposition. Mr. Zelensky had been pressing for an end to Russian deployments of weapons and soldiers into Ukraine under a formula that would allow joint patrols by Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and local citizens along the Russian-Ukrainian border. The Kremlin has rejected that idea. The attack came on the fifth anniversary of a major escalation by Russian-backed separatists and regular Russian army troops that forced Ukraine into the settlement plan known as the Minsk II agreement.

{"year":"2020","month":"12","event_desc":"17 December  Mayor Hennadiy Kernes of Kharkiv dies in Germany due to complications caused by COVID-19 after contracting the virus in September.","text":"EXCLUSIVE Kharkiv Mayor Kernes dies from COVID-19 complications By Oleksiy Sorokin . Published Dec. 17, 2020.   Updated Dec. 17 at 8:28 pm Kharkiv Mayor Hennady Kernes attends a congress of his political party at the time, Doveryai Delam (\u201cTrust in Deeds\u201d), in Kharkiv on June 2, 2019.   \u200b Photo by Oleg Petrasiuk Hennady Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, has died in Berlin where he was receiving treatment for COVID-19, his friend Pavlo Fuks, a Ukrainian businessman, announced on the Telegram messenger on Dec. 17. \u201cCoronavirus caused serious complications to (his) health. Eternal memory to you, my friend,\u201d Fuks wrote on Dec. 17. Kernes was transported to Berlin\u2019s Charite hospital on Sept. 17. Earlier, Ukrainian media reported that the mayor had tested positive for COVID-19. His representatives initially denied that, but later acknowledged he had recovered from the virus. They said that he would return to Kharkiv before New Year. Then, on Dec. 11, Kharkiv officials reported that both of Kernes\u2019 kidneys had failed and he was receiving full dialysis in Charite. Kernes had suffered from health problems since he survived an assassination attempt in April 2014. Since then, he had used a wheelchair for mobility. Despite being hospitalized in Germany and out of the public eye for over two months, Kernes still managed to win another term as mayor during Ukraine\u2019s local elections on Oct. 25, receiving 60% of the vote in the Kharkiv mayoral race. His party, the Kernes Bloc, also won the city council elections and the oblast council elections. Kernes had served as mayor of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million people located 460 kilometers to the east of Kyiv, since 2010. Controversial mayor Despite being among Ukraine\u2019s most popular mayors, Kernes\u2019 10-year reign in Kharkiv was marked by scandals and controversy. Kernes first saw fame in 2004, when he allied himself with regional businessman Arsen Avakov and supported the Orange Revolution which brought pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko to power. Back then, Kernes was among the most powerful people in town, owning several hotels, factories, and a local TV station. Later, the two became arch-enemies, with Kernes accusing Avakov, now interior minister, of ordering his assassination in 2014. Avakov has denied all accusations in the unsolved crime. The rift between the two began in 2006, when Kernes supported the pro-Russian Party of Regions, led by Viktor Yanukovych. Soon, Kernes became the head of the city council. Avakov remained in the pro-Western camp and went in opposition. In 2010, after Yanukovych became president, Kernes was elected mayor. He was re-elected twice, always getting more than 50% of the vote and winning the elections in the first round. Kernes has been known for refurbishing and opening new parks and recreational zones, which helped him draw support from the local residents. However, outside Kharkiv, Kernes is better known for corruption scandals and his initial support of Russian-backed separatists. Kernes had been on trial \u2014 for three years \u2014 on charges of kidnapping, torturing and threatening to murder EuroMaidan Revolution activists. But the court, in an unprecedented decision, suddenly closed the case on Aug. 10 without any kind of verdict or conclusion. Kernes, then a vocal supporter of Yanukovych, actively opposed the EuroMaidan Revolution, which ousted Yanukovych on Feb. 22, 2014. In February 2014, Kernes appeared on stage at a rally of pro-Russian separatists that demanded secession. However, Kernes soon backed down, and the Russian-backed secession movements in Kharkiv were halted, making the region escape the fate of Donetsk and Luhansk. In a 2014 interview with the Kyiv Post, Kernes justified his 180-degree political turn by saying he was a \u201cprisoner\u201d of the political system created by Yanukovych. A month after stating his pro-Ukrainian political views he was shot while taking his usual morning jog. He never fully recovered and had to use a wheelchair ever since. Six years after Kernes was shot, the police are still unable to name the perpetrators. Kernes accused the police led by Avakov of sabotaging the investigation. In 2016, Kernes\u2019 former business partner Yuriy Diment was shot dead on a Kharkiv cemetery. That case also remains unsolved. In 2017, deputy head of the Kharkiv Oblast police Serhiy Chizh told the press that \u201cmore than 1,500 people have been interrogated, more than 55 examinations have been carried out.\u201d\u00a0No suspects have been presented. Anton Herashchenko, Avakov\u2019s deputy, told the press in October 2016 that the assassination could have been ordered by Yevheny Zhilin, a Kharkiv pro-Russian activist and later militant fighting on behalf of Russia against Ukraine in Donbas.\u00a0Zhilin was assassinated in Russia just a month prior to Herashchenko\u2019s statement.\u00a0Both Kernes and Avakov had a longstanding conflict with Zhilin. Kernes was investigated in a major corruption case involving the distribution of land plots in Kharkiv Oblast. However, after the conclusion of pre-trial investigations, he faced no charges for the alleged theft of as much as $984 million from the allocation of state land plots to people close to the mayor. In later years, Kernes self-distanced himself from national politics, creating a local political party and not endorsing any of the national political forces.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times By Farnaz Fassihi Published Jan. 10, 2020 Updated Jan. 11, 2020, 1:53 a.m. ET Iran\u2019s military announced early Saturday that it had accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, blaming human error because of what it called the plane\u2019s sharp, unexpected turn toward a sensitive military base. After days of tension since the jet crashed near Tehran on Wednesday, the same day that Iranian missiles struck American bases in Iraq, the admission was a stunning reversal. Iran initially maintained that mechanical issues had brought the Boeing airliner down, killing all 176 people aboard. \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake, \u201d President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter soon after the military released its statement. He offered condolences to the victims\u2019 families and said investigations were underway. The military said the person responsible would face legal consequences. International pressure had been building on Iran to take responsibility. American and allied intelligence assessments had already concluded that Iranian missiles brought down the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 , most likely by accident, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. \u201cThe little credibility that the Islamic Republic had among its supporters suffered a major blow tonight,\u201d said Rouzbeh MirEmbrahim, an independent Iran analyst in New York and a consultant with the United Nations. \u201cThis tragedy undermines the image Iran has cultivated as a military power and weakened it significantly both regionally and internationally.\u201d Flights In and Out of Tehran Continued After Missile Strikes and Plane Crash Planes took off after Iran\u2019s missile strikes on bases in Iraq, and even after a Ukrainian plane crashed shortly after takeoff. On social media, Iranians began expressing anger toward the military soon after the announcement, many of them using the term \u201charshest revenge,\u201d which officials had repeatedly promised in the wake of the American drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a powerful Revolutionary Guards commander, last week. \u201cThey were supposed to take their harsh revenge against America, not the people,\u201d wrote Mojtaba Fathi, a journalist. The Iranian military's statement said the plane \u201ctook the flying posture and altitude of an enemy target\u201d as it came close to an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps base. It said that \u201cunder these circumstances, because of human error,\u201d the plane \u201ccame under fire.\u201d The military said it would undertake \u201cmajor reform in operations of all armed forces\u201d to make sure that such an error never happened again. It said Revolutionary Guards officials had been ordered to appear on state media and give the public a full explanation. In a statement of his own, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tried to place some of the blame on the United States, saying on Twitter that the disaster was \u201ccaused by U.S. adventurism.\u201d The military\u2019s statement said there had been information suggesting the United States was \u201cpreparing to aerially target sensitive defense and key sites and multiple targets in our country, and this led to even more sensitive defense posture by our antiaircraft units.\u201d The State Department had no immediate comment late Friday about Iran\u2019s admission of responsibility. Suspicions that an Iranian missile had brought down the plane were raised immediately after the crash Wednesday morning \u2014 just hours after Iran fired missiles at two bases in Iraq housing American forces. The Iranians asked the National Transportation Safety Board to help with the investigation, and the State Department granted waivers to allow the American agency to help. A senior administration official said Friday that he thought the Iranians wanted American investigators there to keep up the appearance that they did not know what had caused the crash. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss these matters publicly, said the Iranian military had poor command and control, and that this was reflected in what had happened with the airplane. Communications among officials and between units are often lacking, he said, and confusion can be the norm. Western analysts often overestimate the capability of parts of the Iranian military, he said. State television in Iran aired footage that it said showed two flight recorder units recovered from the crash site. Processing their data could take more than a month, and the investigation could take up to two years, Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said Friday. The military announcement came as something of a surprise. As late as Friday night, officials were weighing whether to blame faulty jet equipment in acknowledging that Iranian missiles brought down the jet, according to four Iranians familiar with the deliberations. Until Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s main intelligence agency, known as the S.B.U., said only that it had narrowed the cause of the crash to a missile strike or a terrorist act and that it could not confirm Western intelligence that an Iranian missile system was likely to blame. An Iranian report released on Thursday said that the plane, bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was in flames before it hit the ground but sent no distress signal. Video The New York Times has obtained and verified video showing the moment a Ukrainian airliner was hit in Iran. Credit Credit... Screenshot from video Video verified by The New York Times and published on Thursday appeared to show a missile fired from Iranian territory hitting the plane. The video showed a small explosion as the plane flew above Parand, a city near the airport \u2014 where it stopped transmitting its signal before it crashed. The plane turned back toward the airport before it exploded and crashed, other videos verified by The Times showed. When Iran began firing missiles early on Wednesday in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani by the United States in Baghdad, international airlines rerouted flights away from Iran, and the Federal Aviation Administration barred American carriers from the airspace in the region. After the crash , experts raised questions about why the Iranian authorities had not stopped flights in and out of Tehran. In Iran, a debate over how much blame the government bears threatened to destroy the national solidarity that followed the country\u2019s conflict with the United States. Many Iranians said that their anger over the lack of accountability at the highest levels of government had quickly returned. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States and its allies had intelligence showing that the passenger jet had been shot down. He was the first American official to publicly confirm the intelligence assessments. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada , citing a preliminary review of the evidence, called for a full investigation \u201cto be convinced beyond all doubt.\u201d The jetliner was carrying 57 Canadians among its 176 passengers and crew. \u201cWe recognize that this may have been done accidentally,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa. \u201cThe evidence suggests very clearly a possible and probable cause for the crash.\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made clear on Friday that Western governments had not initially shared the evidence underpinning their assessments that Iran had brought down the Ukrainian jet, though later a spokeswoman said that American officials had handed over more information. Ukrainian officials also analyzed the plane\u2019s flight pattern on Friday and determined it had stayed within the normal corridor for flights out of Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said at a news conference. \u201cOur goal is to ascertain the undeniable truth,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe believe this is the responsibility of the whole international community before the families of the dead and the memory of the victims of the catastrophe.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Niraj Chokshi, Anton Troianovski, Julian E.

A video of a tank flying what appears to be the Soviet Union flag while reportedly driving along the Dnieper river has been shared on social media. The tank can be seen speeding alongside a group of Russian trucks, and a white painted \"Z\" is also visible on the front of the tank and the trucks. A T-72B3 tank with a roof screen, a \"Z\" marker, and a Soviet flag driving along the Dnieper. https:\/\/t.co\/0j1961OoEw pic.twitter.com\/rx26hsOX5l The white painted Zs could be meant to ensure that Russia's military vehicles can be differentiated from Ukrainian ones from the sky, according to a report by The Sun . \"It would suggest final preparation are complete. It's vital that any attacking force can be distinguished, particularly from the air where Russian forces will have complete control,\" a source in Kyiv told the newspaper this past weekend. \"The Ukrainians have very similar tanks and vehicles and will want to reduce the risk of friendly fire.\" There does remain a debate as to the true meaning behind the painted Z as the letter is from the Roman alphabet and is not in the Cyrillic script used in Russia and Ukraine. Russia has previously dismissed the possibility of reviving the Soviet Union, according to a report by Newsweek. The Kremlin has also denied the idea that the invasion of Ukraine is in service of this goal. In December, Dmitry Peskov, the press security for Russian President Vladimir Putin , rejected the idea, suggested by the U.S., that Putin wants to \"reconstitute the Soviet Union\" as part of a legacy project. This suggestion was made by U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland. Peskov addressed these concerns and said that Nuland, as well as other experts, were aware that restoring the USSR is \"impossible.\" \"Furthermore, Ms. Nuland surely knows that integration processes with different rates of development have appeared in the area of the former Soviet Union for quite a long time and are maturing,\" he added. A poll published in September 2021 by the independent Levada Center saw the highest level of respondents, in recent years, say they would prefer the \" Soviet political system .\" Some 49 percent of respondents said they would prefer the Soviet political system, the highest number since the early 2000s. Only 18 percent chose the current political system while 16 percent favored the \"Western model of democracy\". The Soviet economic system was even more popular, with 62 percent preferring policies of \"state planning and distribution,\" marking a record high that is the \"maximum in the entire history of observations.\" Some 24 percent opted for \"a system based on private property and market relations.\" Gerrard Kaonga is a Newsweek U.S. News Reporter and is based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on U.S. news, politics, world news, local news and viral videos.

{"year":"2022","month":"02","event_desc":"21 February  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognising the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in eastern Ukraine, and ordered Russian forces to enter Ukraine.","text":"1:13 Putin signs decree recognising Ukraine's two breakaway territories \u2013 video Ukraine This article is more than 3 years old Putin orders troops into eastern Ukraine on \u2018peacekeeping duties\u2019 This article is more than 3 years old Russian deployment follows decision to recognise territories in south-east will be viewed in Ukraine and by other western allies as an occupation Kyiv calls for \u2018urgent\u2019 EU sanctions against Russia Ukraine-Russia crisis latest news \u2013 live updates Andrew Roth in Moscow and Julian Borger in Washington Mon 21 Feb 2022 23.48 GMT First published on Mon 21 Feb 2022 17.58 GMT Share Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to enter the Russian-controlled areas of southeast Ukraine following a decision to recognise the territories as independent states. The decision to dispatch his troops to perform \u201cpeacekeeping duties\u201d will be viewed in Ukraine and by other western allies as an occupation of the region and likely trigger tough sanctions and a Ukrainian military response. The deployment was revealed in the text of two treaty documents that Putin signed with the leaders of the separatist republics on Tuesday. The third article of the treaties provided for the \u201cimplementation of peacekeeping functions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation\u201d in the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People\u2019s Republics, which Ukraine and most of the world views at its sovereign territory. On Monday night Ukrainian officials said Russian troops may have already entered separatist territory. The officials said local people in the town of Makiivka, 15kms west of rebel-held Donetsk, saw what appeared to be Russian armoured vehicles on the move. One source - who declined to be named - said \u201ca huge convoy of Russian armoured personnel carriers and other equipment has been travelling for one and a half hours\u201d. It was spotted heading north towards the city of Yasynuvata, also in the Donestk region. Video released by Ukraine appeared to show a column of military vehicles moving in convoy along a road. The officials said it was not possible to tell if the troops belonged to the regular Russian army, or were from Russian-controlled separatist units. Quick Guide What are the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk? Show The self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk are two territories run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as \u201ctemporarily occupied territories\u201d, similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The territories cover an area of about 6,500 sq miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories, mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine, in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? On 21 February, Vladimir Putin said he would recognise the separatist-held territories as independent states. Up to that point, at an official level, Moscow saw the territories as part of Ukraine, though in reality they were fully controlled by Moscow. It is not yet clear whether the Russian president will extend his territorial claim to the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk not already until his control. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That\u2019s less than half of the pre-war population. Public opposition in the territories is near non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region. How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present. Ukraine has claimed there are 35,000 military personnel, 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, and 202 multiple launch rocket systems. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be \u201coverestimated\u201d . Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. In a televised address early on Tuesday morning, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of wrecking peace talks and ruled out making any territorial concessions. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was committed to peace and diplomacy and Ukraine was expecting \u201cclear and effective\u201d steps from its allies. \u201cWe are not afraid,\u201d he said. The decision to send in troops was revealed hours after Putin said he would recognise the Russian-controlled territories in southeast Ukraine as independent states in a pivotal decision that would scuttle an existing peace agreement. Putin announced the decision in a televised speech marked by the Russian leader\u2019s visceral anger at a country he has called a \u201cbrother nation\u201d. \u201cThose who took the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise and don\u2019t recognise any other solution to the Donbas problem besides the military,\u201d Putin said. \u201cTherefore I believe it is necessary to take a long overdue decision to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic\u201d \u2013 the Russian proxy states in east Ukraine. State television then broadcast a short video showing Putin signing a presidential order to recognise the two Russian-backed states. The separatist leaders were also present. A full-scale invasion of the country remains possible, using the estimated 190,000 troops that he has mustered near Ukraine\u2019s borders. Minutes after Putin finished speaking, the White House announced the prohibition of US investment in or trade with in the breakaway republics and potential sanctions against anyone operating within the Moscow-backed territories. \u201cWe will also soon announce additional measures related to today\u2019s blatant violation of Russia\u2019s international commitments,\u201d the White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, said. A senior administration official said more US sanctions would be announced on Tuesday, and would be proportionate to Russian actions overnight. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching very closely the actual actions that Russia takes,\u201d the official said. The UK said it will announce its own sanctions on Tuesday. Joe Biden spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart during the second half of Putin\u2019s rambling near hour-long address, before calling the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had been trying to arrange a Biden-Putin summit. France and Germany are both signatories to the Minsk agreements, a peace deal that will probably be abandoned as a result of the Russian decision. Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, condemned Putin\u2019s declaration. \u201cThis further undermines Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, erodes efforts towards a resolution of the conflict, and violates the Minsk agreements, to which Russia is a party,\u201d Stoltenberg said in a statement. Map The EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel said: \u201cThe recognition of the two separatist territories in Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the Minsk agreements. \u201cThe EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and determination in solidarity with Ukraine.\u201d The UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Putin\u2019s decision to recognise the two separatist Ukrainian republics was \u201cplainly in breach of international law. It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine.\u201d He also described it as an \u201cill omen\u201d that things were moving in the wrong direction. In his speech, Putin condemned Ukraine\u2019s decision to move on from its Soviet past, painting the de-facto partition as his punishment. \u201cModern Ukraine was wholly and fully created by Bolshevik, communist Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want decommunisation? That suits us fine. But don\u2019t stop halfway. We\u2019re ready to show Ukraine what real decommunisation means for it.\u201d The announcement followed an extraordinary meeting of his security council broadcast on national television, where the Russian president said he would make a decision later on Monday after a choreographed back-and-forth with his top advisers designed to create public support for the decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve been negotiating for eight years,\u201d Putin told his aides at one point during the security council meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re at a dead end.\u201d In turn, each of Putin\u2019s top advisers stood at a lectern and delivered a speech that ended in favour of recognising the separatist states in Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which have been at war with Kyiv since 2014 . It ended in a made-for-TV cliffhanger. \u201cI have heard your opinion. A decision will be made today,\u201d Putin said. Russia is creating lists of Ukrainians \u2018to be killed or sent to camps\u2019, US claims Read more Putin has instructed his subordinates to \u201cmaintain tensions\u201d with the west as he seeks \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that would in effect reconstitute a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. To that end, Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders , threatening a massive invasion that could target Kyiv and other cities, according to western officials. The threat of official recognition for its two proxy states in Donetsk and Luhansk has also been a part of that pressure campaign. Russia has controlled and armed the two states since the outbreak of fighting in south-east Ukraine after a revolution in Kyiv in 2014 but wanted to keep them in Ukraine with the right to veto crucial decisions, such as membership of Nato. Ukraine has said it will contest any decision by Russia to recognise the territories\u2019 independence and would recognise the move as a Russian decision to exit the Minsk agreement. After Putin\u2019s speech, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, said he had called for UN security council states to hold consultations under the Budapest memorandum to \u201cdiscuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine\u201d. This likely sets the stage for a meeting of the security council where Ukraine can put its case to the world. Any of the members can request an urgent meeting, which has to be held within 24 hours of the formal demand going in. Russia is the security council president and so may be able to control whether the meeting is closed or open. However, western member states that have been pushing hard for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis are likely to group together in a show of strength, one envoy said. Ukraine\u2019s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said any attempt by Russia to expand the territory controlled by pro-Moscow separatists would mean a full-scale war with Ukraine. The historic borders of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions are much larger than the exiting pro-Moscow-run areas.

{"year":"2022","month":"01","event_desc":"17 January  Former president Petro Poroshenko, filed his appeal to the court after he was appread[clarification needed] by his scandals during his term and the Euromaidan protest.","text":"Petro Poroshenko is being investigated for treason in a case he says was cooked up by allies of his successor, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A Ukrainian judge has rejected a prosecutor\u2019s request to detain former President Petro Poroshenko in a treason case. Judge Oleksiy Sokolov said on Wednesday Poroshenko should instead appear before prosecutors and investigators when requested to do so. Poroshenko is being investigated for treason in a case that he says was cooked up by the allies of his successor, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Poroshenko, 56, who served as president from 2014 to 2019, was placed under investigation for high treason and left Ukraine in December. He is being investigated in connection with the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales in 2014-15. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, and his party accused Zelenskyy of a reckless attempt to silence opposition. Zelenskyy\u2019s administration says the prosecutors and judiciary are independent and accuses Poroshenko of putting himself above the law. One of the country\u2019s richest men, Poroshenko flew back to Kyiv on Monday after a month\u2019s absence promising to help Ukraine fend off a possible Russian invasion . His return comes with Ukraine facing its biggest crisis in years as Russia masses tens of thousands of soldiers on the border, raising fears of an offensive and prompting warnings from the West. Dressed in a traditional embroidered shirt, Poroshenko appeared in court on Wednesday while thousands of his supporters demonstrated outside, chanting and waving flags and briefly scuffling with police before the hearing. Judge Sokolov rejected the prosecution request to arrest Poroshenko and set bail at the equivalent of $35m. Poroshenko and his supporters applauded the decision and started singing the national anthem in the court. \u201cThis is not yet a victory, this is the first step in the right direction,\u201d Poroshenko said. However, the court also ordered Poroshenko to surrender his passports, de facto banning him from leaving the country. Poroshenko said he had invitations to at least three foreign visits, and would appeal. \u201cThe seizure of my passport hinders my political activity. Being limited to staying in Kyiv hinders my internal political activity.\u201d He was elected president in 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and as fighting escalated between Kyiv\u2019s troops and Moscow-backed separatists in the east of the country. Authorities say they are investigating dozens of alleged crimes in which Poroshenko might be involved. A Kyiv court froze his assets at the start of January. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meeting Zelenskyy in Kyiv, appealed to Ukrainian leaders to present a united front against Russia. \u201cI think one of Moscow\u2019s longstanding goals has been to try to sow divisions, between and within countries, and quite simply we cannot and will not let them do that,\u201d he said. Poroshenko also called for unity, saying: \u201cThe behaviour of the aggressor requires a national consensus.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","question":"What was Petro Poroshenko's response to the court's decision in January 2022?","answer":"Poroshenko called the ruling a \"first step in the right direction\" but criticized the travel restrictions, stating they hindered his political activity.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0456\u044f \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0443 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 2022 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0432 \u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \"\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043a\u0443\", \u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0432 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f, \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438, \u0449\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0442\u044c \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0434\u0456\u044f\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456.","model_answer":"Answer: \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 2022 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0439\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0456\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0443 \u0432\u0438\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0456 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u2019\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0432, \u0449\u043e \u0432\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0454 \u0446\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0454\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e\u044e. \u0412\u0456\u043d \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432, \u0449\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0432 \u0432\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0430\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0442 \u0430\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0443, \u0456 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0446\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432 \u0446\u0435 \u044f\u043a \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0432\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0457\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0456\u0432 \u0434\u043e \u0454\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044c\u0431\u0438.","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides a detailed response regarding Petro Poroshenko's reaction to the court decision in January 2022, mentioning his statement about considering it a victory and criticizing the prosecution's demands.

{"year":"2022","month":"03","event_desc":"8 March (Day 13)  The United States banned imports of all Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","text":"March 08, 2022 FACT SHEET: United States Bans Imports of Russian Oil, Liquefied Natural Gas, and Coal Home Briefing Room Statements and Releases Today, President Biden will sign an Executive Order (E.O.) to ban the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal to the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a significant action with widespread bipartisan support that will further deprive President Putin of the economic resources he uses to continue his needless war of choice. The United States made this decision in close consultation with our Allies and partners around the world, as well as Members of Congress of both parties. The United States is able to take this step because of our strong domestic energy infrastructure and we recognize that not all of our Allies and partners are currently in a position to join us. But we are united with our Allies and partners in working together to reduce our collective dependence on Russian energy and keep the pressure mounting on Putin, while at the same taking active steps to limit impacts on global energy markets and protect our own economies. This announcement builds on unprecedented economic costs the United States and our Allies and partners have imposed on Russia. As a result of our historic, multilateral coordination, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah. Over 30 countries representing well over half the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy have announced sanctions that impose immediate and severe economic costs on Russia, cut off access to high-tech technology, sap its growth potential, and weaken its military for years to come. The Russian ruble is now worth less than a penny and has hit an all-time low after losing almost half of its value since Putin announced his further invasion of Ukraine. By isolating Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Central Bank and cutting off the largest Russian banks from the international financial system, we have disarmed his war chest of foreign reserves and left Putin to soften the blow of our sanctions. U.S. and allied export controls are impacting industrial production in Russia, Russian commercial aviation, and other key sectors of the Russian economy. The United States and governments all over the world are going after Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cronies and their families by identifying and freezing the assets they hold in our respective jurisdictions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Executive Order bans: The importation into the United States of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal. Last year, the U.S. imported nearly 700,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products from Russia and this step will deprive Russia of billions of dollars in revenues from U.S. drivers and consumers annually. New U.S. investment in Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy sector, which will ensure that American companies and American investors are not underwriting Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to expand energy production inside Russia. Americans will also be prohibited from financing or enabling foreign companies that are making investment to produce energy in Russia. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brutal war has led to higher energy prices and raised costs for Americans at home. Today, President Biden made clear that he will keep working to mitigate the pain American families feel at the pump and reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels: The Administration has already committed to releasing more than 90 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this fiscal year, with an emergency sale of 30 million barrels announced just last week.\u00a0After intensive around-the-clock coordination and consultation by President Biden, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Member countries agreed to a collective release of an initial 60 million barrels of crude oil from our strategic petroleum reserves, with the United States committing half of that in the emergency sale. We are in conversations with a range of energy producers and consumers on further steps we can take to ensure a stable global supply of energy. U.S. oil and gas production is approaching record highs, while thousands of drilling permits on federal lands go unused.\u00a0Federal policies are not limiting the production of oil and gas.\u00a0 To the contrary, the Biden Administration has been clear that in the short-term, supply must keep up with demand, at home and around the world while we make the shift to a secure clean energy future. \u00a0We are one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest producers with a strong domestic oil and gas industry. Natural gas production has never been higher, and crude oil production is expected to hit a new high next year. Oil and gas companies, and the finance firms that back them, should not use Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s war as an excuse for excess price increases or padding profits, and, as major energy company leaders have themselves said, they have the resources and incentives they need to further increase production in the United States. In the long run, the way to avoid high gas prices is to speed up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not slow down \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our transition to a clean energy future.\u00a0 We cannot drill our way out of dependence on a global commodity controlled in part by foreign nations and their leaders, including Putin. The only way to eliminate Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and every other producing country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to use oil as an economic weapon, is to reduce our dependency on oil.\u00a0 So, even as President Biden does everything in his power in the short term to make sure we can readily access the oil and gas necessary to protect American consumers and allied countries\u00e2\u0080\u0093 including through greater U.S. domestic production that is expected to hit record highs next year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this crisis reinforces our resolve to make America truly energy independent, which means reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. This is a shared goal with our European allies, that we will work together to achieve. ###","question":"What action did the United States take in March 2022 regarding Russian energy imports?","answer":"The United States banned imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0456 \u0434\u0456\u0457 \u0432\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0443 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0456 2022 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043e \u0456\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0443 \u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0456\u0432 \u0437 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457?","answer_translated":"\u0421\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0456\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0444\u0442\u0438, \u0437\u0440\u0456\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0443\u0433\u0456\u043b\u043b\u044f \u0437 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0423 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0456 2022 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0456\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0444\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0443\u0433\u0456\u043b\u043b\u044f \u0437 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0443.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer accurately reflects the expected answer, stating that the United States banned the import of oil, natural gas, and coal from Russia in March 2022.

The UNSC failed to adopt the vote though, because of the single \"no\" vote from Russia, a P5 member.","text":"\u201cThis is an extraordinary moment,\u201d declared US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield during a recent UN General Assembly (UNGA) emergency special session on Ukraine. \u201cNow, at more than any other point in recent history, the United Nations is being challenged. If the United Nations has any purpose, it is to prevent war, it is to condemn war, to stop war.\u201d With this purpose in mind, in a sweeping show of international unity, 141 countries voted in favor of an UNGA resolution demanding an immediate end to the Russian offensive in Ukraine. While non-binding and largely symbolic, this overwhelming show of global support for Ukraine came at a time when it was doubly needed, both for Ukraine itself and for the sake of the UN. Only four countries joined Russia in voting against the resolution. To the surprise of nobody, the list included Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria. Thirty-five nations abstained. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy applauded the outcome, declaring \u201cDestructive results of the vote in the UN for the aggressor convincingly show that a global anti-Putin coalition has been formed and is functioning. The world is with us.\u201d Yet while Zelenskyy\u2019s description of a global anti-Putin coalition may ring true for the UNGA, a meaningful multilateral response is still being blunted by Russia\u2019s veto power in the UN Security Council (UNSC). While the UNGA vote showed overwhelming global support for Ukraine, just a few days earlier the UN\u2019s most powerful body sent a very different message. Despite the support of 11 Council members, the UNSC failed to adopt a resolution necessitating the immediate cessation and withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine following a single \u201cno\u201d vote from Russia. This once again highlighted the privileged and troubling role the five permanent members (P5) enjoy within the international body\u2019s most powerful organ. Stay updated As the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox. Under the UN Charter, the Security Council is imbued with both primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and the capacity to pass binding resolutions. Such decisions, however, are to be made with \u201cthe concurring votes of the permanent members,\u201d thus requiring unanimous support (or abstention in lieu of) from the P5 nations. While the UN Charter endeavors to restrict member states party to a conflict from blocking UNSC action, the provision has rarely been enforced by members reluctant to see similar caps placed on their own powers. As a result, no member state has moved to forestall or challenge Russia\u2019s veto of the resolution. The P5 have frequently wielded their veto power to torpedo resolutions incongruent with their national and foreign policy interests. Such machinations have been at the root of repeated Council inaction on Syria, Israel, and perhaps most memorably , Ukraine following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia. Unilateral obstruction in the Council has over time fed into growing criticism of the UN\u2019s alleged irrelevance on the international stage. Established to foster global cooperation for the common good and consensual laws governing international behavior to preempt and mitigate interstate conflicts, today the UN is becoming increasingly captive to geopolitical rivalry and indecision. Russia is using its perch on the Security Council to distort international norms and sow discord in the pursuit of national interests. In a series of perturbing televised addresses on February 21 and 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin evoked terms of international law in an undisguised bid to cloak Russian military aggression behind the guise of self-defense against alleged abuses and genocide perpetrated by Ukraine against Russians and Russian-speaking minorities in the Donbas, and the existential threat posed to \u201cthe very existence of [the Russian] state and to its sovereignty\u201d by the West. The utter absurdity of these statements belies the extent of Russia\u2019s exceptional interpretations and weaponization of normative frameworks governing national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the use of force. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine represents the largest conventional military attack since World War II. Over 2.8 million Ukrainian refugees have fled the country since the start of the assault as the civilian death toll continues to rise . Global outrage over the invasion has been powerful and the collective response has been surprisingly united, swift, and increasingly bruising. Russia has faced a multifaceted international backlash with repercussions for its war on Ukraine hitting the nation in all parts of its economy and society. As British foreign minister Liz Truss said , Russia is becoming a \u201cglobal pariah\u201d and facing deserved isolation on the global stage. A major part of such isolation has come through enactment of massive sanctions targeting Russian commerce and banking systems. Societal backlash has also been extensive, as a slew of multinational corporations from Apple to Boeing have suspended operations in the country. Furthering its ostracization on the global arena is a growing movement to boycott Russian sports and cultural engagement . Perhaps most noteworthy is the galvanization of dramatic reversals in European foreign and security policy away from engagement with Russia. Yet whereas much of the global response has been decisive in its freeze out of Russia, the UN remains a disappointing if not surprising holdout. The failure to mount more than symbolic condemnation for an attack perpetrated by a member of the P5 is irresponsible at best and evidence of a system fundamentally unable to live up to its mission. Eurasia Center events Online Event Wed, April 16, 2025 \u2022 9:30 am ET German Galushchenko on the US role in Ukraine\u2019s energy sector Conflict Energy & Environment Europe & Eurasia Geopolitics & Energy Security The magnitude and sheer audacity of Russian actions must represent an urgent wake-up call for the global community. This includes a pressing need to reevaluate the very institutions that enable the perversion of international laws and permit totalitarianism to flourish with no retribution. Such reevaluations must include the United Nations. As the premier intergovernmental organization with the aim of maintaining peace and security, the United Nations has a unique responsibility to question how it moves forward. Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Austrian ambassador to the UN warned , \u201cThe Security Council cannot remain silent when basic principles of our international rules-based order are trampled by military boots and squashed by tanks.\u201d Anything less than a resolute response to Russia\u2019s systemic cooption and undermining of UN values puts the institution at risk of losing its moral grounding and irrevocably shattering public faith in the multilateral system. Since the start of Putin\u2019s invasion, numerous countries have joined calls for more punishing consequences for Russia in the UN Security Council. A gamut of responses, ranging from the pragmatic to the sobering, continue to be discussed. These include a mandated convening of the General Assembly after any use of veto power in the UNSC. Some have also questioned the legitimacy of Russian succession to the USSR\u2019s UNSC seat. This issue was raised most vocally by the Ukrainian ambassador to the UN. Given the gravity of the situation, there have also been demands for Russia\u2019s removal from the UNSC, including in a recent US Congressional resolution . Others have advocated ending veto power entirely. Change will not come easily. Security Council reform has been on the Assembly\u2019s agenda for more than two decades to little avail. However, Russia\u2019s latest actions have given renewed impetus to reform discussions. At no point in time has a member of the P5 so blithely abandoned international law to launch an unsanctioned assault on another country and used their position in the Security Council to shield itself from punishment. Perfunctory warnings about the futility or infeasibility of censuring Russian actions threaten to make a mockery of the multilateral system. Recent reports of the UN\u2019s internal guidance to avoid usage of the words \u201cwar\u201d or \u201cinvasion\u201d in reference to the Russian assault on Ukraine further underscore this point. Putin\u2019s war has fundamentally transformed the geopolitical landscape. This new reality must be reflected in the way the United Nations functions. If not now, when?

This comes after the agency announced on Thursday that Russian forces were beginning to withdraw from the plant after suffering \"a significant doses of radiation.\"  Energoatom's announcement came shortly after the US defense official also said Russian troops were withdrawing the facility. The announcement came as Russia said its planning to scale back military operations in the northern parts of Ukraine. Russian forces invaded Chernobyl in late February at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops had forced workers to stay on-site for close to a month before allowing another group of co-workers to switch with them. Two Ukrainian staff told Reuters on Thursday that Russian soldiers drove armored vehicles through the 'Red Forest,\" Chernobyl's most contaminated area without any protective gear when they invaded the site. On Friday, the United Nations atomic watchdog said it's opening an investigation into Russian soldiers' exposure to radiation. Ukrainian scientists from the Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants have also said that Russia's invasion of the exclusion zone allowed looters to take radioactive isotopes used to calibrate instruments, and nuclear waste left over from the 1986 nuclear accident from a radiation monitoring lab near the nuclear site at Chernobyl. Ukraine's defense ministry also said that withdrawing Russian troops \"took kettles, lab equipment, and radiation,\" before leaving.

Ukraine\u2019s forces regained full control of the region around capital city Kyiv on Saturday for the first time since Russia invaded the country at the end of February, according to a Ukrainian official. Hanna Malyar, the deputy minister for Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry, shared the news in a Facebook post . Malyar said Ukrainians should still refrain from returning to their homes, citing ongoing efforts to clear the area, including from leftover mines. Earlier this week, Russia said it was withdrawing forces from around Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv, but President Biden expressed skepticism about the claim and the Pentagon said Moscow was actually \u201c repositioning \u201d troops. \u201cWe believe this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean the threat to Kyiv is over,\u201d Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Tuesday. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met this week for peace talks in Turkey as the war has stretched on for more than a month, pushing more than four million Ukrainians to flee the country and resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians. Ukrainians have put up a stiff resistance to the invasion, however, killing as many as 15,000 Russian troops \u2014 reportedly including multiple high-ranking officers \u2014 by late March, according to NATO estimates. The Kremlin has reported significantly lower casualty numbers. Around Kyiv, the British Ministry of Defense said early on Saturday that Ukrainian troops were attempting to advance from Irpin toward Bucha and Hostomel northwest of the capital and had retaken several villages to its east. Russian troops had also reportedly withdrawn from the Hostomel airport, located northwest of the capital, according to the British ministry. Towns around Kyiv were littered with destroyed Russian tanks, Reuters reported on Saturday. Ukrainian presidential adviser Okeksiy Arestovych\u00a0said Ukraine has recaptured more than 30 towns and villages this week in the region.

He holds his hands to his head, then raises them up to the sky in anguish. \u201cBrother, we\u2019ve been looking for you for so long,\u201d he says, bursting into tears halfway through. His brother, Dmitry, has been missing for roughly a week and neighbors told Vladimir he might be buried here. \u201cWe thought you were alive,\u201d Vladimir cries out. Inside the grave, the bodies are piled on top of one another, mostly inside black bags but some with limbs protruding from the soil. Only some are interred. A CNN team saw at least a dozen bodies on the mass grave , but the earth shows signs of recent movement, suggesting many more could lie beneath.

CNN could not independently verify their claims. Vladimir gathers himself, comforted by his wife, Anna, and a neighbour, Liubov, and leaves. He says he believes his brother is buried there, but the sad reality is he cannot know for sure \u2013 and might not for a very long time as the town was only liberated from Russian forces over the weekend. Residents say the grave, on the grounds behind the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, started being dug early in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine , such was the death toll in this leafy suburb of Kyiv. Satellite images from Maxar going back to March 10 show the trench already being dug. Vladimir is comforted by his wife, Anna, near the mass grave in Bucha. Vasco Cotovio\/CNN As Russian forces retreat from the area around Kyiv, the horrors of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are increasingly coming to light. The death and destruction brought by Russia\u2019s war machine are on full display in Bucha, once an up-and-coming area on Kyiv\u2019s outskirts for young couples looking for relatively new housing developments, large lawns and good schools. But the invasion changed everything and artillery strikes have taken chunks out of Bucha\u2019s homes. One tree-lined road in the town is now littered with the warped remnants of a Russian convoy that was ambushed by Ukrainian forces. Most disturbingly, the Russian retreat has revealed at least 20 bodies lining a single street on Saturday. Some had their hands tied behind their backs, others lay crumpled under their bicycles, in what officials have described as an execution by the Russian occupiers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed Russia for the killings and called on Moscow to put an end to the \u201cwar crimes.\u201d exp GPS 0403 Phil Black on the ground in Ukraine_00024011.png video Related video On GPS: The brutality of Putin's war \u201cFor these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,\u201d Zelensky said in a Sunday video address. For its part, Russia has denied any involvement, maintaining it doesn\u2019t target civilians and saying the images of bodies on the streets of Bucha are fake. Inside the district, the roads are littered with destroyed Russian armored vehicles \u2013 including tanks \u2013 ambushed by Ukrainian drones or units with NATO-supplied hand-held rocket launchers such as Javelins and Next-Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons Systems , or NLAWs. In some cases, entire columns of Russian armored vehicles were trapped on narrow residential roads before being destroyed. A column of Russian armored vehicles litters a road in Bucha. Vasco Cotovio\/CNN \u201cThey thought they could just drive on the streets and go through. That they would be greeted as though it\u2019s alright to come here,\u201d Valery Spichek, an officer with the Ukrainian National Police, tells us. \u201cMaybe they think it is normal to drive around looting, to destroy buildings and to mock people.\u201d \u201cBut our people didn\u2019t allow it,\u201d he adds. The vehicles are now rusting away where they stopped, evidence of the heavy losses Moscow suffered before being driven out of the area around Kyiv. The destruction extends to most buildings and other infrastructure around, with very few houses left intact, a majority unlivable after Russia\u2019s offensive on the capital. The scene in Bucha is similar to what CNN was able to see in other districts around Kyiv, such as Irpin, Myla, Hostomel and as far north as Bordyanka. Many multistory buildings were destroyed in the town of Bordyanka, northwest of Kyiv. Vasco Cotovio\/CNN In the latter, entire multistory buildings were razed by artillery shells as Ukrainians and Russians battled for control of the area. Authorities say they fear dead bodies are lying underneath the rubble, and that the real death toll is still impossible to measure. Konstantin Momotov, 69, chose to stay Bucha to look after his two dogs. \u201cTroops with the letter V, that means \u2018east,\u2019 arrived here. There were a lot of them. They began to shoot with anti-aircraft guns to intimidate. It was on the third day of the war,\u201d he told CNN. They killed his young neighbor, he said, but Momotov insisted that he was not afraid. \u201cI\u2019m already old (and) I have sent my children to Poland.\u201d Despite the carnage, residents who survived the horrors are picking up their lives again. People attempted to do their grocery shopping on Sunday as the news of the alleged atrocities spread across the globe. Western and Ukrainian officials are calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate the apparent killing of civilians in Bucha despite Russia\u2019s denials. In the town itself, grief is turning into deafening anger. Looking to the sky, Vladimir\u2019s neighbor Liubov addresses Russia and President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWhy do you hate us so much? Since the 1930s, you have been abusing Ukraine. You just wanted to destroy us, wanted us gone. But \u2026 everything will be okay. I believe it,\u201d she said.

{"year":"2022","month":"04","event_desc":"The European Union proposed a ban on Russian coal after the Bucha massacre.","text":"The European Commission is proposing a ban on Russian coal \u2014 but not oil or gas \u2014 as part of a new package of sanctions in response to possible war crimes in Bucha, Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the latest sanctions package seeks to ban Russian coal imports, impose sanctions on four Russian banks and ban Russian vessels from European Union ports, among other measures. The proposal will be debated by E.U. ambassadors on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThese atrocities cannot and will not be left unanswered,\u201d von der Leyen said. \u201cIt is important to sustain utmost pressure on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the Russian government at this crucial point.\u201d\n\nThe package does not meet demands for an embargo on Russian oil or natural gas and is unlikely to quiet calls for the E.U. to do more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo avert \u2018new Buchas\u2019, impose the mother of all sanctions: stop buying oil, gas, and coal from Russia,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Tuesday. \u201cStop financing Putin\u2019s war machine.\u201d\n\nThis is the first E.U. move to block Russian energy imports since the invasion. The reason the commission proposed coal, not oil or gas, \u201cis likely because it is the easiest to be replaced,\u201d said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank.\n\nThe E.U. is already pushing to phase out coal to meet its climate change goals.\n\nIn 2020, the bloc imported just under 20 percent of its coal from Russia, compared with about 35 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its natural gas, according to the E.U. statistics office.\n\n\u201cThe E.U. everyday imports from Russia around 15 million euros [$16.38 million] of coal, around 400 million euros [$436.84 million] of gas and 450 million euros [$491.44 million] of oil,\u201d Tagliapietra said. \u201cA ban on coal is not going to hit Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVon der Leyen suggested Tuesday that oil could be next but offered no concrete plan or timeline. \u201cWe are working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports,\u201d she said.\n\nThe commission said Tuesday that a ban on imports of coal from Russia would cost the country $4 billion a year, cutting \u201canother important revenue source for Russia.\u201d Some countries may push to moderate the plan, however, preferring a phaseout of Russian coal.\n\nIn addition to targeting coal, the package aims to \u201cweaken Russia\u2019s financial system\u201d by cutting off four banks and to impose export bans on items such as quantum computers and advanced semiconductors to \u201ccontinue to degrade Russia\u2019s technological base and industrial capacity,\u201d according to a statement.\n\nThe commission\u2019s proposal also seeks to block most Russian ships and trucks from the E.U. to \u201cdrastically limit the options for the Russian industry to obtain key goods.\u201d There will also be additional sanctions on individuals, although they have yet to be named.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, the E.U. has worked with the United States and others to hit Russia with sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow and weakening the war effort.\n\nAlthough a next round of sanctions has been in the works for a while, reports of possible war crimes prompted the E.U. to press ahead on energy, starting with coal.\n\n\u201cWe are today submitting a proposal for more sanctions to further cripple Putin\u2019s war machine following the atrocities committed by Russian armed forces in Bucha and other places under Russian occupation in Ukraine,\u201d said Josep Borrell, the E.U.\u2019s top diplomat.\n\nThe E.U. is united in its outrage over apparent Russian atrocities in Ukraine, but it is deeply split about what to do next, especially when it comes to energy.\n\nUkrainian and some E.U. leaders have urged the bloc to impose a full embargo, but major E.U. economies have pushed back, arguing that the cost to Europe would be too high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrisly images from Bucha increased the pressure to act. French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that indications of \u201cwar crimes\u201d in Ukraine warranted new sanctions.

There are 93 nations who voted in favor, 24 nations against, and 58 nations that abstained.","text":"Video Ad Feedback US Amb. to UN: We have the votes to remove Russia from Human Rights Council 10:57 - Source: CNN US Amb. to UN: We have the votes to remove Russia from Human Rights Council 10:57 CNN \u2014 The United Nations General Assembly voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council after high-profile allegations of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers during the war in Ukraine. The voting result was 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. A draft of the resolution says the General Assembly may \u201csuspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.\u201d The draft resolution adds that the council has \u201cgrave concern\u201d regarding reports of \u201cgross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights\u201d and \u201cviolations of international humanitarian law\u201d committed by the Russian Federation during its invasion of Ukraine. The General Assembly needed to vote in favor by two-thirds of the countries present and voting to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. The measure suspends Russia\u2019s membership in the Council and would launch a review of the matter if the UN deems it appropriate. The United States ambassador to the United Nations made a case for seeking the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council in front of the UN Security Council on Tuesday, something she and other UN member states have been pushing. \u201cRussia should not have a position of authority in a body whose purpose \u2013 whose very purpose \u2013 is to promote respect for human rights. Not only is it the height of hypocrisy \u2013 it is dangerous,\u201d Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cEvery day, we see more and more how little Russia respects human rights,\u201d she said. Ultimately she argued, \u201cRussia\u2019s participation on the Human Rights Council hurts the Council\u2019s credibility. It undermines the entire UN. And it is just plain wrong.\u201d The Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, ahead of the vote on Thursday called on all United Nations member states to support the resolution suspending Russia from the council. \u201cNow the world has come to a crucial juncture. We witness that our liner is going through treacherous fog towards deadly icebergs. It might seem that we should have named it the Titanic instead of the Human Rights Council. \u2026 We need to take an action today to save the council from sinking,\u201d Kyslytsya said. The Ukrainian ambassador said Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine \u201cwould be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d While he noted that a vote to suspend a country from the Human Rights Council is \u201ca rare and extraordinary action,\u201d he said \u201cRussia\u2019s actions are beyond the pale.\u201d In response, the deputy Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Gennady Kuzmin, called on member states to reject the resolution, saying it would set a \u201ca dangerous precedent.\u201d \u201cToday is not the time nor the place for theatrics, or these kinds of extremely theatrical performances like the one presented by Ukraine. In fact the draft resolution we are considering today has no relationship to the actual human rights situation on the ground,\u201d Kuzmin said. The Russian representative said the vote on suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council \u201cis an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control to continue its attempt at human rights colonialism in international relations.\u201d Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement that Russia\u2019s suspension sends \u201ca crystal-clear message\u201d that they have \u201cno business\u201d on the council. \u201cThe General Assembly has sent a crystal-clear message to Russia\u2019s leadership that a government whose military is routinely committing horrific rights violations has no business on the UN Human Rights Council,\u201d Charbonneau said. \u201cGruesome images from Bucha have shocked people around the world.\u00a0Victims and their families deserve to see those responsible held to account. Investigators from the UN and International Criminal Court should set the wheels of justice in motion by moving swiftly to gather and preserve evidence of war crimes.\u201d T his story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.","question":"How many countries voted in favor of suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights Council in April 2022?","answer":"93 countries voted in favor, while 24 opposed and 58 abstained.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u0421\u043a\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0432 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0456 \u041e\u041e\u041d \u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u043a\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043d\u0456 2022 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"93 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u00ab\u0437\u0430\u00bb, 24 \u2014 \u00ab\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u00bb, \u0430 58 \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044f.","model_answer":"Answer: 93","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides only the number of countries that voted 'for' (93), but it omits the number of countries that voted 'against' (24) and those that abstained (58).

Gilmour had performed live with BoomBox in 2015, at a London benefit gig for the Belarus Free Theatre \u2013 they played a brief, endearingly raw set of Pink Floyd songs and Gilmour solo tracks \u2013 but events had moved on dramatically since then: at the end of Feburary, Khlyvnyuk had abandoned BoomBox\u2019s US tour in order to fight against the Russian invasion. On his Instagram, Gilmour found a video of the singer in military fatigues, a rifle slung over his shoulder, standing outside Kyiv\u2019s St Sofia Cathedral, belting out an unaccompanied version of Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow, a 1914 protest song written in honour of the Sich Riflemen who fought both in the first world war and the Ukrainian war of independence. \u201cI thought: that is pretty magical and maybe I can do something with this,\u201d says Gilmour. \u201cI\u2019ve got a big platform that [Pink Floyd] have worked on for all these years. It\u2019s a really difficult and frustrating thing to see this extraordinarily crazy, unjust attack by a major power on an independent, peaceful, democratic nation. The frustration of seeing that and thinking \u2018what the fuck can I do?\u2019 is sort of unbearable.\u201d The result is Hey Hey, Rise Up!, a new single by Pink Floyd that samples Khlyvnyuk\u2019s performance, to be released at midnight on Friday with proceeds going to Ukrainian humanitarian relief. 1:37 'A record we wish had never been made': Pink Floyd re-form to support Ukraine \u2013 video Most observers assumed Pink Floyd were long defunct. They last released original new music 28 years ago, although in 2014 Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason reconvened to turn outtakes from their 1994 album The Division Bell into the largely instrumental The Endless River , as a tribute to the band\u2019s late keyboard player Rick Wright. At the time, Gilmour was insistent that was the finale for a band that began in 1965 and sold more than 250m albums. Pink Floyd couldn\u2019t tour without Wright, who died of cancer in 2008, and there was to be no more music: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d he told the BBC, \u201cbut this is the end.\u201d View image in fullscreen David Gilmour recording the new Pink Floyd song. Photograph: Sarah Lee\/The Guardian The invasion of Ukraine changed Gilmour\u2019s mind. \u201cI hate it when people say things like \u2018As a parent, I \u2026\u2019, but the practicalities of having an extended Ukrainian family is part of this. My grandchildren are half-Ukrainian, my daughter-in-law Janina is Ukrainian \u2013 her grandmother was in Kharkiv until three weeks ago. She\u2019s very old, disabled, in a wheelchair and has a carer, and Janina and her family managed to get her all the way across Ukraine to the Polish border and now they\u2019ve managed to get her to Sweden, literally last week.\u201d After \u201cfinding the chords for what Andriy was singing and writing another section that I could be\u201d \u2013 Gilmour rolls his eyes \u2013 \u201cthe rock god guitar player on\u201d, he hastily convened a recording session last week with Mason, Pink Floyd\u2019s longstanding bassist Guy Pratt, and musician, producer and composer Nitin Sawhney on keyboards, layering their music with Khlyvnyuk\u2019s sampled voice; Rick Wright\u2019s daughter Gala also attended. They also shot a video for the song, with Mason playing a set of drums decorated with a painting by Ukrainian artist Maria Primachenko (the fate of her paintings remains unknown following the bombing of a museum in Ivankiv). \u201cI rang Nick up and said: \u2018listen, I want to do this thing for Ukraine. I\u2019d be really happy if you played on it and I\u2019d also be really happy if you\u2019d agree to us putting it out as Pink Floyd.\u2019 And he was absolutely on for that. \u201cIt\u2019s Pink Floyd if it\u2019s me and Nick, and that is the biggest promotional vehicle; that is, as I said, the platform that I\u2019ve been working on for my whole adult life, since I was 21. I wouldn\u2019t do this with many more things, but it\u2019s so vitally, vitally important that people understand what\u2019s going on there and do everything within their power to change that situation. And the thought, also, that mine and Pink Floyd\u2019s support of the Ukrainians could help boost morale in those areas: they need to know the whole world supports them.

Photograph: Marcus Yam\/LOS ANGELES TIMES\/REX\/Shutterstock \u201cWhen I spoke to Andriy, he was telling me about the things he\u2019d seen, and I said to him, \u2018you know this has been on the BBC here in England, and on television around the world? Everyone is seeing these terrible things that are happening.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh really? I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that most people there have got such great communication and they don\u2019t really understand that actually, the things they are going through are being shown to the world.\u201d Gilmour says it took some time for him to track Khlyvnyuk down, trawling Instagram and trying phone numbers.

Their most famous work, from the 1960s and 70s, was not removed, leading to rumours that moves to do so had been blocked by former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters , whose relations with his former bandmates are legendarily strained. A week before Russia invaded Ukraine, Waters told an interviewer on Russia Today that talk of a Russian invasion was \u201cbullshit ... anybody with an IQ above room temperature knows [an invasion] is nonsense\u201d; he has subsequently condemned the invasion calling it \u201cthe act of a gangster\u201d, while also condemning \u201c propaganda to demonise Russia \u201d.

Moscow has signaled it is willing to continue talks with the West to ease a crisis over Ukraine as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz embarked on another round of diplomacy with a visit to Kyiv, saying there was \"no reasonable justification\" for Russia's buildup of troops in border areas that many fear could be preparations to invade its neighbor. Scholz met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for two hours on February 14 and urged Russia to take immediate steps toward reducing the tensions triggered by its amassing an estimated 130,000 soldiers near the border with Ukraine, adding that the Kremlin should accept offers to discuss European security. Speaking in a televised meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that, while Moscow has \"warned more than once\" that negotiations can't be \"endless,\" he also indicated there was still space for diplomacy to defuse the crisis. Putin is to meet Scholz on February 15. \"It seems to me that our possibilities are far from exhausted....

Zelenskiy said Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, would continue to pursue its goal of NATO membership despite Russia's anger and skepticism from some Western countries over the move. Zelenskiy said later in an address to the nation posted on Facebook that authorities in Ukraine and Ukrainians themselves understand all the challenges they face and expressed confidence in the military, saying it is prepared to respond to all possible forms of aggression. \u201cWe clearly know where the foreign army is near our border, its number, its locations, equipment and its plans,\u201d he said. Zelenskiy also said he signed a decree declaring February 16 -- the day that he said Ukraine has been told would be the day of attack -- as a day of unity. \"On this day, we will hang national flags, wear blue and yellow ribbons, and show the world our unity. We have only one European aspiration -- we want freedom and are ready to fight for it,\" Zelenskiy said . Earlier on February 14, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed U.S. warnings that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent and urged Moscow to step back. \"We are on the edge of a precipice but there is still time for President Putin to step back,\" Johnson said. He also reiterated that Russia's demand that Ukraine be refused NATO membership cannot be accepted by the West. \"I think it is very important that we have a conversation. But what we can't do is trade away the sovereign rights of the Ukrainian people to aspire to NATO membership... you can't bargain that away -- it is for the Ukrainian people,\" Johnson said, adding he would be talking to U.S. President Joe Biden \"very soon\" to help the diplomatic process.

Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi issued a public call for renewed diplomacy with the E3 -- France, Germany, and the UK -- amid mounting tensions and their exclusion from ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States. In a post on X on April 24, Araqchi acknowledged that relations with the E3 are \u201ccurrently down,\u201d describing the status quo as \u201close-lose\u201d for both sides. He emphasized that \u201cplacing blame is a futile exercise\u201d and instead urged a return to dialogue and cooperation, not only on nuclear issues but across all areas of mutual interest. Araqchi offered to visit Paris, Berlin, and London for direct talks. \u201cThe ball is now in the E3's court,\u201d the Iranian foreign minister wrote, \u201chow we act at this critical junction is likely to define the foreseeable future.\u201d The foreign minister\u2019s outreach comes as the E3 have been sidelined from the latest round of nuclear negotiations, which are being mediated by Oman rather than European powers. The E3 were key players in earlier efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, but this time they've been sidelined. The E3 have threatened to trigger the re-imposition of UN sanctions on Iran if no agreement is reached with the United States by the end of June. The \u201csnapback\u201d of UN sanctions is a provision under the effectively defunct 2015 nuclear deal, which formally expires in October. Iranian state media have welcomed the E3\u2019s exclusion, with The Tehran Times even accusing them -- without evidence -- of backing UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi for secretary-general in exchange for helping to \u201cdemonize\u201d Iran and justify a return to UN sanctions.

ISLAMABAD -- Tensions between India and Pakistan are threatening to boil over as the two countries trade diplomatic and economic measures following a deadly attack in the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir that has raised fears of another military escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals. India downgraded its ties with Pakistan on April 23 and accused it of supporting \"cross-border terrorism\" a day after 26 people were killed by gunmen at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. A little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack. Twenty-five of those killed were Indian nationals. The attack and its fallout risk inflaming ties between India and Pakistan, which both claim authority over the region. SEE ALSO: What's Behind The New Wave Of Violence In Pakistan's Balochistan? Among other punitive measures taken against Islamabad, New Delhi closed the main border crossing linking the two countries, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and ordered some Pakistani visa holders to leave within 48 hours. India also announced the suspension of the six-decade old Indus Waters Treaty, which shares water between the two countries. Pakistan has denied any involvement and responded with countermeasures of its own on April 24, suspending visas for some Indian nationals and expelling certain Indian diplomats and defense officials from the country. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also called for a \"credible investigation\" into the attack and said \"India must resist the temptation to exploit such tragic incidents to its advantage.\" SEE ALSO: Pakistan's Internet 'Firewall' Aimed At Crushing Dissent Upends Livelihoods He also hit back with a stern warning about New Delhi's suspension of the water-sharing treaty. \"Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance,\" Sharif said in a statement following the convening of the country's National Security Council on April 24. \"Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty\u2026will be considered as an Act of War and responded with full force,\" the statement added. The April 22 attack marks the area's worst assault on civilians in years and could bring a new wave of unrest to the region claimed by both Pakistan and India that has been the epicenter of an often-violent territorial struggle between the two countries. SEE ALSO: In Moscow, Modi Treads Fine Line Between Russia And The West \"We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on April 24 as he vowed to track down and punish the attackers. Modi did not refer to the attackers as being Pakistani, but police in Indian Kashmir claimed two of the three suspected militants were Pakistani nationals. They did not say how they identified the attackers. Modi is expected to meet with other Indian officials on April 24 to discuss the attack and how to respond to the tit-for-tat moves with Pakistan. India and Pakistan control separate parts of Kashmir, but both claim it in full. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought wars over the territory. SEE ALSO: Pakistan's Chinese Solar-Panel Boom Risks New Debt Crisis The Pahalgam attack now risks reigniting long-running tensions. The water treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank and signed in 1960, regulates the sharing of waters of the Indus River and its tributaries between India and Pakistan. It has withstood two wars between the neighbors since then and severe strains in ties at other times. The treaty stipulates that India must, with few exceptions, allow water from the western rivers to flow downstream into Pakistan. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were already weak even before the latest measures and countermeasures announced by New Delhi and Islamabad. Pakistan expelled India's envoy and has not posted its own ambassador in New Delhi since India revoked the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir in 2019. India has often accused Pakistan of involvement in an insurgency in Kashmir, but Islamabad says it only offers diplomatic and moral support to a demand for self-determination.

KYIV -- Emergency rescuers dug through the rubble of destroyed apartment buildings, searching for survivors of a massive Russian missile-and-drone attack that killed at least 10 people and wounded scores of others across the country. The April 24 overnight barrage -- the largest in months -- came just hours after the White House gave what amounted to an ultimatum about a US proposal to end the 38-month-old Russian invasion. Western efforts to try and resolve the Ukraine war, or even secure a temporary cease-fire, have sputtered in recent days as Russia shows no indication it will ease its assault and Ukraine pushes back on US proposals. \"If Russia says it wants a cease-fire, it should stop these massive attacks,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in South Africa, where he cut short an official visit due to the overnight assault. Photo Gallery: Scores Wounded, 10 Dead In Russian Attack On Kyiv Serhiy Nuzhnenko AP Reuters Russia launched a major missile and drone assault on multiple locations across Ukraine, flattening residential buildings in Kyiv, killing at least 10 people, and wounding scores of others across the country. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email to a Friend Share on LinkedIn US President Donald Trump, who lashed out at Zelenskyy a day earlier, condemned the Russian attack in a short social media post addressed to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on Kyiv,\" he wrote. \"Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, Stop! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let's get the Peace Deal Done!\" Is The US Open To Recognizing Crimea As Russian? Foreign ministers and top diplomats had been scheduled to meet in London on April 23 for new talks. But they were effectively downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out at the last minute. Rubio's decision was reportedly prompted by Zelenskyy's rejection of a US proposal that Washington might formally recognize Russian control over the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. That would be a major reversal of longstanding US policy. It is also seen as potential political suicide for any Ukrainian officials. \"There is nothing to talk about. This violated our constitution. This is our territory, the territory of Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the London talks. The US proposal also reportedly calls for blocking Ukraine's membership in the NATO alliance, an policy goal that is written into the country's constitution. SEE ALSO: What\u2019s On The Table: Ukraine Talks Get Downgraded As Top Officials Pull Out Hours after the London talks concluded, Trump criticized Zelenskyy directly, on social media and in remarks to reporters.

We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \"I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy,\" he said. \"So far it's harder.\" White House envoy Steve Witkoff is set to fly to Moscow on April 25 for expected meetings with Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US proposal on Crimea fit with Moscow's longstanding assertion that the peninsula is Russian. \"This fully corresponds to our understanding and what we have been saying for a long time,\" he told reporters . In a post on X, Zelenskyy responded to Trump and included a copy of a 2018 US State Department statement calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea. \"We don't want this to be a frozen conflict, with war breaking out again in two to three years,\" he said on April 24, speaking alongside South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria. \"We need a strong guarantor [of our security].

With reporting by Reuters and AFP Read more April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL's Belarus Service Lithuania Accuses Russia, Belarus Of Plotting Violent Attacks On Belarusian Exiles Members of the Belarusian diaspora celebrate the Day of Freedom in Vilnius, Lithuania, on March 25. Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD) says it has uncovered a covert operation by Russian and Belarusian intelligence services aimed at inciting violence against Belarusian exiles living in Lithuania. The plot, involving staged provocations and disinformation campaigns, was revealed in a statement released by the VSD and reported by the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT. According to Lithuanian authorities, foreign intelligence services have been orchestrating increasingly dangerous incidents targeting the Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania, which numbered more than 57,000 people as of early 2025. Authorities say foreign agents have attempted to simulate clashes between so-called \"Litvinist\" Belarusians -- followers of an ideology tying Belarusian identity to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania -- and fabricated Lithuanian nationalist groups. \"The organizers are trying to stage conflicts between opposing forces -- Belarusians who advocate for Litvinist ideas and so-called Lithuanian groups who appear to resist them,\u201d the VSD said. Recent Provocations Officials stressed that no real extremist Litvinist groups have been identified in Lithuania, and that they believe the narrative is being manipulated in Belarusian and Russian propaganda to stir mistrust and division. Recent provocations include fake video messages allegedly from Belarusian soldiers, anti-Belarusian graffiti, threats against Lithuanian lawmakers and Vilnius-based exiles, and social media campaigns spreading pseudohistorical claims about the region's past. The VSD warned residents not to fall for such provocations, noting that \"participation in these activities could lead to administrative or criminal liability.\" Meanwhile, there has been growing scrutiny of Belarusian nationals living in Lithuania. Many face increasingly strict visa checks, difficulties extending residence permits, and even deportation due to past affiliations with Belarusian state institutions or the military. Lithuanian media have labeled the disinformation campaign \u201cLitvinism.\u201d Authorities emphasize that the real danger lies not in the ideology itself, but in its exploitation to destabilize communities. In recognition of its reporting on this issue, the Lithuanian government's Department of National Minorities recently presented an award to RFE\/RL\u2019s Belarus Service for an investigative piece that shed light on the actors behind the campaign and its broader geopolitical implications. Read more April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Judge Orders Steps To Reverse Shutdown Of US Government Funded Broadcaster VOA A sign for the US broadcaster Voice of America is seen in Washington, D.C. (file photo) A federal court judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to reverse its efforts aimed at forcing the closure of Voice of America (VOA), which was shut down last month in a move the broadcaster had called illegal. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled late on April 22 to grant a preliminary injunction that says officials must \"take all necessary steps\" to restore employees and contractors to their positions at VOA and to restore Congress-approved funding to two other U.S.-government funded broadcasters -- Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks -- and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts. Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees the federal broadcasters, also ordered the media outlets to provide monthly status reports showing the USAGM was complying with the order to allow the outlets to \"provide news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive.\" The USAGM has not responded publicly to the court decision. VOA last month filed a lawsuit saying the Trump administration has taken \u201ca chainsaw\u201d approach to the USAGM through an executive order that directed it and six other federal agencies to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\u201d The USAGM subsequently placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and terminated some 600 contractors, forcing VOA to stop its broadcasts for the first time since it was founded in 1942. The USAGM had argued in the case that no \"final decision\" on VOA's future had been made and that the lawsuits should be treated as \"employment disputes\" with those workers who had been terminated. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty has also filed a lawsuit against the USAGM \u201cto avoid irreparable harm\u201d to the broadcaster over the withholding of its Congress-approved grant as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to terminate RFE\/RL\u2019s funding. RFE\/RL's case continues to be pursued in court.

Officials from Ukraine, the United States, and Europe said a meeting in London was \"substantive\" despite the last-minute postponement of a broader set of talks with foreign ministers. The April 23 talks, which were aimed at trying to resolve Russia's 38-month war on Ukraine, were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting and casting a major pall over ongoing peace efforts. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy also opted to skip the meetings, leaving a Ukrainian delegation that included Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top aide -- to meet with lower-level officials and US Ukraine envoy Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. In the end, the talks involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said. Zelenskyy said emotions had \"run high\" during the meeting but it was good that the representatives of five countries met to bring peace closer. \"The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . Speaking to reporters at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he thought the London talks went well. He also said he thinks he has a deal with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the war. But he also implied that a deal with Zelenskyy remained elusive, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been more difficult to deal with than Putin. Putin was quoted as saying he viewed the deal on the table positively and hoped that Ukraine feels the same way. Trump and Zelenskyy are both scheduled to attend the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on April 25. There has been no announcement of a meeting between the two. The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain at the London talks highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talks. It also came after Trump complained of a lack of progress in the negotiations, prompting him to threaten to make a deal soon or Washington will walk away from the table. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you, we have other things to do.\" Last week, Rubio and other Ukrainian and European officials met in Paris for talks that yielded what many saw was minor progress toward a resolution of the war. But Rubio later signaled US impatience with the status of the talks and suggested the United States might pull out entirely from all involvement in the negotiations. Trump again warned Ukraine that it needs to make a deal to end the fighting while sharply criticizing Zelenskyy for saying Kyiv sees any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia -- reportedly a condition the United States has put on the table in the talks -- is a red line for Ukraine. \"It\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\" Trump said in a social media post in which he denied anyone is asking Ukraine recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire -- He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\" Trump added. Zelenskyy in his post on X included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day during a trip to India, US Vice President JD Vance said Washington had issued a \u201cvery explicit proposal\u201d to Russia and Ukraine, though he gave no details. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance said. \u201cThe current lines, somewhere close to them is where you\u2019re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,\u201d he said. SEE ALSO: Trump Talk Of Imminent Deal Sharpens Focus On Ukraine Diplomacy Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and CNN reported that US negotiators had presented Ukraine with a list of possible concessions. Included among them was potential US recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, and a definitive rejection of Ukraine's aspiration to join NATO. The Kremlin on April 23 refused to comment on rumored proposals and said the downgrading of the London talks showed that the countries involved still needed to narrow their differences as there were \"a lot of nuances\" that still need resolving. Britain's Defense Secretary John Healy told lawmakers on April 22 there was no evidence that Russia had let up its attacks on Ukraine, chiding Putin as someone who says he wants peace but \"has rejected a full cease-fire...and continues to play for time in the negotiations.\" Healy and Lammy held talks with the Ukrainian delegation during the day on April 23, with Kellogg also in attendance. He called the talks \"substantial,\" while Lammy wrote in a social media post that \"we are working at pace with US, Ukraine, and European allies to end the war and secure a just and lasting peace.\" RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report Read more Updated April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Deadly Russian Drone Strike Hits Bus In Wave Of Attacks On Ukraine's Regions Ukrainian rescuers evacuate a wounded person from a bus damaged by a Russian drone strike in the town of Marhanets, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, on April 23. A Russian drone attack hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian town of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens of others, local authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, saying that Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacks on civilians are 'commonplace' in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions, as well as the frontline cities of Kupyansk and Pokrovsk. \"Russians struck a bus which was transporting workers of a mining and processing plant.

Speaking at a meeting of the State Military-Industrial Commission on April 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than 1.5 million drones of various types had been produced in Russia last year. Putin added that this amount included about 4,000 FPV drones. A wave of Russia's attacks also targeted civilian infrastructure across other Ukrainian regions. At least five people were reported injured in the Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Odesa. \"Residential buildings, business facilities, warehouses, and garages have been damaged,\" Ukraine's emergency service said . Large-scale fires had also broken out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said . The emergency service said the attack targeted 'solely the city's civilian infrastructure.' Meanwhile, in the Yelabuga district of Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, two fires broke out following a reported drone attack, local authorities confirmed on April 23. The Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over Tatarstan by air defense systems on duty. Officials have not released further details on the type of drone or its intended target. Rustem Nuriyev, head of the Yelabuga district administration, said in a statement that there were no casualties or injuries as a result of the incident. In response to the drone activity, temporary flight restrictions were imposed on Kazan and Nizhnekamsk airports. Kyiv has not commented on the incident. Also, a fire that had been burning at an ammunition depot on a military base -- where a large explosion occurred a day earlier -- in the Kirzhach district of Russia's Vladimir region, northeast of Moscow, has been \u201cgradually ending,\u201d regional Governor Aleksandr Avdeyev said. Four people were injured when ammunition exploded, prompting an evacuation order, Avdeyev said , adding that ammunition caught fire and shells exploded in the storage area. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that the fire had been caused by a breach of safety protocols and had resulted in the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse. \"As a result of a fire on the territory of a military unit in the Vladimir region, ammunition stored in a warehouse detonated,\" the Defense Ministry said. \"According to preliminary information...the cause of the fire was a violation of safety standards in work with explosive materials.\" A state of emergency was declared in the Kirzhach district, which is about 130 kilometers northeast of the Russian capital. The base was evacuated along with about 450 people from at least seven nearby settlements, the governor said. The ammunition depot is one of the largest of the Russian armed forces. It is more than 500 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. There had been no reports of drone attacks in the Vladimir region prior to the explosion. Yan Matveyev, a Russian military analyst, told Current Time that the ammunition stored at the depot could range from typical 155-millimeter artillery shells to Iskander-M missiles. \"This depot is close to the capital, close to Moscow, so it's easy to transport all this [ammunition] around the country,\" Matveyev said. Unverified video published earlier on Telegram channels showed a huge fire ball, a loud blast, and clouds of thick smoke rising into the sky. Baza, a Telegram channel close to security services, said 10 to 11 explosions had occurred and firefighters from neighboring regions had been called in to contain the blaze. It said a special commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire.

(file photo) Farmers in Uzbekistan say the government is forcing them to surrender land to Chinese businesses under the guise of state-backed development, taking thousands of hectares of fertile cotton and wheat fields out of the hands of locals. Concerned over the fate of the lush lands of the Ferghana Valley, they told Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty that large patches of land have been taken into the state reserve and transferred to Chinese businessmen. Official documents say the land transfers are voluntary. But dozens of accounts given to RFE\/RL from those who signed over their land appear to describe a different reality: coercion, threats, and intimidation by Uzbek law enforcement officers acting on orders from local officials. \"The governor told me: 'This is a presidential order. Either give up the land or go to jail,'\" said one farmer who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal for commenting publicly on the issue. Creeping Influence? Land transfers in the Ferghana Valley, which is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, are the latest flashpoint in what is becoming an increasingly visible and volatile undercurrent across Central Asia -- a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment driven by land disputes, debt dependency, labor market tensions, and fears of creeping influence.

Neither the local government nor the prosecutor can take it away. According to the legislation, the land can only be seized by the state by court decision. Farmers, though, say and seizures are being carried out based on a verbal order from Shuhrat Abdurahmonov, the head of the region. \"I did not want to give up my land and put up some resistance, but in response, the district governor called more than 20 police officers and the National Guard to the district administration building and ordered them to arrest me and my wife,\" a farmer from Qurgonteppa district told RFE\/RL. \"That is why none of the farmers resist now; otherwise, they could be imprisoned. It is unlikely that any of us would be able to get out of there alive and well.\" Regional administrations failed to comment on the claims by farmers when contacted by RFE\/RL. Concerns over China taking over the use of large swaths of land extend beyond the farming community. Beijing's economic presence in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. As of early 2025, China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion. Over 3,400 Chinese firms operate in the country, surpassing even the number of Russian entities. Similar patterns have emerged in other Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan.

Uzbek political analyst Nargiza Muratalieva points out that Central Asian countries are increasingly falling into what she calls China's \"economic trap:\" easy access to credit -- often with opaque terms -- that can eventually leave weaker states vulnerable to political pressure or asset forfeiture. Muratalieva points out that Beijing gained over 1,100 square kilometers of land in Tajikistan in 2011 in exchange for debt relief, a clear example of the potential consequences of falling into this \"trap.\" China is already the largest lender in Uzbekistan, with outstanding loans totaling $3.8 billion. \"The general characteristics of Chinese lending for all countries in the region are the ease of obtaining debts, their difficult repayment, as well as the lack of transparency of procedures and specific conditions,\" according to Muratalieva.

Whether it's propaganda or not, the fear that China could one day treat Kazakhs or Uzbeks the same way has further sown seeds of opposition to Beijing's expanding presence. \"It turns out that the Chinese really like my land; they want to take the land from other farmers too. Naturally, we are against it, but the district governor, the prosecutor, and the police chief continue to put pressure on us,\" one farmer from Uzbekistan's western Andijon region told RFE\/RL. \"What worries us most is that they can subsequently seize our country and do to us the same as they did to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\" SEE ALSO: Trump's Tariffs, Like Russian Sanctions, Benefit Chinese EVs In Central Asia Read more April 22, 2025 By Ray Furlong , RFE\/RL's Russian Service and Current Time Russia Issues Warrant For Film Critic Turned War Critic Yekaterina Barabash in court. In a baggy red blouse and matching glasses, Yekaterina Barabash was pictured apparently blowing kisses from behind a bulletproof glass screen when she stood in the dock at a Moscow court. A well-known film critic, she was sentenced to two months of house arrest for allegedly spreading \u201clies\u201d about the Russian military\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. Now, Russian authorities have issued a wanted note for her and she faces up to 10 years in prison after they found the 63-year-old wasn\u2019t home during a check on April 13. On April 21, the Russian prison agency issued a statement saying that she wasn\u2019t home when they called several days earlier. Subsequently, a Moscow court changed her sentence, meaning that she now faces prison. Friends of Barabash contacted by RFE\/RL declined to comment on her disappearance amid fears for her safety. Barabash has been an occasional guest on RFE\/RL\u2019s Russian Service programs for some years and has often criticized the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip on society. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, she immediately condemned it. Russian forces \u201chave bombed the country, levelled whole cities to the ground,\u201d she wrote a few weeks into the conflict. Words such as these were a direct challenge to the Kremlin\u2019s narrative, which banned the word \u201cwar\u201d and denied that civilians were being targeted in attacks despite evidence to the contrary. Shortly after the invasion began, Russia passed new legislation providing jail sentences for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the armed forces. It has been used to jail hundreds of people since the war began, and has led to many others keeping silent. Barabash in court. Moscow, February 26, 2025. In a recent case , a 19-year-old woman in St. Petersburg received a nearly three-year prison sentence for gluing a short verse to a statue of a Ukrainian poet. The same law eventually led to Barabash\u2019s arrest in February 2025. In court, prosecutors said she had distributed \u201cintentionally false information about the activities of the Russian military\u201d on social media. After receiving her sentence, she emerged from the court declaring \u201cat least I\u2019ll have two months of freedom,\u201d suggesting perhaps that she expected a jail sentence in the future. Describing the moment of her arrest, she said it was \u201csurprising.\u201d \u201cThe doorbell rings and [you expect] a kind person, you open the door and there are men in masks.\u201d Her case led to an outpouring of support from leading cultural figures.

Massive Russian aerial strikes hit residential buildings in several Ukrainian cities, leaving at least one dead and more than two dozen injured, including several children, in attacks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"deliberate terror.\" Two guided aerial bomb strikes hit the city of Zaporizhzhya on April 22, killing one woman and injuring 38 others -- four of whom were children and a pregnant woman, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone attacks were also seen in the city of Kharkiv, though casualty figures were unknown. The daytime strikes came after a drone attack overnight sparked massive fires in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, where a a housing block in a densely inhabited area was hit. The attack left one woman dead and at least three other residents injured. The attack came amid ongoing diplomatic activity to secure a cease-fire in the Ukraine war, following Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. \"All of this is absolutely deliberate Russian terror that can be stopped by a single order, an order in Russia and for the Russian Army,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \"Our proposal for a cease-fire regarding civilian buildings also remains in force. Russia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this. There are no obstacles on the Ukrainian side and there will be none.\" Across the country, the Ukrainian Air Force reported dozens of drone attacks overnight. Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhaniv wrote on social media on April 22 that many apartments had been damaged and that \u201cthe residents are in shock.\u201d Emergency services posted photos and videos of fire crew battling blazes at what they said was civilian infrastructure. The renewed attacks came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that his forces were attacking civilian targets in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the governor of Russia's Vladimir region, Aleksandr Avdeyev, said on April 22 that an explosion occurred in the region's Kirzhach district. Avdeyev did not provide details but said emergency services were on site. Telegram channels reported the blast happened in the village of Barsovo, near military unit 11785, also known as the 51st arsenal of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, which stores ammunition. Residents reported several explosions. A \"powerful attack\" was reported, prompting evacuations in Barsovo and nearby villages within a 5 km radius. Roads to Kirzhach from Moscow were blocked. Local authorities announced a state of emergency in the area. Russia also launched large-scale missile strikes on Easter Monday on April 21, following the expiry of a self-declared 30-hour Easter truce. Kyiv claimed Russian forces violated the truce 3,000 times. On April 22, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot dismissed the truce as a \u201cmarketing operation\u201d by Putin aimed primarily at US President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at continuing Russian attacks as he pushes diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire. SEE ALSO: Ukraine Stands By Proposal To End Attacks On Civilian Targets, Zelenskyy Says \"The Easter truce, which he announced somewhat unexpectedly, was a marketing operation, an operation of charm, aimed at preventing President Trump's impatience and anger,\" Barrot was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying on FranceInfo television. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said he spoke to Barrot the previous evening to coordinate positions ahead of a meeting in London on April 23. The London meeting was set to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, following a gathering in Paris on April 18 -- the first joint talks in this format since Trump took office. Barrot told FranceInfo that the European countries used that meeting to tell Washington what their red lines were for a deal. Trump has said he\u2019s hopeful an agreement can be wrapped up this week, which feels ambitious to many observers. But in another sign that diplomacy is picking up steam, Putin said on April 21 that he was ready for direct talks with Zelenskyy -- something that he had until recently refused.

Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin's proposal but said Ukraine \"was ready for any conversation\" about a cease-fire that would stop strikes on civilians. \"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure.\" SEE ALSO: Zelenskyy Demands Russia Return Ukrainian Children In New International Campaign Ukraine and Russia are facing pressure from the United States to make progress on negotiations to end the war.

Ukrainian authorities reported dozens of Russian missile and drone attacks on April 21, while a Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. Russian forces attacked Ukraine's northeastern region, killing one person in a border village, according to regional prosecutors. The report on Telegram said a Russian drone struck and killed a man on a scooter in the village of Ivashki. Russian forces also launched a late night drone attack on residential areas of Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, triggering fires and damaging many apartments, local officials said early on April 22. A day earlier US President Donald Trump voiced hope that an agreement would be reached between the two countries this week. Trump told reporters at the White House on April 21 that he plans to comment on the war in Ukraine and mediation efforts in the next three days. He made the comment in response to a question about whether the United States had proposed that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014 and then annexed it in violation of international law. \"So I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,\" Trump said. \"But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,\" he added without providing details. In his comments earlier on April 21, Putin said Russia was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv. \"We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude toward any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,\" Putin said on state TV. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when Putin said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, he meant bilateral negotiations. There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week.

At age 16, Vladyslav Rudenko was captured by Russian forces and held in children\u2019s camps in Russia-occupied Crimea and Kherson for nine months. Unlike some 20,000 other Ukrainian youths, Rudenko was rescued by the NGO Save Ukraine and returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after nine months in captivity. It's the fate of those thousands, many of whom remain in Russian-occupied areas -- in what Moscow calls \u201crehabilitation centers\u201d -- that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials say they are now focused on. \"This crime must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held accountable,\" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said over the weekend as part of the launch of the ChildrenAreNonNegotiable campaign. \"A just and lasting peace requires the return of all these Ukrainian children home.\" SEE ALSO: Amid Interrogations And Threats, Ukrainian Civilians Flee Russian Occupation US President Donald Trump has made ending Europe's longest conflict since World War II a top foreign policy priority since taking office three months ago. While the talks have lurched between several contentious issues, Ukrainian officials have kept the repatriation of all of those taken from Ukraine a major negotiating point. Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of orchestrating what some groups have called a \"systematic deportation\" of children out of Ukraine and into Russia-controlled parts of the country, or even further to destinations in Russia and its ally, Belarus. Evidence gathered last year by RFE\/RL's Belarus Service and Schemes , the investigative unit of RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service, indicated camps were being used to teach young Ukrainians to identify with concepts that both Moscow and Minsk promote. That came after a November 2023 study by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab that deemed Ukrainian schoolchildren's escorted trips to Belarus were coordinated by Belarus and Russia as part of the two countries' so-called Union State. SEE ALSO: Abducted Ukrainian Children: Calls Made To Continue Search For Kids Taken By Russia As US Closes Investigation Team The study said the process involves \"re-education,\" which it defined as \"the promotion of cultural, historical, societal, and patriotic messages or ideas that serve the political interests\" of both regimes. Military training, including by Interior Ministry troops, occurred with \"at least six groups of children,\" according to the report. Rudenko told RFE\/RL's Ukrainian service earlier this month that during the time he was held by Russian authorities his daily routine had an obvious orientation. \u201cWe woke up to the Russian anthem, raised the flag, did exercises. After breakfast, they told us what had happened in Russia overnight. Literally. Then we went to watch Russian movies,\" he said, recalling his regiment while held in camps. According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab more than 8,400 children from Ukraine have been systematically relocated to at least 57 facilities: 13 facilities in Belarus and 43 facilities in Russia and Russia-occupied territory. According to Ukraine\u2019s official government portal childrenofwar.gov.ua , a much higher number -- around 20,000 -- have been taken away and only 1,300 children have been successfully returned. \u201cWe remind the world that without the return of the children abducted by Russia, the war cannot truly be considered over,\u201d a statement published by Zelenskyy's office during Easter said. Washington has supported Kyiv on the issue of repatriating children, saying last month it remains committed to supporting the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. However, Ukrainian officials are worried recent budget cutting moves by the Trump administration could significantly hinder investigations into where the children have been moved and efforts to enable their return. Meanwhile, Karolina Hird, deputy team leader and an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, warned that Ukrainian teenagers forced to accept Russian citizenship may face conscription into the Russian army and could be forced to fight against their own people, a violation of international law. \u201cNegotiations and an end to the fighting without consideration for the deported children will empower Russia to continue to commit these crimes with absolute impunity,\u201d Hird wrote .

Analysts have suggested there might be some chance of Washington recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, which occupied the peninsula in 2014. Speaking to RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service on April 21, people in Kyiv were strongly opposed to this. \"Crimea is Ukraine first and foremost.

Political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin told Current Time that Trump was in a hurry for a deal as his 100th day in office approaches on April 30. He said this also meant putting pressure on Putin. \u201cThe point is you need to understand the limit to what\u2019s possible for Putin. What does it mean if he rejects a deal? It means going against Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means undermining a relationship that, while shaky, is at least fairly friendly.

Russian state media cited the Defense Ministry in Moscow as saying on April 21 that the country\u2019s forces had \u201cresumed\u201d fighting in Ukraine after observing a 30-hour cease-fire announced by Putin on April 19. Kyiv claimed nearly 3,000 violations by Moscow\u2019s forces during the truce period. In a Telegram post on April 21, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Moscow had ignored both a proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire and a call to halt air strikes on civilian infrastructure, including missile and drone attacks. Oreshkin said Putin\u2019s 30-hour truce was merely a show for propaganda purposes. \u201cBut Zelenskyy managed to turn it to his own advantage, by proposing a 30-day truce,\u201d he added. \u201cPutin was forced to not agree to that.

Despite his illness, his death came as a shock after he had been driven around St. Peter's Square to greet cheering crowds on Easter Sunday. \"Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vatican's TV channel on April 21. \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father,\" he said. Francis, who had also delivered a blessing at this year's Easter services a day before his death, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first pontiff born outside Europe in over a millennium. At the Vatican, locals, tourists, and pilgrims visiting for Easter expressed their shock and grief. \"This is something that really hits you hard,\" Rome resident Emanuela Tinari told Reuters. \"He was a pope who brought so many people closer to the church. He was not appreciated by everyone. But he definitely was by ordinary people.\" Embed share Around The World, People Mourn The Pope Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:02:20 0:00 Tributes have also been pouring in for the late pontiff from leaders around the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin published a statement saying Francis \"enjoyed great international authority as a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious statesman, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice.\" \"Throughout his pontificate, he actively contributed to the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive interaction between Russia and the Holy See,\" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also praised the pope's tenure, describing the pontiff as someone who \"knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\" \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,\" he added. \"We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!\" 'Painful And Shameful' -- Pope Francis On The Ukraine War Pope Francis, who died on April 21, Easter Monday, did not deliver his final annual Angelus address in person. But the text of his address said the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 was \u201ca painful and shameful occasion for all of humanity.\" He went on to voice \u201csolidarity with the martyred Ukrainian people.\" The Pontiff\u2019s death-bed statement was his last attempt to give the Vatican a voice in the conflict. While he was clearly sympathetic to the plight of Ukrainians, Pope Francis\u2019 previous interventions were not always welcomed by Kyiv. He raised particular ire in March 2024 by calling on Ukraine to find \"the courage of the white flag\u201d to enter peace talks with Russia. He later said that the \u201cfirst condition\u201d for peace was that Russia \u201cput an end to its aggression.\u201d But earlier, his avoidance of specific criticism of Russia was a cause of frustration. In June 2022, he condemned the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Russian forces while also suggesting the war was \u201cperhaps somehow provoked.\u201d This echoed a Kremlin argument, repeatedly made without evidence, that it was forced to attack. -- By Ray Furlong, senior international corresponden t \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Trump announced later on the same social media platform that he and first lady Melania Trump would attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome.

US Vice President JD Vance, who met with the pontiff on April 20, said his heart \"goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis,\" adding that \"he inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.\" Moldovan President Maia Sandu also expressed regret at the news of Francis's death, saying that he had \"tirelessly promoted compassion and social justice\" and \"led with love, stood by the vulnerable, and called for unity in times of division.\" Her comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the pope had been \"a man of humility, on the side of the most vulnerable and the most fragile.\" Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Francis would be remembered for his \"tireless commitment to the weakest in society.\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tweeted that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Francis's death. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to the news with a short a Facebook post that included a picture of him with the late pontiff. \"Thank you for everything, Holy Father,\" he said. \"We bid you farewell.\" An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman voiced sadness over Francis's death, saying that he offered \"condolences to all Christians around the world.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Francis was \"a spiritual leader who gave importance to dialogue between different faith groups and took the initiative in the face of humanitarian tragedies, especially the Palestinian issue and the genocide in Gaza.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev , Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani , Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze , and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajic also posted tributes to the pope. A Papacy Focused On Social Justice Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis worked as a chemical technician before entering the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a priest in 1969 and became the provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed archbishop of Buenos Aires. Three years later, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Elected Pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, reflecting his commitment to humility and the poor. Images From Francis's Years As Pope No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:01 0:00 His papacy was marked by a focus on mercy, social justice, and environmental stewardship. In 2015, Pope Francis issued the encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019,\u201d calling for global action on climate change and care for the environment. He also emphasized interfaith dialogue, notably signing the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Ahmed el-Tayeb, in 2019, a landmark agreement promoting peace and coexistence among different faiths. 'A Poor Church For The Poor' Pope Francis was known for his pastoral approach, advocating for a \u201cpoor Church for the poor\u201d and reaching out to marginalized communities. He made efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s financial systems and address alleged clerical sexual abuse within the church. In 2025, he published his autobiography, \u201cHope,\u201d offering insights into his life and papal mission. In his later years, Pope Francis faced several health challenges. In 2021, he underwent colon surgery to address diverticulitis, and in 2023, he had abdominal surgery to repair a hernia. He also experienced chronic knee and back pain, often using a wheelchair for mobility. Despite these issues, he maintained a rigorous schedule, continuing his pastoral duties and international travels. In early 2025, Pope Francis was hospitalized with a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, which developed into double pneumonia. His condition remained complex, requiring an extended hospital stay. He had been discharged from hospital on March 23.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would continue to mirror Russia's actions, following reports of further missile strikes by Moscow. In a Telegram post , Zelenskyy noted that Moscow had ignored both a proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire and a call to halt air strikes on civilian infrastructure, including missile and drone attacks. \u201cThe nature of Ukrainian actions will remain mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, and any Russian attacks will be met with our own. Actions always speak louder than words,\u201d he added. An Easter truce in fighting between Russia and Ukraine appeared to reduce some air strikes on Ukrainian cities, but Kyiv angrily claimed nearly 3,000 violations by Moscow\u2019s forces while calls for an extension went unheeded by the Kremlin. Nevertheless, US President Donald Trump said late on April 20 that \"hopefully, Ukraine and Russia will make a deal this week.\" \"Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform without elaboration. A unilateral truce was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 19, running from 6 p.m. that day until midnight on April 20. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agency TASS that Putin had given no orders for the cease-fire to extend beyond midnight. Ukrainian officials said it was not observed anyway. Air attacks appeared to resume early on April 21. Hours after the scheduled end of the Easter truce, air-raid sirens blared across Kyiv, while the mayor of Mykolayiv reported that explosions were heard across the southern city.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said Moscow's actions following the midnight end to the truce will indicate the Kremlin's real attitude toward any initiatives to end the war. \"Regarding the so-called 'Easter Cease-fire,' we have still not heard Moscow\u2019s response to our proposal to extend it to 30 days,\" he wrote on X. \"Russia's actions after midnight, tomorrow, and throughout the week will reveal Russia\u2019s true attitude toward US peace efforts and the 30-day full cease-fire proposal. They will show whether Russia is serious about peace or Putin's statements from yesterday were simply manipulations,\" Sybiha added. The US State Department earlier said it would welcome an extension to the Easter cease-fire that was set to expire a few hours later. \"We have seen President Putin's announcement of a temporary cease-fire due to Easter. We remain committed to achieving a full and comprehensive cease-fire,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to news media. \"As we assess their seriousness in this instance, we would welcome it extending beyond Sunday,\" the statement added. In the early morning hours of April 21, Zelenskyy accused Russia of 2,935 violations following Putin's call for the Easter truce, although he added that there had been \"no air raid alerts\" during the period. \"Either Putin does not have full control over his army or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on April 20.

Russian authorities reported at least three explosions in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine early on April 20. The Defense Ministry claimed Kyiv launched 48 drone attacks on targets in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine overnight. Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s forces were acting \"in a fully symmetrical manner\" to Moscow's. Meanwhile, in a further sign of heightened international tensions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain's Defense Ministry reported recently intercepting Russian warplanes over the Baltic Sea. It cited two incidents, on April 15 and 17, in which British jets were scrambled to intercept Russian aircraft. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard said on April 20 that \"Russian aggression\" was growing and that British jets were working with the Swedish Air Force to defend NATO airspace. What Do Ukrainians Think Of Easter Cease-Fire? In Kyiv, as priests sprinkled worshippers with holy water, there was deep skepticism about the Easter truce. \"I really hope for it but I do not believe in it.

Evgeny Pavlov, 58, told the AFP news agency that \"it's pointless because I don't trust Ukraine.\" \"We shouldn't give them a break. If we're pressing them, we should finish the job,\" he added. Maria Goranina, 85, said, \"We need to end this -- either yes or no. Either make peace permanently or not at all.\" Trump's Threat To Walk Away Putin's truce announcement followed signals from Trump and other US officials complaining about the slow progress in talks to resolve the Ukraine war, now in its fourth year. Trump on April 18 said the Ukraine and Russia talks are \"coming to a head\" and he insisted that neither side is \"playing\" him in his push to end the conflict. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, warned that the United States may \"move on\" from trying to secure a peace deal if there is no progress in coming days.

That's up 12.6% from February, when the index reached its highest level since its inception in 1990. Russia's invasion of Ukraine largely drove the 17.1% increase in the prices of grains, including wheat, FAO said. The price index for vegetable oils \u2014 the biggest price increase tallied \u2014 rose 23.2%, \"driven by higher quotations for sunflower seed oil, of which Ukraine is the world\u2019s leading exporter,\" FAO notes. Russia and Ukraine together accounted for around 30% and 20% of global wheat and maize exports, respectively, over the past three years. The big picture: The war in Ukraine has also led to food shortages in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia, where UNICEF is warning of \"unprecedented hikes in food prices coupled with low purchasing power.\" \"The number of malnourished children is likely to drastically increase,\" Adele Khodr, UNICEF's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement.

Photo: Mykhaylo Palinchak\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images Ukrainian officials reported Saturday \"abnormally high\" radiation in areas of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, where they say Russian troops dug trenches and tried to build fortifications when they occupied the site until late last month . Why it matters: It's one of the world's most toxic places due to the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could not immediately verify claims of radioactive dust in areas of the zone known as the \"Red Forest,\" but is due to send a team to the region to assess damage. Petro Kotin, CEO of Ukraine's nuclear power operator, Energoatom, at one of the Red Forest tracts in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Photo: Energoatom\/Twitter Yes, but: Rafael Mariano Grossi director general of United Nations nuclear watchdog the IAEA, said in a statement Saturday that despite \"the increase in the level of radioactive contamination \u2026 due to non-conformity with requirements of radiation safety and strict access procedures,\" the radiation situation was \"within the limits\" for the site. What they're saying: Valeriy Simyonov, chief safety engineer for the Chernobyl nuclear site, told the New York Times on Saturday that Russian troops \"ignored\" engineers' warnings of radiation risks to digging trenches after they seized control of the station . \"They came and did whatever they wanted\" in the zone around the plant that's some 80 miles north of Kyiv, Simyonov said. Ukrainian soldier Ihor Ugolkov told CNN , which visited Chernobyl, that Russian troops \"went to the Red Forest and brought radioactive material back with them on their shoes.\" \"Other places are fine, but radiation increased here, because they were living here,\" Ugolkov added. The big picture: Ukrainian officials reported that Russian troops forced about half of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant employees to stay at the facility for more than three weeks before finally releasing the 64 workers late last month. About 170 Ukrainian national guard members were also held hostage in the basement of the station, according to the BBC , which visited the area this week. Oleksandr Lobada, a radiation safety supervisor at the plant, told the outlet engineers \"had to constantly negotiate\" with Russian forces and \"try hard not to offend them, so that they allowed our personnel to manage the facility.\" Flashback: The plant lost direct power and had to rely on emergency diesel generators for three days in early March after power lines were damaged \u2014 raising concerns that cooling of radioactive material stored there could be disrupted and risk radioactive leakage that could be carried by wind to other parts of Europe. Lobada told the BBC that when the site lost power, he moved to \"find fuel to keep the generator running\" by \"stealing\" some of it from Russian forces. \"If we had lost power, it could have been catastrophic,\" Oleksandr said. \"Radioactive material could have been released.\" Of note: Although Chernobyl isn't an active power station, the sarcophagus above the reactor that exploded in the nuclear disaster has to be maintained in order to prevent further radiation leaks, per CNN. A significant amount of spent nuclear fuel has to be taken care of at the plant. What to watch: Ukrainian officials said they had \"not yet been possible to restore the operation of radiation and other sensors due to the absence of required maintenance and other specialized staff,\" according to Grossi.

Nehammer said he brought up the Russian atrocities in Ukraine during a \"tough\" and \"unfriendly\" meeting.","text":"Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke for about 75 minutes, the Austrian leader's spokesperson told CNN. Dragan Tatic Berlin CNN \u2014 Austria\u2019s Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he raised alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine during a \u201ctough\u201d and unfriendly meeting Monday with Vladimir Putin \u2013 the first Western sit-down with the Russian President since he launched his invasion in February. \u201cThis is not a friendly visit. I have just come from Ukraine and have seen with my own eyes the immeasurable suffering caused by the Russian war of aggression,\u201d Nehammer was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his office after the meeting outside Moscow. Nehammer is the first European leader to meet Putin face-to-face since his invasion of Ukraine. His visit divided opinion among EU leaders, with some expressing skepticism about engaging with the Russian leader. The pair spoke for about 75 minutes at Putin\u2019s Novo-Ogaryovo residence near Moscow, Nehammer\u2019s spokesperson said, in talks the Austrian leader described as \u201cvery direct, open and tough.\u201d Before visiting Russia, Nehammer met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and visited the town of Bucha, where bodies of unarmed civilians were found strewn across public streets after a month of Russian occupation. \u201dI addressed the serious war crimes in Bucha and other places and emphasized that all those responsible for them must be held accountable,\u201d Nehammer said, according to the statement. \u201cI also told President Putin in no uncertain terms that sanctions against Russia will remain in place and will continue to be tightened as long as people are dying in Ukraine.\u201d The Austrian leader said Putin had blamed the Ukrainians for \u201cbeing responsible for the crimes in Bucha.\u201d  Video footage, however, shows Russian forces gunning down a civilian there. Austria is militarily neutral but its government has joined its neighbors in condemning Putin\u2019s invasion. The Chancellor said he raised the issue of evacuation corridors with Putin, after repeated instances in which attempted evacuations around Ukraine have been scuppered by Russian attacks. Ukrainian officials said a Russian strike on Kramatorsk train station on Friday killed dozens of people, including several children. In this pool photo taken on Thursday, March  17, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, poses with Col. Gen. Alexander Dvornikov during an awarding ceremony in Moscow's Kremlin, Russia. Alexei Nikolsky\/AP Related article Russia has appointed a new general for Ukraine. Can Moscow reboot its war in time for Putin to claim a victory? \u201cI also made it clear to the Russian President that there is an urgent need for humanitarian corridors to bring drinking water and food to the besieged cities and to bring out women, children and the wounded,\u201d Nehammer said in his statement. Nehammer cited \u201ca sense of responsibility to leave no stone unturned\u201d as a reason for seeking the meeting with Putin, saying: \u201cFor me, there is no alternative to seeking direct talks with Russia as well, despite all the very great differences.\u201d During a briefing in Moscow following the meeting, Nehammer said he was not \u201cparticularly optimistic,\u201d adding that \u201cthe offensive (in Ukraine) is being prepared with determination.\u201d While he did not expect Putin to change his view, Nehammer said it was important to confront him \u201cwith the facts.\u201d \u201cWhat is important is a personal meeting, phoning is one thing, but you really need to look each other in the eye, you need to talk about the cruelty of war,\u201d Nehammer said. \u201cOf course, when you talk to him for the first, second, third time, we can\u2019t expect him to change his view \u2026 I didn\u2019t expect that. But it is important to confront President Vladimir Putin. Every day is a day too long in the war, every \u2026 death is one too many.\u201d Nehammer noted that \u201cit was also clear and recognizable that Russian president still has confidence\u201d in the ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. Putin had no reply at all when Nehammer relayed to him that Zelensky is ready for an in-person meeting with him, an Austrian official told CNN. The impression was that Putin is more interested in continuing with the negotiations going on in Istanbul, the official said. Ahead of the talks on Monday, Lithuania\u2019s Foreign Minister cast doubt on their effectiveness, saying of the Russian leader: \u201cI personally have no reason to believe that he\u2019s talkable.\u201d Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Lipavsky also urged Nehammer to be wary. \u201cDon\u2019t be naive. Putin is a perpetrator of this horrendous war crime and those atrocities, and he should be punished for that,\u201d he said. Nehammer\u2019s statement said the European Union was \u201cmore united than ever on this issue.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister said on Sunday it would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to even think about negotiations with Russia following the atrocities committed in the town of Bucha and at the train station in Kramatorsk. Putin appointed a new general to oversee his invasion over the weekend, and the focus of Russia\u2019s forces has turned towards eastern Ukraine after their failure to seize the capital, Kyiv, and other territories in the center of the country.

Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia's Southern Military District, the new commander of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine after the previous general's failure to take Kyiv, according to a US and European officials.","text":"Chancellor Karl Nehammer will be the first European leader to meet Vladimir Putin since the invasion began. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer will visit Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, the first European leader to meet him since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine , the leader announced on Twitter. \u201cWe are militarily neutral, but [have] a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against the Ukraine. He has to stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, a ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes,\u201d he said. Nehammer said he had briefed other European partners regarding his visit to Moscow, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukraine President Volodymr Zelenskyy. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to RIA news agency that Putin would be holding talks with Nehammer on Monday. The planned meeting with the Russian leader follows a trip by Nehammer to Ukraine on Saturday, during which the Austrian chancellor met the Ukrainian president. Putin has been largely shunned by Western leaders since the start of the conflict, though he met Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in the Kremlin in early March. Neutral Austria has been providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well as helmets and body armour for civilians rather than weapons. Nehammer, a conservative, has been visibly moved by telephone conversations with Zelenskyy and says he wants to show support. Austria is a member of the European Union, but has not joined NATO. Vienna has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and this week expelled four Russian diplomats. Earlier this week, the EU\u00a0approved an embargo on Russian coal \u2013 the first time the bloc has targeted the energy sector, on which it is heavily dependent \u2013 and the closing of European ports to Russian vessels. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees said the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine since the war started was now some 4.5 million. About 2.6 million of those fled, at least initially, to Poland, and more than 686,000 to Romania, the UN said. On Friday, the UN General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council \u2013 with 93 votes in favour and 24 against, with 58 member states abstaining from the process.

{"year":"2022","month":"04","event_desc":"Indian PM Narendra Modi and US President Biden hold a virtual meeting to discuss the two nations differing stances on Ukraine, with India being currently non-aligned. India, while staying firm in its stance despite growing pressure from the US, does promote the end of the war without criticizing Russia.","text":"2+2 talks: How India and US agreed to differ on Ukraine war 12 April 2022 Share Save Vikas Pandey BBC News, Delhi Share Save Getty Images Mr Modi and Mr Biden held a virtual meeting on Monday Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden's virtual meeting came on the back of their differing stands on Ukraine. Days before their meeting, Mr Biden had called India's stand \"somewhat shaky\" and one US official had warned that India had been informed that the consequences of a \"more explicit strategic alignment\" with Moscow would be \"significant and long-term\". But India stood firm in its stand despite what appeared to be growing pressure from the US. Delhi continued to promote dialogue to end the war. It didn't criticise Russia directly but chose some strong words about the need to respect the sovereignty of each nation. In that backdrop, the leaders' summit - which was not planned and was requested by the White House - is significant for geopolitical developments. It was followed by the planned annual 2+2 Dialogue between Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin in Washington. It's evident from the statements that both sides have shown willingness to understand each other's positions on Ukraine. Pratyush Rao, director for South Asia at Control Risks consultancy, said the visit came at a sensitive time for the relationship. Getty Images Mr Modi shares good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"This was a visible reaffirmation at the highest levels by both sides to the bilateral relationship, amidst all the media speculation about deepening strains over the Ukraine conflict. The message was, yes we do differ on Russia and will unlikely bridge the gap, but won't allow it to derail wider co-operation in the Indo-Pacific either,\" he added. While PM Modi and his ministers reaffirmed their stated policy of non-alignment on Ukraine, Mr Biden and his ministers appeared more understanding of Delhi's position - a marked shift from some earlier strong statements of Washington officials. Mr Blinken said India \"has to make its own decisions about how it approaches this challenge\". He also noted that India had issued strong statements at the UN and it had called for an independent investigation into the killings of civilians in Ukraine's Bucha. In a candid remark, he said \"India's relationship with Russia has developed over decades at a time when the United States was not able to be a partner to India\". Getty Images Many Ukranian towns have been destroyed in the war He added that \"times have changed\" and the US was willing to be a partner of choice with India across virtually every realm - commerce, technology, education, and security. Former Indian diplomat Anil Triguniyat said this statement showed that the US has understood India's position in a broader geopolitical context. \"Both sides have too much to lose if the bilateral relations are strained. Their relationship is rich and the meetings just reaffirmed that,\" he added. Beyond Ukraine, the two sides also reaffirmed their commitment in continuing co-operation in the Indo-Pacific, and also in the trade, defence and security sectors. Getty Images Ukraine has also accused Russia of indiscriminate shelling of its cities The US said it saw India as \"a net provider of security in the region\". \"China is seeking to refashion the region and the international system more broadly in ways that serve its interests,\" Mr Blinken said. Both the US and India agree on playing a bigger role in the region to counterbalance China's growing influence. India has a long disputed boundary with China. Their troops were involved in deadly clashes in the Galwan valley in 2020 that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers. China said later it lost four troops in the clash. Ukraine looms large over Biden-Modi talks Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine What Putin's India visit means for world politics Mr Jaishankar acknowledged that the Quad - which includes India, the US, Japan and Australia - had emerged as \"a powerful force for global good\" and its \"elevation benefits the entire Indo-Pacific\". Mr Rao said India reposing its faith in the Quad was significant. Russia, India's time-tested ally, has criticised the Quad and called it a forum to target China. Both Moscow and Beijing have become closer and often jointly taken stands against the West. In that context, Mr Rao said that the Indian foreign minister's public and unequivocal endorsement of the Quad was important and will likely resonate among his audience in Washington. Defence ties Washington also acknowledged that Russia is India's biggest defence supplier - accounting for more than 50% of its imports. In contrast, the US was India's second-largest supplier between 2011 and 2015 after Russia, but fell behind France and Israel in the period between 2016 and 2021. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra said India continued to import from Russia because it got good value for money, and, crucially, transfers of technology in some areas. \"The US needs to give commitments on technology transfers to be able to get a bigger share of India's defence imports,\" he said. Getty Images A Russian S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system in Crimea Defence Minister Singh talked about PM Modi's \"Make in India\" campaign and invited US defence companies to set up shop in India. But there hasn't been any big-ticket announcement on this. However, a significant measure was announced about the two countries jointly developing air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles. \"More such measures are needed to address India's defence needs and help reduce its dependence on Moscow,\" Mr Misra added. But the crucial issue of India's acquisition of Russia's S-400 missile defence system remains unsolved. Getty Images The leaders' meeting was held at the request of the White House The purchase has come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), which was introduced in 2017 to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. It also prohibits any country from signing defence deals with these nations. Mr Blinken said the \"US had not made a determination regarding potential sanctions or potential waivers under the CAATSA law\". There was also a veiled suggestion to India when Mr Blinken said the US was asking countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapons systems. Mr Triguniyat says the ambiguity over the S-400 showed that the US wanted to keep its options open but it doesn't want to rock the boat at the moment. It's clear that there is a lot more ground to cover for the US to replace Moscow as India's largest defence supplier. Meanwhile, Mr Blinken also talked about India's human rights record, saying the US was \"monitoring some recent concerning developments in India, including a rise in human rights abuses by some government, police, and prison officials\". The Indian ministers didn't respond to this but analysts say Democrats, including former president Obama, have raised such issues in the past. The statement may have caused discomfort to Indians but analysts say its unlikely that the issue will become a major irritant in the relationship. Energy and trade Indian companies have been trying to circumvent sanctions to take advantage of the discounted oil prices being offered by Russian firms. When this question was put to Mr Jaishankar, he denied that India was ramping up its oil imports from Russia. \"I suspect, looking at the figures, probably our total purchases [from Russia] for the month would be less than what Europe does in an afternoon. So you might want to think about that,\" he said. The US has steadily increased its export of crude oil and refined petroleum products to India - accounting for 15% of India-US trade, which stood at $113bn in 2021.

The presidents of four countries on Russia's doorstep visited Ukraine on Wednesday and underscored their support for the country, demanding accountability for what they called war crimes carried out by Russian forces. The visit by the presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia was a strong show of solidarity from the countries on NATO's eastern flank, three of them like Ukraine once part of the Soviet Union. The leaders travelled by train to Kyiv to meet with their counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy and visited Borodianka, one of the nearby towns where evidence of atrocities was found after Russian troops withdrew to focus on the country's east. \"The fight for Europe's future is happening here,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said, calling for tougher sanctions, including against Russia's oil and gas shipments and all the country's banks. Russia invaded on 24 February with the purported goal of taking the capital, toppling the government and installing a Moscow-friendly one, but the advance stalled and Russia lost an estimated thousands of troops. The conflict has killed untold numbers of Ukrainian civilians and forced millions more to flee. It also has rattled the world economy, threatened global food supplies and shattered Europe's post-Cold War balance. Appearing alongside Zelenskyy in an ornate room in Kyiv's historic Mariinskyi Palace on Wednesday, Nauseda, Estonian President Alar Karis, Poland's Andrzej Duda and Egils Levits of Latvia reiterated their commitment to supporting Ukraine politically and with military aid. \"We know this history. We know what Russian occupation means. We know what Russian terrorism means,\" Duda said, adding that those who committed war crimes and those who gave the orders should be held accountable. \"If someone sends aircraft, if someone sends troops to shell residential districts, kill civilians, murder them, this is not war,\" he said. \"This is cruelty, this is banditry, this is terrorism.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied his troops committed atrocities, saying on Tuesday that Moscow \"had no other choice\" but to invade and would \"continue until its full completion and the fulfilment of the tasks that have been set.\" He insisted Russia's campaign was going as planned despite a major withdrawal after its forces failed to take the capital and suffered significant losses. Russian troops are now gearing up for a major offensive in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-allied separatists and Ukrainian forces have been fighting since 2014, and where Russia has recognized the separatists' claims of independence.

Both accounts confirm that the warship did in fact catch fire.","text":"The missile cruiser Moskva is the most significant naval vessel to be sunk since Argentina\u2019s General Belgrano in 1982.

Although Russia did not confirm that Ukrainian missiles had hit the ship, early on Friday it struck what it described as a factory in Kyiv that made and repaired anti-ship missiles, in apparent retaliation. Ukraine said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles while distracting its crew with an aerial drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew of 500 to abandon ship. Russia\u2019s defence ministry initially denied reports that it had sunk and claimed the fires had been extinguished. It said four Russian ships that had gone to the Moskva\u2019s rescue were hampered by bad weather and by ammunition blowing up on board. Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 51 of the invasion Read more Late on Thursday the ministry said in a statement: \u201cThe cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship\u2019s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.\u201d The claim of bad weather being a factor in the sinking was questioned by observers. Mark Hertling, the former commanding general of the United States Army Europe , told CNN: \u201cAs they were towing that ship in, that very wounded ship, into Sevastopol, they claim a storm sank it. Looking at the weather report outside of Sevastopol today the winds were about four miles an hour with 40 degree [4C] temperatures and a little bit of rain.\u201d The apparent attack on and sinking of the Black Sea fleet\u2019s flagship \u2013 50 days after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine \u2013 represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. The Moskva was the pride of its fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine. \u201cThe sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, is not just a significant loss, it is emblematic of the shambolic Russian military campaign,\u201d said Michael Kofman, research programme director and Russia expert at the US government-funded Center for Naval Analyses. Confirmation of the sinking came as the CIA\u2019s director, William Burns, warned that Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of his country\u2019s military setbacks. During a speech in Atlanta, Burns said: \u201cGiven the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership \u2026 none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.\u201d The Kremlin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after beginning the war on 24 February, and furthered its nuclear rhetoric on Thursday when it said it would be forced to strengthen its defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Burns, however, said the US had not seen \u201ca lot of practical evidence\u201d of actual deployments that would cause more worry. Kyiv was hit on Friday by some of the most powerful explosions heard since Russian forces withdrew from the area two weeks ago. Moscow said it had struck a plant that made and repaired Ukrainian missiles, including anti-ship missiles. \u201cThe number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime,\u201d the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. Russia\u2019s defence ministry also said it had captured the Ilyich steel works in Mariupol, the besieged eastern port that has seen the war\u2019s heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe. The report could not be confirmed. Ukrainian defenders are mainly believed to be holding out in Azovstal, another huge steel works. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has delivered an address to mark the 50th day of war, calling Russia\u2019s invasion \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d and saying Ukraine had become a \u201chero for the whole free world\u201d. In signs of the financial pressures being placed on Russia by the sanctions regime, which has led to rating agency Moody\u2019s saying that Russia \u201cmay be considered in default\u201d if it fails to pay bonds in US dollars by 4 May, Moscow has written to Brazil asking for its support in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G20 group of top economies. Live Inside Ukraine\u2019s suburban horror: \u2018I have nothing left\u2019 - video The sinking of the Moskva dealt a blow to one of Russia\u2019s main campaign objectives. Commissioned in 1983, it was armed with 16 anti-ship Vulkan cruise missiles with a range of at least 440 miles (700km). According to reports, it was also carrying S-300 anti-air missiles, which are crucial to Russia\u2019s air power over Crimea and Ukraine\u2019s Kherson province, now occupied by Russian troops. It is the most significant naval vessel to be sunk since the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed by a British submarine, HMS Conqueror, in 1982 . Maksym Marchenko, the Ukrainian governor of the region around Odessa, said the Moskva had been hit by two cruise missiles. \u201cNeptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage,\u201d he said. Oleksandr Turchynov, a former secretary of the national security and defence council, said Ukraine had hit another Russian ship two weeks ago with a Neptune cruise missile. He said the missile inflicted \u201csignificant damage\u201d on the Admiral Essen, \u201cremoving it from combat operation\u201d. Western officials described the Ukrainian claims to have hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles as \u201ccredible\u201d. A senior US defence official noted that five other Russian vessels that had been as close as or closer to the Ukrainian coast than the Moskva had moved at least another 20 nautical miles offshore after the explosion, suggesting an effort to get out of range of Ukrainian missiles. \u201cIn the wake of the damage that the Moskva experienced, all of the northern Black Sea ships have now moved out, away from the northern areas they were operating in,\u201d the defence official said. The Moskva gained notoriety early in the war when the crew demanded the surrender of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island, prompting a riposte by radio from one of the border guards on the island: \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself.\u201d The phrase instantly became synonymous with Ukrainian defiance, and is now a universal meme. The day before the Moskva was sunk, Zelenskiy unveiled a new postage stamp portraying the ship and the Ukrainian border guard with his middle finger raised.

The Ukrainian southern military command claimed late on Thursday to have struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew to abandon ship.

But late on Friday, the ministry said in a statement: \u201cThe cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship\u2019s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank\u201d The apparent attack and sinking of the flagship \u2013 50 days after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine \u2013 represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin.

People have passed this spiritual connection on\u00a0to\u00a0their children and\u00a0grandchildren. Despite all the\u00a0trials they endured, they carried the\u00a0love for\u00a0Russia through the\u00a0years. This is something no one can destroy. That is why both older generations and\u00a0young people\u00a0\u2013 those who were born after the\u00a0tragic collapse of\u00a0the\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0\u2013 have voted for\u00a0our unity, for\u00a0our common future.\nIn\u00a01991 in\u00a0Belovezhskaya Pushcha, representatives of\u00a0the\u00a0party elite of\u00a0that time made a\u00a0decision to\u00a0terminate the\u00a0Soviet Union, without asking ordinary citizens what they wanted, and\u00a0people suddenly found themselves cut off from their homeland. This tore apart and\u00a0dismembered our national community and\u00a0triggered a\u00a0national catastrophe. Just like the\u00a0government quietly demarcated the\u00a0borders of\u00a0Soviet republics, acting behind the\u00a0scenes after the\u00a01917 revolution, the\u00a0last leaders of\u00a0the\u00a0Soviet Union, contrary to\u00a0the\u00a0direct expression of\u00a0the\u00a0will of\u00a0the\u00a0majority of\u00a0people in\u00a0the\u00a0referendum of\u00a01991, destroyed our great country, and\u00a0simply made the\u00a0people in\u00a0the\u00a0former republics face this as\u00a0an\u00a0accomplished fact.\nI\u00a0can admit that they didn\u2019t even know what they were doing and\u00a0what consequences their actions would have in\u00a0the\u00a0end. But it doesn't matter now. There is no Soviet Union anymore; we cannot return to\u00a0the\u00a0past. Actually, Russia no longer needs it today; this isn\u2019t our ambition. But there is nothing stronger than the\u00a0determination of\u00a0millions of\u00a0people who, by\u00a0their culture, religion, traditions, and\u00a0language, consider themselves part of\u00a0Russia, whose ancestors lived in\u00a0a\u00a0single country for\u00a0centuries. There is nothing stronger than their determination to\u00a0return to\u00a0their true historical homeland.\nFor\u00a0eight long years, people in\u00a0Donbass were subjected to\u00a0genocide, shelling and\u00a0blockades; in\u00a0Kherson and\u00a0Zaporozhye, a\u00a0criminal policy was pursued to\u00a0cultivate hatred for\u00a0Russia, for\u00a0everything Russian. Now too, during the\u00a0referendums, the\u00a0Kiev regime threatened schoolteachers, women who worked in\u00a0election commissions with reprisals and\u00a0death. Kiev threatened millions of\u00a0people who came to\u00a0express their will with repression. But the\u00a0people of\u00a0Donbass, Zaporozhye and\u00a0Kherson weren\u2019t broken, and\u00a0they had their say. \nI\u00a0want the\u00a0Kiev authorities and\u00a0their true handlers in\u00a0the\u00a0West to\u00a0hear me now, and\u00a0I\u00a0want everyone to\u00a0remember this: the\u00a0people living in\u00a0Lugansk and\u00a0Donetsk, in\u00a0Kherson and\u00a0Zaporozhye have become our citizens, forever. (Applause.)\nWe call on\u00a0the\u00a0Kiev regime to\u00a0immediately cease fire and\u00a0all hostilities; to\u00a0end the\u00a0war it unleashed back in\u00a02014 and\u00a0return to\u00a0the\u00a0negotiating table. We are ready for\u00a0this, as\u00a0we have said more than once. But the\u00a0choice of\u00a0the\u00a0people in\u00a0Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye and\u00a0Kherson will not be discussed. The\u00a0decision has been made, and\u00a0Russia will not betray it. (Applause.) Kiev\u2019s current authorities should respect this free expression of\u00a0the\u00a0people\u2019s will; there is no other way. This is the\u00a0only way to\u00a0peace. \nWe will defend our land with all the\u00a0forces and\u00a0resources we have, and\u00a0we will do everything we can to\u00a0ensure the\u00a0safety of\u00a0our people. This is the\u00a0great liberating mission of\u00a0our nation. \nWe will definitely rebuild the\u00a0destroyed cities and\u00a0towns, the\u00a0residential buildings, schools, hospitals, theatres and\u00a0museums. We will restore and\u00a0develop industrial enterprises, factories, infrastructure, as\u00a0well as\u00a0the\u00a0social security, pension, healthcare and\u00a0education systems. \nWe will certainly work to\u00a0improve the\u00a0level of\u00a0security. Together we will make sure that citizens in\u00a0the\u00a0new regions can feel the\u00a0support of\u00a0all the\u00a0people of\u00a0Russia, of\u00a0the\u00a0entire nation, all the\u00a0republics, territories and\u00a0regions of\u00a0our vast Motherland. (Applause.)\nFriends, colleagues,\nToday I\u00a0would like to\u00a0address our soldiers and\u00a0officers who are taking part in\u00a0the\u00a0special military operation, the\u00a0fighters of\u00a0Donbass and\u00a0Novorossiya, those who went to\u00a0military recruitment offices after receiving a\u00a0call-up paper under the\u00a0executive order on\u00a0partial mobilisation, and\u00a0those who did this voluntarily, answering the\u00a0call of\u00a0their hearts. I\u00a0would like to\u00a0address their parents, wives and\u00a0children, to\u00a0tell them what our people are fighting for, what kind of\u00a0enemy we are up against, and\u00a0who is pushing the\u00a0world into new wars and\u00a0crises and\u00a0deriving blood-stained benefits from this tragedy.\nOur compatriots, our brothers and\u00a0sisters in\u00a0Ukraine who are part of\u00a0our united people have seen with their own eyes what the\u00a0ruling class of\u00a0the\u00a0so-called West have prepared for\u00a0humanity as\u00a0a\u00a0whole. They have dropped their masks and\u00a0shown what they are really made of.\nWhen the\u00a0Soviet Union collapsed, the\u00a0West decided that the\u00a0world and\u00a0all of\u00a0us would permanently accede to\u00a0its dictates. In\u00a01991, the\u00a0West thought that Russia would never rise after such shocks and\u00a0would fall to\u00a0pieces on\u00a0its own. This almost happened. We remember the\u00a0horrible 1990s, hungry, cold and\u00a0hopeless. But Russia remained standing, came alive, grew stronger and\u00a0occupied its rightful place in\u00a0the\u00a0world.\nMeanwhile, the\u00a0West continued and\u00a0continues looking for\u00a0another chance to\u00a0strike a\u00a0blow at\u00a0us, to\u00a0weaken and\u00a0break up Russia, which they have always dreamed about, to\u00a0divide our state and\u00a0set our peoples against each other, and\u00a0to\u00a0condemn them to\u00a0poverty and\u00a0extinction. They cannot rest easy knowing that there is such a\u00a0great country with this huge territory in\u00a0the\u00a0world, with its natural wealth, resources and\u00a0people who cannot and\u00a0will not do someone else\u2019s bidding.\nThe\u00a0West is ready to\u00a0cross every line to\u00a0preserve the\u00a0neo-colonial system which allows it to\u00a0live off the\u00a0world, to\u00a0plunder it thanks to\u00a0the\u00a0domination of\u00a0the\u00a0dollar and\u00a0technology, to\u00a0collect an\u00a0actual tribute from humanity, to\u00a0extract its primary source of\u00a0unearned prosperity, the\u00a0rent paid to\u00a0the\u00a0hegemon. The\u00a0preservation of\u00a0this annuity is their main, real and\u00a0absolutely self-serving motivation. This is why total de-sovereignisation is in\u00a0their interest. This explains their aggression towards independent states, traditional values and\u00a0authentic cultures, their attempts to\u00a0undermine international and\u00a0integration processes, new global currencies and\u00a0technological development centres they cannot control. It is critically important for\u00a0them to\u00a0force all countries to\u00a0surrender their sovereignty to\u00a0the\u00a0United States. \nIn\u00a0certain countries, the\u00a0ruling elites voluntarily agree to\u00a0do this, voluntarily agree to\u00a0become vassals; others are bribed or\u00a0intimidated. And\u00a0if this does not work, they destroy entire states, leaving behind humanitarian disasters, devastation, ruins, millions of\u00a0wrecked and\u00a0mangled human lives, terrorist enclaves, social disaster zones, protectorates, colonies and\u00a0semi-colonies. They don't care. All they care about is their own benefit.\nI\u00a0want to\u00a0underscore again that their insatiability and\u00a0determination to\u00a0preserve their unfettered dominance are the\u00a0real causes of\u00a0the\u00a0hybrid war that the\u00a0collective West is waging against Russia. They do not want us to\u00a0be free; they want us to\u00a0be a\u00a0colony. They do not want equal cooperation; they want to\u00a0loot. They do not want to\u00a0see us a\u00a0free society, but a\u00a0mass of\u00a0soulless slaves. \nThey see our thought and\u00a0our philosophy as\u00a0a\u00a0direct threat. That is why they target our philosophers for\u00a0assassination. Our culture and\u00a0art present a\u00a0danger to\u00a0them, so they are trying to\u00a0ban them. Our development and\u00a0prosperity are also a\u00a0threat to\u00a0them because competition is growing. They do not want or\u00a0need Russia, but we do. (Applause.)\nI\u00a0would like to\u00a0remind you that in\u00a0the\u00a0past, ambitions of\u00a0world domination have repeatedly shattered against the\u00a0courage and\u00a0resilience of\u00a0our people. Russia will always be Russia. We will continue to\u00a0defend our values and\u00a0our Motherland. \nThe\u00a0West is counting on\u00a0impunity, on\u00a0being able to\u00a0get away with anything. As\u00a0a\u00a0matter of\u00a0fact, this was actually the\u00a0case until recently. Strategic security agreements have been trashed; agreements reached at\u00a0the\u00a0highest political level have been declared tall tales; firm promises not to\u00a0expand NATO to\u00a0the\u00a0east gave way to\u00a0dirty deception as\u00a0soon as\u00a0our former leaders bought into them; missile defence, intermediate-range and\u00a0shorter-range missile treaties have been unilaterally dismantled under far-fetched pretexts.\nAnd\u00a0all we hear is, the\u00a0West is insisting on\u00a0a\u00a0rules-based order. Where did that come from anyway? Who has ever seen these rules? Who agreed or\u00a0approved them? Listen, this is just a\u00a0lot of\u00a0nonsense, utter deceit, double standards, or\u00a0even triple standards! They must think we\u2019re stupid. \nRussia is a\u00a0great thousand-year-old power, a\u00a0whole civilisation, and\u00a0it is not going to\u00a0live by\u00a0such makeshift, false rules. (Applause.)\nIt was the\u00a0so-called West that trampled on\u00a0the\u00a0principle of\u00a0the\u00a0inviolability of\u00a0borders, and\u00a0now it is deciding, at\u00a0its own discretion, who has the\u00a0right to\u00a0self-determination and\u00a0who does not, who is unworthy of\u00a0it. It is unclear what their decisions are based on\u00a0or\u00a0who gave them the\u00a0right to\u00a0decide in\u00a0the\u00a0first place. They just assumed it.\nThat is why the\u00a0choice of\u00a0the\u00a0people in\u00a0Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye and\u00a0Kherson makes them so furiously angry. The\u00a0West does not have any moral right to\u00a0weigh in, or\u00a0even utter a\u00a0word about freedom of\u00a0democracy. It does not and\u00a0it never did.\nWestern elites not only deny national sovereignty and\u00a0international law. Their hegemony has pronounced features of\u00a0totalitarianism, despotism and\u00a0apartheid. They brazenly divide the\u00a0world into their vassals\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0so-called civilised countries\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0all the\u00a0rest, who, according to\u00a0the\u00a0designs of\u00a0today's Western racists, should be added to\u00a0the\u00a0list of\u00a0barbarians and\u00a0savages. False labels like \u201crogue country\u201d or\u00a0\u201cauthoritarian regime\u201d are already available, and\u00a0are used to\u00a0stigmatise entire nations and\u00a0states, which is nothing new. There is nothing new in\u00a0this: deep down, the\u00a0Western elites have remained the\u00a0same colonisers. They discriminate and\u00a0divide peoples into the\u00a0top tier and\u00a0the\u00a0rest. \nWe have never agreed to\u00a0and\u00a0will never agree to\u00a0such political nationalism and\u00a0racism. What else, if not racism, is the\u00a0Russophobia being spread around the\u00a0world? What, if not racism, is the\u00a0West\u2019s dogmatic conviction that its civilisation and\u00a0neoliberal culture is an\u00a0indisputable model for\u00a0the\u00a0entire world to\u00a0follow? \u201cYou\u2019re either with us or\u00a0against us.\u201d It even sounds strange.\nWestern elites are even shifting repentance for\u00a0their own historical crimes on\u00a0everyone else, demanding that the\u00a0citizens of\u00a0their countries and\u00a0other peoples confess to\u00a0things they have nothing to\u00a0do with at\u00a0all, for\u00a0example, the\u00a0period of\u00a0colonial conquests.\nIt is worth reminding the\u00a0West that it began its colonial policy back in\u00a0the\u00a0Middle Ages, followed by\u00a0the\u00a0worldwide slave trade, the\u00a0genocide of\u00a0Indian tribes in\u00a0America, the\u00a0plunder of\u00a0India and\u00a0Africa, the\u00a0wars of\u00a0England and\u00a0France against China, as\u00a0a\u00a0result of\u00a0which it was forced to\u00a0open its ports to\u00a0the\u00a0opium trade. What they did was get entire nations hooked on\u00a0drugs and\u00a0purposefully exterminated entire ethnic groups for\u00a0the\u00a0sake of\u00a0grabbing land and\u00a0resources, hunting people like animals. This is contrary to\u00a0human nature, truth, freedom and\u00a0justice.\nWhile we\u00a0\u2013 we are proud that in\u00a0the\u00a020th century our country led the\u00a0anti-colonial movement, which opened up opportunities for\u00a0many peoples around the\u00a0world to\u00a0make progress, reduce poverty and\u00a0inequality, and\u00a0defeat hunger and\u00a0disease.\nTo\u00a0emphasise, one of\u00a0the\u00a0reasons for\u00a0the\u00a0centuries-old Russophobia, the\u00a0Western elites\u2019 unconcealed animosity toward Russia is precisely the\u00a0fact that we did not allow them to\u00a0rob us during the\u00a0period of\u00a0colonial conquests and\u00a0forced the\u00a0Europeans to\u00a0trade with us on\u00a0mutually beneficial terms. This was achieved by\u00a0creating a\u00a0strong centralised state in\u00a0Russia, which grew and\u00a0got stronger based on\u00a0the\u00a0great moral values \u200b\u200bof\u00a0Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism and\u00a0Buddhism, as\u00a0well as\u00a0Russian culture and\u00a0the\u00a0Russian word that were open to\u00a0all.\nThere were numerous plans to\u00a0invade Russia. Such attempts were made during the\u00a0Time of\u00a0Troubles in\u00a0the\u00a017th century and\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0period of\u00a0ordeals after the\u00a01917 revolution. All of\u00a0them failed. The\u00a0West managed to\u00a0grab hold of\u00a0Russia\u2019s wealth only in\u00a0the\u00a0late 20th century, when the\u00a0state had been destroyed. They called us friends and\u00a0partners, but they treated us like a\u00a0colony, using various schemes to\u00a0pump trillions of\u00a0dollars out of\u00a0the\u00a0country. We remember. We have not forgotten anything.\nA\u00a0few days ago, people in\u00a0Donetsk and\u00a0Lugansk, Kherson and\u00a0Zaporozhye declared their support for\u00a0restoring our historical unity. Thank you! (Applause.)\nWestern countries have been saying for\u00a0centuries that they bring freedom and\u00a0democracy to\u00a0other nations. Nothing could be further from the\u00a0truth. Instead of\u00a0bringing democracy they suppressed and\u00a0exploited, and\u00a0instead of\u00a0giving freedom they enslaved and\u00a0oppressed. The\u00a0unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and\u00a0unfree; it is false and\u00a0hypocritical through and\u00a0through.\nThe\u00a0United States is the\u00a0only country in\u00a0the\u00a0world that has used nuclear weapons twice, destroying the\u00a0cities of\u00a0Hiroshima and\u00a0Nagasaki in\u00a0Japan. And\u00a0they created a\u00a0precedent.\nRecall that during WWII the\u00a0United States and\u00a0Britain reduced Dresden, Hamburg, Cologne and\u00a0many other German cities to\u00a0rubble, without the\u00a0least military necessity. It was done ostentatiously and, to\u00a0repeat, without any military necessity. They had only one goal, as\u00a0with the\u00a0nuclear bombing of\u00a0Japanese cities: to\u00a0intimidate our country and\u00a0the\u00a0rest of\u00a0the\u00a0world.\nThe\u00a0United States left a\u00a0deep scar in\u00a0the\u00a0memory of\u00a0the\u00a0people of\u00a0Korea and\u00a0Vietnam with their carpet bombings and\u00a0use of\u00a0napalm and\u00a0chemical weapons.\nIt actually continues to\u00a0occupy Germany, Japan, the\u00a0Republic of\u00a0Korea and\u00a0other countries, which they cynically refer to\u00a0as\u00a0equals and\u00a0allies. Look now, what kind of\u00a0alliance is that? The\u00a0whole world knows that the\u00a0top officials in\u00a0these countries are being spied on\u00a0and\u00a0that their offices and\u00a0homes are bugged. It is a\u00a0disgrace, a\u00a0disgrace for\u00a0those who do this and\u00a0for\u00a0those who, like slaves, silently and\u00a0meekly swallow this arrogant behaviour.\nThey call the\u00a0orders and\u00a0threats they make to\u00a0their vassals Euro-Atlantic solidarity, and\u00a0the\u00a0creation of\u00a0biological weapons and\u00a0the\u00a0use of\u00a0human test subjects, including in\u00a0Ukraine, noble medical research.\nIt is their destructive policies, wars and\u00a0plunder that have unleashed today\u2019s massive wave of\u00a0migrants. Millions of\u00a0people endure hardships and\u00a0humiliation or\u00a0die by\u00a0the\u00a0thousands trying to\u00a0reach Europe.\nThey are exporting grain from Ukraine now. Where are they taking it under the\u00a0guise of\u00a0ensuring the\u00a0food security of\u00a0the\u00a0poorest countries? Where is it going? They are taking it to\u00a0the\u00a0self-same European countries. Only five percent has been delivered to\u00a0the\u00a0poorest countries. More cheating and\u00a0naked deception again.\nIn\u00a0effect, the\u00a0American elite is using the\u00a0tragedy of\u00a0these people to\u00a0weaken its rivals, to\u00a0destroy nation states. This goes for\u00a0Europe and\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0identities of\u00a0France, Italy, Spain and\u00a0other countries with centuries-long histories. \nWashington demands more and\u00a0more sanctions against Russia and\u00a0the\u00a0majority of\u00a0European politicians obediently go along with it. They clearly understand that by\u00a0pressuring the\u00a0EU to\u00a0completely give up Russian energy and\u00a0other resources, the\u00a0United States is practically pushing Europe toward deindustrialisation in\u00a0a\u00a0bid to\u00a0get its hands on\u00a0the\u00a0entire European market. These European elites understand everything\u00a0\u2013 they do, but they prefer to\u00a0serve the\u00a0interests of\u00a0others. This is no longer servility but direct betrayal of\u00a0their own peoples. God bless, it is up to\u00a0them. \nBut the\u00a0Anglo-Saxons believe sanctions are no longer enough and\u00a0now they have turned to\u00a0subversion. It seems incredible but it is a\u00a0fact\u00a0\u2013 by\u00a0causing explosions on\u00a0Nord Stream\u2019s international gas pipelines passing along the\u00a0bottom of\u00a0the\u00a0Baltic Sea, they have actually embarked on\u00a0the\u00a0destruction of\u00a0Europe\u2019s entire energy infrastructure. It is clear to\u00a0everyone who stands to\u00a0gain. Those who benefit are responsible, of\u00a0course.\nThe\u00a0dictates of\u00a0the\u00a0US are backed up by\u00a0crude force, on\u00a0the\u00a0law of\u00a0the\u00a0fist. Sometimes it is beautifully wrapped sometimes there is no wrapping at\u00a0all but the\u00a0gist is the\u00a0same\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0law of\u00a0the\u00a0fist. Hence, the\u00a0deployment and\u00a0maintenance of\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0military bases in\u00a0all corners of\u00a0the\u00a0world, NATO expansion, and\u00a0attempts to\u00a0cobble together new military alliances, such as\u00a0AUKUS and\u00a0the\u00a0like. Much is being done to\u00a0create a\u00a0Washington-Seoul-Tokyo military-political chain. All states that possess or\u00a0aspire to\u00a0genuine strategic sovereignty and\u00a0are capable of\u00a0challenging Western hegemony, are automatically declared enemies.\nThese are the\u00a0principles that underlie US and\u00a0NATO military doctrines that require total domination. Western elites are presenting their neocolonialist plans with the\u00a0same hypocrisy, claiming peaceful intentions, talking about some kind of\u00a0deterrence. This evasive word migrates from one strategy to\u00a0another but really only means one thing\u00a0\u2013 undermining any and\u00a0all sovereign centres of\u00a0power.\nWe have already heard about the\u00a0deterrence of\u00a0Russia, China and\u00a0Iran. I\u00a0believe next in\u00a0line are other countries of\u00a0Asia, Latin America, Africa and\u00a0the\u00a0Middle East, as\u00a0well as\u00a0current US partners and\u00a0allies. After all, we know that when they are displeased, they introduce sanctions against their allies as\u00a0well\u00a0\u2013 against this or\u00a0that bank or\u00a0company. This is their practice and\u00a0they will expand it. They have everything in\u00a0their sights, including our next-door neighbours\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0CIS countries.\nAt\u00a0the\u00a0same time, the\u00a0West has clearly been engaged in\u00a0wishful thinking for\u00a0a\u00a0long time. In\u00a0launching the\u00a0sanctions blitzkrieg against Russia, for\u00a0example, they thought that they could once again line up the\u00a0whole world at\u00a0their command. As\u00a0it turns out, however, such a\u00a0bright prospect does not excite everyone\u00a0\u2013 other than complete political masochists and\u00a0admirers of\u00a0other unconventional forms of\u00a0international relations. Most states refuse to\u00a0\u201dsnap a\u00a0salute\u201c and\u00a0instead choose the\u00a0sensible path of\u00a0cooperation with Russia.\nThe\u00a0West clearly did not expect such insubordination. They simply got used to\u00a0acting according to\u00a0a\u00a0template, to\u00a0grab whatever they please, by\u00a0blackmail, bribery, intimidation, and\u00a0convinced themselves that these methods would work forever, as\u00a0if they had fossilised in\u00a0the\u00a0past.\nSuch self-confidence is a\u00a0direct product not only of\u00a0the\u00a0notorious concept of\u00a0exceptionalism\u00a0\u2013 although it never ceases to\u00a0amaze\u00a0\u2013 but also of\u00a0the\u00a0real \u201dinformation hunger\u201c in\u00a0the\u00a0West. The\u00a0truth has been drowned in\u00a0an\u00a0ocean of\u00a0myths, illusions and\u00a0fakes, using extremely aggressive propaganda, lying like Goebbels. The\u00a0more unbelievable the\u00a0lie, the\u00a0quicker people will believe it\u00a0\u2013 that is how they operate, according to\u00a0this principle.\nBut people cannot be fed with printed dollars and\u00a0euros. You can't feed them with those pieces of\u00a0paper, and\u00a0the\u00a0virtual, inflated capitalisation of\u00a0western social media companies can't heat their homes. Everything I\u00a0am saying is important. And\u00a0what I\u00a0just said is no less so: you can't feed anyone with paper\u00a0\u2013 you need food; and\u00a0you can't heat anyone\u2019s home with these inflated capitalisations\u00a0\u2013 you need energy.\nThat is why politicians in\u00a0Europe have to\u00a0convince their fellow citizens to\u00a0eat less, take a\u00a0shower less often and\u00a0dress warmer at\u00a0home. And\u00a0those who start asking fair questions like \u201cWhy is that, in\u00a0fact?\u201d are immediately declared enemies, extremists and\u00a0radicals. They point back at\u00a0Russia and\u00a0say: that is the\u00a0source of\u00a0all your troubles. More lies. \nI\u00a0want to\u00a0make special note of\u00a0the\u00a0fact that there is every reason to\u00a0believe that the\u00a0Western elites are not going to\u00a0look for\u00a0constructive ways out of\u00a0the\u00a0global food and\u00a0energy crisis that they and\u00a0they alone are to\u00a0blame for, as\u00a0a\u00a0result of\u00a0their long-term policy, dating back long before our special military operation in\u00a0Ukraine, in\u00a0Donbass. They have no intention of\u00a0solving the\u00a0problems of\u00a0injustice and\u00a0inequality. I\u00a0am afraid they would rather use other formulas they are more comfortable with.\nAnd\u00a0here it is important to\u00a0recall that the\u00a0West bailed itself out of\u00a0its early 20th century challenges with World War I. Profits from World War II helped the\u00a0United States finally overcome the\u00a0Great Depression and\u00a0become the\u00a0largest economy in\u00a0the\u00a0world, and\u00a0to\u00a0impose on\u00a0the\u00a0planet the\u00a0power of\u00a0the\u00a0dollar as\u00a0a\u00a0global reserve currency. And\u00a0the\u00a01980s crisis\u00a0\u2013 things came to\u00a0a\u00a0head in\u00a0the\u00a01980s again\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0West emerged from it unscathed largely by\u00a0appropriating the\u00a0inheritance and\u00a0resources of\u00a0the\u00a0collapsed and\u00a0defunct Soviet Union. That's a\u00a0fact.\nNow, in\u00a0order to\u00a0free itself from the\u00a0latest web of\u00a0challenges, they need to\u00a0dismantle Russia as\u00a0well as\u00a0other states that choose a\u00a0sovereign path of\u00a0development, at\u00a0all costs, to\u00a0be able to\u00a0further plunder other nations\u2019 wealth and\u00a0use it to\u00a0patch their own holes. If this does not happen, I\u00a0cannot rule out that they will try to\u00a0trigger a\u00a0collapse of\u00a0the\u00a0entire system, and\u00a0blame everything on\u00a0that, or, God forbid, decide to\u00a0use the\u00a0old formula of\u00a0economic growth through war. \nRussia is aware of\u00a0its responsibility to\u00a0the\u00a0international community and\u00a0will make every effort to\u00a0ensure that cooler heads prevail. \nThe\u00a0current neocolonial model is ultimately doomed; this much is obvious. But I\u00a0repeat that its real masters will cling to\u00a0it to\u00a0the\u00a0end. They simply have nothing to\u00a0offer the\u00a0world except to\u00a0maintain the\u00a0same system of\u00a0plundering and\u00a0racketeering.\nThey do not give a\u00a0damn about the\u00a0natural right of\u00a0billions of\u00a0people, the\u00a0majority of\u00a0humanity, to\u00a0freedom and\u00a0justice, the\u00a0right to\u00a0determine their own future. They have already moved on\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0radical denial of\u00a0moral, religious, and\u00a0family values.\nLet\u2019s answer some very simple questions for\u00a0ourselves. Now I\u00a0would like to\u00a0return to\u00a0what I\u00a0said and\u00a0want to\u00a0address also all citizens of\u00a0the\u00a0country\u00a0\u2013 not just the\u00a0colleagues that are in\u00a0the\u00a0hall\u00a0\u2013 but all citizens of\u00a0Russia: do we want to\u00a0have here, in\u00a0our country, in\u00a0Russia, \u201cparent number one, parent number two and\u00a0parent number three\u201d (they have completely lost it!) instead of\u00a0mother and\u00a0father? Do we want our schools to\u00a0impose on\u00a0our children, from their earliest days in\u00a0school, perversions that lead to\u00a0degradation and\u00a0extinction? Do we want to\u00a0drum into their heads the\u00a0ideas that certain other genders exist along with women and\u00a0men and\u00a0to\u00a0offer them gender reassignment surgery? Is that what we want for\u00a0our country and\u00a0our children? This is all unacceptable to\u00a0us. We have a\u00a0different future of\u00a0our own. \nLet me repeat that the\u00a0dictatorship of\u00a0the\u00a0Western elites targets all societies, including the\u00a0citizens of\u00a0Western countries themselves. This is a\u00a0challenge to\u00a0all. This complete renunciation of\u00a0what it means to\u00a0be human, the\u00a0overthrow of\u00a0faith and\u00a0traditional values, and\u00a0the\u00a0suppression of\u00a0freedom are coming to\u00a0resemble a\u00a0\u201creligion in\u00a0reverse\u201d\u00a0\u2013 pure Satanism. Exposing false messiahs, Jesus Christ said in\u00a0the\u00a0Sermon on\u00a0the\u00a0Mount: \u201cBy\u00a0their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d These poisonous fruits are already obvious to\u00a0people, and\u00a0not only in\u00a0our country but also in\u00a0all countries, including many people in\u00a0the\u00a0West itself.\nThe\u00a0world has entered a\u00a0period of\u00a0a\u00a0fundamental, revolutionary transformation. New centres of\u00a0power are emerging. They represent the\u00a0majority\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0majority!\u00a0\u2013 of\u00a0the\u00a0international community. They are ready not only to\u00a0declare their interests but also to\u00a0protect them. They see in\u00a0multipolarity an\u00a0opportunity to\u00a0strengthen their sovereignty, which means gaining genuine freedom, historical prospects, and\u00a0the\u00a0right to\u00a0their own independent, creative and\u00a0distinctive forms of\u00a0development, to\u00a0a\u00a0harmonious process.\nAs\u00a0I\u00a0have already said, we have many like-minded people in\u00a0Europe and\u00a0the\u00a0United States, and\u00a0we feel and\u00a0see their support. An\u00a0essentially emancipatory, anti-colonial movement against unipolar hegemony is taking shape in\u00a0the\u00a0most diverse countries and\u00a0societies. Its power will only grow with time. It is this force that will determine our future geopolitical reality.\nFriends,\nToday, we are fighting for\u00a0a\u00a0just and\u00a0free path, first of\u00a0all for\u00a0ourselves, for\u00a0Russia, in\u00a0order to\u00a0leave dictate and\u00a0despotism in\u00a0the\u00a0past. I\u00a0am convinced that countries and\u00a0peoples understand that a\u00a0policy based on\u00a0the\u00a0exceptionalism of\u00a0whoever it may be and\u00a0the\u00a0suppression of\u00a0other cultures and\u00a0peoples is inherently criminal, and\u00a0that we must close this shameful chapter. The\u00a0ongoing collapse of\u00a0Western hegemony is irreversible. And\u00a0I\u00a0repeat: things will never be the\u00a0same.\nThe\u00a0battlefield to\u00a0which destiny and\u00a0history have called us is a\u00a0battlefield for\u00a0our people, for\u00a0the\u00a0great historical Russia. (Applause.) For\u00a0the\u00a0great historical Russia, for\u00a0future generations, our children, grandchildren and\u00a0great-grandchildren. We must protect them against enslavement and\u00a0monstrous experiments that are designed to\u00a0cripple their minds and\u00a0souls.\nToday, we are fighting so that it would never occur to\u00a0anyone that Russia, our people, our language, or\u00a0our culture can be erased from history. Today, we need a\u00a0consolidated society, and\u00a0this consolidation can only be based on\u00a0sovereignty, freedom, creation, and\u00a0justice. Our values \u200b\u200bare humanity, mercy and\u00a0compassion.\nAnd\u00a0I\u00a0want to\u00a0close with the\u00a0words of\u00a0a\u00a0true patriot Ivan Ilyin: \u201cIf I\u00a0consider Russia my\u00a0Motherland, that means that I\u00a0love as\u00a0a\u00a0Russian, contemplate and\u00a0think, sing and\u00a0speak as\u00a0a\u00a0Russian; that I\u00a0believe in\u00a0the\u00a0spiritual strength of\u00a0the\u00a0Russian people. Its spirit is my\u00a0spirit; its destiny is my\u00a0destiny; its suffering is my\u00a0grief; and\u00a0its prosperity is my\u00a0joy.\u201d\nBehind these words stands a\u00a0glorious spiritual choice, which, for\u00a0more than a\u00a0thousand years of\u00a0Russian statehood, was followed by\u00a0many generations of\u00a0our ancestors. Today, we are making this choice; the\u00a0citizens of\u00a0the\u00a0Donetsk and\u00a0Lugansk people's republics and\u00a0the\u00a0residents of\u00a0the\u00a0Zaporozhye and\u00a0Kherson regions have made this choice. They made the\u00a0choice to\u00a0be with their people, to\u00a0be with their Motherland, to\u00a0share in\u00a0its destiny, and\u00a0to\u00a0be victorious together with it.\nThe\u00a0truth is with us, and\u00a0behind us is Russia!\n (Applause.)","question":"Which four regions did Russia annex in September 2022?","answer":"Russia annexed the Donetsk People's Republic, the Lugansk People's Republic, the Zaporozhye Region, and the Kherson Region.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0456 \u0447\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0456 2022 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0430\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0443, \u041b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0443, \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0437\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0430 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer lists the same four regions as the expected answer, albeit in a slightly different format (omitting '\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0443' for Donetsk and Luhansk and using '\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456' instead of '\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c' for Zaporizhzhia and Kherson).

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Russian-installed officials in occupied regions of Ukraine reported huge majorities on Tuesday in favour of becoming part of Russia after five days of voting in so-called referendums that Kyiv and the West denounced as a sham. Hastily arranged votes had taken place in four areas - the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and to the south Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - that make up about 15% of Ukrainian territory. Sign up here. Luhansk authorities said 98.4% of people there had voted to join Russia. In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian-appointed official put the figure at 93.1%. In Kherson, the head of the voting committee put the \"yes\" vote at above 87%. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said 99.2% of participants in the region had voted to join Russia. All four areas said all ballots had been counted. Within the occupied territories, Russian-installed officials took ballot boxes from house to house in what Ukraine and the West said was an illegitimate, coercive exercise to create a legal pretext for Russia to annex the four regions. Russian President Vladimir Putin could then portray any Ukrainian attempt to recapture them as an attack on Russia itself. He said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend the \"territorial integrity\" of Russia. Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, posted a brief celebratory message on Telegram. \"The referendums are over,\" he said. \"The results are clear. Welcome home, to Russia!\" Displaced people from the four regions were able to cast votes in Russia, where state news agency RIA said early counts showed numbers in excess of 96% in favour of coming under Moscow's rule. UKRAINE: ANNEXATION WILL DESTROY PEACE TALKS Ukraine has repeatedly warned that Russian annexation of territories would destroy any chance of peace talks, seven months after Russia invaded its neighbour. It says Ukrainians who helped Russia organise the votes will face treason charges. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the European Union to impose further economic sanctions on Russia to punish it for staging the votes, which he said would not change Ukraine's actions on the battlefield. The votes mirrored a referendum in Crimea after Russia's seizure of the southern peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, when Crimea's leaders declared a 97% vote to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. Putin said on state TV on Tuesday that the votes were designed to protect people from what he has called the persecution of ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers by Ukraine, something the Kyiv government has denied. \"Saving people in all the territories where this referendum is being held is at the top of our minds and the focus of attention of our entire society and country,\" he said. Moscow has acted in recent months to \"Russify\" areas under its control, including by issuing people with Russian passports and rewriting school curriculums. The referendums were hurriedly brought forward this month after Ukraine seized the momentum on the battlefield by routing Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Valentina Matviyenko, head of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said that if the vote results were favourable, it could consider the incorporation of the four regions on Oct. 4, three days before Putin celebrates his 70th birthday.

Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times By Marc Santora Dec. 2, 2022 KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for lawmakers to prevent the branch of Orthodox Christianity that answers to Moscow from operating in Ukraine, taking aim at a powerful cultural force that Ukrainian officials accuse of abetting the Russian invasion. His administration will draft a law \u201cmaking it impossible for religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation to operate in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said late Thursday in his nightly video address . In addition, he directed the government to conduct an inquiry into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its ties to Moscow, \u201cand, if necessary, to take measures provided for by law.\u201d But he did not elaborate on how a new law would work \u2014 whether, for example, the church would be judged as one or parish by parish \u2014 and how it would be enforced. Several religious and legal scholars said it could face legal challenges, and without seeing more detail, they were not sure how the government would proceed. Mr. Zelensky\u2019s plans may be popular with an increasingly anti-Russian populace after months of Russian bombardment, but they raise hard questions about what it means to be a collaborator in a nation at war, and how a ban on the church would square with freedom of religion under the Ukrainian Constitution.

Lynsey Addario for The New York Times For centuries the ancient Ukrainian branch of the church has been subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church , based in Moscow. The leader of the Russian church, Patriarch Kirill, has strong ties to President Vladimir V. Putin, whose long tenure he has called \u201c a miracle of God ,\u201d and has endorsed the invasion.

The service did not name the man, who it said was chief of staff of its anti-terrorism centre, but Ukrainian media quoting sources in the SBU say he is Col Dmytro Kozyura. Local media showed him handcuffed while being arrested by SBU head Vasyl Malyuk. A statement said there were at least 14 instances in which the suspect, who it described as a \"rat\", had collected and transmitted information to Russia.  The SBU said the investigation involved audio and video monitoring, as well as gaining access to mobile phones and computers. Since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has announced numerous operations to expose Russian agents on its soil. Malyuk had been personally involved in the investigation into the suspect and headed the operation to arrest him, the SBU statement said, adding that he reported directly on its progress to President Volodymyr Zelensky. It said Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) recruited him in Vienna in 2018. He was \"mothballed\" for several years and his handlers only resumed contact with him last December. One killed in ballistic missile attack on Kyiv, Ukraine says Hegseth says return to Ukraine's 2014 borders 'unrealistic' Kremlin says Russian citizen released in US after Trump greets freed teacher \"Thanks to encrypted programme bookmarks, we got into the traitor's gadgets - mobile terminals, computers,\" Malyuk said in a video statement posted on the SBU website. \"We basically lived with him, conducted audio and video monitoring.

{"year":"2025","month":"01","event_desc":"11 January  Ukraine announces the capture of two North Korean soldiers during fighting in Russia's Kursk Oblast.","text":"Wounded soldiers taken to Kyiv for questioning by Ukrainian investigators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence. Ukraine says it has captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia\u2019s Kursk region and taken them to Kyiv, where investigators were questioning them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the two prisoners of war were \u201ccommunicating\u201d with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency. \u201cRussian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea\u2019s involvement in the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on Saturday. Ukraine\u2019s SBU said in a statement that one of the captured soldiers had no documents at all, while the other had been carrying a Russian military ID card in the name of a man from Tuva, a Russian region bordering Mongolia. \u201cThe prisoners do not speak Ukrainian, English or Russian, so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence,\u201d the statement said. According to the SBU, one of the soldiers claimed he had been told he was going to Russia for training, rather than to fight against Ukraine. The agency said both men were provided with medical care in line with the Geneva Conventions. Ukraine did not provide evidence that the captured soldiers were from North Korea. Kyiv has repeatedly said North Korean troops are fighting in the Kursk region, where it launched an incursion\u00a0in August, claiming control over several hundred square kilometres of territory. However, this is the first time that the country\u2019s intelligence services said they have had the opportunity to question North Korean soldiers. While Ukraine had previously claimed to have captured North Korean soldiers in combat, it said they had been badly wounded and died shortly afterwards. Last month, a senior Ukrainian military official claimed that some 200 North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk had been killed or wounded in battle. The estimate of North Korean casualties came weeks after Ukraine announced that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 to 12,000 soldiers to Russia to help it in its almost three-year war against its much smaller neighbour. The\u00a0White House and Pentagon\u00a0last month confirmed that the North Korean forces have been battling on the front lines in largely infantry positions.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"US president Donald Trump announces the beginning of negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine following a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin.","text":"Ukraine war talks start now, Trump says after Putin call 13 February 2025 Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr, at the White House, and Mike Wendling BBC News James Waterhouse Ukraine correspondent Share Save Reuters US President Donald Trump has said he had a \"lengthy and highly productive\"  phone call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he and the Russian president had \"agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately\". Later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had spoken with Trump about a \"lasting, reliable peace\". The calls with the warring sides came as both Trump and his defence secretary said it was unlikely Ukraine would join Nato, which will come as a bitter disappointment to Kyiv. On Thursday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces. Earlier, Trump wrote on social media: \"It is time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION. God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!\" He did not set a date for a face-to-face meeting with Putin, but later told reporters at the White House: \"We'll meet in Saudi Arabia.\" He wrote on social media the pair had also invited each other to their respective capitals. Zelensky said he would meet Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a defence summit on Ukraine in Munich on Friday. Follow live updates on this story Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin supported Trump's idea that the time had come to work together. The phone call between Putin and Trump lasted nearly an hour-and-a-half, during which the Russian president extended an invitation to visit Moscow, Peskov said. Trump also told reporters at the White House that it was unlikely Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said \"some of that land will come back\". The president said he agreed with Hegseth, who told a Nato summit earlier on Wednesday that there was no likelihood of Ukraine joining the military alliance. Speaking to reporters ahead of the defence meeting in Brussels on Thursday, Hegseth said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a \"factory reset\" for Nato which signalled the alliance needed to be \"robust\", \"strong\" and \"real\". Hegseth said the US had made an \"incredible commitment\" to Nato and reiterated calls for fellow members to increase defence spending. He added that no country had shown a larger commitment to Ukraine than the US. On Wednesday, seven European countries including Britain, France and Germany insisted they be part of any future negotiations on Ukraine's fate. \"Our shared objectives should be to put Ukraine in a position of strength,\" read the joint statement released after a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris. \"Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations.\" They called for strong security guarantees for Ukraine and said they were looking forward to discussing the way forward with their American allies. Watch: BBC reporter asks Trump about a return to pre-2014 Ukraine borders While it has long been known the new US administration would be less sympathetic to Ukraine than its predecessor, the words from Trump and his defence secretary will have only pleased Moscow. Zelensky has repeatedly argued there \"can be no talks on Ukraine without Ukraine\" - but the Trump-Putin phone call proved otherwise. Western help \u2013 and the Ukrainian forces who benefitted from it \u2013 are the reason Kyiv did not fall within days of Russia's invasion, as was expected by some. But the road to a \"just peace\", as Zelensky puts it, is neither going to be straight nor smooth for Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said his own call with Trump had been a \"good and detailed discussion\" about a variety of issues, and that he had also met US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is visiting Kyiv. \"No one wants peace more than Ukraine. Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace,\" Zelensky wrote. The Ukrainian leader added: \"We agreed to maintain further contact and plan upcoming meetings.\" Trump offers Putin a way back in from the cold Hegseth sets out hard line on European defence and Nato What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member? Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast on Thursday she was \"concerned\" by Trump's conversation with Putin because the end of the Russian leader's \"isolation\" would give the \"illusion\" he wanted peace. \"How do we know that Putin really wants peace and wants to negotiate, and then who or what will make sure that Putin will keep his part of the bargain?\" she asked. Asked if she could conceive of Ukraine agreeing to a settlement that would concede territory to Russia, Rudik said: \"We will not give up on our territories.\" \"However, we may, as President Zelensky said, delay our goal to regain them.\" In an interview with The Guardian published on Tuesday, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for Ukrainian-held territory in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. Putin's spokesman Peskov said this was \"impossible\". \"Russia has never discussed and will not discuss the exchange of its territory. Ukrainian units will be expelled from this territory. All who are not destroyed will be expelled.\" Zelensky also insisted that the US, and not just European countries, would need to be part of any security package for his country. \"Security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees,\" he said. Separately, Trump said that at \"some point you're going to have an election\" in Ukraine, in what was seen as a reference to the expiry of Zelensky's presidential term in May 2024. Zelensky says the continuing Russian invasion and martial law in Ukraine make it impossible to hold a new presidential election. Russia's Putin has repeatedly questioned Zelensky's legitimacy to hold any negotiations with Moscow. Meanwhile, fighting between Russia and Ukraine has continued overnight. Ukraine's air force said there had been 140 drone attacks, starting on Wednesday evening in the Odesa and Kharkiv regions - 85 of which had been shot down. Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in  bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine. The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. Moscow's attempts to take control of the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have taken around one-fifth of Ukraine's territory in the east and south, and have carried out air strikes across the country. Ukraine has retaliated with artillery and drone strikes, as well as a ground offensive against Russia's western Kursk region. Accurate casualty counts are hard to come by due to secrecy by both the Russian and Ukrainian governments, but it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees.

{"year":"2025","month":"01","event_desc":"Ukraine becomes a state party in the International Criminal Court.","text":"Ukraine becomes ICC member state Exclusive 01.01.2025 11:50 Ukrinform On January 1, 2025, Ukraine became the 125th state to join the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and, starting that date, will have the same rights as other member states, meaning it will be a full member of the ICC, including the ability to participate in elections, propose amendments, and more. As reported by a Ukrinform correspondent in The Hague, a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag was installed among the flags of the member states at the court\u2019s building. \u201cToday, the Rome Statute enters into force for Ukraine...That means that now Ukraine is fully a state party to this international treaty. And as a state party, it has all the rights and obligations that are attached to the states parties. The most important of them, potentially, are the rights to vote for the adoption of the budget, for adoption of amendments to the Rome Statute, for the elections of the judges, and of the future prosecutor and deputy prosecutors, which, to some extent, helps shape the future of international criminal law,\u201d said ICC Spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah in an exclusive comment to Ukrinform. He expressed hope that Ukraine\u2019s example would inspire other countries. \u201cWe hope that this new ratification will also open the door for others to follow that this is a sign of faith that Ukraine is given to the ICC and that others would see it as such and will also participate in getting us closer to this dream of universality of the Rome Statute, where all the states would be united in this global fight against impunity, and for the fight to build a more just world,\u201d the Spokesperson said. Read also: Ukraine to become full member of ICC Assembly starting Jan 1, 2025 In response to a question about a Ukrainian judge at the ICC, Fadi El Abdallah said: \u201cIt is totally possible for Ukraine as a state party to present candidates. And then, there would be subject to the vote of the Assembly. There are specific requirements for judges at the ICC. Specific experience in terms of either international law or criminal law, and of course, being, qualified for the highest judicial positions in their own respective countries. And then, also there is every three years election of six judges at the ICC. So of course, we hope that Ukraine will be participating in all the various possibilities of cooperation and supporting the ICC, including with presenting candidates for judges and also with having more colleagues from Ukraine.\u201d According to the Spokesperson, among the requirements for judges is fluency in at least one of the ICC\u2019s two official languages: English or French. Knowing both languages is an advantage, but it is essential to know at least one of them, as these are the working languages of the ICC. Fadi El Abdallah noted that it is important to understand that \u201cthe ICC does not have cases against the states, but it's always about individual responsibility for alleged crimes. Now, who can make the accusations or bring the charges against suspects? It's not the states. It's actually the ICC prosecutor. What states parties can do is make referrals of a certain conflict or certain amount of crimes to the prosecutor, and then the ICC prosecutor can decide to open an investigation and check which crimes actually fall under the ICC jurisdiction and, based on the evidence that are there, decides to bring charges, meaning to ask the judges to issue either arrest warrants or summons to appear. So it is for the ICC prosecutor to decide on that. We know very well that there is already an investigation opened in relation to Ukraine, but I just want to highlight that it's not the states that bring cases, it's the prosecutor who can decide to do that. But of course, the cooperation of all the states is very important because it allows the prosecutor to gather the evidence in a more efficient and a faster way, of course.\u201d Read also: Ukraine hands over document on joining ICC to UN depository He also stated that \u201cUkraine had in the past accepted the ICC jurisdiction. And based on that, there was an investigation that is currently open and it continues. So within this investigation, the prosecutor has brought several cases and he's still ongoing with the investigations and maybe other cases and other charges will be brought by the ICC prosecutor. Ukraine ratification does not necessarily mean that we have to open a new investigation.\u201d According to him, after ratification, Ukraine also has new obligations, such as financial participation in the budget formation. The Spokesperson also clarified that the ICC\u2019s budget is approved by the Assembly of states parties, taking into account the size of the economy and population of each country. \u201cThe budget of the ICC is adopted by the Assembly, at a whole. So we have 125 states, with Ukraine that would adopt the budget. The budget is roughly around \u20ac190 million, more or less. And the burden of the budget is divided on all the states, but within a certain proportion, because it's based on the same formula like the United Nations, meaning that it takes into account the size of the economy and the population of the country,\u201d he said. As reported by Ukrinform, Ukraine has submitted a document to the UN regarding its accession to the Rome Statute.","question":"When did Ukraine become a full member of the International Criminal Court?","answer":"Ukraine became a full member of the International Criminal Court on January 1, 2025.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443 1 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u044f 2025 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0454 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0420\u0438\u043c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0443 2000 \u0440\u043e\u0446\u0456, \u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0456 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0456\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430.","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The expected answer states that Ukraine became a full member of the International Criminal Court on January 1, 2025.

The announcement came days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president with skepticism of America\u2019s military burden in Europe and what he says is a plan to end the continent\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II. \u201cWe are with you not just today or tomorrow, for this year or the next, but for 100 years \u2014 long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again,\u201d Starmer told Zelenskyy during a visit to Kyiv, promising that the U.K. would \u201cplay our part\u201d in guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s post-war security . Starmer said that the landmark century-long agreement commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country. Ukraine\u2019s alignment with the West, and potential future membership in NATO , have angered Russian President Vladimir Putin , who still wants to exert influence over the independent nation. RELATED COVERAGE Crimea is a focus of discussions to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so coveted In rare criticism of Putin, Trump urges the Russian leader to \u2018STOP!\u2019 after a deadly attack on Kyiv Photos: Kyiv pummeled by deadly Russian drone and missile strikes While Starmer was meeting with Zelenskyy at the presidential palace, debris from Russian drones shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defenses fell in at least four districts of Kyiv, according to city administration chief Tymur Tkachenko. One was close to the Baroque presidential palace where the two men met. Starmer said that the drones were \u201ca reminder\u201d of what the Ukrainian people are up against and their resolve. Starmer\u2019s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July, though he said that it was his seventh meeting with Zelenskyy. The Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany\u2019s defense minister visited and three days after Zelenskyy talked by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron. The flurry of diplomatic activity came in the days leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing U.S. administration\u2019s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated that he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine. Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the full-scale invasion , which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Ukrainians worry that Trump\u2019s plan will demand unpalatable concessions, such as giving up territory. Zelenskyy has also said that he wants security guarantees to deter Russia from invading again in the future. \u201cWe must look at how this war could end, the practical ways to get a just and lasting peace \u2026 that guarantees your security, your independence and your right to choose your own future,\u201d Starmer said at a joint news conference. Zelenskyy said that the two leaders had discussed an idea floated by Macron for Western troops to monitor a future ceasefire, but said that it\u2019s \u201ca bit too early to talk about details.\u201d Starmer left the door open to U.K. participation, telling Ukraine\u2019s leader that \u201cwe will work with you and all of our allies on steps that would be robust enough to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security.\u201d \u201cThose conversations will continue for many months ahead,\u201d Starmer said. Zelenskyy has previously discussed a potential peacekeeping force with Baltic countries, France and Poland. But he said that it could only be part of the security solution and noted that \u201cwe do not consider security guarantees without the United States.\u201d Starmer agreed that Washington\u2019s role in Ukraine is \u201cvital.\u201d The United States is the biggest provider of military support and advanced weaponry to the country. \u201cWe will continue to work with the U.S. on this,\u201d Starmer said. Starmer said that in 2025, the U.K. will give Ukraine \u201cmore military support than ever before.\u201d He said that his country has already committed 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) for military aid this year, including 150 more artillery barrels and a U.K.-designed mobile air defense system named Gravehawk. The U.K. has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in military and civilian aid since the war broke out. During the daylong visit, Starmer and Zelenskyy laid flowers at a wall of remembrance for those killed in the war. The wall outside St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery, a Kyiv landmark, is covered in photos of the slain, stretching for a city block. It has become a place of pilgrimage for families paying tribute to their lost loved ones. Starmer also visited a Kyiv hospital specializing in burns treatment and an exhibition of drone technology . As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains before possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.

{"year":"2025","month":"01","event_desc":"Ukraine halts the transportation of Russian gas supplies through the country, following the expiration of a five-year transit deal.","text":"The five-year gas transit deal between Russia and Ukraine expired on Wednesday as Kyiv refuses to extend the deal amid war. Russian natural gas exports via Ukraine to several European countries have been halted after Kyiv refused to renew a transit deal that expired on Wednesday. Ukraine had warned that it would not renew the five-year transit deal amid the ongoing military conflict with Russia. \u201cWe stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses. Europe has already made the decision to abandon Russian gas,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. Russia\u2019s energy giant Gazprom said gas exports to Europe had been halted from 8am Moscow time (05:00 GMT) as the transit deal had expired. \u201cDue to the repeated and clearly expressed refusal of the Ukrainian side to renew these agreements, Gazprom was deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through the territory of Ukraine from January 1, 2025,\u201d Gazprom said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine pumps Russian natural gas through its territory to several European countries, including Slovakia, Moldova and Hungary. Brussels downplayed the impact the loss of Russian gas supply will have on the 27-member bloc. \u201cThe Commission has been working for more than a year specifically on preparing for a scenario without Russian gas transiting via Ukraine,\u201d it told the AFP news agency on Tuesday. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico blasted the move on Wednesday, warning it would be Europe that pays the price. \u201cHalting gas transit via Ukraine will have a drastic impact on us all in the EU but not on the Russian Federation,\u201d Fico said in a video message on Facebook. Fico, who has been critical of the European Union\u2019s support to Kyiv, last week travelled to Moscow to meet Putin, anticipating a stoppage of the gas flow.    In a separate dispute over payments, Gazprom also said it would halt gas supplies to Moldova, forcing Chisinau to introduce a state of emergency. The Moldovan government said the breakaway pro-Russian region of Transnistria was in a \u201cdifficult situation\u201d after gas supplies were cut off on Wednesday. Government spokesperson Daniel Voda said that \u201cRussian blackmail in the Transnistrian region must stop.\u201d Local media reported heating outages in the region, while an energy supplier urged residents to \u201cdress warmly\u201d, gather into a single room, seal doors and windows with curtains and blankets and avoid using homemade heating equipment. The rest of Moldova has been spared blackouts for now, able to secure power imports from neighbouring Romania. It was already cut off from direct Russian gas, but still relied on a major Russian-supplied power plant in Transnistria for its electricity. The shutdown of Russia\u2019s oldest gas route to Europe ends a decade of fraught relations prompted by Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea in 2014. \u201cIt brings to a final end what was once Russia\u2019s dominance of the EU energy market. It used that dominance in the past to economically damaging effect when it would call for higher prices unexpectedly or threatened to turn off the taps in the midst of winter,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Jonah Hull reported from Kyiv. \u201cAnd of course, that has come with a price for the European Union itself, diversifying supply away towards more expensive liquid natural gas products. In turn, harming economic output of the bloc and causing real worries about its future global competitiveness.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d The EU redoubled its efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian energy after the outbreak of the military conflict in Ukraine in 2022 by seeking alternative sources. As of December 1, the EU received less than 14 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas from Russia via Ukraine, down from 65bcm a year when the latest five-year contract began in 2020. The European Commission has said that volume can be fully replaced by liquefied natural gas and non-Russian pipeline imports. Russia still exports gas via the TurkStream pipeline on the bed of the Black Sea. Hungary \u2013 which like Slovakia has remained friendly to Moscow \u2013 receives most of its Russian gas imports via the Black Sea pipeline. As a result, Budapest will remain largely unaffected by Ukraine\u2019s decision.

Zelenskyy first announced the intention to impose sanctions on the ex-president and politically connected businesspeople in a video published Wednesday evening. Advertisement \u201cI just held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, the decision has been made, it will be published tomorrow. We are protecting our state and restoring justice.

The halt in aid, which came after Trump held a series of meetings with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraine\u2019s war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield. \u201cThe president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,\u201d the White House official said. After more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday\u2019s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office. In recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin\u2019s hand. The pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky\u2019s bad behavior last week. Ukraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks \u2014 perhaps until the start of the summer \u2014 before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. The Biden administration rushed shipments of weapons to Ukraine in its waning days, providing the country with large stockpiles of advanced weapons. It is those sophisticated weapons \u2014 including the long-range ATACMS missiles \u2014 that have allowed Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, a strategy that could suffer if those weapons remain paused. While European nations may be able to replace US shipments of artillery, supplemented by Ukraine\u2019s own growing defense industry, the most advanced weapons used by Kyiv come from the United States. Impact could be \u2018crippling\u2019 \u201cThe impact is going to be big. I would call it crippling,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has closely followed the war. Cancian estimated that Ukraine would feel the impacts of the pause in aid within two to four months, as aid from European countries helps Kyiv remain in the fight for now. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t fall off a cliff, but when your supplies get cut in half, eventually that shows up on the front lines,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cTheir front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse \u2013 even catastrophic \u2013 peace settlement.\u201d But Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces. \u201cThere might be a way out of this, but it\u2019s going to be extremely humiliating for Zelensky,\u201d Cancian said.

According to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky \u2013 potentially in the form of a public apology \u2013 before moving ahead with a deal on Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals , which had been close to agreement before Friday\u2019s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday in an interview on CNN . The halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States\u2019 traditional European allies like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday. \u201cThere is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,\u201d one US official said. A European official called the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine \u201cpetty and wrong.\u201d The official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles. \u201cI\u2019m beyond disappointed,\u201d the official told CNN Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gives an interview to Turkish media after his visit to Turkey on February 19, 2025, in Ankara, Turkey. Mert Gokhankoc\/dia images\/Getty Images Related article Europeans embrace Zelensky after he was vilified by Trump Since the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. The largest of these packages was nearly $3 billion, though most were far smaller. Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the US for the weapons on social media, as well as in calls and meetings with American officials. The pause comes one day after a defense official told CNN that military aid to Ukraine announced by the Biden administration was still flowing. Those shipments included critical munitions such as anti-tank weapons, thousands of artillery rounds, and rockets. Those shipments were expected to continue for several weeks, but the decision from the Trump administration freezes the aid that was en route. \u201cDoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed,\u201d the defense official said on Sunday. The US had set up facilities in Poland to repair Western equipment damaged on the battlefield before sending it back to the Ukrainian military. There are also multiple longer-term contracts between arms manufacturers and the US to send weapons systems and air defense systems to Ukraine. Mixed reaction from Republicans Republicans in Congress, where the party holds majorities in both chambers, have been split on continuing aid to Ukraine amid its three-year war with Russia. Earlier Monday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes \u201cso far,\u201d saying, \u201cthe American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there\u2019s no end in sight.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, \u2018Let\u2019s bring an end to it,\u2019\u201d the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, \u201cthen we will.\u201d However, he warned if Zelensky \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to negotiate peace, then it\u2019s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.\u201d GOP Sen. Susan Collins, however, denounced the pause on Monday night, arguing that the US needs to continue backing its ally. \u201cThis is a critical time for Ukraine. And I managed the Ukraine supplemental last year that provided additional help to Ukraine, and I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It\u2019s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,\u201d the Maine Republican said. Collins acknowledged that Congress may not be able to do anything to ensure Ukraine continues to receive aid from the US. \u201cA lot of it is linked to the president\u2019s drawdown authority,\u201d she noted, pointing to accusations during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term that he had \u201cslow walked\u201d aid. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen this movie before, and I remain convinced that it\u2019s not only in Ukraine\u2019s interest but our interest to back Ukraine because Putin is not going to stop there,\u201d she said. House Foreign Affairs Chair Republican Rep.

{"year":"2025","month":"03","event_desc":"The European Court of Human Rights rules that the Ukrainian government failed to prevent and adequately investigate the 2014 Odesa clashes and orders it to pay compensation.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on March 13 that the Ukrainian government failed to prevent and adequately investigate deadly clashes between the EuroMaidan supporters and opponents in Odesa in May 2014. The ruling concerns seven applications filed by 28 individuals \u2014 25 relatives of the victims and three survivors \u2014 between 2016 and 2018. Forty-eight people died in the violence that erupted between the two camps on May 2, 2014. A group of pro-Russian activists attacked a pro- EuroMaidan rally but retreated to the Trade Unions House after the ensuing violence. Forty-two of the EuroMaidan opponents died after the building caught fire as the two groups began throwing petrol bombs. Two pro-Ukrainian activists were also killed after suffering gunshot wounds. The ruling noted \"authorities\u2019 failure to do everything that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent the violence in Odesa on 2 May 2014, to stop that violence after its outbreak, to ensure timely rescue measures for people trapped in the fire, and to institute and conduct an effective investigation into the events.\" The ECHR noted that Russian propaganda helped to instigate the clashes but acknowledged the applicants' complaints that Ukraine failed to prevent the violence and adequately investigate it. The Ukrainian state was ordered to pay out compensations. The plaintiffs included relatives of victims from both camps, all of whom accused the Ukrainian state of inaction. Russian propaganda has heavily employed the violent episode in Odesa to vilify the EuroMaidan Revolution and falsely paint the movement as pro-Nazi and extremist. The EuroMaidan Revolution began in November 2013 when people gathered at Maidan Nezalezhnosti , Kyiv's central square, to protest pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych's refusal to sign the long-awaited Association Agreement with the European Union. Law enforcement officers, namely Berkut riot police, used violence to suppress the protests, including lethal force. More than 100 people were killed during the revolution, which culminated in Yanukovych fleeing to Russia. \"The Court noted that distortion of the events in Odesa had eventually become a tool of Russian propaganda in respect of the war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine since February 2022,\" the ECHR's ruling said. \"Enhanced transparency in the related investigative work by the Ukrainian authorities might have helped to prevent or counteract that propaganda effectively.\" The court noted that the investigation should have been \"carried out by an organ entirely independent from the police.\" At the same time, the ECHR dismissed allegations that the authorities were not impartial when investigating the deaths of EuroMaidan opponents and supporters. EuroMaidan Revolution The EuroMaidan Revolution is often credited with being the single most consequential event in Ukraine\u2019s modern history. After pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych took power in 2010, the political and business landscape in Ukraine was gradually deteriorating.

Without confirming the withdrawal with a statement, the General Staff posted the latest battlefield maps on social media, which showed a complete retreat from Sudzha. The confirmation comes as Russian troops scale up their offensive in the Russian border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 in hopes of using the captured territories as a bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Kyiv has held on to its gradually shrinking foothold in Kursk Oblast despite a deteriorating logistics situation caused by Russia's intense use of artillery, drones, and glide bombs.

Ukraine has denied the claims of encirclement. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13 that its troops had captured Sudzha.

The administration\u2019s decision marked a sharp shift from only a week ago, when it imposed the measures in an apparent effort to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to enter talks to end the war with invading Russian forces. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting .

But we have a full ceasefire from Ukraine. That\u2019s good.\u201d The Kremlin had no immediate comment on the U.S. and Ukrainian statements. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said only that negotiations with U.S. officials could take place this week.

The person cautioned that scheduling could change. Officials met in Saudi Arabia only hours after Russia shot down over 300 Ukrainian drones in Ukraine\u2019s biggest attack since the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion. Neither U.S. nor Ukrainian officials offered any comment on the barrage.

Hawkish Russians push back against a ceasefire In Moscow, hawkish politicians and military bloggers spoke strongly against a prospective ceasefire, arguing that it would play into Kyiv\u2019s hands and damage Moscow\u2019s interests at a time when the Russian military has the advantage. \u201cA ceasefire isn\u2019t what we need,\u201d wrote hardline ideologue Alexander Dugin. Viktor Sobolev, a retired general who is a member of the Russian parliament\u2019s lower house, warned that a 30-day truce would allow Ukraine to beef up arms supplies and regroup its troops before resuming hostilities. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political commentator, suggested that Moscow could demand a halt on Western arms supplies to Ukraine as part of a ceasefire. \u201cAn embargo on arms supplies to Ukraine could be a condition for a truce,\u201d he wrote.

He participated in the EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa . The activist had been active in rallies supporting Ukraine , charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle Soviet and imperial monuments. The shooter fled the scene, and police have launched an investigation. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said he is taking personal control of the case, adding that a top investigative team from the National Police is en route to Odesa. \"An investigative team of the best officers has been formed with the central office of the National Police and has already left for Odesa. A regiment of the National Police has also been sent to Odesa,\" he said during an hour of questions to the government in the Verkhovna Rada. Pro-Russian media Tipichanya Odesa initially reported that the shooter was a man in military uniform. Klymenko denied this information. \"Operatives and police investigators are working to identify the shooter and arrest him,\" Klymenko added. Hanul had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, he claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him.

The law aims to enhance defense cooperation with partner nations, particularly by enabling Ukrainian forces to participate in training and receive military equipment, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko explained. \"This will allow us to attract international support to strengthen Ukraine's defense faster and more effectively,\" Honcharenko posted on Telegram. The legislation permits Ukrainian military units to be deployed to other countries for national security purposes, including repelling armed aggression, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and exercising the right to self-defense under international law. The law does not concern the deployment of Ukrainian troops for combat operations on Russian territory. The decision to send military personnel abroad will be made by the president but requires approval from the Verkhovna Rada , the country's parliament. Deployments will be subject to a formal request detailing the mission's objectives, troop numbers, weaponry, and the conditions of their stay abroad. Zelensky vetoed the bill in January and returned it to parliament with amendments clarifying the decision-making process and ensuring compliance with international law.

While it is a relief that they are now free, it is a travesty to see them being used as human bargaining chips in political deals. \u201cThe conflict in eastern Ukraine opened a new and tragic chapter for human rights in the country and beyond. Following his arrest, illegal transfer to Russia and deeply flawed trial by a military court, Oleg Sentsov spent more than six years behind bars. \u201cThe Russian authorities derisively refused to recognize his Ukrainian citizenship and transported him 3,000 kilometers away from his family and native Crimea to the frost-bitten penal colony at Labytnangi in the far north of Russia. \u201cNo-one should be prosecuted and imprisoned solely for political reasons; we demand justice for all remaining prisoners subjected to these politically-motivated trials, those who had been imprisoned solely for exercising their human rights, should be immediately and unconditionally release.\u201d Background On September 7, Russia and Ukraine finalized the exchange of 66 prisoners held in both countries.

{"year":"2019","month":"01","event_desc":"Bartholomew I of Constantinople issues formal decree granting Orthodox Church of Ukraine independence from the Russian Orthodox Church.","text":"Ukraine Orthodox Church granted independence from Russian Church Published 5 January 2019 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Reuters Image caption, Ceremonies are taking place in Istanbul to recognise the independence of Ukraine's Orthodox Church from Russia The recently formed Orthodox Church of Ukraine has been granted independence, marking a historic split from the Russian Church. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew - the head of the global Orthodox Church - has signed a document in Istanbul, Turkey, to that effect. It formalises an October announcement. The move has provoked a furious response in Russia, where the Church has broken off links, deepening a split in the worldwide Orthodox Church. Ukraine's churches have for centuries been under the authority of the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow. The decision may also lead to a lasting schism in the global Orthodox movement, says the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Kiev, Ukraine. Orthodox Church split: Five reasons why it matters What are the events in Istanbul? The Patriarch has signed what is known as a \"tomos\", a decree officially recognising an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church, in the presence of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who travelled to Istanbul for the occasion. Istanbul remained the centre of the Orthodox Church after the Muslim Ottoman Turks occupied the city, then known as Constantinople, in the 15th Century. The event at St George's cathedral was broadcast live on Ukrainian television. The tomos will be handed over on Sunday, and brought back to Ukraine on what is the Orthodox Christmas Eve. On Monday - Christmas Day - a celebration and rally will take place in central Kiev. Upset at losing its Ukrainian parishes, the Russian Orthodox Church - which is the world's largest - has already cut ties with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the spiritual authority of the world's Orthodox church after it recognised the Ukrainian Church's independence. What is the dispute all about? The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has been under the Moscow Patriarchate for centuries. But tensions within the Church mounted after Ukraine became independent in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Before the council held in Kiev in December where the split was announced, there were three Orthodox Church branches in Ukraine: The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Kiev Patriarchate) The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Now, priests from the Kiev Patriarchate and the Autocephalous Church become members of the new Church - the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The drive for Ukrainian Orthodox independence intensified in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and Russia-backed separatists seized a big swathe of territory in eastern Ukraine. Image source, EPA Image caption, Many Ukrainians welcomed Constantinople's ruling last year, holding a prayer in Kiev The Moscow branch of the Ukrainian Church has denied accusations that it acts as a tool of the Kremlin, and says it has tried to bring about peace in eastern Ukraine. Earlier this year, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople overruled its decision dating back to 1686 to transfer its jurisdiction over Kievan Orthodox churches (known as the Kievan Metropolis) to Moscow. Now Moscow fears losing many of its 12,000 parishes in Ukraine. Constantinople holds sway over more than 300 million Orthodox Christians across the world.

{"year":"2024","month":"01","event_desc":"31 January  Russia and Ukraine conduct a prisoner exchange on the border with 195 soldiers being returned to Russia, and 207 military personnel and civilians being returned to Ukraine, respectively. The deal is facilitated by the United Arab Emirates.","text":"Ukraine and Russia complete first prisoner swap since plane crash 31 January 2024 Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv & Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford in Kyiv BBC News Share Save @V_Zelenskiy_official One Ukrainian soldier was seen kissing the country's national flag after the reported exchange Russia and Ukraine say they have exchanged captured soldiers - the first swap since the crash of a Russian plane that Moscow claimed had 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) on board. Russia's military says each side got 195 soldiers back on Wednesday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says 207 Ukrainian soldiers were returned. Kyiv questions Moscow's claims that Ukrainian PoWs were on the plane that came down last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday that the Il-76 military transport plane had been downed by Ukraine in the western Belgorod region using an American Patriot system. He provided no proof. The Russian military had previously said that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers were on the plane, which was heading to the area for a prisoner exchange. It said six Russian crew members and three escorting officials were also on board, adding that there were no survivors. Russia has as yet produced no firm evidence of its claims and officials there have a long and proven history of lies and disinformation. Kyiv has not directly denied the Russian statements but says that nothing has been confirmed. Last week, a spokesman for military intelligence in Kyiv told the BBC that he \"does not exclude\" the possibility that PoWs were on the Il-76 plane. Other official statements talk about Ukraine's right to defend itself from Russian missiles, particularly fired from Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border. But many in Ukraine wonder why Russia has not shown images of dozens of dead bodies after the plane crash to back up its assertions. None of the details have been independently verified and both sides have called for an international investigation. Downed Russian plane leaves unanswered questions Wednesday's exchange is the 50th PoW swap since President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In a brief statement, the Russian defence ministry said the exchange was completed after negotiations. \"The released military personnel will be transported by military transport aircraft... to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation,\" it said. Russian Defence Ministry\/Handout via REUTERS Russia's defence ministry released a video purportedly showing exchanged Russian soldiers boarding a bus \"All those released are provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance,\" the statement said. Footage released by the ministry purportedly shows those exchanged Russian soldiers boarding a bus before their flight to Moscow. Meanwhile, President Zelensky wrote in a post on social media: \"Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what. \"We remember every Ukrainian in captivity. Both warriors and civilians. We must bring all of them back,\" he said, thanking Ukraine's top security officials for making the latest exchange possible. Videos filmed by the Ukrainian authorities show the released PoWs spilling off buses, with big grins and shouts of \"Glory to Ukraine!\" One soldier drops to the ground, rolling in the snow, so overjoyed to be back. The men are wearing Russian prison uniforms, their heads are close-shaven and many look gaunt after their time in captivity. Some are in tears, talking to relatives by phone. At the end of the video they all stand, wrapped in Ukraine's national blue-and-yellow flags, and singing the country's anthem. The exchange was kept secret until it happened, for security. Ukraine confirms that the United Arab Emirates was involved as a mediator, as it was earlier this month, but we do not know any details about the negotiations. Ukraine's co-ordination centre for PoWs said among those released were National Guard members, border guards as well as one police officer. The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region Ukraine has said that none of the 65 men who were due for release last week, and who Russia claims were killed, are among the latest to be swapped. However, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence told the BBC some of the other soldiers who did return on Wednesday, had been due to be swapped in the last exchange. The BBC has spoken to friends and relatives of the 65 still unaccounted for. They do not want to comment publicly, but stress that there is no evidence of anything at this point - and they remain hopeful. \"Of course, we're worried,\" a friend of one prisoner said. \"But there is no information, no proof.\" There are still thousands of Ukrainian PoWs being held in Russia. Their families usually have no contact with them at all, and can know nothing about the men's fate until they are suddenly freed in a prisoner swap. One woman, Tetyana, whose son was captured in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Mariupol in 2022, told the BBC she had heard nothing from her son directly ever since. The last confirmation he was even alive was more than a year ago, when a prisoner who was released confirmed that they had shared a cell. Tetyana described the agony of living with such uncertainty and having to convince herself each day that her son was still alive.

{"year":"2024","month":"02","event_desc":"1 February  The European Union formally approves a \u20ac50 billion financial support package for Ukraine after Hungary withdraws its veto. The package is expected to help the Ukrainian government pay pensions, salaries and other costs over the next four years with the first funds being released in March.","text":"Ukraine support package worth \u20ac50bn agreed by EU leaders 1 February 2024 Share Save Laura Gozzi and Sarah Rainsford in Kyiv BBC News Share Save Getty Images EU leaders at a pre-summit meeting on Thursday morning All 27 EU leaders have agreed a \u20ac50bn (\u00a342bn; $54bn) aid package for Ukraine, after Hungary stopped blocking the deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the new funding, saying it would strengthen the country's economic and financial stability. Ukraine's economic ministry said it expects the first tranche in March. There had been fears Hungary's PM would again block the package as he did at a European summit in December. Viktor Orban, Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in the EU, had said he wanted to force a rethink of the bloc's policy towards Ukraine and questioned the idea of committing funds for Kyiv for the next four years. The new funding promise comes as aid from the US - the largest provider of military support for Kyiv - is being held up by Congress. \"I think it will be an encouragement for the United States also to do their fair share,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. The agreement was announced less than two hours after the summit started, surprising many observers who had expected talks to go on much longer due to the depth of disagreement between Mr Orban and the other EU leaders. On the streets of Kyiv, people welcomed the news. \"It's great. All this support, money, ammunition, humanitarian help are all important for our country, and we thank all the world for supporting us,\" one man told the BBC. However, this EU funding package is not for the frontline - it's for life in the rear. War is an expensive endeavour, and budget revenue in Ukraine is being swallowed up funding the fighting. But the Ukrainian government still needs to pay for pensions, state salaries - down to keeping the lights on. There were warnings such payments could be delayed, had the EU not approved the aid. Keeping life for its citizens running as smoothly as possible is vital for the government to maintain domestic support for the war effort, even as Ukraine pushes for continuing backing from its allies abroad. The new deal includes a yearly discussion of the funding package and the option to review it in two years, \"if needed\" - and only at the Council's discretion. Mr Orban had been pushing for a yearly vote on the package, which could have left the deal exposed to an annual veto threat from Hungary. Under the agreement, one precondition for the support for Ukraine is that it upholds the \"rights of persons belonging to minorities\" - a possible reference to Mr Orban's longstanding concern about the ethnic Hungarian minority in Ukraine. Artillery for Ukraine was also discussed at the summit. Earlier this week, the EU acknowledged that it would only be able to deliver 52% of the one million ammunition rounds it had promised to send by March. Today, European Council President Charles Michel said the EU is determined to make sure Ukraine gets the equipment it needs to defend \"their country and their future\" . In a video address to European leaders, President Zelensky said the EU had \"proven that its word matters, and its promises work for the interests of entire Europe\". He referred to the fact that US aid is being blocked up by Congress, saying that today's announcement would send a \"signal across the Atlantic... that the international rules-based world order will withstand all challenges.\" \"Europe sets the tone for global affairs - with its unity,\" Mr Zelensky added. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who had been highly critical of what he called Mr Orban's \"strange and egotistic game,\" posted on X: \"Viktor Orban could be 'persuaded'... Let's move on.\" The EU had been withholding \u20ac20bn of funds for Hungary because of concerns about human rights and corruption in the country. Today's announcement of a new aid package comes after European leaders agreed to open EU membership talks with Ukraine in December - a decision hailed at the time as \"a victory\" for his country.

The Ukrainian parliament outlawed most Soviet and communist symbols, street names, and moments in 2015 as part of the decommunization process . Monuments around the country have since come down or been changed, although the sheer number of Soviet-era statues and symbols has prolonged the completion of the project. Ukraine made a significant step in August 2023 when the Soviet hammer and sickle was removed from the Motherland monument, the country's tallest statue and a fixture of the Kyiv skyline. It was replaced by the trident, Ukraine's coat of arms. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Kozytskyi said that 312 Soviet monuments were removed in 2023, with the last remaining structure taken down in the community of Lopatyn, located around 90 kilometers from the city of Lviv. No funds from the oblast's budget were used in dismantling the monuments, according to Kozytskyi. Instead, local citizens helped to remove them, he said.

{"year":"2024","month":"02","event_desc":"8 February  President Zelenskyy announces the dismissal of commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi, replacing him with Oleksandr Syrskyi.","text":"Zelensky sacks Ukraine's commander-in-chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi 8 February 2024 Share Save Marita Moloney BBC News Share Save Volodymyr Zelensky\/X President Zelensky posted this picture with Gen Zaluzhnyi in announcing his replacement Ukraine's president has sacked the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. It follows speculation about a rift between the president and Gen Zaluzhnyi, who has led Ukraine's war effort since the conflict began. Battle-hardened Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi was announced as his replacement in a presidential decree. It is the biggest change to Ukraine's military leadership since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the high command needed to be \"renewed\" and that Gen Zaluzhnyi could \"remain on the team\". \"Starting today, a new management team will take over the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" he said on Thursday. Gen Zaluzhnyi is a popular general trusted by Ukrainian soldiers and the public, and has been something of a national hero. His recent approval ratings have been higher than those of Mr Zelensky. Analysis: General's sacking won't instantly solve Ukraine's war woes The president said he and Gen Zaluzhnyi had a \"frank conversation\" about the changes needed in the army, and that he thanked the general for defending Ukraine from Russia. The new army chief, Gen Syrskyi, has experience of both defensive and offensive warfare, Mr Zelensky said. He led the defence of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. He then masterminded Ukraine's surprise and successful counter-attack in Kharkiv that summer, and has since been serving as the head of military operations in eastern Ukraine - one of the two main axes in Ukraine's counter-offensive. VALENTYN OGIRENKO General Oleksandr Syrskyi will now lead Ukraine's war effort \"We must make this year a crucial one,\" Mr Zelensky said. \"Crucial for achieving Ukraine's goals in the war. Russia cannot simply accept the existence of an independent Ukraine - the very fact of our country's independent life.\" He said his \"renewal\" of the army's leadership was \"not about surnames\" or politics, but rather the management of Ukraine's armed forces and the experience of battlefield commanders. \"The army's actions must become much more technologically advanced. The generalship must be reset,\" he added. Mr Zelensky said he expected a detailed plan for the armed forces this year, taking into account the reality of the war with Russia. He said there needed to be a different approach to frontline management, mobilisation and recruitment. Mykhailo Podolyak, who is the adviser to the head of the president's office, said the move was needed to revise the tactics used in Ukraine's counter-offensive last year. He echoed Mr Zelensky's comments about the need to prevent stagnation on the frontline and to find high-tech solutions. But there has been mixed reaction so far to the announcement, with opposition MPs the first to criticise the shake-up. Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko thanked Gen Zaluzhnyi for his service to Ukraine, adding that he hoped the authorities would justify the changes. Oleksii Honcharenko, an MP from the opposition party led by former President Petro Poroshenko, said the move was \"a huge mistake\" by the president. He said it would carry risks for the country, adding: \"We will all have to pay for this mistake.\" Another opposition MP, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko from the Batkivschina party, said the military leadership during the war \"is something that we must preserve, support, not criticise, but help in every possible way\".

Ukraine said 230 prisoners, including serving members of the armed forces and border guard, had been freed from Russian captivity. In exchange, 248 Russians were released by Ukraine in the deal, mediated by the United Arab Emirates. It is the first major prisoner exchange since last August. \"Our people are home,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media. \"Today, we brought back over 200 warriors and civilians from Russian captivity.\" In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defence said negotiations had been \"difficult\". The two countries have exchanged prisoners on a number of occasions since the start of Russia's full-scale war in February 2022, but the Ukrainian leader said last month that the process had slowed down for Russia's own \"very specific reasons\".

{"year":"2024","month":"01","event_desc":"24 January  Korochansky Il-76 crash A Russian Ilyushin IL-76 military transport plane carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six crew members and three guards, crashes in Russia's Korochansky District, near the Ukrainian border, killing everybody on board.","text":"Comments come after Russia accused Ukraine of shooting down transport plane, killing 65 Ukrainian POWs on board. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of \u201cplaying with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners\u201d over the crash of a military transport plane that Moscow blamed on Ukraine. The Ilyushin Il-76 came down in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Wednesday, killing everyone on board. The Russian Ministry of Defence said 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were on the plane in preparation for a prisoner swap, as well as six Russian crew and three Russian soldiers. \u201cIt is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday evening address. He did not confirm or deny Russia\u2019s claims, but said it had been a \u201cvery difficult day\u201d. \u201cWe need to establish all the clear facts. As much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,\u201d he said. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was hit as it was travelling from a military aerodrome near Moscow to Belgorod. Close to the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has been targeted in recent weeks by Ukrainian air strikes. The ministry claimed, without offering evidence, that radars had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.    \u201cOn board were 65 captured Ukrainian army servicemen being transported to the Belgorod region for exchange, six crew members and three escorts,\u201d state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the defence ministry as saying. It did not provide any evidence for the claim. A few hours afterwards, the Ukrainian military said it had noticed more Russian military transport aircraft landing in Belgorod, something it linked to continued Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. \u201cUkraine has the right to defend itself and destroy the means of the aggressors\u2019 aerial attack,\u201d said Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. The Kremlin told reporters that it was investigating the reports on the plane, as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying Russia aimed to establish \u201cthe reasons behind the Ukrainian criminal act\u201d. A French spokesperson at the UN said the meeting would be held at 5pm (22:00 GMT) on Thursday. Zelenskyy also called for an international investigation into the crash. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency said in a statement it had no \u201creliable or comprehensive information\u201d on who was on board the plane or in what number\u201d. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defence, said that an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine had been prepared for Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing Radio Free Europe, a media outlet based in the Czech Republic. Yusov added that the prisoner exchange would not be going ahead. Military intelligence also said that Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod in contrast to previous swaps and had not been informed about what means of transport would be used and which routes. \u201cOn this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state,\u201d it said in a statement on Telegram. A video posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling and exploding in a fireball. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media that investigators and emergency workers had already arrived at a site in the Korochansky, a district in Belgorod Oblast. \u201cThe plane fell in a field near a populated area. Everyone on board died,\u201d Gladkov said on his Telegram channel. The Il-76 is designed to airlift troops, cargo, military equipment and weapons. It usually has a crew of five and can carry as many as 90 passengers.  Kharkiv and Kyiv came under Russian aerial assault on Tuesday, killing at least 18 people . In December, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d on civilians in the city of Belgorod, after 25 people were killed. Last week, the Kremlin accused Kyiv of killing 27 people in an attack on the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Ukraine has denied the claim.

From: Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP Published 12 January 2024 This was published under the 2022 to 2024 Sunak Conservative government Prime Minister to visit Kyiv today [Friday] to set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership Rishi Sunak will increase military funding for Ukraine next financial year to \u00a32.5 billion, supporting largest ever commitment of drones The Prime Minister and President Zelenskyy will also sign a historic UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation The Prime Minister is expected to meet first responders dealing with the aftermath of Russian bombings as part of his visit Later today, the Prime Minister and President Zelenskyy will sign a historic UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation. The G7 nations agreed to provide Ukraine with bilateral security assurances at the NATO Summit in Vilnius last year; the UK is the first country to deliver a final agreement. The totemic agreement is intended to be the first step in developing an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation formalises a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine\u2019s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defence industrial cooperation. It also commits the UK to consult with Ukraine in the event it is ever attacked by Russia again, and to provide \u201cswift and sustained\u201d assistance for their defence. Ahead of meeting President Zelenskyy, Rishi Sunak has also confirmed the UK will provide \u00a32.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine in 2024\/25, an increase of \u00a3200 million on the previous two years. The funding will help to leverage the best of UK military expertise and defence production to ensure Ukraine\u2019s victory on the battlefield, including in critical areas like long-range missiles, air defence, artillery ammunition and maritime security. Of the \u00a32.5 billion, at least \u00a3200 million will be spent on a major push to rapidly procure and produce thousands of military drones for Ukraine, including surveillance, long-range\u00a0strike\u00a0and sea drones. The technology will give Ukraine cutting edge, battle-tested capabilities to defend their citizens and target the invading Russian forces on land and sea. This will be the largest delivery of drones to Ukraine from any nation. Most of the drones are expected to be manufactured in the UK, and the Ministry of Defence will work with international partners to significantly scale up the number of drones provided for Ukraine\u2019s defence. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy. I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come. \u201cThe UK is already one of Ukraine\u2019s closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security. Today we are going further - increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term.\u201d During his visit to Kyiv, the Prime Minister is expected to meet emergency workers responding to the aftermath of Russian airstrikes. He will announce a further \u00a318 million in aid for Ukraine, building on almost \u00a3340 million already provided. Some of that funding will support organisations like the UN and Red Cross to provide humanitarian aid on the frontline, and \u00a38 million will go to fortify Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure against further Russian attacks. As part of efforts to cement the close bond between our two nations and Ukraine\u2019s place at the heart of Europe, the UK will also provide additional funding and resources for English language training in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government has proposed legislation to promote English in Ukraine, boosting economic competitiveness and diplomatic ties. Today\u2019s announcement will see the UK fund online English lessons for Ukrainians of all ages, as well as providing resources and teacher training.

Zelensky announced he had signed the decree during his address on Unity Day, a national holiday celebrated on Jan. 22 that marks the unification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Western Ukrainian People's Republic in 1919 into one independent country. The decree \"On the Territories of the Russian Federation Historically Inhabited by Ukrainians\" stipulates that the government should cooperate with international experts to create a plan \"to preserve the national identity of Ukrainians\" in specific territories of what is now Russia. The decree listed the regions of Kuban, a historical region to the east of the Crimean Peninsula , Starodubshchyna, to the north of Chernihiv, and northern and eastern Slobozhanshchyna. Also known as Sloboda Ukraine, Slobozhanshchyna was a significant and semi-autonomous region under Tsarist rule that extended across what is now northeastern Ukraine, predominantly Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts, and southwestern Russia. Krasnodar Krai covers most of what was once Kuban, while Starodubshchyna now lies predominantly in Bryansk Oblast . The decree also declares that the government should preserve the history of Ukrainians in these regions. Their testimonies on the forced Russification , political repression , and deportations they suffered should be recorded, according to the decree. More work should also be done to counter \" disinformation and propaganda of the Russian Federation regarding the history and present of Ukrainians in Russia\" and to develop relations between Ukrainians and other \"peoples enslaved by Russia,\" the decree says. The government should work with the National Academy of Sciences to develop materials about the \"more than a thousand-year history of Ukrainian state formation, the historical connections of lands inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, and Ukrainian national state formations in various historical periods.\" The \"true history of ethnic Ukrainians in the lands historically inhabited by them within the borders of the Russian Federation\" should also be included in educational textbooks, according to the decree. 2 years into full-scale war, Ukraine under pressure to draft hundreds of thousands of new soldiers As Russia\u2019s full-scale war approaches its third year and looks ready to drag on for several more, one topic is dominating the discussion in Ukraine: mobilization.

Directed by Mstyslav Chernov, a Ukrainian journalist who documented the invasion in early 2022 , 20 Days in Mariupol drew wide acclaim after its premiere at the Sundance film festival in 2023, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw calling it \u201ca searing film [that] bears a terrible witness to this great crime\u201d in a five-star review . In an interview with the Guardian, Chernov described the film as \u201csome kind of collective resistance to tragedy\u201d. \u2018It felt like the beginning of the third world war \u2026 It still does\u2019 \u2013 Mstyslav Chernov on 20 Days in Mariupol Read more The film was considered a strong contender for the award, having already picked up best documentary awards from Bafta and the Directors Guild of America. In the end it triumphed over contenders including the Ugandan political documentary Bobi Wine: The People\u2019s President , and Alzheimer\u2019s study The Eternal Memory . Taking to the stage, Chernov said the Oscar was the first ever for a Ukrainian film. \u201cI am honoured but I will probably be the first director on this stage to say that I wish I had never made this film. \u201cI wish to be able to exchange this for Russia never attacking Ukraine , never invading our cities. I wish to be able to exchange this for Russia not killing tens of thousands of my fellow Ukrainians.\u201d Chernov said he also would love to be able to swap the honour for Russia \u201creleasing the hostages\u201d as well as \u201cthe civilians who are now in their jails\u201d. \u201cI cannot change history.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was grateful to the team for creating the film and cheered the award as \u201cimportant for our entire country\u201d. He said the death toll in Mariupol remained unknown but satellite images showed \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of graves. \u201cThe horrors of Mariupol must never be forgotten,\u201d he said on social media. \u201cThe entire world must see and remember what the inhumane Russian invasion brought to our people.

This is what the film director did by mentioning the occupation, prisoners of war, killing of Ukrainians by Russia, and illegal abduction of civilians,\u201d he wrote on Telegram.

Ukrainian Presidential Press Service\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab March 7 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday that he had approved the candidacy of former army chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi as ambassador to Britain. Zaluzhnyi, widely seen as a national hero for overseeing Ukraine's war effort throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, was replaced last month by ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi. Sign up here. \"Today, I approved the candidacy of our country's ambassador to the United Kingdom, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. \"General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi spoke to me specifically about pursuing that direction -- a diplomatic direction.\" Zelenskiy said Ukraine's Foreign Ministry had sent the request for approval and that \"our alliance with Britain is set to strengthen further\". Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told national television that the president \"had long sought\" a suitable candidate \"and one of the key requirements was an understanding of the military context. \"Britain is one of the leaders in military help for Ukraine. It is a country which has a vision of military strategy. The new ambassador therefore had to have a deep military background,\" Kuleba said. Ukraine has not had an ambassador in Britain since Zelenskiy dismissed former , opens new tab envoy Vadym Prystaiko in July 2023 after he publicly criticised the president. Zaluzhnyi's dismissal as army chief was the focal point of a shakeup of senior positions in Ukraine's armed forces. It followed weeks of tension and speculation about possible disagreements between the president and his top commander. Zaluzhnyi had written in a published article last November that the now-two-year-old war against Russia had entered a stage of attrition, and he called for technological advances. Zelenskiy did not respond directly to the comments, but denied any suggestion that the war had entered a stalemate. Zelenskiy on Thursday met British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps in Kyiv and said he had expressed gratitude for Britain's \"tangible leadership\" in providing support for Ukraine and working together to counter Russian actions. A British government statement said Shapps announced a 325 million pound ($417 million) package of military aid for Ukraine, including delivery of more than 10,000 drones. A British aid package in January also provided for drones and was valued at 200 million pounds. In his remarks, Zelenskiy said priority areas of cooperation were boosting air defences, long-range weapons, and artillery and joint production of weapons, and bringing Russia to account. \"We have already reached a historically unprecedented level of cooperation with Britain,\" Zelenskiy said, referring to Britain as the first of several countries to sign an accord extending security guarantees to Ukraine.

REUTERS\/Oleksandr Ratushniak Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BRUSSELS, March 13 (Reuters) - European Union countries agreed on Wednesday to provide 5 billion euros ($5.48 billion) for military aid to Ukraine as part of a revamp of an EU-run assistance fund, handing Kyiv a timely boost as its forces struggle against Russia's invasion. Ambassadors from the EU's 27 member countries agreed to the overhaul of the European Peace Facility (EPF) fund at a meeting in Brussels after months of wrangling , with EU heavyweights France and Germany at the centre of much of the debate. Sign up here. \"The message is clear: we will support Ukraine with whatever it takes to prevail,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on social media platform X after the decision. The fund operates as a giant cashback scheme, giving EU members refunds for sending munitions to other countries. France, a strong promoter of European defence industries, had insisted on a strong \"buy European\" policy for arms eligible for refunds. Other countries argued that requirement would inhibit efforts to buy worldwide to get weapons to Ukraine quickly. Germany, by far Europe's biggest bilateral donor of military aid to Ukraine, had demanded such donations be taken into account in determining the size of countries' financial contributions to the fund. Diplomats said a compromise was found that allows flexibility on \"buy European\" rules and takes into account part of the value of bilateral aid when calculating members' financial contributions. \"This is yet another powerful and timely demonstration of European unity and determination in achieving our common victory,\" said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. \"We look forward to the final decision being approved at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting.\" The final text says the scheme should give priority to the European defence industry while \"exceptionally allowing for flexibility in cases where it cannot provide within a timeframe compatible with Ukrainian needs\". The compromise will allow the fund to help finance a Czech initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of desperately needed artillery shells from countries outside Europe, according to diplomats. The EPF has already been used to allocate some 6.1 billion euros to military aid for Ukraine, according to the EU. Borrell proposed last year creating a new cash pot specifically for aid to Kyiv - the Ukraine Assistance Fund - inside the EPF, with a budget of up to 5 billion euros per year for the next four years. That prompted a prolonged debate over rules for future aid, eventually leading to Wednesday's agreement. The compromise includes measures to satisfy Hungary, which has previously blocked payouts from the EPF and said it does not want its contributions to finance arms for Ukraine. Under the deal, its contributions will be used to fund military aid to other countries, according to EU officials. \"Ukraine needs more arms and equipment, we will provide them in sufficient quantities and in a coordinated manner,\" said Hadja Lahbib, the foreign minister of Belgium, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency. \"Europe is true to its commitments.

The bill expands the number of civilians the army can mobilise into its ranks to fight under martial law, which has been in place since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and has sparked heated debate. It had been on Zelenskiy\u2019s table since it was approved by lawmakers in May 2023. Ukrainian drone attacks target oil refinery and factory deep inside Russia Read more In the first weeks after the invasion, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians volunteered to serve at the front in an explosion of patriotism that helped keep the country independent and fight off the initial attack. More than two years later, however, many of those initial recruits are dead, wounded or simply exhausted, and the army needs new recruits to fill the ranks. By now, most of those who want to fight have already signed up, leaving the military to recruit among a much more reluctant pool of men. Kyiv has also been battling a shortage of ammunition supplies as vital funding from the US remains blocked by Republicans in Congress. Viral videos have shown men snatched from the street to be conscripted, and there have been numerous corruption scandals of officials taking bribes to provide exemption. In August, Zelenskiy fired every regional recruitment chief . Zelenskiy said in December that his military had proposed mobilising up to 500,000 more Ukrainians into the armed forces. It is unclear how many men will be affected by the new law. Republicans say Trump call for Russia to attack Nato allies was just fine, actually Read more Data on Ukraine\u2019s male population, cited by the Financial Times, showed that of 11.1 million Ukrainian men aged between 25 and 60, only an estimated 3.7 million are eligible for mobilisation. The others are fighting, disabled, out of the country or considered critical workers. Zelenskiy also separately signed a second bill requiring men who were given military waivers on disability grounds to undergo another medical assessment, another measure that could help the military draft more fighters. Zelenskiy has warned that Russia may plan another offensive in the coming months, and Kyiv\u2019s troops have been scaling up their efforts to build up strong defensive fortifications along a sprawling frontline. \u201cLowering the mobilization age from 27 to 25 years of age will support the Ukrainian military\u2019s ability to restore and reconstitute existing units and to create new units,\u201d wrote the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US thinktank, in its latest report on Wednesday. But the ISW said that delays in the US military aid \u201cmay impact the speed at which Ukraine can restore degraded and stand up new units\u201d. \u201cISW continues to assess that western-provided materiel continues to be the greatest deciding factor for the Ukrainian military\u2019s ability to restore and augment its combat power.\u201d The Russian military leadership continues to reject rumours that it plans its own mobilisation. Vladimir Putin ordered a \u201cpartial mobilisation\u201d of 300,000 reservists in September 2022, after a series of military defeats saw Russian forces routed from east Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region and under increasing pressure in the southern Kherson region. Since then, it has replenished its ranks by recruiting prisoners as well as luring tens of thousands of recruits from poorer Russian regions with the promise of high salaries. At the end of 2023, Putin said that 486,000 new recruits had joined the army that year and that 1,500 a day were signing contracts. Russia\u2019s defence ministry on Tuesday claimed that another 100,000 recruits had joined the army in 2024.

REUTERS\/Viacheslav Ratynskyi\/\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab April 16 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed into law a bill overhauling army mobilisation rules , according to the parliamentary website, as Ukraine seeks to address acute troop shortages in its fight against Russia. More than two years into the war , Ukraine is on the back foot and its top military commander on the eastern frontline has said Russian forces outnumbered its own by up to 10 times. Kyiv needs fresh troops to strengthen its positions and rotate its exhausted military. Sign up here. The law will come into force a month after it is officially published. It obliges men to update their draft data with the authorities, boosts payments to those who volunteer, and adds new punishment for draft dodging. It remains unclear how many troops could be mobilised under the new provisions, although some serving military personnel and analysts have expressed concern that the law would not be effective enough in addressing the shortages. The bill signed into law on Tuesday also lacks the much tougher sanctions for draft evasion that were contained in the initial version. The draft sparked public outcry, and there were more than 4,000 amendments before the final reading in parliament. Zelenskiy recently signed a separate law cutting the draft age to 25 from 27 to secure more fighting power. Ukraine began mobilisation immediately after Russia's invasion in February 2022. The country initially saw a significant influx of volunteer fighters, but numbers later plunged, with thousands of cases of draft evasion reported since. Kyiv troops are facing a shortage of ammunition supplies, with vital funding from the U.S. blocked by Republicans in Congress for months and the EU failing to deliver munitions on time, while Russian forces are inching forward.

The two men were colonels in Ukraine's state guard service recruited by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) who leaked classified information to Moscow, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on the Telegram app. Sign up here. They were tasked with finding someone close to the presidential guard who would take Zelenskiy hostage and later kill him, the SBU statement said, without making clear at what point the alleged plot had been foiled. \"The terrorist attack, which was supposed to be a gift to Putin for the inauguration, was indeed a failure of the Russian special services,\" SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk was quoted as saying by his agency on Telegram. There was no immediate comment from Moscow. The Kremlin declined to comment last month when asked about the arrest in Poland of a man accused of working with Russian intelligence to prepare a possible attempt to assassinate Zelenskiy. The Ukrainian leader, who has led his country's effort to fend off Russia's more than two-year-old invasion , said last autumn that his security services had foiled at least five Russian plots to assassinate him. The spy group also planned to \"eliminate\" Maliuk and Kyrylo Budanov, the military intelligence agency's head, the SBU said. Budanov's assassination was supposed to happen before Orthodox Easter Sunday on May 5, it added. The agents sought to inform the Russian side of the whereabouts of Budanov so they could carry out missile and drone attacks at the location, it said. One of the arrested men was involved in transporting and storing drones and explosives for the operation, it added.

More than two years into the war , Ukraine is on the back foot and its top military commander on the eastern frontline has said Russian forces outnumbered its own by up to 10 times. Kyiv needs fresh troops to strengthen its positions and rotate its exhausted military. Sign up here. The law will come into force a month after it is officially published. It obliges men to update their draft data with the authorities, boosts payments to those who volunteer, and adds new punishment for draft dodging. It remains unclear how many troops could be mobilised under the new provisions, although some serving military personnel and analysts have expressed concern that the law would not be effective enough in addressing the shortages. The bill signed into law on Tuesday also lacks the much tougher sanctions for draft evasion that were contained in the initial version. The draft sparked public outcry, and there were more than 4,000 amendments before the final reading in parliament. Zelenskiy recently signed a separate law cutting the draft age to 25 from 27 to secure more fighting power. Ukraine began mobilisation immediately after Russia's invasion in February 2022. The country initially saw a significant influx of volunteer fighters, but numbers later plunged, with thousands of cases of draft evasion reported since. Kyiv troops are facing a shortage of ammunition supplies, with vital funding from the U.S. blocked by Republicans in Congress for months and the EU failing to deliver munitions on time, while Russian forces are inching forward.

{"year":"2024","month":"05","event_desc":"24 May  The European Union makes a decision allowing Ukraine to use interest funds from frozen Russian bank accounts, totaling \u20ac2.5 billion ($2.7 billion) per year.","text":"Ukraine wants to use $300bn in Russian central bank money held abroad to defeat it; Europe isn\u2019t enthusiastic. A landmark EU decision this week\u00a0to send Ukraine the interest earned by hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian central bank accounts on its territory is adding urgency to a debate over what will happen to those accounts. The difference between the two sums is enormous. Ukraine wants to use the estimated 210 billion euros ($228bn) of Russian central bank money held in European institutions to defeat Russia on the battlefield. The EU froze those assets in February 2022, immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine. Another 50 billion euros ($54bn) are frozen around the world. \u201cIf the world has $300bn, why not use it?\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said. After years of debate, the bloc decided on Tuesday to allow Ukraine to use just the interest earned by those accounts, which the EU believes would amount to about 2.5 to 3 billion euros ($2.7bn-$3.3bn) a year. \u201cThis decision was the result of a lot of discussion and soul-searching,\u201d an EU diplomatic source familiar with Ukrainian issues told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. International legal experts agree it is a big step. \u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for the freezing of assets on this scale, and therefore the issue of what to do with the interest was never this acute,\u201d Anton Moiseienko, a lecturer in international law at Australian National University, told Al Jazeera. \u201cIn this sense, new ground is being broken.\u201d  The EU decision is to tap the interest twice a year and send it to Ukraine in the form of cash and weapons. This money is over and above weapons EU members have already contributed, or plan to contribute through bilateral agreements, European Commission sources told Al Jazeera. It is also separate from the 12.5 billion euros ($13.6bn) a year in financial assistance they have pledged for the next four years. A first payment is to be made in July, representing interest earned since February, when the EU ordered financial institutions to separate profits from the principal. The institutions will keep any interest earned between February 2022 and February 2024, possibly for reconstruction purposes, European Commission sources said. But what about the rest? \u201cRight now it doesn\u2019t seem as though the EU is in any way prepared to move on to a discussion about using the principal for Ukraine,\u201d the diplomatic source said. \u201cThere are European institutions that are against it and a lot of member states that are against it. The EU doesn\u2019t want to risk its reputation and its prosperity.\u201d The European Central Bank has been especially vocal about leaving other central banks\u2019 assets alone, worried about reputational damage to the euro. And some EU members like Hungary and Slovakia maintain strong economic ties with Russia and have made known their unease about alienating Moscow. That leaves matters on a plateau, said Moiseienko. \u201cIt is a placeholder, an intermediate step. But a placeholder for what?\u201d Moiseienko said. \u201cTransfer of those assets to Ukraine, or continue in this wait-and-see game? In terms of the overall direction of travel, it\u2019s very unclear.\u201d \u201cThe EU keeps saying that Russia must pay but keeps taking steps that prevent that from happening,\u201d he added.    The EU could be testing the waters for international reactions to its first move. Philippa Webb, a professor of international law at King\u2019s College London, said that Russia had a clear obligation under the law to pay Ukraine reparations for launching an aggressive war against it, but it also enjoyed immunity from most forms of enforcement. But that immunity was not absolute, she advised the European Parliament in a research paper last February. It is just a question of finding the right legal avenue to seizing the entire principal \u2013 something that would break new legal ground. Over the past two years, several ideas have been presented. One approach is to issue a loan using the Russian assets as collateral, but it would amount to much less than the assets. Another is to use a legal concept known as countermeasures, whereby a country takes a step normally considered unlawful, such as seizing sovereign assets, but is justified as a response to a previous unlawful action by the other state. In this case, Russia\u2019s unlawful act was to wage a war of aggression, against the statutes of the United Nations Charter and its recognition of Ukraine\u2019s borders in 1991. More ambitiously, the United Nations could vote to lift Russia\u2019s immunity from enforcement, creating a new international legal standard. That would require a large majority in the General Assembly, legal experts believe. Shortly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, 141 out of 193 UNGA members demanded a Russian withdrawal, marking a high point of empathy with Ukraine. As Al Jazeera has reported, Ukraine has been unable to recreate that majority to indict Russian President Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression, and it is unlikely the world would show a greater appetite for remaking international law to seize Russian assets. The EU has invited Ukraine to become a future member, and therefore assumes the greatest responsibility for its reconstruction, pointed out political scientist Theodoros Tsikas. Unwillingness or inability to harness an aggressor\u2019s assets would not only be perceived as weakness \u2013 it would not match up to the EU\u2019s claim to uphold the rule of law, he said. \u201cThe reconstruction of Ukraine and the healing of its wounds is seen as a key task for the EU,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cLike all aggressors, Russia will have to pay war reparations to Ukraine,\u201d Tsikas said. How that happens without global enthusiasm is now the subject of an intensifying debate.

{"year":"2024","month":"04","event_desc":"26 April  A court orders the arrest of agriculture minister Mykola Solskyi on a charge of illegal acquisition of land worth $7 million.","text":"President Joe Biden speaks after signing the foreign aid bill at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 24, 2024. Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images Washington CNN \u2014 President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed into law an aid package providing crucial military assistance to Ukraine, capping months of negotiations and debate. The aid package, passed by the Senate late Tuesday evening and worth $95 billion in total, includes nearly $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, $26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations \u2013 and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. The package also includes a bill that could eventually lead to the banning of TikTok in the United States - giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else it will be banned from app stores in the United States. Wearing a US-Ukrainian flag pin and speaking from the White House after signing the bill on Wednesday, Biden said it was a \u201cgood day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\u201d The aid package, Biden said, is \u201cgoing to make America safer. It\u2019s going to make the world safer. And it continues America\u2019s leadership in the world.\u201d The signing of the aid package was the culmination of months of tense negotiations, personal lobbying from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a split in the House Republican conference that continues to threaten the leadership position of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline House conservatives opposed further US funding to Kyiv and threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of the negotiations. Conservatives in Congress have opposed additional assistance for what they view as an unwinnable war. Biden had spent months lobbying Johnson to move forward with aid to Ukraine, enlisting top administration officials and CIA Director Bill Burns to lay out the stakes for Ukraine - and ultimately democracy in Europe and across the world - if Russia continued to make inroads in its military campaign there. Earlier this year, Biden signaled his intentions to make significant immigration-related concessions if Congress were to move forward with the aid bill. Republicans in Congress had demanded those concessions, but retreated from the issue after former President Donald Trump signaled his opposition to allowing Biden to claim a win on an issue Trump hopes to campaign on. He acknowledged the bumpy road to get the package passed in his remarks on Wednesday. \u201cIt was a difficult path,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt should have been easier. It should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, came together. We got it done.\u201d Spending the bulk of his remarks talking about the Ukraine aid, Biden noted that Russia has \u201cbeen responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians,\u201d Biden said, \u201cbombed hospitals \u2026 kindergartens, grain silos, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold dark winter.\u201d But left unsaid in that statement is something that is likely to cause further frustrations from Biden\u2019s left flank: Israel has also been accused of targeting hospitals in Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war and carrying out an imprecise military campaign that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, many of them children. The aid package includes billions of dollars worth of additional military equipment for that country. Some of the Democrats who voted against the bill cited the Israel aid as the reason why they did so. The final vote in the Senate was 79-18. Fifteen Republicans voted with two Democrats and an independent against the bill. Among the senators who voted against the bill was Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spent time with Biden earlier this week and said he was against further US funding of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sanders said in a post on X shortly after the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cNo more money for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu\u2019s war machine.\u201d Funding going to Ukraine quickly The bill\u2019s effects will be felt most quickly and acutely on battlefields in Ukraine, whose soldiers have faced ammunition shortages and battlefield losses in the absence of US assistance this year. Biden said the shipments of military supplies to Ukraine will begin \u201cin the next few hours,\u201d and would include air-defense equipment and munitions for artillery and rocket systems, along with armored vehicles. The Pentagon announced a $1 billion aid package would go to Ukraine just moments after Biden signed the bill into law. Among the capabilities included in the new package is ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), artillery rounds,\u00a0RIM-7 and AIM-9M air defense missiles, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and more. It also includes various logistics and tactical vehicles, anti-armor systems, training munitions and spare parts, and small arms ammunition including .50 caliber rounds to counter drones. CNN reported Tuesday that administration officials have indicated to Congress the US would send long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, a system Ukraine has long asked for. The Pentagon revealed it already sent those long-range missiles earlier this month after Biden spoke. Biden secretly approved the transfer of\u00a0the long-range missiles\u00a0in February for use inside Ukrainian territory. The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the $300 million aid package announced on March 12\u00a0and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Garron Garn. \u201cIt was not announced that we are providing Ukraine with this new capability at the time in order to maintain operational security for Ukraine at their request,\u201d Garn said, deferring questions about their use to Ukraine\u2019s military. Last fall,\u00a0the US first sent\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0the\u00a0mid-range\u00a0variant of the ATACMS missile system, which\u00a0can reach\u00a0about 100 miles,\u00a0while\u00a0the longer-range version can reach as far as 190\u00a0miles. Ukrainian officials have been\u00a0asking the US in private and in public\u00a0for the long-range missiles\u00a0to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have\u00a0previously\u00a0resisted, citing supply issues and\u00a0concerns about\u00a0further provoking Moscow\u00a0if they are deployed. Biden\u2019s campaign will continue to use TikTok Biden\u2019s campaign will still utilize TikTok to reach voters, officials say, despite Biden signing the potential ban into law. The decision underscores the fraught dynamic of the platform, which is owned by a Chinese company. While national security officials, including those in the Biden administration, have warned of its risks, it remains enormously popular with young Americans, who Biden will rely upon to win reelection. Asked Wednesday whether the campaign would continue using the app, an official said it would. \u201cA fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are \u2013 and that includes online,\u201d the official said. \u201cTikTok is one of many places we\u2019re making sure our content is being seen by voters. When the stakes are this high in the election, we are going to use every tool we have to reach young voters where they are. We are using enhanced security measures.\u201d Biden joined Tiktok earlier this year, and often posts video meant to contrast his policies with Trump, who is not on the platform. The bill Biden signed Wednesday\u00a0gives TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from \u201cinternet hosting services\u201d that support it. That would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden\u2019s decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company\u2019s made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban.

Spain has pledged 1 billion euros ($1.1bn) in military aid to Ukraine as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a security deal in Madrid. The deal \u201cincludes a commitment for 1 billion euros in military aid for 2024\u201d, Sanchez said at a joint news conference on Monday. The pact, which covers the next decade, calls for the supply of modern military equipment for ground, aerial, naval and other uses, \u201cprioritising Ukraine\u2019s key capacity needs\u201d, and an emphasis on protecting sea routes for Ukraine\u2019s food exports, but it gave no specifics. \u201cIt will allow Ukraine to boost its capabilities including its essential air defence systems to protect its civilians, cities and infrastructure, which are still suffering indiscriminate attacks as seen this weekend in Kharkiv,\u201d Sanchez said, referring to a Russian strike on the northeastern city that killed at least 16 people at a hardware hypermarket on Saturday. Zelenskyy visited the Spanish capital as Ukraine battles a Russian ground offensive in the Kharkiv region that began on May 10 and has seen Moscow make its biggest territorial advances in 18 months. With Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion now in its third year, Ukraine has been pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. Sanchez said Spain had already pledged to supply Patriot missiles but what Zelenskyy needed from Ukraine\u2019s allies was \u201cthe systems to launch these missiles\u201d. In a post on the social media platform X, Zelenskyy thanked Spain for \u201cits tangible and truly life-saving support to Ukraine in this time of war\u201d and said he also discussed how Madrid could play a role in strengthening Kyiv\u2019s air defences. Spain will send \u201canother batch of Leopard tanks and above all ammunition\u201d, Sanchez said, pledging to keep working with Kyiv \u201cto understand how else \u2013 and with what other alternative systems \u2013 we can help ensure Ukraine\u2019s air security\u201d.

{"year":"2024","month":"04","event_desc":"24 April  The United States announces a $1 billion aid package for Ukraine as part of a bill that was stalled in the US Congress for months and was recently approved. The package includes ammunition for artillery and air defense systems, along with armoured fighting vehicles.","text":"President Joe Biden speaks after signing the foreign aid bill at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 24, 2024. Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images Washington CNN \u2014 President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed into law an aid package providing crucial military assistance to Ukraine, capping months of negotiations and debate. The aid package, passed by the Senate late Tuesday evening and worth $95 billion in total, includes nearly $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, $26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations \u2013 and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. The package also includes a bill that could eventually lead to the banning of TikTok in the United States - giving Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell it or else it will be banned from app stores in the United States. Wearing a US-Ukrainian flag pin and speaking from the White House after signing the bill on Wednesday, Biden said it was a \u201cgood day for America, a good day for Ukraine and a good day for world peace.\u201d The aid package, Biden said, is \u201cgoing to make America safer. It\u2019s going to make the world safer. And it continues America\u2019s leadership in the world.\u201d The signing of the aid package was the culmination of months of tense negotiations, personal lobbying from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a split in the House Republican conference that continues to threaten the leadership position of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline House conservatives opposed further US funding to Kyiv and threatened to oust Johnson over his handling of the negotiations. Conservatives in Congress have opposed additional assistance for what they view as an unwinnable war. Biden had spent months lobbying Johnson to move forward with aid to Ukraine, enlisting top administration officials and CIA Director Bill Burns to lay out the stakes for Ukraine - and ultimately democracy in Europe and across the world - if Russia continued to make inroads in its military campaign there. Earlier this year, Biden signaled his intentions to make significant immigration-related concessions if Congress were to move forward with the aid bill. Republicans in Congress had demanded those concessions, but retreated from the issue after former President Donald Trump signaled his opposition to allowing Biden to claim a win on an issue Trump hopes to campaign on. He acknowledged the bumpy road to get the package passed in his remarks on Wednesday. \u201cIt was a difficult path,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt should have been easier. It should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, came together. We got it done.\u201d Spending the bulk of his remarks talking about the Ukraine aid, Biden noted that Russia has \u201cbeen responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians,\u201d Biden said, \u201cbombed hospitals \u2026 kindergartens, grain silos, tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold dark winter.\u201d But left unsaid in that statement is something that is likely to cause further frustrations from Biden\u2019s left flank: Israel has also been accused of targeting hospitals in Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war and carrying out an imprecise military campaign that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, many of them children.

It also includes various logistics and tactical vehicles, anti-armor systems, training munitions and spare parts, and small arms ammunition including .50 caliber rounds to counter drones. CNN reported Tuesday that administration officials have indicated to Congress the US would send long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, a system Ukraine has long asked for. The Pentagon revealed it already sent those long-range missiles earlier this month after Biden spoke. Biden secretly approved the transfer of\u00a0the long-range missiles\u00a0in February for use inside Ukrainian territory. The ATACMS missiles were then quietly included in the $300 million aid package announced on March 12\u00a0and ultimately delivered to Ukraine earlier this month, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt.

Ukrainian officials have been\u00a0asking the US in private and in public\u00a0for the long-range missiles\u00a0to target deeper behind Russian lines. American officials have\u00a0previously\u00a0resisted, citing supply issues and\u00a0concerns about\u00a0further provoking Moscow\u00a0if they are deployed.

Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from \u201cinternet hosting services\u201d that support it. That would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden\u2019s decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company\u2019s made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban.

(AP Photo\/Alex Brandon, Pool) Read More By FATIMA HUSSEIN Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia\u2019s frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral. Details of the deal were being hashed out by G7 leaders at their summit in Italy. The money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year, according to U.S. and French officials. President Joe Biden told reporters at a news conference Thursday that the move was part of a \u201chistoric agreement.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said providing a loan through Russia\u2019s assets \u201cis a vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war.\u201d Here\u2019s how the plan would work: Where would the money come from? Most of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the U.S. government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations. A French official said the loan could be \u201ctopped up\u201d with European money or contributions from other countries. The White House said Canada will loan Ukraine up to $5 billion, while European countries have expressed interest in sending as much as half of the total package. Japan has also said it intends to help fund Ukraine \u2014 though its laws require the money to go to Ukraine\u2019s budget, not its war effort. The G7 leaders\u2019 official statement also left the door open to trying to confiscate the Russian assets entirely. Why not just give Ukraine the frozen assets? That\u2019s much harder to do. For more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia. The assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia. While governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court. The EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access. Separately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act \u2014 short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act \u2014 that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out. How could the loan be used and how soon? It will be up to technical experts to work through the details. Ukraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the U.S. official said. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \u201cto provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it\u2019s capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia\u2019s continuing aggression.\u201d Another goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly. The French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \u201cvery quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\u201d Beyond the costs of the war, the needs are great. The World Bank\u2019s latest damage assessment of Ukraine , released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years. The move to unlock Russia\u2019s assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine. At an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \u201cthe fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\u201d Who would be on the hook in the case of a default? If Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \u201cthen the question of burden-sharing arises,\u201d according to the French official. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \u201cwill be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.\u201d Some nations are critical of the plan to seize Russian assets. Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told The Associated Press that the U.S. is \u201cfueling the fight and inciting confrontation.\u201d \u201cWe urge the U.S. to immediately stop slapping illegal unilateral sanctions and play a constructive role in ending the conflict and restoring peace.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Darlene Superville in Fasano, Italy, and Colleen Long aboard Air Force One en route to Italy contributed to this report.

It includes air defense, artillery ammunition and armored vehicles. Swedish Defense Minister P\u00e5l Jonsson reiterated that the country has ruled out for now sending any Swedish-built JAS 39 Gripen jets to Ukraine, saying the focus on the Ukrainian side is on implementing a F-16 fighter jet program. Several countries have said they want to donate F-16s. On Tuesday, Belgium pledged 30 F-16 jets to Ukraine. Jonsson said Sweden \u201cis still working on possibly being able to contribute with the Gripen system later.\u201d The donation also includes two Swedish-made SAAB ASCC airborne early warning and control airplanes, which Jonsson said would have the \u201cgreatest effect on the Ukrainian air defense\u201d because it would complement and reinforce the promised donations of American F-16 fighter jets. \u201cYou can identify incoming cruise missiles, you can identify drones and identify targets both on land and at sea,\u201d he said.

Russia has returned six children displaced by the war in Ukraine in a deal brokered by Qatar, according to Russian state media. TASS news agency published a video on Wednesday showing Qatar\u2019s ambassador shaking hands with the children \u2013 all male and aged between six and 17, including two brothers \u2013 in Qatar\u2019s embassy in Moscow. There was no immediate comment by Ukraine, but TASS said the event was also attended by officials representing Russia\u2019s Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova . The commissioner and Russian President Vladimir Putin are currently wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for \u201cunlawfully deporting\u201d children from Ukraine to Russia, a charge the Kremlin denies.    Ukraine believes Russia has illegally taken about 20,000 Ukrainian children and minors since its February 2022 invasion, of which fewer than 400 have been returned. Russia denies that charge, saying it has transferred them for their safety away from warzones. Some of the minors\u2019 parents were killed, while others were separated from their carers by the fast-moving front lines at the start of the war. A number of them were living in Ukrainian orphanages in areas Russia then occupied. Since last year, Qatar has led family reunification efforts following talks with both Russia and Ukraine. At Wednesday\u2019s event, TASS quoted the Qatari ambassador in Moscow as saying the Gulf state hoped to continue the cooperation. Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 16 Ukrainian children who \u201chad previously been forcibly deported\u201d to Russia were recovering in Qatar. Zelenskyy said the group was reunited with their families thanks to the Qatari mediation efforts that have helped bring back dozens of children taken during the war.

Scope is the first rating agency to cut Ukraine to this level.","text":"Dennis Shen Analyst Alvise Lennkh-Yunus Team leader Scope Ratings GmbH (Scope) has today downgraded Ukraine\u2019s long-term issuer rating in foreign currency to C, from CC, and maintained a Negative Outlook. The long-term senior unsecured debt rating in foreign currency and Eurobond securities ratings are left unchanged (CC and Negative Outlook) \u2013 reflecting uncertainty currently concerning: i) the specific instruments to experience non-payment or approve restructuring; and ii) the precise changes of terms and\/or losses to be accepted by creditors*. Ukraine\u2019s long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt-category rating in local currency and domestic-law debt instrument ratings are unchanged (CCC and Stable Outlook). In addition, the Agency has left unchanged short-term issuer ratings in local- and foreign-currency (S-4 and Stable Outlook). Download the rating report . The start of formal negotiations for near-term external commercial debt restructuring for conclusion within the coming month(s). The driver of the downgrade of the long-term issuer rating in foreign currency reflects expectation of finalisation within the coming month(s) of an external commercial debt restructuring \u2013 the proximity currently to such a distressed debt exchange being consistent with a C rating. This announcement is in line with the Agency\u2019s base-case expectation since 2022 of a second external debt restructuring by this year and is in accordance with the Agency\u2019s rating announcement dated 12 May 2023 signalling a cut of the foreign-currency issuer rating to C at this stage of formal start of commercial debt renegotiation. The Ministry of Finance announced during March of 2023 an intent for negotiations around commercial debt treatment 1 and currently targets an agreement by June (2024). The foreign-currency issuer rating is expected to be revised to a selective-default credit grade within the forthcoming period should negotiations conclude successfully in a distressed debt restructuring, resulting in changes of repayment from current contractual terms, or, alternatively, under the non-baseline scenario of no agreement being reached with creditors before a current debt-servicing freeze concludes by August of this year and Ukraine having to suspend payments unilaterally as negotiations resume. The authorities plan a full-fledged commercial debt restructuring for this year on around USD 23.6bn in Eurobonds and past due interest. If agreement around such a proposition with external commercial creditors cannot be reached under the available time before August, an interim more-moderate restructuring of the debt \u2013 such as the further deferral of Eurobond debt service for several years (per one example to 2027) \u2013 reflects an alternate scenario. Any modification of a series of notes must be approved by holders of two-thirds of the aggregate principal across all debt of the series and at least half of the bonds from each series incorporated. The International Monetary Fund has outlined goals for the restructuring of external debt 2 : i) public debt should reach 65% of GDP by 2033; ii) gross government financing needs should average 8% of GDP during the \u201cpost-programme\u201d phase (2028\u201333); and iii) as complementary objectives, public debt should be brought (down) to 82% of GDP by 2028 and achieve debt-service flow relief on external debt obligations of 1\u20131.8% of GDP a year. Achieving such targets implies significant haircuts for the Eurobond securities whether promptly this year or by 2027. The restructuring is being advanced consistent with IMF programme parameters of delivering debt sustainability under IMF baseline and the downside economic scenarios. The objective of the Ukrainian government is to access international debt markets for fresh financing after restructuring of the debt. Ukraine targets borrowing fresh debt by selling collateralised and guaranteed bonds (backed by either multilateral institutions or western sovereign governments). In addition, as a precondition for the historic USD 15.6bn IMF Extended Fund Facility approved for Ukraine in March of 2023 3 , the Group of Creditors \u2013 comprising select G-7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 agreed earlier on 21 December 2023 4 for the extension of their existing debt-service suspension until March 2027 (the month of conclusion of the present IMF programme) on the segment of loans issued to Ukraine before the 2022 Russian full-scale invasion (legacy debt), extending on an earlier termination date of earliest end-2023. The Group has urged all other official bilateral creditors to reach an agreement with Ukraine on a further debt treatment on terms at least as favourable. The Group furthermore plans to agree on and execute a comprehensive debt restructuring on this segment of legacy debt due to the Group once the conflict is stabilised or at the latest by the present conclusion of the IMF facility (2027). Excluding the debt-curtailing effects of future cuts of principal on the external commercial and bilateral-official debt, the debt-to-GDP ratio of Ukraine is projected by Scope to reach 106% by end-2027. This debt-ratio projection reflects a rise from an estimated public-debt ratio of 84.4% of GDP at end-2023 and 48.9% as of end-2021 before escalation of the war. This expectation reflects the continued expectation of the Agency of a protracted conflict. Agency projections reflect a comparatively more-pessimistic assumption than an IMF base case for the war to wind down by end-2024. Under the IMF base case \u2013 similarly excluding the effects at this stage of debt restructuring, the IMF projects general government debt peaking at 96.7% of GDP by 2025 \u2013 before easing to 93.8% by end-2027. The IMF March-2024 \u201cPre-Restructuring Downside Scenario\u201d envisions debt peaking at 135.7% by 2026 under such an adverse scenario. General-government fiscal deficits are seen remaining significant around 19% of GDP this year before 11% by next year based on rating-agency forecasting, as war-time conditions inhibit fiscal flexibility. Rating strengths: significant international financing support and an observable resilience of the domestic financial system. Near-term stresses for Ukraine\u2019s capacity for self-defence have temporarily eased after approval of USD 61bn of American military assistance, including USD 1bn to be immediately delivered 5 . This follows up to EUR 50bn to be paid out in grants and highly-concessional loans between 2024-27 under an EU financial facility approved February for Ukraine 6 . Any further suspension of debt service as part of the forthcoming restructuring of Eurobonds combined with the already-approved suspension of payment on the legacy segment of bilateral-official loans might deliver an aggregate USD 4.6bn (2.5% of GDP) of savings for Ukraine this year before a cumulative added USD 7.2bn from 2025 to the end of the IMF programme by March 2027 2 . Official reserves stand presently at record highs of USD 43.8bn. Complementing actions of the international sector, Ukraine has prudently augmented domestic-bank financing of the sovereign for sustaining an elimination of monetary financing since January 2023. Here, the resilience of the domestic financial system since escalation of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine supports creditworthiness of the domestic debt. Domestic banks have adapted and continued operating effectually although operational risks have risen from the need to adapt bank branches to power outages. Dollarisation has declined moderately, with foreign-currency deposits and loans representing around 32% and 26% of aggregate deposits and loans as of March. Because of banking-sector reforms of the previous years, as well as rapid administrative and capital controls adopted by the National Bank of Ukraine following the invasion, there have been no systemic bank runs despite the exceptionally-challenging economic conditions. However, tier 1 capital ratios moderated to 12.0% of risk-weighted assets by February 2024, from 14.9% at October-2023 highs and recapitalisations are required especially for privately-held small and medium-sized banks. Non-performing loans remain elevated (37.4% as of end-2023). *NB. Scope debt-instrument ratings are evaluated on loss given default, and issuer ratings are judged on probability-of-default bases. The Negative Outlook on the foreign-currency long-term issuer rating reflects an expectation that risks to the rating remain skewed to the downside. The upside scenario for the foreign-currency long-term issuer rating and\/or Outlook is: Downside scenario for the foreign-currency long-term issuer rating is: The Stable Outlook on the domestic-currency debt ratings reflects an opinion of risks to the domestic-debt ratings being balanced. Upside scenarios for the domestic-currency debt ratings and\/or Outlooks are if (individually or collectively): The downside scenario for the domestic-currency debt ratings and\/or Outlooks is if: Scope\u2019s SQM, which assesses core sovereign credit fundamentals, signals a first indicative credit rating of \u2018b+\u2019 on Ukraine. Under Scope\u2019s sovereign-rating methodology, this first indicative rating receives 1) no further positive adjustment from the methodological reserve-currency adjustment; and 2) a three-notch downside adjustment from the methodological political-risk quantitative adjustment, reflecting the presence of war on sovereign territory. On this basis, the final SQM quantitative rating of \u2018ccc\u2019 is assigned and next judged by the analyst Qualitative Scorecard (QS). Under the QS, this final indicative rating from the model can be changed by up to three notches up or down depending on the size of the Ukraine\u2019s qualitative credit strengths or weaknesses compared against a model-assigned peer group of sovereign states. Scope identified the following QS relative credit strengths for the Ukraine: i) monetary policy framework; ii) debt profile and market access; iii) current account resilience; iv) financial sector oversight and governance; and v) financial imbalances. Conversely, the following relative credit weaknesses have been identified under the QS: 1) macro-economic stability and sustainability; 2) long-term debt trajectory; 3) environmental factors; 4) social factors; and 5) governance factors. On aggregate, the QS generates no net adjustment for Ukraine\u2019s indicative credit rating. As such, aggregate adjustments signal a long-term issuer credit rating in local currency of CCC for Ukraine. A final two-notch downside adjustment under the additional considerations is made to the foreign-currency long-term issuer rating, reflecting formal negotiations around external commercial debt restructuring \u2013 signalling a foreign-currency long-term issuer rating of C. A rating committee has discussed and confirmed these results. Scope explicitly factors in ESG issues in its ratings process vis-\u00e0-vis the sovereign-rating methodology\u2019s stand-alone ESG sovereign-risk pillar, which holds a significant 25% weighting under the quantitative model (SQM) and 20% weight under the methodology\u2019s qualitative overlay (QS). With respect to environmental risk \u2013 Ukraine scores poorly on the SQM on carbon emissions per unit of GDP (a proxy variable for \u201ctransition costs\u201d for achieving a greener economic model long run) although Ukraine scores comparatively well on greenhouse gas emissions per capita. Ukraine scores strongly on the economy\u2019s degree of exposure and vulnerability to natural-disaster risk \u2013 as measured by the ND-GAIN Index. Ukraine\u2019s marks are, however, below-average under the SQM regarding the ecological footprint of consumption compared against available biocapacity. This results in an aggregate SQM model score for environment near a global median. Ukraine\u2019s environmental objectives and challenges are furthermore considered by the analyst under the QS through an assessment of \u2018weak\u2019 for Ukraine for the \u2018environmental factors\u2019 QS category compared against Ukraine\u2019s \u2018ccc\u2019 sovereign peer group assigned by the SQM. Ukraine plans to reduce emissions while growing its economy, reducing poverty and simultaneously combatting aggression from neighbouring Russia \u2013 aiming to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from 62% under 1990 levels as of 2019 to 65% below 1990 levels by 2030, thereafter achieving full climate neutrality not later than 2060. However, the war is triggering sizeable, long-lasting environmental and climate damage for waterways, air and soil pollution, forest destruction, and an increase in the carbon footprint because of the use of weapons \u2013 contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Socially-related credit factors are captured under the SQM as well as the QS qualitative overlay. Under the SQM, Ukraine receives a middle-of-the-road score on income inequality (as captured by the ratio of the income share held by the bottom 50% of the population), average marks on labour-force participation, and relatively-weak scoring with respect to the old-age dependency ratio. This results in a slightly under-global average SQM score for social factors. In addition, Ukraine\u2019s comparatively modest GDP per capita (estimated around USD 15,464 in 2024 on purchase-power-parity basis) as a lower-middle-income economy is captured by the SQM. A long-run decline of the working-age population undermines economic growth potential (estimated at 2.5% a year). In the QS \u2018social factors\u2019 assessment of Ukraine, Scope evaluates this qualitative analytical category as \u2018weak\u2019 compared against the credit\u2019s sovereign peers. Finally, under governance-related factors, Ukraine scores under the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs) represent a credit-rating constraint. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2021, given meaningful institutional reforms, percentile ranks had improved across WGI categories \u2013 although scores except on control of corruption have declined since 2022 compared against 2021 due to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. This WGI evaluation includes the three-notch downside adjustment for the SQM indicative rating based on the political-stability WGI category. In an assessment of Ukraine\u2019s \u2018governance factors\u2019 under the QS analyst judgments, Scope evaluates this qualitative analytical category as \u2018weak\u2019 against Ukraine\u2019s \u2018ccc\u2019 indicative sovereign peers. Rating Committee The main points discussed by the rating committee were: i) external private-debt restructuring and associated negotiations; ii) debt sustainability; iii) rating definitions in default; and iv) sovereign peers considerations.

The loosening of the restrictions marks a break from long-standing policy and comes amid growing international pressure from close US allies. But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv , and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the decision had been made following a request from Ukraine. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Prague. The top US diplomat said the request went to Biden, and he approved their use for that purpose. When asked if the door was open for the US to allow Ukraine to strike further into Russia, Blinken said the US would continue to \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d moving forward. \u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re proceeding deliberately, as well as effectively,\u201d he said. Politico was first to report the news. Kyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia. The administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or\u00a0300 kilometers , away. Ukraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia. Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration\u2019s tact this week when he noted that the US could \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d its position. A hallmark of US support for Ukraine \u201chas been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we\u2019ve adapted and\u00a0adjusted too,\u201d\u00a0Blinken\u00a0said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \u201cI am confident we will continue to do that.\u201d The previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf\u00a0Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\u201d Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \u201cSo how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\u201d Macron continued. Germany\u2019s Scholz echoed Macron\u2019s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons \u2013 including the United States \u2013 and international law. The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes. Blinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia\u2019s border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make\u00a0sure to put Ukraine in a \u201cposition where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\u201d \u201cThe US is feeling the weight of the argument,\u201d said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming. In fact, the wheels were already in motion for Biden to amend the US policy when Blinken returned to Washington two weeks ago. According to US officials, the\u00a0secretary of state\u00a0signed on to a recommendation that had been made to Biden by\u00a0national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and\u00a0Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0C.Q. Brown\u00a0in the days after\u00a0Russia launched its offensive on May 10. On a May 13 secure video conference, the trio had heard appeals from their Ukrainian counterparts and determined that it made sense to lift the US restrictions so Ukrainian forces could hit the staging areas from which Russia was launching its attacks on Kharkiv. The head of US European Command,\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Christopher Cavoli, was brought into the conversation to help finalize the details. But it would take until Thursday for the US decision to work its way through the system and go into effect. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia,\u00a0sources said.

The loosening of the restrictions marks a break from long-standing policy and comes amid growing international pressure from close US allies. But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv , and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the decision had been made following a request from Ukraine. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Prague. The top US diplomat said the request went to Biden, and he approved their use for that purpose. When asked if the door was open for the US to allow Ukraine to strike further into Russia, Blinken said the US would continue to \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d moving forward. \u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re proceeding deliberately, as well as effectively,\u201d he said. Politico was first to report the news. Kyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia. The administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or\u00a0300 kilometers , away. Ukraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia. Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration\u2019s tact this week when he noted that the US could \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d its position. A hallmark of US support for Ukraine \u201chas been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we\u2019ve adapted and\u00a0adjusted too,\u201d\u00a0Blinken\u00a0said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \u201cI am confident we will continue to do that.\u201d The previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf\u00a0Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\u201d Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \u201cSo how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\u201d Macron continued. Germany\u2019s Scholz echoed Macron\u2019s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons \u2013 including the United States \u2013 and international law. The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes. Blinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia\u2019s border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make\u00a0sure to put Ukraine in a \u201cposition where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\u201d \u201cThe US is feeling the weight of the argument,\u201d said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming. In fact, the wheels were already in motion for Biden to amend the US policy when Blinken returned to Washington two weeks ago. According to US officials, the\u00a0secretary of state\u00a0signed on to a recommendation that had been made to Biden by\u00a0national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and\u00a0Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0C.Q. Brown\u00a0in the days after\u00a0Russia launched its offensive on May 10. On a May 13 secure video conference, the trio had heard appeals from their Ukrainian counterparts and determined that it made sense to lift the US restrictions so Ukrainian forces could hit the staging areas from which Russia was launching its attacks on Kharkiv. The head of US European Command,\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Christopher Cavoli, was brought into the conversation to help finalize the details. But it would take until Thursday for the US decision to work its way through the system and go into effect. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia,\u00a0sources said. Stoltenberg\u2019s repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit \u2013 and perhaps necessity \u2013 of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits. \u201cTo deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"10 June  The United States lifts a ban on sending U.S. weaponry to Ukraine's Azov Brigade.","text":"The Biden administration will allow a Ukrainian military unit with a checkered past to use U.S. weaponry, the State Department said Monday, having lifted a ban imposed years ago amid concerns in Washington about the group\u2019s origins. The Azov Brigade, known for its tenacious but ultimately unsuccessful defense of the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol early in Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, is regarded as a particularly effective fighting force. But it was barred about a decade ago from using American arms because U.S. officials determined that some of its founders espoused racist, xenophobic and ultranationalist views, and U.N. human rights officials accused the group of humanitarian violations.\n\nNow the brigade, a onetime volunteer militia absorbed into the Ukrainian National Guard in 2015, will have access to the same U.S. military assistance as any other unit. The policy shift was disclosed as Kyiv starts the summer fighting season and faces down a Russian military that has intensified its pressure on objectives in eastern Ukraine and the country\u2019s energy infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe State Department has been unclear about the origins and timing of the restrictions on Azov. Asked Monday about a recent policy shift enabling Azov to use U.S. weapons, the department provided a statement saying that \u201cafter thorough review, Ukraine\u2019s 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade passed Leahy vetting as carried out by the U.S. Department of State.\u201d\n\nThe statement referred to the \u201cLeahy Law,\u201d which prevents U.S. military assistance from going to foreign units credibly found to have committed major human rights violations. It is named for former senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who wrote the legislation. The State Department found \u201cno evidence\u201d of such violations, its statement says.\n\nA State Department spokesman declined to answer follow-up questions, including when the ban was lifted and whether U.S. weaponry had already reached Azov personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA separate ban preventing the \u201cAzov Battalion\u201d from receiving U.S. military assistance has been written into U.S. appropriations laws for years, the result of congressional concerns about the group\u2019s origins. The State Department has said it does not believe that congressional ban should apply to Azov as it is currently constituted.\n\nThe brigade received word of a review\u2019s results in a letter from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv that said an inspection had determined it was eligible for U.S. security assistance, Lt. Col. Sviatoslav Palamar, the brigade\u2019s deputy commander, told The Washington Post on Tuesday. The brigade has not yet received any U.S. weapons but hopes to soon, he said. Its soldiers are eager for all varieties of U.S. equipment \u2014 from tanks and infantry vehicles to air defense systems.\n\nPalamar, who joined Azov Battalion in 2014, was taken prisoner in Mariupol in 2022 and later transferred to Turkey under an agreement with Moscow. He returned to Ukraine last summer with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who visited Turkey and traveled home with several Azov commanders. Their release infuriated the Kremlin, which insisted its agreement to allow them to leave Russia did not permit their return to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPalamar said he first learned his unit was banned from receiving U.S. training and weapons nearly a decade ago, when other National Guard troops were invited to train abroad and Azov was not. Instead, Azov troops downloaded NATO manuals online and taught themselves protocols from open-source materials, he said.\n\n\u201cEven through all those years there was a ban, we wouldn\u2019t stop any kind of training or stop investing into our evolution and becoming more and more professional,\u201d Palamar said.\n\nAlthough some Western weapons were delivered to Azovstal to help Ukrainian troops defend the plant, they were delivered to other troops defending the plant \u2014 not to Azov, Palamar said. Since then, his brigade \u2014 which has engaged in intense battles on the war\u2019s front line \u2014 has not received U.S. weapon systems, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanceling the ban had been a priority for Ukrainian officials, who say the brigade could have been more effective during its defense of Azovstal if it had access to U.S. equipment. A Ukrainian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of negotiations, said Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba raised the topic of the ban with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when the top U.S. diplomat visited Kyiv last month.\n\n\u201cThe decision on lifting the restrictions under the Leahy vetting process required thorough considerations and diplomatic efforts,\u201d said Ruslan Muzychuk, spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s National Guard, noting that a wide variety of units carry out operations on the front line. \u201cUnderstanding by our allies how important it is to help each of these units is another important step on the way of our struggle for independence.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has long cited racist and ultranationalist elements of the Azov Battalion as an element of his accusation that Ukrainian fighters and their rulers in Kyiv are neo-Nazis. The shift in U.S. policy has already reignited those Russian critiques.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are talking about \u2026 ultranationalist armed units,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday. \u201cSuch a sudden change in Washington\u2019s position shows that they do not bother with anyone in their attempts to suppress Russia, using the Ukrainian people as a tool in their hands. They are even ready to flirt with neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\nAzov insists that it long ago shed those associations and that both the unit and its leadership have changed since 2014. Current leaders say the brigade has been targeted by Russian propaganda. \u201cNow that the ban is lifted, it brings us to a full understanding of how poisonous Russian propaganda is,\u201d Palamar said.\n\nWithin Ukraine, the brigade\u2019s name has become synonymous with the country\u2019s last stand in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more territory. Putin\u2019s remarks came as Switzerland prepared to host scores of world leaders -- but not from Moscow -- this weekend to try to map out first steps toward peace in Ukraine. They also coincided with a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Italy and after the U.S. and Ukraine this week signed a 10-year security agreement that Russian officials, including Putin, denounced as \u201cnull and void.\u201d Putin blasted the Switzerland conference as \u201cjust another ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention, reverse the cause and effect of the Ukrainian crisis (and) set the discussion on the wrong track.\u201d His demands came in a speech at the Russian Foreign Ministry and was aimed at what he called a \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of the conflict rather than \u201cfreezing it,\u201d and stressed the Kremlin is \u201cready to start negotiations without delay.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Crimea is a focus of discussions to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so coveted Ramaphosa to meet Trump \u2018soon\u2019 to discuss strained South Africa-US relations In rare criticism of Putin, Trump urges the Russian leader to \u2018STOP!\u2019 after a deadly attack on Kyiv Broader demands for peace that Putin listed included Ukraine\u2019s recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, keeping the country\u2019s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population. All of these should be part of \u201cfundamental international agreements,\u201d and all Western sanctions against Russia should be lifted, Putin said. \u201cWe\u2019re urging to turn this tragic page of history and to begin restoring, step-by-step, the unity between Russia and Ukraine and in Europe in general,\u201d he said. Putin\u2019s remarks, made to a group of somber Foreign Ministry officials and some senior lawmakers, represented a rare occasion in which he clearly laid out his conditions for ending the war in Ukraine, but it didn\u2019t include any new demands. The Kremlin has said before that Kyiv should recognize its territorial gains and drop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in Italy for the G7 meeting, said Putin\u2019s proposal was not new and was in the form of an \u201cultimatum,\u201d comparing it to actions by Adolf Hitler in seizing territory that led to World War II. \u201cWhat Putin demands is to give them a part of our territories, those occupied and not occupied, talking about several regions of our country,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry called Putin\u2019s plan \u201cmanipulative,\u201d \u201cabsurd\u201d and designed to \u201cmislead the international community, undermine diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a just peace, and split the unity of the world majority around the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.\u201d Besides seeking to join NATO, Ukraine wants Russian forces out of its territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that was illegally annexed in 2014; the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity; and that Russia be held accountable for war crimes and for Moscow to pay reparations to Kyiv. Russia launched its a full-scale invasion in February 2022. After Ukrainian forces thwarted a Russian drive to the capital, much of the fighting has focused in the south and east, where Moscow illegally annexed four regions, although it doesn\u2019t fully control any of them. Zelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on social media there was nothing new from Putin and that the Russian leader \u201cvoiced only the \u2018standard aggressor\u2019s set,\u2019 which has been heard many times already.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak wrote on X. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that Putin \u201chas illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory. He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace.\u201d Austin added that Putin \u201cstarted this war with no provocation. He could end it today if he chose to do that.\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg added that \u201cthis is not a peace proposal. This is a proposal of more aggression, more occupation, and it demonstrates in a way that that Russia\u2019s aim is to control Ukraine.\u201d Putin insisted that Kyiv should withdraw from all four annexed regions entirely and essentially cede them to Moscow within their administrative borders. In Zaporizhzhia in the southeast, Russia still doesn\u2019t control the region\u2019s administrative capital with a pre-war population of about 700,000; in the neighboring Kherson region, Moscow withdrew from its biggest city and capital of the same name in November 2022. Putin said if \u201cKyiv and Western capitals\u201d reject his offer, \u201cit is their business, their political and moral responsibility for continuing the bloodshed.\u201d The Kremlin has repeatedly aired its readiness for peace talks with Kyiv and blamed the West for undermining its efforts to end the conflict. Putin went further Friday and claimed his troops never intended to storm Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, even though they approached the city. \u201cIn essence, it was nothing other than an operation to force the Ukrainian regime to peace. The troops were there to push the Ukrainian side to negotiate, to try and find an acceptable solution,\u201d he said. Moscow withdrew from Kyiv in March 2022 and described it a goodwill gesture as peace talks between the two began, but the pullback took place amid fierce Ukrainian resistance that significantly slowed down Russia\u2019s battlefield advances. Putin also claimed that in that same month, he told a foreign official he wasn\u2019t ruling out withdrawing forces from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and ceding occupied parts of them back to Ukraine, as long as Kyiv allowed Russia to have a \u201cstrong land connection\u201d to Crimea. He said the official planned on bringing that proposal to Kyiv \u2014 which Moscow \u201cwelcomed,\u201d as it generally welcomed \u201cattempts to find a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\u201d But the Kremlin then annexed both regions, along with the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, citing the results of sham \u201creferendums\u201d it staged there. Putin mentioned those and said, \u201cThe matter is closed forever and is no longer up for discussion.\u201d In Friday\u2019s fighting, Russian defenses shot down 87 Ukrainian drones, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said, most of them launched against the Rostov region, home to Russia\u2019s southern military command, but no deaths or damage were reported in one of the biggest Ukrainian drone barrages of the war . In Russia\u2019s Belgorod region on the border, part of a residential building collapsed in the town of Shebekino after Ukrainian shelling, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Three people were injured, he said. Ukraine\u2019s military has been on the back foot in recent months, with its troops outnumbered by the Kremlin\u2019s forces and running short of ammunition and weaponry due to delays in promised Western military aid. Russia has battered Ukraine with drones, especially its power grid. It fired 14 missiles and 17 Shahed drones overnight, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Air defense systems downed all the drones as well as seven missiles, it said. The attacks injured six people in the Donetsk region, where residential buildings were hit, officials said. A Russian drone struck a bus near the village of Esman in the northern Sumy region, injuring three women. Authorities say 20 passengers were in the bus at the time. Also Friday, Russia returned to Ukraine the bodies of 254 of its soldiers, Kyiv said.

The summit comes as G7 leaders gathering in Italy clinch a new deal for a \u20ac50bn loan for Ukraine , securitised through use of the windfall profits from the interest on Russian central bank assets frozen by the EU and other western nations after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The two-day peace conference, which will take place at the luxury B\u00fcrgenstock resort outside Lucerne, will discuss Kyiv\u2019s proposed 10-point plan to end the war along with three other themes: the nuclear threat, food security and humanitarian needs in Ukraine. It follows the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday demanding that Kyiv cede more land, withdraw troops deeper inside its own country and drop its Nato bid in order for him to end his war in Ukraine \u2013 proposals that were rejected by Ukraine, the US and Nato. A joint communique on Sunday is expected to centre on the importance of the UN principles on maintaining and respecting \u201csovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. While this is not seen as advancing peace in itself, it is designed to \u201creduce the space for any unhelpful initiatives\u201d, say those with knowledge of the conference. This will be seen as a success for Volodymyr Zelenskiy who is aiming to build international support for his peace plan that includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and return to its 1991 post-Soviet borders. Organisers of the peace summit played down China\u2019s decision not to attend, a move that prompted Zelenskiy to accuse Beijing of helping Moscow undermine the meeting, which China\u2019s foreign ministry denied. Kyiv had been pushing hard for a Chinese delegation to attend the summit to give the conference further legitimacy and drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. There were also hopes that Saudi Arabia may attend after what Zelenskiy described as \u201cproductive and energetic\u201d talks with the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday. Moscow has dismissed the meeting as futile. China, which has close ties to Russia , said it would not attend because the conference did not meet its requirements, including the participation of Russia. That dozens of leaders will be in Switzerland at a time when Ukraine is on the back foot militarily, and with talk of war fatigue growing, is an impressive feat, senior US figures said. \u201cIt\u2019s rather remarkable that there\u2019s 100 countries showing up to a peace summit at which the main instigator of that conflict is not participating,\u201d said Max Bergmann, a former US state department official. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

William Courtney, a former US diplomat, called the Swiss outreach a \u201chuge success\u201d. The summit follows several previous gatherings, including one in Saudi Arabia attended by 40 countries including China, which has been trying to enlist support for its own six-point peace plan. As the summit approaches, China has intensified its outreach through meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries, phone calls and messages to foreign missions on China\u2019s WeChat platform, diplomats told Reuters reporters. But sources said organisers were not concerned, as there had been \u201cno concretisation\u201d of any Chinese diplomatic manoeuvres, with many global south countries, including Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Ecuador, attending on Saturday. Others attending include Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Japan, while Malaysia and Cambodia, which have close ties to China, are not thought to be going.

Harris unveiled the package while attending a two-day Ukraine peace summit in\u00a0Switzerland. She said the package includes $500 million in new funding for energy assistance and the redirecting of another previously announced $324 million toward emergency energy funding. \"This funding will repair energy infrastructure damaged in the war, expand power generation, encourage private sector investment, and protect energy infrastructure,\" the White House said in a statement Saturday. \"These efforts will help Ukraine respond to Russia\u2019s latest attacks on Ukraine energy infrastructure by supporting repair and recovery, improving Ukraine\u2019s resilience to energy supply disruptions, and laying the groundwork to repair and expand Ukraine\u2019s energy system.\" Harris also announced that, working with the U.S. Congress, the State Department plans to provide an additional $300 million in Ukrainian civilian security assistance to support life-saving equipment for Ukrainian border guards and law enforcement, according to the statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging allies to provide increased assistance as Moscow has stepped up attacks recently in the Kharkiv area.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"20 June  Ukraine is moved to the top of the US list in receiving ordered deliveries of Patriot missile systems.","text":"A Patriot missile mobile launcher is displayed outside the Fort Sill Army Post near Lawton, Okla., on Tuesday, March 21, 2023. Sean Murphy\/AP CNN \u2014 The Biden administration\u00a0is\u00a0prioritizing\u00a0critical air defense\u00a0capabilities\u00a0for Ukraine over other countries to \u201censure Ukraine\u2019s survival\u201d as Russia continues its brutal assault on the country with no end in sight ,\u00a0a senior White House official and congressional sources told CNN. A senior White House official described\u00a0the action as a \u201crather extraordinary\u201d policy adjustment at\u00a0a\u00a0critical moment for Ukraine.\u00a0The deliveries to Ukraine will begin this summer, and it is not immediately clear how many countries are impacted. Prior to the decision,\u00a0Ukrainian officials had clearly explained to the Biden administration that additional air defenses were critically needed as Russia continued its aerial assaults against its\u00a0cities and civilian infrastructure. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t do this for Ukraine, they would not have been able to maintain their critical air defense stockpile heading into the winter, period,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is a decision that\u2019s being made to ensure that they\u2019re able to defend themselves against these relentless Russian missile and drone attacks.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked President Joe Biden for the move later on Thursday. \u201cI am deeply grateful to @POTUS [President of the United States] and the United States for prioritising Ukraine in the delivery of air defenses that we critically need to defeat Russian attacks,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on X . \u201cThe partnership between Ukraine and the United States is strong and unwavering. Together, we are protecting life against terror and aggression,\u201d Zelensky added. Putting Ukraine at the top of the list to begin receiving\u00a0\u201csufficient quantities\u201d of\u00a0these critical air defense capabilities \u2013 specifically the Patriot and NASAM interceptors \u2013 means that the US slid down other countries that were already in the\u00a0queue\u00a0to receive the weapons, the sources said. State Department and Pentagon officials are engaged in an \u201cintensive diplomatic effort\u201d to inform the affected countries that they will receive the interceptors on delayed timelines, the\u00a0White\u00a0House official said. Ukraine is expected to get its first exports of the air defense capabilities this summer and the policy change will stay\u00a0in place\u00a0for 16 months, the official said. The other countries will\u00a0then\u00a0get the interceptors they ordered. Late last week, Pentagon and State Department\u00a0officials\u00a0briefed congressional leadership on the policy change, but refused to tell them which countries would be impacted, creating frustration. That information has\u00a0yet to be shared\u00a0with Congress, sources said. The White House official would not share the list of\u00a0affected\u00a0countries, other than to say that air defense exports to Taiwan would not be impacted. \u201cSo far,\u00a0at least in the private discussions,\u00a0many of these countries have understood and appreciated the necessity of this decision,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf any of our partners were in an existential situation like the one that Ukraine is in right now, we would move heaven and earth to help them and it just so happens that right now that country is Ukraine.\u201d The change is the latest shift from the Biden administration to ensure that Ukraine can continue to defend itself in the face of Russia\u2019s ongoing assault. Last month,\u00a0Biden\u00a0gave permission to\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0to strike inside Russian territory with American munitions, breaking from long-standing US policy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0though he restricted their use. The move is being done in parallel with Biden administration efforts to get Ukraine more air defense systems as well, a second White House official said. It\u00a0also\u00a0comes as the Biden administration adapts its policy approach to the conflict to account for evolving battlefield needs, and as NATO and the G7 are shoring up assistance to Ukraine amid uncertainty over November\u2019s US presidential election. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has threatened to cut US support for Ukraine, and the country\u2019s war effort was seriously hindered when Republicans in Congress stalled a major military aid package for months until it was eventually passed in April. Monthslong\u00a0effort in the making The idea to adjust\u00a0the global list was first raised internally by\u00a0national\u00a0security\u00a0adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan in mid-April when Russia was intensifying its air campaign against Ukraine\u00a0and Congress had not yet passed a supplemental defense package with aide for the country. Around the same time,\u00a0a lack of air defenses meant Ukraine was powerless to prevent a\u00a0Russian\u00a0airstrike that destroyed the biggest power plant in Kyiv region, President\u00a0Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky said. The Pentagon proposed options after months of internal processes\u00a0to examine how the change could be made.\u00a0The\u00a0plan to put Ukraine at the top of the list was finalized in late May. \u201cOur message to Russia is that if they think they can outlast Ukraine in this war, they\u2019re mistaken,\u201d the official said, adding, \u201cwe are now effectively mobilizing our defense industrial capacity in order to get air defense interceptors that are rolling off the line straight to Ukraine, which will provide them with sufficient quantities to be able to defend against Russian air missile attacks for the foreseeable future.\u201d Biden shared the news with Zelensky last week when they met on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy, the official said. The pair also announced that the US and Ukraine had signed\u00a0a bilateral security pact that\u00a0commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"The European Court of Human Rights unanimously finds Russia guilty of systematic violations of human rights in Crimea.","text":"Ukraine wins its first interstate case against Russia over systematic violations of human rights on its occupied peninsula. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has found Russia guilty of systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine\u2019s occupied Crimean peninsula. The verdict on Tuesday in the first interstate case brought by Ukraine against Russia over Crimea said that the rights breaches starting in February 2014, when Moscow occupied and annexed the peninsula , included violations of the right to life, inhuman or degrading treatment, the prohibition of freedom of religion and freedom of expression, among others. The court based in Strasbourg, France, said in its unanimous judgement that there was sufficient evidence \u2013 corroborated by a range of witness testimony and reports from nongovernmental organisations \u2013 to find Russia guilty \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. It said the \u201cincidents had been sufficiently numerous and interconnected\u201d and amounted to a \u201csystem of violations\u201d. The court ordered Russia \u201cto take measures as soon as possible for the safe return of the relevant prisoners transferred from Crimea to penal facilities located on the territory of the Russian Federation\u201d. The impact of the decision is likely to be limited as Russia refuses to recognise the judgements of the court. The country was expelled from the Council of Europe in the wake of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As a result, it is no longer a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the court in Strasbourg enforces. However, the court can still rule on incidents that occurred before Russia\u2019s expulsion. The case in question on Tuesday dates back to March 2014. A top Ukrainian presidential official hailed the ruling as \u201ca great achievement\u201d of international jurisprudence. \u201cUkraine has become closer to restoring justice,\u201d Iryna Mudra, deputy head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office, said on X. Margarita Sokorenko, Ukraine\u2019s representative for the ECHR, said the ruling \u201cessentially nullified Russia\u2019s ten-year narrative that human rights are respected in Crimea\u201d. \u201cThis is a crushing decision of the ECHR for the aggressor! The ECHR recognised that the government of Ukraine has proven the existence of systematic violations of our citizens since the beginning of Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea in February 2014,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. The government of Ukraine argued in this case that since February 27, 2014, Russia exercised a campaign of repression against non-Russians in Crimea that included disappearances, illegal detentions, ill-treatment, the inability to renounce Russian citizenship, the suppression of the Ukrainian media and the functioning of the Ukrainian language in schools, as well as the transfer from Crimea to remote prisons in Russia. Russia had previously denied accusations it violated human rights and oppressed political opponents on the peninsula. It stopped participating in the ECHR proceedings in 2022.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"21 June  Israel and Ukraine mutually impose travel restrictions to each others' citizens, preventing reciprocal visa-free travel without an authorization permit.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance Israel will soon impose new travel restrictions on Ukrainians, leading Ukraine to impose similar requirements in response, Ukraine's Embassy in Israel announced on June 20. From July 1, Ukrainians who want to enter visa-free to Israel need to first apply for an electronic travel authorization (ETA) permit. \"The latest requirement effectively ends the visa-free regime\" that has been in place since 2010, the Ukrainian Embassy in Israel said. \"In response, Ukraine will impose similar pre-approval requirements for Israeli citizens.\" The new rules will impact the thousands of Hasidic Jews who travel to Uman in Cherkasy Oblast, a major pilgrimage site, to mark Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. \"Ukraine remains open to dialogue with Israel to discuss and negotiate these travel policy changes for the benefit of both nations,\" the embassy said, but noted that \"recent Israeli actions, such as restricting Ukrainian refugees and denying entry to many Ukrainians,\" has strained relations. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in September 2023 that he had raised the issue of Ukrainians being refused entry to Israel during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Zelensky highlighted the \"number of refusals for Ukrainian citizens to enter Israel under the visa-free regime.\" Reports emerged over the summer that around 10% of Ukrainians are denied entry to Israel, despite the visa-free regime. Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to Israel Yevhen Korniichuk said on Aug. 21 that Kyiv was considering suspending the visa-free travel regime in response. There is a large Ukrainian community in Israel , estimated by the Foreign Ministry as being around 500,000, most of whom left Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The vast majority of them are Jews from Ukraine. In addition, some 15,000 - 40,000 Ukrainian refugees have entered Israel since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. It is unclear what their status is, or how many have stayed in the country. Zelensky: Ukraine recognizes both Israel and Palestine, seeks to end suffering of civilians When asked by a journalist about Kyiv\u2019s denouncement of Hamas, President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine also offered to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and said that the two periods should \u201cnot be mixed together.\u201d The Kyiv Independent Martin Fornusek Authors: Elsa Court , The Kyiv Independent news desk Most popular 1 .

Security officials described a plan that would have begun with a protest before shifting to an attempt to seize the Parliament building. Credit... Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times By Marc Santora Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine July 1, 2024 Ukraine\u2019s security service said on Monday that it had foiled yet another Russian plot to stir public unrest and then use the ensuing turmoil to topple the government, outlining a familiar tactic that Kyiv claims has been employed in a string of coup attempts in recent years. The Ukrainian domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., said that it had discovered a \u201cgroup\u201d of conspirators it accused of planning to spark a riot, seize the Parliament building and replace the nation\u2019s military and civilian leadership. Four people have been arrested and charged, according to the authorities. While offering little detail on how such an ambitious plan could have succeeded, officials said it was a reminder that more than two years after launching a full-scale invasion of the country, the Kremlin remained determined to bring down President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government by any means. On the battlefield, Russia continues to send tens of thousands of new soldiers to the front to replace those killed in the hopes of exhausting Ukraine\u2019s military and Kyiv\u2019s Western backers. At the same time, Russia\u2019s relentless bombardment of Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure is designed, in part, to throttle the economy and undermine the state\u2019s ability to function. The Kremlin has also long been directing more covert campaigns aimed at destabilizing the government in Kyiv, according to Ukrainian and Western officials, in some cases attempting to stir discontent with disinformation. The plot outlined by Ukraine\u2019s domestic intelligence agency and prosecutors on Monday fit squarely in that pattern. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more June 25 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine each handed back 90 prisoners of war on Tuesday in the latest of several periodic swaps in their 28-month-old conflict, with the United Arab Emirates overseeing the exchange as an intermediary. The last exchange took place on May 31, when each side handed over 75 prisoners of war, also with the UAE acting as a go-between. That was the first exchange in nearly four months. Sign up here. Russia said prisoners brought home on Tuesday had faced mortal danger in captivity. Ukraine said returnees had included soldiers who had defended the Azovstal steel mill in a three-month siege in 2022 and others taken prisoner when Russian forces briefly seized the defunct Chornobyl nuclear power station. The UAE said its action as a go-between had been made possible by maintaining good contacts with both sides. The Russian Defence Ministry, in a posting on the Telegram messaging app, said: \"As a result of negotiations, 90 Russian prisoners of war who risked death in captivity are being returned from areas under Kyiv's control.\" It said the Russian prisoners were able to return home \"with the United Arab Emirates participating as an intermediary in a humanitarian capacity\". The freed Russian prisoners were being flown to Moscow, where they would undergo medical checks, the ministry said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said most of the freed servicemen were privates and sergeants, and the swap was another step in the process of bringing all detainees home. \"We will return all others in the same way,\" he said in his nightly video address. \"We are seeking the truth about everyone -- where a person is, in what condition, what is needed for their return.\" He thanked the UAE for facilitating the exchange and pledged to press on with efforts to bring home those still being held. Ukraine's parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said those returning from captivity would undergo medical checks and receive help in resuming their lives. Video posted on the president's Telegram channel showed men stepping off a bus to be greeted and handed blue and yellow national flags to drape over their shoulders. The UAE Foreign Ministry, in a statement quoted by the state news agency WAM, said mediation had proved successful because it had leveraged \"its distinct ties and partnership with both sides, including as a reliable mediator among both parties\". Since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, the UAE has maintained neutral rhetoric on the conflict and continued mediating between the two sides to exchange prisoners.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"27 June  President Zelenskyy signs a law establishing English as an official language of international communication in Ukraine.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law on June 26 establishing English as an official language of international communication in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian parliament's website. The law defines specific positions that require knowledge of English and establishes protocols for using English in various government and public sector offices. Zelensky submitted a bill on the English language to the Verkhovna Rada , Ukraine's parliament, back in 2023. The parliament passed it on June 4 in the second reading, adding an amendment to provide budgetary support for movie theaters that show English-language films . The draft law was first passed by parliament in November 2023 and excluded a controversial amendment that would have ended the common practice of dubbing English-language films into Ukrainian. A study conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in March 2023 found that 51% of respondents said they had some knowledge of English , but only 23% said they could read, write, and communicate at everyday levels. The survey also found that an overwhelming majority (93%) of parents with children under the age of 18 wanted their children to improve their level of English. Another 51% of parents said their children were learning English in school, and 27% said they were learning in school and had additional time spent outside of school. Polish was the second most common foreign language reported, with 22% of respondents saying they had some level of knowledge, followed by German at 14%. The Russian language was not included in the survey.

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"Kazakh opposition activist Aydos Sadykov dies of injuries sustained after being shot in Kyiv on 18 June.","text":"Wife of journalist Aydos Sadykov blames Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for attack in Kyiv last month. A Kazakh dissident has died in Ukraine, two weeks after being shot outside his home last month. Kyiv-based journalist Aydos Sadykov was shot in the head while seated in a car with his wife on June 18. Ukrainian prosecutors suspect that the \u201ccarefully planned\u201d attack was carried out by a pair of suspected assassins from Kazakhstan. Sadykov\u2019s wife, Natalya Sadykova, blamed Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for the death of her husband, who was an outspoken critic of the Central Asian country\u2019s leadership. \u201cMy beloved husband, father of our three children, great son of the Kazakh people. Aydos dedicated his life to Kazakhstan and suffered martyrdom at the hands of killers,\u201d Sadykova said in a Facebook post. \u201cHis death is on Tokayev\u2019s conscience,\u201d she declared. According to the office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, two Kazakh citizens, one of them a former policeman, are suspected of shooting Sadykov. Both left the country on the same day, they say, escaping to Moldova. While Kazakhstan has since detained one of the suspects, named as Altai Zhakanbayev, it has said it would not hand him over to Ukraine. The second suspect remains at large. President Tokayev instructed Kazakh law enforcement agencies to cooperate with Ukraine to locate the suspects, his spokesperson said last month, according to Russian news agencies. \u201cAstana is ready to cooperate with Ukraine, including through Interpol,\u201d the spokesperson was cited as saying. Human Rights Watch has called for an investigation into the shooting of Sadykov, who ran a YouTube channel often critical of Kazakhstan\u2019s former president Nursultan Nazarbayev and then his successor Tokayev. \u201cThe news of the attack on Sadykov during broad daylight in the Kyiv city centre is deeply disturbing,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch last month. \u201cUkrainian authorities should ensure Sydykov\u2019s safety, identify the attacker, bring them to justice, and determine who ordered the attack. Kazakhstan should show it is committed to the rule of law during this process.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","question":"Who was Aydos Sadykov and what happened to him in June 2024?","answer":"Aydos Sadykov was a Kazakh opposition activist and journalist who was shot in the head in Kyiv on June 18, 2024, and later died from his injuries.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u0425\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0410\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0456 \u0449\u043e \u0437 \u043d\u0438\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044f \u0443 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0410\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0430 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u044f\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e 18 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u044f 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456, \u0456 \u043f\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0456\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0456\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0432\u0456\u0434 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043c.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0410\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0456\u044f\u0447\u0435\u043c \u0456 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c, \u044f\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0432 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456. \u0423 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0454\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0443 \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456 \u2014 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0443 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044f \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0443. \u041f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f \u043a\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0445 \u0434\u043d\u0456\u0432 \u0443 \u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0456 \u0410\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0432\u0456\u0434 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides a detailed description of \u0410\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0441 \u0421\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, identifying him as a Kazakh opposition journalist, public figure, and blogger living in Ukraine.

The southern German town of Wiesbaden, known for spas and hot springs, will now serve as a site of NATO's efforts to support the Ukrainian military. There, NATO has launched a new command centre to plan, coordinate, and arrange the delivery of security assistance for Ukraine. The command centre, located at a former US Army base, will coordinate training and equipment donations to Ukraine and will be organised and led by a three-star general. It\u2019s the centrepiece of the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine plan, which was announced when alliance leaders met for an anniversary summit in Washington last week. The base will comprise approximately 700 personnel from NATO allied nations and select partners. NATO says the command centre in Germany will enhance its support of Ukraine but not make the alliance a party to the conflict. A Ukrainian MP within President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s party, who is also fighting in the military, said the centre is an extremely welcomed sign. \u201cWe must certainly meet those people who have produced those munitions and try to train us,\" said Servant of the People party's Sviatoslav Yurash, explaining how NATO training has been invaluable on the frontline. The centre was discussed at last week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington when the alliance also declared that Ukraine was on an irreversible path to membership of the organisation. One foreign policy expert cautioned that although positive, there were potential limits to the extent the alliance would allow Ukraine to enter. \u201cIt will hopefully inspire confidence in NATO\u2019s support for Ukraine but at the same time, everyone knows including Ukrainian politicians that US domestic politics will decide Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership,\u201d said Leonard Schuette, senior researcher at Munich Security Conference. Officials have stated that Ukraine could only enter the alliance once the war with Russia on its territory was over. During the summit, the US also announced it would deploy long-range missiles in Germany. When fully developed, these conventional\u00a0long-range fire units will include SM-6, Tomahawk, and developmental hypersonic weapons, which have significantly longer ranges than current land-based systems in Europe. Green MP Sebastian Schaefer, who sits on the parliamentary defence committee, told Euronews that Germany should focus on re-arming itself. \u201cThis is one of the realities of the 21st century. It\u2019s not a very good thing to see, but it\u2019s just necessary. It would be much wiser if we would live together in peace on this planet.

REUTERS\/Alexander Ermochenko Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BRUSSELS, July 3 (Reuters) - NATO allies have agreed to fund military aid for Ukraine with 40 billion euros ($43 billion) next year, two Western European diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday, a week before the alliance's leaders are set to meet in Washington. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had asked allies to make a multi-year commitment to keep military aid for Kyiv at the same level as that since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, adding up to about 40 billion euros a year. Sign up here. While the member states did not back Stoltenberg's original request for such a multi-year pledge, the pact includes a provision to re-evaluate allied contributions at future NATO summits, according to a diplomat. Allies also decided to have two reports over the next year to establish which country supplies what to Ukraine, the diplomat said, to meet demands for more transparency over the burden sharing in the alliance. Member states \"will aim to meet this pledge through proportionate contributions\", the agreement said. The financial pledge is part of a broader Ukraine package that NATO leaders will agree when they gather for the Washington summit from July 9 to 11. In June, allies decided that NATO would assume a greater role in co-ordinating arms supplies to Ukraine, taking over from the United States in a bid to safeguard the process as NATO-sceptic Donald Trump seeks a second term as U.S. president. After Russia's invasion in 2022, the United States gathered like-minded nations at the Ramstein air base in Germany, forming a group of nations that now numbers about 50, which meets regularly to match Kyiv's arms requests with pledges of donors. This so-called Ramstein group will continue to exist as a U.S.-led political forum but NATO will take over the military working level below that co-ordinates arms deliveries and training for Ukrainian troops. The move is widely seen as a way to provide a degree of \"Trump-proofing\" by putting co-ordination under a NATO umbrella, giving the alliance a more direct role in the war against Russia, while stopping well short of committing its own forces. But diplomats acknowledge such a move may have limited effect, as the United States is NATO's dominant power and provides the majority of weaponry to Ukraine. So if Washington wanted to slash Western aid to Kyiv, it would still be able to do so. However, allies are still at odds in the run-up to the Washington summit over whether, and how, to strengthen NATO's wording on Ukraine's future membership in the alliance. NATO's official line is that Ukraine will join one day, but not while the country is at war. \"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" its leaders declared at last year's Vilnius summit. Some allies want this language to be strengthened, suggesting the summit declare that Ukraine's path to membership is \"irreversible\", according to diplomats.

I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiations.\" While praising Ukraine's peace initiatives, Orban said that they take \"too long.\" Zelensky dismissed Orban's proposal, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Ihor Zhovkva said . \"The President of Ukraine listened to him, but in response, he stated Ukraine's position \u2013 clear, understandable, and well-known,\" Zhovkva added. Kyiv previously rejected a temporary break to hostilities, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces. Instead, Ukraine organized a global peace summit in Switzerland in June without Russia's participation to consider possible steps toward peace. Orban and Zelensky also addressed long-standing issues between the two countries and steps toward improving relations. Orban's first visit to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion comes as Hungary takes over the European Union's rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union .

(Andrew Kravchenko\/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Budapest has repeatedly opposed Ukraine's accession to NATO and the EU, sanctions on Russia, undermined Western aid efforts for Ukraine, and maintained close relations with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. This has led to deteriorating relations between Ukraine and Hungary, which had already been strained before 2022. Following their bilateral talks, Zelensky and Orban told journalists that their meeting was an important step toward solving long-standing problems between the two countries. \"The content of our talks today can become the basis for a future bilateral agreement between our states, which will regulate our relations,\" Zelensky said, as reported by European Pravda . \"We want to establish relations between our countries and to sign a cooperation agreement with Ukraine similar to those Hungary has already signed with other neighbors,\" Orban noted. The Hungarian prime minister also offered support for modernizing Ukraine and praised progress in resolving the issues of the Hungarian minority in the country Orban and Zelensky also agreed to open the first school for Ukrainian-speaking children in Hungary. The previous day, unnamed sources in Budapest told the Guardian that the visit was confirmed after negotiations on the rights of the ethnic Hungarian minority living in Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent Martin Fornusek US to announce $2.3 billion military aid package to Ukraine 'soon' Washington is preparing to announce \"soon\" a military aid package for Ukraine worth more than $2.3 billion, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on July 2, Voice of America (VOA) reported. Austin made the announcement during a meeting with Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Washington. The Pentagon chief said that the package will include air defense missiles, anti-tank weapons \"and other critical munitions from U.S. stockpiles,\" VOA reported . According to late June reports, the U.S. was preparing to announce new assistance for Kyiv worth about $150 million . The new package could include HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) rockets, anti-armor weaponry, small arms and grenades, as well as 155 mm and 105 mm artillery shells, as well as HAWK air defense interceptors, several media outlets reported, citing their unnamed sources. President Volodymyr Zelensky tasked Umerov to \"receive specific dates for the delivery of additional Patriot systems \" that Ukraine has agreed on with its partners, he said in his evening address on July 2. Washington announced in June it had deprioritized the near-term planned deliveries of foreign military sales to other countries, particularly Patriot and NASAMS missiles , to supply them to Ukraine first. In April, the U.S. Senate passed a long-awaited aid package, which included $61 billion in military aid to Ukraine. The Pentagon announced on April 26 that it was ready to move forward with sending $1 billion worth of weapons to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles. The U.S. subsequently sent three other aid packages in the following months, authorizing a $400 million defense aid package, followed by $275 million and $225 million aid packages. Over the winter months, Ukraine suffered a critical shortage of artillery shells, in large part due to delays in U.S. military aid. Russia has taken advantage of this, taking the city of Avdiivka in February. Warsaw, Berlin agree to boost defense cooperation, coordination on Ukraine aid Germany and Poland have reaffirmed their security cooperation in a joint action plan, Reuters reported on July 2. The Kyiv Independent Kateryna Hodunova Ukraine hit ammunition depot in Russian-occupied Crimea, Air Force confirms The Ukrainian Air Force struck an ammunition depot in Russian-occupied Crimea on July 1, Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk reported on July 2. \"Once again, Ukrainian aircraft 'destroyed' by enemy propaganda continue to successfully perform combat missions, launch missile and bomb attacks on occupied positions, and eliminate important military facilities in the enemy's deep rear,\" Oleshchuk wrote on Telegram . Oleshchuk's statement comes after news about explosions on July 1 in Balaklava , a municipal district of the city of Sevastopol. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Russian proxy leader in Sevastopol , claimed that air defenses were operating in the city. Razvozhayev claimed that according to the preliminary data, five air targets were destroyed near Balaklava, \"but the wreckage fell in the coastal zone.\" No casualties were reported. Telegram channel Crimean Wind shared a photo reportedly taken by locals showing a tall column of smoke rising above Balaklava, presumably near a local thermal power plant. Explosions were also reported in the area of Cape Fiolent, Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty's Krym Realii project reported . Oleshchuk did not specify which settlement the ammunition depot was hit in. Ukraine has carried out multiple successful attacks against Russian targets in occupied Crimea and its vicinity, heavily degrading the Russian Black Sea Fleet . Ukrainian forces struck around 15 air defense systems in Russian-occupied Crimea over the past two months, Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported on June 17. As Russian tank losses in Ukraine continue to mount, here\u2019s what you need to know Russian losses in Ukraine recently passed another milestone, with the total number of \u201ctanks\u201d claimed destroyed by Kyiv passing the 8,000 mark. As of July 1, the figure stands at 8,099, according to the General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia The Kyiv Independent Chris York Active Russia-Ukraine front line has expanded, Syrskyi says The active Russia-Ukraine front line has recently expanded as intense fighting continues in the areas of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, Ukraine's Chief Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said on July 2. He added that the intensity of fighting in other segments of the front line has recently decreased. The Toretsk sector in Donetsk Oblast has become another hotspot in recent weeks, the general said. Fierce fighting of different intensity is also ongoing in the Kurakhove, Vremivka, Kramatorsk and Kharkiv sectors, according to Syrskyi . Moscow's troops have increased their attacks near the town of Toretsk in June after a \"long lull\" in fighting in the area. Russia carried out 17 attacks in this direction, Ukraine's General staff said in its latest update on July 2. The situation in the Pokrovsk sector is difficult, according to Syrskyi. Russia wants to break through Ukraine's defenses and has rotated strike units, removing the units \"whose assault forces have completely lost their combat capability,\" Syrskyi said . \"Despite the reinforcement of our units with reserves, this area requires constant attention and additional ammunition and firepower,\" he added. The key problem for Ukrainian commanders are \"manning units with motivated, well-trained military,\" Syrskyi said, as well as providing soldiers with modern electronic warfare and air defense equipment capable of effectively countering Russian drones. \"We have an advantage in the number and quality of combat copters, primarily bombers and FPV drones , and the skill of the operators who use them. This is the key to our success and the safety of our soldiers,\" Syrskyi said. Ukraine\u2019s defense of Kharkiv \u2018unconditional success,\u2019 says ex-Polish defense minister In an interview with Ukrinform, Janusz Onyszkiewicz said it raised hopes that Moscow\u2019s forces would not launch another offensive in northern Ukraine, including an attack from the territory of Belarus. The Kyiv Independent Chris York NATO plans to establish new post in Kyiv, 'Trump-proof' Ukraine aid, WSJ reports NATO plans to establish a senior representative post in Kyiv, as well as a new command in Germany to coordinate assistance for Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on July 1, citing U.S. and allied officials. This is part of the alliance's effort to safeguard long-term aid for Ukraine should Donald Trump return to the White House after the U.S. presidential election later this year, the outlet wrote. Ex-President Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, has repeatedly criticized NATO and assistance for Kyiv . The new measures, which are expected to be announced at the upcoming NATO summit in Washington, will involve the new command center in Germany's Wiesbaden coordinating the flow of military equipment and the training of Ukrainian soldiers, the WSJ wrote. The steps should help better coordinate the assistance and bring the Ukrainian military closer to NATO standards. Allied leaders previously said that the July 9-11 Washington summit would contain \" new language \" on Ukraine's NATO prospects and focus on a roadmap toward its eventual membership. Ukraine also hopes to secure \"guaranteed\" military funding commitment from NATO allies. While no decision has been reached so far, outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg proposed to provide Ukraine with at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support each year \"for as long as necessary.\" Russia starts to chair UN Security Council in July, Ukraine not on agenda Each of the 15 members of the UN Security Council, including Russia, holds the presidency for a month.

Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi issued a public call for renewed diplomacy with the E3 -- France, Germany, and the UK -- amid mounting tensions and their exclusion from ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States. In a post on X on April 24, Araqchi acknowledged that relations with the E3 are \u201ccurrently down,\u201d describing the status quo as \u201close-lose\u201d for both sides. He emphasized that \u201cplacing blame is a futile exercise\u201d and instead urged a return to dialogue and cooperation, not only on nuclear issues but across all areas of mutual interest. Araqchi offered to visit Paris, Berlin, and London for direct talks. \u201cThe ball is now in the E3's court,\u201d the Iranian foreign minister wrote, \u201chow we act at this critical junction is likely to define the foreseeable future.\u201d The foreign minister\u2019s outreach comes as the E3 have been sidelined from the latest round of nuclear negotiations, which are being mediated by Oman rather than European powers. The E3 were key players in earlier efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, but this time they've been sidelined. The E3 have threatened to trigger the re-imposition of UN sanctions on Iran if no agreement is reached with the United States by the end of June. The \u201csnapback\u201d of UN sanctions is a provision under the effectively defunct 2015 nuclear deal, which formally expires in October. Iranian state media have welcomed the E3\u2019s exclusion, with The Tehran Times even accusing them -- without evidence -- of backing UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi for secretary-general in exchange for helping to \u201cdemonize\u201d Iran and justify a return to UN sanctions. Read more April 24, 2025 By RFE\/RL's Radio Mashaal India, Pakistan Tensions Rise After Tit-For-Tat Moves Following Deadly Kashmir Attack Protesters in New Delhi hold placards during a protest march toward the Pakistan High Commission condemning the Kashmir attack on April 24. ISLAMABAD -- Tensions between India and Pakistan are threatening to boil over as the two countries trade diplomatic and economic measures following a deadly attack in the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir that has raised fears of another military escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals. India downgraded its ties with Pakistan on April 23 and accused it of supporting \"cross-border terrorism\" a day after 26 people were killed by gunmen at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. A little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack. Twenty-five of those killed were Indian nationals. The attack and its fallout risk inflaming ties between India and Pakistan, which both claim authority over the region. SEE ALSO: What's Behind The New Wave Of Violence In Pakistan's Balochistan? Among other punitive measures taken against Islamabad, New Delhi closed the main border crossing linking the two countries, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and ordered some Pakistani visa holders to leave within 48 hours. India also announced the suspension of the six-decade old Indus Waters Treaty, which shares water between the two countries. Pakistan has denied any involvement and responded with countermeasures of its own on April 24, suspending visas for some Indian nationals and expelling certain Indian diplomats and defense officials from the country. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also called for a \"credible investigation\" into the attack and said \"India must resist the temptation to exploit such tragic incidents to its advantage.\" SEE ALSO: Pakistan's Internet 'Firewall' Aimed At Crushing Dissent Upends Livelihoods He also hit back with a stern warning about New Delhi's suspension of the water-sharing treaty. \"Pakistan vehemently rejects the Indian announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance,\" Sharif said in a statement following the convening of the country's National Security Council on April 24. \"Any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty\u2026will be considered as an Act of War and responded with full force,\" the statement added. The April 22 attack marks the area's worst assault on civilians in years and could bring a new wave of unrest to the region claimed by both Pakistan and India that has been the epicenter of an often-violent territorial struggle between the two countries. SEE ALSO: In Moscow, Modi Treads Fine Line Between Russia And The West \"We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on April 24 as he vowed to track down and punish the attackers. Modi did not refer to the attackers as being Pakistani, but police in Indian Kashmir claimed two of the three suspected militants were Pakistani nationals. They did not say how they identified the attackers. Modi is expected to meet with other Indian officials on April 24 to discuss the attack and how to respond to the tit-for-tat moves with Pakistan. India and Pakistan control separate parts of Kashmir, but both claim it in full. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought wars over the territory. SEE ALSO: Pakistan's Chinese Solar-Panel Boom Risks New Debt Crisis The Pahalgam attack now risks reigniting long-running tensions. The water treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank and signed in 1960, regulates the sharing of waters of the Indus River and its tributaries between India and Pakistan. It has withstood two wars between the neighbors since then and severe strains in ties at other times. The treaty stipulates that India must, with few exceptions, allow water from the western rivers to flow downstream into Pakistan. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were already weak even before the latest measures and countermeasures announced by New Delhi and Islamabad. Pakistan expelled India's envoy and has not posted its own ambassador in New Delhi since India revoked the semi-autonomous status of Kashmir in 2019. India has often accused Pakistan of involvement in an insurgency in Kashmir, but Islamabad says it only offers diplomatic and moral support to a demand for self-determination.

KYIV -- Emergency rescuers dug through the rubble of destroyed apartment buildings, searching for survivors of a massive Russian missile-and-drone attack that killed at least 10 people and wounded scores of others across the country. The April 24 overnight barrage -- the largest in months -- came just hours after the White House gave what amounted to an ultimatum about a US proposal to end the 38-month-old Russian invasion. Western efforts to try and resolve the Ukraine war, or even secure a temporary cease-fire, have sputtered in recent days as Russia shows no indication it will ease its assault and Ukraine pushes back on US proposals. \"If Russia says it wants a cease-fire, it should stop these massive attacks,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in South Africa, where he cut short an official visit due to the overnight assault. Photo Gallery: Scores Wounded, 10 Dead In Russian Attack On Kyiv Serhiy Nuzhnenko AP Reuters Russia launched a major missile and drone assault on multiple locations across Ukraine, flattening residential buildings in Kyiv, killing at least 10 people, and wounding scores of others across the country. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email to a Friend Share on LinkedIn US President Donald Trump, who lashed out at Zelenskyy a day earlier, condemned the Russian attack in a short social media post addressed to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on Kyiv,\" he wrote. \"Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, Stop! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let's get the Peace Deal Done!\" Is The US Open To Recognizing Crimea As Russian? Foreign ministers and top diplomats had been scheduled to meet in London on April 23 for new talks. But they were effectively downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out at the last minute. Rubio's decision was reportedly prompted by Zelenskyy's rejection of a US proposal that Washington might formally recognize Russian control over the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. That would be a major reversal of longstanding US policy. It is also seen as potential political suicide for any Ukrainian officials. \"There is nothing to talk about. This violated our constitution. This is our territory, the territory of Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the London talks. The US proposal also reportedly calls for blocking Ukraine's membership in the NATO alliance, an policy goal that is written into the country's constitution. SEE ALSO: What\u2019s On The Table: Ukraine Talks Get Downgraded As Top Officials Pull Out Hours after the London talks concluded, Trump criticized Zelenskyy directly, on social media and in remarks to reporters. He also suggested Putin was open to the US proposals. \"I think Russia is ready, and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \"I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy,\" he said. \"So far it's harder.\" White House envoy Steve Witkoff is set to fly to Moscow on April 25 for expected meetings with Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US proposal on Crimea fit with Moscow's longstanding assertion that the peninsula is Russian. \"This fully corresponds to our understanding and what we have been saying for a long time,\" he told reporters . In a post on X, Zelenskyy responded to Trump and included a copy of a 2018 US State Department statement calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea. \"We don't want this to be a frozen conflict, with war breaking out again in two to three years,\" he said on April 24, speaking alongside South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria. \"We need a strong guarantor [of our security]. If you don't support [NATO membership], that's your decision...but Russia should have no power to veto it.\" Embed share Russia Launches Massive Overnight Strike On Kyiv Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:43 0:00 Direct link 240p | 4.0MB 360p | 5.1MB 480p | 7.4MB 720p | 25.6MB 1080p | 21.9MB What Is the Biggest Obstacle to Ukraine Peace Deal? Trump had vowed to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office. But negotiations have proved difficult as Russia targets both civilian and military sites across the country while pressing its advantage on the battlefield. Ukraine's military said more than 210 missiles and drones were launched in the overnight assault, including ballistic and cruise missiles launched by heavy bombers and Black Sea naval ships. More than 100 missiles were downed or intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, the military claimed . \"Kyiv and its region [and the] Zhytomyr, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytsky, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhya regions were under a massive combined Russian attack,\" Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram .

Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD) says it has uncovered a covert operation by Russian and Belarusian intelligence services aimed at inciting violence against Belarusian exiles living in Lithuania. The plot, involving staged provocations and disinformation campaigns, was revealed in a statement released by the VSD and reported by the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT. According to Lithuanian authorities, foreign intelligence services have been orchestrating increasingly dangerous incidents targeting the Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania, which numbered more than 57,000 people as of early 2025. Authorities say foreign agents have attempted to simulate clashes between so-called \"Litvinist\" Belarusians -- followers of an ideology tying Belarusian identity to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania -- and fabricated Lithuanian nationalist groups. \"The organizers are trying to stage conflicts between opposing forces -- Belarusians who advocate for Litvinist ideas and so-called Lithuanian groups who appear to resist them,\u201d the VSD said. Recent Provocations Officials stressed that no real extremist Litvinist groups have been identified in Lithuania, and that they believe the narrative is being manipulated in Belarusian and Russian propaganda to stir mistrust and division. Recent provocations include fake video messages allegedly from Belarusian soldiers, anti-Belarusian graffiti, threats against Lithuanian lawmakers and Vilnius-based exiles, and social media campaigns spreading pseudohistorical claims about the region's past. The VSD warned residents not to fall for such provocations, noting that \"participation in these activities could lead to administrative or criminal liability.\" Meanwhile, there has been growing scrutiny of Belarusian nationals living in Lithuania. Many face increasingly strict visa checks, difficulties extending residence permits, and even deportation due to past affiliations with Belarusian state institutions or the military. Lithuanian media have labeled the disinformation campaign \u201cLitvinism.\u201d Authorities emphasize that the real danger lies not in the ideology itself, but in its exploitation to destabilize communities. In recognition of its reporting on this issue, the Lithuanian government's Department of National Minorities recently presented an award to RFE\/RL\u2019s Belarus Service for an investigative piece that shed light on the actors behind the campaign and its broader geopolitical implications.

(file photo) A federal court judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to reverse its efforts aimed at forcing the closure of Voice of America (VOA), which was shut down last month in a move the broadcaster had called illegal. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled late on April 22 to grant a preliminary injunction that says officials must \"take all necessary steps\" to restore employees and contractors to their positions at VOA and to restore Congress-approved funding to two other U.S.-government funded broadcasters -- Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks -- and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts. Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees the federal broadcasters, also ordered the media outlets to provide monthly status reports showing the USAGM was complying with the order to allow the outlets to \"provide news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive.\" The USAGM has not responded publicly to the court decision. VOA last month filed a lawsuit saying the Trump administration has taken \u201ca chainsaw\u201d approach to the USAGM through an executive order that directed it and six other federal agencies to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\u201d The USAGM subsequently placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and terminated some 600 contractors, forcing VOA to stop its broadcasts for the first time since it was founded in 1942. The USAGM had argued in the case that no \"final decision\" on VOA's future had been made and that the lawsuits should be treated as \"employment disputes\" with those workers who had been terminated. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty has also filed a lawsuit against the USAGM \u201cto avoid irreparable harm\u201d to the broadcaster over the withholding of its Congress-approved grant as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to terminate RFE\/RL\u2019s funding. RFE\/RL's case continues to be pursued in court. Read more April 23, 2025 By Ray Furlong and Mike Eckel Officials Call Ukraine Peace Talks 'Substantive' Despite Last-Minute No-Shows (From left to right) British Defense Minister John Healey, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov after talks in London on April 23, 2025. Officials from Ukraine, the United States, and Europe said a meeting in London was \"substantive\" despite the last-minute postponement of a broader set of talks with foreign ministers. The April 23 talks, which were aimed at trying to resolve Russia's 38-month war on Ukraine, were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting and casting a major pall over ongoing peace efforts. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy also opted to skip the meetings, leaving a Ukrainian delegation that included Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top aide -- to meet with lower-level officials and US Ukraine envoy Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. In the end, the talks involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said. Zelenskyy said emotions had \"run high\" during the meeting but it was good that the representatives of five countries met to bring peace closer. \"The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . Speaking to reporters at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he thought the London talks went well. He also said he thinks he has a deal with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the war. But he also implied that a deal with Zelenskyy remained elusive, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been more difficult to deal with than Putin. Putin was quoted as saying he viewed the deal on the table positively and hoped that Ukraine feels the same way. Trump and Zelenskyy are both scheduled to attend the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on April 25. There has been no announcement of a meeting between the two. The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain at the London talks highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talks. It also came after Trump complained of a lack of progress in the negotiations, prompting him to threaten to make a deal soon or Washington will walk away from the table. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you, we have other things to do.\" Last week, Rubio and other Ukrainian and European officials met in Paris for talks that yielded what many saw was minor progress toward a resolution of the war. But Rubio later signaled US impatience with the status of the talks and suggested the United States might pull out entirely from all involvement in the negotiations. Trump again warned Ukraine that it needs to make a deal to end the fighting while sharply criticizing Zelenskyy for saying Kyiv sees any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia -- reportedly a condition the United States has put on the table in the talks -- is a red line for Ukraine. \"It\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\" Trump said in a social media post in which he denied anyone is asking Ukraine recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire -- He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\" Trump added. Zelenskyy in his post on X included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day during a trip to India, US Vice President JD Vance said Washington had issued a \u201cvery explicit proposal\u201d to Russia and Ukraine, though he gave no details. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance said. \u201cThe current lines, somewhere close to them is where you\u2019re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,\u201d he said. SEE ALSO: Trump Talk Of Imminent Deal Sharpens Focus On Ukraine Diplomacy Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and CNN reported that US negotiators had presented Ukraine with a list of possible concessions. Included among them was potential US recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, and a definitive rejection of Ukraine's aspiration to join NATO. The Kremlin on April 23 refused to comment on rumored proposals and said the downgrading of the London talks showed that the countries involved still needed to narrow their differences as there were \"a lot of nuances\" that still need resolving. Britain's Defense Secretary John Healy told lawmakers on April 22 there was no evidence that Russia had let up its attacks on Ukraine, chiding Putin as someone who says he wants peace but \"has rejected a full cease-fire...and continues to play for time in the negotiations.\" Healy and Lammy held talks with the Ukrainian delegation during the day on April 23, with Kellogg also in attendance. He called the talks \"substantial,\" while Lammy wrote in a social media post that \"we are working at pace with US, Ukraine, and European allies to end the war and secure a just and lasting peace.\" RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report Read more Updated April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Deadly Russian Drone Strike Hits Bus In Wave Of Attacks On Ukraine's Regions Ukrainian rescuers evacuate a wounded person from a bus damaged by a Russian drone strike in the town of Marhanets, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, on April 23.

Speaking at a meeting of the State Military-Industrial Commission on April 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than 1.5 million drones of various types had been produced in Russia last year. Putin added that this amount included about 4,000 FPV drones. A wave of Russia's attacks also targeted civilian infrastructure across other Ukrainian regions. At least five people were reported injured in the Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Odesa. \"Residential buildings, business facilities, warehouses, and garages have been damaged,\" Ukraine's emergency service said . Large-scale fires had also broken out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said . The emergency service said the attack targeted 'solely the city's civilian infrastructure.' Meanwhile, in the Yelabuga district of Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, two fires broke out following a reported drone attack, local authorities confirmed on April 23. The Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over Tatarstan by air defense systems on duty. Officials have not released further details on the type of drone or its intended target. Rustem Nuriyev, head of the Yelabuga district administration, said in a statement that there were no casualties or injuries as a result of the incident. In response to the drone activity, temporary flight restrictions were imposed on Kazan and Nizhnekamsk airports. Kyiv has not commented on the incident. Also, a fire that had been burning at an ammunition depot on a military base -- where a large explosion occurred a day earlier -- in the Kirzhach district of Russia's Vladimir region, northeast of Moscow, has been \u201cgradually ending,\u201d regional Governor Aleksandr Avdeyev said. Four people were injured when ammunition exploded, prompting an evacuation order, Avdeyev said , adding that ammunition caught fire and shells exploded in the storage area. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that the fire had been caused by a breach of safety protocols and had resulted in the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse. \"As a result of a fire on the territory of a military unit in the Vladimir region, ammunition stored in a warehouse detonated,\" the Defense Ministry said. \"According to preliminary information...the cause of the fire was a violation of safety standards in work with explosive materials.\" A state of emergency was declared in the Kirzhach district, which is about 130 kilometers northeast of the Russian capital. The base was evacuated along with about 450 people from at least seven nearby settlements, the governor said. The ammunition depot is one of the largest of the Russian armed forces. It is more than 500 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. There had been no reports of drone attacks in the Vladimir region prior to the explosion. Yan Matveyev, a Russian military analyst, told Current Time that the ammunition stored at the depot could range from typical 155-millimeter artillery shells to Iskander-M missiles. \"This depot is close to the capital, close to Moscow, so it's easy to transport all this [ammunition] around the country,\" Matveyev said. Unverified video published earlier on Telegram channels showed a huge fire ball, a loud blast, and clouds of thick smoke rising into the sky. Baza, a Telegram channel close to security services, said 10 to 11 explosions had occurred and firefighters from neighboring regions had been called in to contain the blaze. It said a special commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire.

(file photo) Farmers in Uzbekistan say the government is forcing them to surrender land to Chinese businesses under the guise of state-backed development, taking thousands of hectares of fertile cotton and wheat fields out of the hands of locals. Concerned over the fate of the lush lands of the Ferghana Valley, they told Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty that large patches of land have been taken into the state reserve and transferred to Chinese businessmen. Official documents say the land transfers are voluntary. But dozens of accounts given to RFE\/RL from those who signed over their land appear to describe a different reality: coercion, threats, and intimidation by Uzbek law enforcement officers acting on orders from local officials. \"The governor told me: 'This is a presidential order. Either give up the land or go to jail,'\" said one farmer who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal for commenting publicly on the issue. Creeping Influence? Land transfers in the Ferghana Valley, which is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, are the latest flashpoint in what is becoming an increasingly visible and volatile undercurrent across Central Asia -- a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment driven by land disputes, debt dependency, labor market tensions, and fears of creeping influence.

Neither the local government nor the prosecutor can take it away. According to the legislation, the land can only be seized by the state by court decision. Farmers, though, say and seizures are being carried out based on a verbal order from Shuhrat Abdurahmonov, the head of the region. \"I did not want to give up my land and put up some resistance, but in response, the district governor called more than 20 police officers and the National Guard to the district administration building and ordered them to arrest me and my wife,\" a farmer from Qurgonteppa district told RFE\/RL. \"That is why none of the farmers resist now; otherwise, they could be imprisoned. It is unlikely that any of us would be able to get out of there alive and well.\" Regional administrations failed to comment on the claims by farmers when contacted by RFE\/RL. Concerns over China taking over the use of large swaths of land extend beyond the farming community. Beijing's economic presence in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. As of early 2025, China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion. Over 3,400 Chinese firms operate in the country, surpassing even the number of Russian entities. Similar patterns have emerged in other Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan.

Uzbek political analyst Nargiza Muratalieva points out that Central Asian countries are increasingly falling into what she calls China's \"economic trap:\" easy access to credit -- often with opaque terms -- that can eventually leave weaker states vulnerable to political pressure or asset forfeiture. Muratalieva points out that Beijing gained over 1,100 square kilometers of land in Tajikistan in 2011 in exchange for debt relief, a clear example of the potential consequences of falling into this \"trap.\" China is already the largest lender in Uzbekistan, with outstanding loans totaling $3.8 billion. \"The general characteristics of Chinese lending for all countries in the region are the ease of obtaining debts, their difficult repayment, as well as the lack of transparency of procedures and specific conditions,\" according to Muratalieva.

Whether it's propaganda or not, the fear that China could one day treat Kazakhs or Uzbeks the same way has further sown seeds of opposition to Beijing's expanding presence. \"It turns out that the Chinese really like my land; they want to take the land from other farmers too.

In a baggy red blouse and matching glasses, Yekaterina Barabash was pictured apparently blowing kisses from behind a bulletproof glass screen when she stood in the dock at a Moscow court. A well-known film critic, she was sentenced to two months of house arrest for allegedly spreading \u201clies\u201d about the Russian military\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. Now, Russian authorities have issued a wanted note for her and she faces up to 10 years in prison after they found the 63-year-old wasn\u2019t home during a check on April 13. On April 21, the Russian prison agency issued a statement saying that she wasn\u2019t home when they called several days earlier. Subsequently, a Moscow court changed her sentence, meaning that she now faces prison. Friends of Barabash contacted by RFE\/RL declined to comment on her disappearance amid fears for her safety. Barabash has been an occasional guest on RFE\/RL\u2019s Russian Service programs for some years and has often criticized the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip on society. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, she immediately condemned it. Russian forces \u201chave bombed the country, levelled whole cities to the ground,\u201d she wrote a few weeks into the conflict. Words such as these were a direct challenge to the Kremlin\u2019s narrative, which banned the word \u201cwar\u201d and denied that civilians were being targeted in attacks despite evidence to the contrary. Shortly after the invasion began, Russia passed new legislation providing jail sentences for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the armed forces. It has been used to jail hundreds of people since the war began, and has led to many others keeping silent. Barabash in court. Moscow, February 26, 2025. In a recent case , a 19-year-old woman in St. Petersburg received a nearly three-year prison sentence for gluing a short verse to a statue of a Ukrainian poet. The same law eventually led to Barabash\u2019s arrest in February 2025. In court, prosecutors said she had distributed \u201cintentionally false information about the activities of the Russian military\u201d on social media. After receiving her sentence, she emerged from the court declaring \u201cat least I\u2019ll have two months of freedom,\u201d suggesting perhaps that she expected a jail sentence in the future. Describing the moment of her arrest, she said it was \u201csurprising.\u201d \u201cThe doorbell rings and [you expect] a kind person, you open the door and there are men in masks.\u201d Her case led to an outpouring of support from leading cultural figures.

Massive Russian aerial strikes hit residential buildings in several Ukrainian cities, leaving at least one dead and more than two dozen injured, including several children, in attacks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"deliberate terror.\" Two guided aerial bomb strikes hit the city of Zaporizhzhya on April 22, killing one woman and injuring 38 others -- four of whom were children and a pregnant woman, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone attacks were also seen in the city of Kharkiv, though casualty figures were unknown. The daytime strikes came after a drone attack overnight sparked massive fires in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, where a a housing block in a densely inhabited area was hit. The attack left one woman dead and at least three other residents injured. The attack came amid ongoing diplomatic activity to secure a cease-fire in the Ukraine war, following Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. \"All of this is absolutely deliberate Russian terror that can be stopped by a single order, an order in Russia and for the Russian Army,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \"Our proposal for a cease-fire regarding civilian buildings also remains in force. Russia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this.

Meanwhile, the governor of Russia's Vladimir region, Aleksandr Avdeyev, said on April 22 that an explosion occurred in the region's Kirzhach district. Avdeyev did not provide details but said emergency services were on site. Telegram channels reported the blast happened in the village of Barsovo, near military unit 11785, also known as the 51st arsenal of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, which stores ammunition. Residents reported several explosions. A \"powerful attack\" was reported, prompting evacuations in Barsovo and nearby villages within a 5 km radius. Roads to Kirzhach from Moscow were blocked. Local authorities announced a state of emergency in the area. Russia also launched large-scale missile strikes on Easter Monday on April 21, following the expiry of a self-declared 30-hour Easter truce. Kyiv claimed Russian forces violated the truce 3,000 times. On April 22, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot dismissed the truce as a \u201cmarketing operation\u201d by Putin aimed primarily at US President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at continuing Russian attacks as he pushes diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire. SEE ALSO: Ukraine Stands By Proposal To End Attacks On Civilian Targets, Zelenskyy Says \"The Easter truce, which he announced somewhat unexpectedly, was a marketing operation, an operation of charm, aimed at preventing President Trump's impatience and anger,\" Barrot was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying on FranceInfo television. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said he spoke to Barrot the previous evening to coordinate positions ahead of a meeting in London on April 23. The London meeting was set to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, following a gathering in Paris on April 18 -- the first joint talks in this format since Trump took office. Barrot told FranceInfo that the European countries used that meeting to tell Washington what their red lines were for a deal. Trump has said he\u2019s hopeful an agreement can be wrapped up this week, which feels ambitious to many observers. But in another sign that diplomacy is picking up steam, Putin said on April 21 that he was ready for direct talks with Zelenskyy -- something that he had until recently refused. This was met with skepticism by Ukrainian political analyst Ihor Reiterovich, who told RFE\/RL's Current Time that it was \"standard manipulation -- an attempt to portray Russia in a peace-making light, which frankly looks extremely cynical.\" Read more April 22, 2025 By RFE\/RL Ukraine Stands By Proposal To End Attacks On Civilian Targets, Zelenskyy Says A woman walks in front of an apartment building damaged in the course of Russia-Ukraine war.

Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on April 21 that Ukraine stood by its proposal for an end to attacks on civilian targets and was ready for any form of discussion to achieve it. \"Ukraine stands by its offer...not to strike civilian infrastructure. And we expect a clear answer from Moscow,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We are ready for any conversation on how to ensure this.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on April 21 proposed bilateral talks with Ukraine for the first time since the early days of the war. Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin's proposal but said Ukraine \"was ready for any conversation\" about a cease-fire that would stop strikes on civilians. \"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure.\" SEE ALSO: Zelenskyy Demands Russia Return Ukrainian Children In New International Campaign Ukraine and Russia are facing pressure from the United States to make progress on negotiations to end the war. Ukraine will take part in talks with the US and European countries on April 23 in London, Zelenskyy said. The talks will have a primary task: \"to push for an unconditional ceasefire. This must be the starting point,\" he said. Both sides said fighting had resumed after an Easter cease-fire, which Putin announced unilaterally on April 19. Ukrainian authorities reported dozens of Russian missile and drone attacks on April 21, while a Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. Russian forces attacked Ukraine's northeastern region, killing one person in a border village, according to regional prosecutors. The report on Telegram said a Russian drone struck and killed a man on a scooter in the village of Ivashki. Russian forces also launched a late night drone attack on residential areas of Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, triggering fires and damaging many apartments, local officials said early on April 22. A day earlier US President Donald Trump voiced hope that an agreement would be reached between the two countries this week. Trump told reporters at the White House on April 21 that he plans to comment on the war in Ukraine and mediation efforts in the next three days. He made the comment in response to a question about whether the United States had proposed that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014 and then annexed it in violation of international law. \"So I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,\" Trump said. \"But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,\" he added without providing details. In his comments earlier on April 21, Putin said Russia was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv. \"We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude toward any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,\" Putin said on state TV. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when Putin said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, he meant bilateral negotiations. There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week. But he welcomed a comment by US envoy Keith Kellogg saying Ukraine would not be able to join NATO.

At age 16, Vladyslav Rudenko was captured by Russian forces and held in children\u2019s camps in Russia-occupied Crimea and Kherson for nine months. Unlike some 20,000 other Ukrainian youths, Rudenko was rescued by the NGO Save Ukraine and returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after nine months in captivity. It's the fate of those thousands, many of whom remain in Russian-occupied areas -- in what Moscow calls \u201crehabilitation centers\u201d -- that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials say they are now focused on. \"This crime must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held accountable,\" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said over the weekend as part of the launch of the ChildrenAreNonNegotiable campaign. \"A just and lasting peace requires the return of all these Ukrainian children home.\" SEE ALSO: Amid Interrogations And Threats, Ukrainian Civilians Flee Russian Occupation US President Donald Trump has made ending Europe's longest conflict since World War II a top foreign policy priority since taking office three months ago. While the talks have lurched between several contentious issues, Ukrainian officials have kept the repatriation of all of those taken from Ukraine a major negotiating point. Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of orchestrating what some groups have called a \"systematic deportation\" of children out of Ukraine and into Russia-controlled parts of the country, or even further to destinations in Russia and its ally, Belarus. Evidence gathered last year by RFE\/RL's Belarus Service and Schemes , the investigative unit of RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service, indicated camps were being used to teach young Ukrainians to identify with concepts that both Moscow and Minsk promote. That came after a November 2023 study by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab that deemed Ukrainian schoolchildren's escorted trips to Belarus were coordinated by Belarus and Russia as part of the two countries' so-called Union State. SEE ALSO: Abducted Ukrainian Children: Calls Made To Continue Search For Kids Taken By Russia As US Closes Investigation Team The study said the process involves \"re-education,\" which it defined as \"the promotion of cultural, historical, societal, and patriotic messages or ideas that serve the political interests\" of both regimes. Military training, including by Interior Ministry troops, occurred with \"at least six groups of children,\" according to the report. Rudenko told RFE\/RL's Ukrainian service earlier this month that during the time he was held by Russian authorities his daily routine had an obvious orientation. \u201cWe woke up to the Russian anthem, raised the flag, did exercises. After breakfast, they told us what had happened in Russia overnight. Literally. Then we went to watch Russian movies,\" he said, recalling his regiment while held in camps. According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab more than 8,400 children from Ukraine have been systematically relocated to at least 57 facilities: 13 facilities in Belarus and 43 facilities in Russia and Russia-occupied territory. According to Ukraine\u2019s official government portal childrenofwar.gov.ua , a much higher number -- around 20,000 -- have been taken away and only 1,300 children have been successfully returned. \u201cWe remind the world that without the return of the children abducted by Russia, the war cannot truly be considered over,\u201d a statement published by Zelenskyy's office during Easter said. Washington has supported Kyiv on the issue of repatriating children, saying last month it remains committed to supporting the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. However, Ukrainian officials are worried recent budget cutting moves by the Trump administration could significantly hinder investigations into where the children have been moved and efforts to enable their return. Meanwhile, Karolina Hird, deputy team leader and an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, warned that Ukrainian teenagers forced to accept Russian citizenship may face conscription into the Russian army and could be forced to fight against their own people, a violation of international law. \u201cNegotiations and an end to the fighting without consideration for the deported children will empower Russia to continue to commit these crimes with absolute impunity,\u201d Hird wrote .

Despite his illness, his death came as a shock after he had been driven around St. Peter's Square to greet cheering crowds on Easter Sunday. \"Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vatican's TV channel on April 21. \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father,\" he said. Francis, who had also delivered a blessing at this year's Easter services a day before his death, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first pontiff born outside Europe in over a millennium. At the Vatican, locals, tourists, and pilgrims visiting for Easter expressed their shock and grief. \"This is something that really hits you hard,\" Rome resident Emanuela Tinari told Reuters. \"He was a pope who brought so many people closer to the church. He was not appreciated by everyone.

Russian President Vladimir Putin published a statement saying Francis \"enjoyed great international authority as a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious statesman, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice.\" \"Throughout his pontificate, he actively contributed to the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive interaction between Russia and the Holy See,\" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also praised the pope's tenure, describing the pontiff as someone who \"knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\" \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,\" he added. \"We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!\" 'Painful And Shameful' -- Pope Francis On The Ukraine War Pope Francis, who died on April 21, Easter Monday, did not deliver his final annual Angelus address in person. But the text of his address said the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 was \u201ca painful and shameful occasion for all of humanity.\" He went on to voice \u201csolidarity with the martyred Ukrainian people.\" The Pontiff\u2019s death-bed statement was his last attempt to give the Vatican a voice in the conflict. While he was clearly sympathetic to the plight of Ukrainians, Pope Francis\u2019 previous interventions were not always welcomed by Kyiv. He raised particular ire in March 2024 by calling on Ukraine to find \"the courage of the white flag\u201d to enter peace talks with Russia. He later said that the \u201cfirst condition\u201d for peace was that Russia \u201cput an end to its aggression.\u201d But earlier, his avoidance of specific criticism of Russia was a cause of frustration. In June 2022, he condemned the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Russian forces while also suggesting the war was \u201cperhaps somehow provoked.\u201d This echoed a Kremlin argument, repeatedly made without evidence, that it was forced to attack. -- By Ray Furlong, senior international corresponden t \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Trump announced later on the same social media platform that he and first lady Melania Trump would attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome.

US Vice President JD Vance, who met with the pontiff on April 20, said his heart \"goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis,\" adding that \"he inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.\" Moldovan President Maia Sandu also expressed regret at the news of Francis's death, saying that he had \"tirelessly promoted compassion and social justice\" and \"led with love, stood by the vulnerable, and called for unity in times of division.\" Her comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the pope had been \"a man of humility, on the side of the most vulnerable and the most fragile.\" Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Francis would be remembered for his \"tireless commitment to the weakest in society.\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tweeted that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Francis's death. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to the news with a short a Facebook post that included a picture of him with the late pontiff. \"Thank you for everything, Holy Father,\" he said. \"We bid you farewell.\" An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman voiced sadness over Francis's death, saying that he offered \"condolences to all Christians around the world.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Francis was \"a spiritual leader who gave importance to dialogue between different faith groups and took the initiative in the face of humanitarian tragedies, especially the Palestinian issue and the genocide in Gaza.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev , Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani , Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze , and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajic also posted tributes to the pope. A Papacy Focused On Social Justice Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis worked as a chemical technician before entering the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a priest in 1969 and became the provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed archbishop of Buenos Aires. Three years later, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Elected Pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, reflecting his commitment to humility and the poor. Images From Francis's Years As Pope No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:01 0:00 His papacy was marked by a focus on mercy, social justice, and environmental stewardship. In 2015, Pope Francis issued the encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019,\u201d calling for global action on climate change and care for the environment. He also emphasized interfaith dialogue, notably signing the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Ahmed el-Tayeb, in 2019, a landmark agreement promoting peace and coexistence among different faiths. 'A Poor Church For The Poor' Pope Francis was known for his pastoral approach, advocating for a \u201cpoor Church for the poor\u201d and reaching out to marginalized communities. He made efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s financial systems and address alleged clerical sexual abuse within the church. In 2025, he published his autobiography, \u201cHope,\u201d offering insights into his life and papal mission. In his later years, Pope Francis faced several health challenges. In 2021, he underwent colon surgery to address diverticulitis, and in 2023, he had abdominal surgery to repair a hernia. He also experienced chronic knee and back pain, often using a wheelchair for mobility. Despite these issues, he maintained a rigorous schedule, continuing his pastoral duties and international travels. In early 2025, Pope Francis was hospitalized with a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, which developed into double pneumonia. His condition remained complex, requiring an extended hospital stay. He had been discharged from hospital on March 23.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would continue to mirror Russia's actions, following reports of further missile strikes by Moscow. In a Telegram post , Zelenskyy noted that Moscow had ignored both a proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire and a call to halt air strikes on civilian infrastructure, including missile and drone attacks. \u201cThe nature of Ukrainian actions will remain mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, and any Russian attacks will be met with our own. Actions always speak louder than words,\u201d he added. An Easter truce in fighting between Russia and Ukraine appeared to reduce some air strikes on Ukrainian cities, but Kyiv angrily claimed nearly 3,000 violations by Moscow\u2019s forces while calls for an extension went unheeded by the Kremlin. Nevertheless, US President Donald Trump said late on April 20 that \"hopefully, Ukraine and Russia will make a deal this week.\" \"Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform without elaboration. A unilateral truce was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 19, running from 6 p.m. that day until midnight on April 20. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agency TASS that Putin had given no orders for the cease-fire to extend beyond midnight. Ukrainian officials said it was not observed anyway. Air attacks appeared to resume early on April 21. Hours after the scheduled end of the Easter truce, air-raid sirens blared across Kyiv, while the mayor of Mykolayiv reported that explosions were heard across the southern city.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said Moscow's actions following the midnight end to the truce will indicate the Kremlin's real attitude toward any initiatives to end the war. \"Regarding the so-called 'Easter Cease-fire,' we have still not heard Moscow\u2019s response to our proposal to extend it to 30 days,\" he wrote on X. \"Russia's actions after midnight, tomorrow, and throughout the week will reveal Russia\u2019s true attitude toward US peace efforts and the 30-day full cease-fire proposal. They will show whether Russia is serious about peace or Putin's statements from yesterday were simply manipulations,\" Sybiha added. The US State Department earlier said it would welcome an extension to the Easter cease-fire that was set to expire a few hours later. \"We have seen President Putin's announcement of a temporary cease-fire due to Easter. We remain committed to achieving a full and comprehensive cease-fire,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to news media. \"As we assess their seriousness in this instance, we would welcome it extending beyond Sunday,\" the statement added. In the early morning hours of April 21, Zelenskyy accused Russia of 2,935 violations following Putin's call for the Easter truce, although he added that there had been \"no air raid alerts\" during the period. \"Either Putin does not have full control over his army or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on April 20.

Russian authorities reported at least three explosions in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine early on April 20. The Defense Ministry claimed Kyiv launched 48 drone attacks on targets in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine overnight. Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s forces were acting \"in a fully symmetrical manner\" to Moscow's. Meanwhile, in a further sign of heightened international tensions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain's Defense Ministry reported recently intercepting Russian warplanes over the Baltic Sea. It cited two incidents, on April 15 and 17, in which British jets were scrambled to intercept Russian aircraft. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard said on April 20 that \"Russian aggression\" was growing and that British jets were working with the Swedish Air Force to defend NATO airspace. What Do Ukrainians Think Of Easter Cease-Fire? In Kyiv, as priests sprinkled worshippers with holy water, there was deep skepticism about the Easter truce. \"I really hope for it but I do not believe in it.

Either make peace permanently or not at all.\" Trump's Threat To Walk Away Putin's truce announcement followed signals from Trump and other US officials complaining about the slow progress in talks to resolve the Ukraine war, now in its fourth year. Trump on April 18 said the Ukraine and Russia talks are \"coming to a head\" and he insisted that neither side is \"playing\" him in his push to end the conflict.

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"19 July  Former Svoboda MP Iryna Farion is shot and killed by an unidentified gunman in Lviv.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance Former Ukrainian lawmaker and linguist Iryna Farion died in Lviv on July 19, hours after being attacked, Lviv Oblast Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said. An unidentified man opened fire on Farion, 60, in the street in the city of Lviv at around 7:30 p.m. earlier the same day and fled. Law enforcement officers are seeking to identify and detain the attacker. The reports of Farion's death came shortly after she was operated on in the hospital. Farion was in a coma. \"Unfortunately, despite all the doctors' efforts, they failed to save Iryna Farion,\" Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram. President Volodymyr Zelensky was briefed about the assassination and said that \"anyone responsible for this attack must be held fully accountable.\" Iryna Farion, who is known for her controversial statements on the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, entered the ultranationalist party Svoboda in 2005 and served as a member of the parliament between 2012 and 2014. She was reinstated in June 2024 as a professor at the Ukrainian language department at Lviv Polytechnic University shortly after being fired. Farion sparked outrage when she said on Nov. 6 that she couldn't call Ukrainian soldiers Ukrainians if they speak Russian. The scandal around Farion's statements escalated after she allegedly received a message of support from Maksym Hlebov, a pro-Ukrainian student living in occupied Crimea. She published the email on her social media, after which received harsh criticism . Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said in November 2023 that Farion was under criminal investigation both for her statements about Russian-speaking soldiers and for leaking the message from Hlebov. Who was Iryna Farion, the nationalist professor-politician assassinated in Lviv? Despite the contrasting opinions surrounding her life\u2019s work and contentious public statements, the assassination of linguist and former right-wing lawmaker Iryna Farion on July 19 came as a shock to Ukrainians.

The southern German town of Wiesbaden, known for spas and hot springs, will now serve as a site of NATO's efforts to support the Ukrainian military. There, NATO has launched a new command centre to plan, coordinate, and arrange the delivery of security assistance for Ukraine. The command centre, located at a former US Army base, will coordinate training and equipment donations to Ukraine and will be organised and led by a three-star general. It\u2019s the centrepiece of the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine plan, which was announced when alliance leaders met for an anniversary summit in Washington last week. The base will comprise approximately 700 personnel from NATO allied nations and select partners. NATO says the command centre in Germany will enhance its support of Ukraine but not make the alliance a party to the conflict. A Ukrainian MP within President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s party, who is also fighting in the military, said the centre is an extremely welcomed sign. \u201cWe must certainly meet those people who have produced those munitions and try to train us,\" said Servant of the People party's Sviatoslav Yurash, explaining how NATO training has been invaluable on the frontline. The centre was discussed at last week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington when the alliance also declared that Ukraine was on an irreversible path to membership of the organisation. One foreign policy expert cautioned that although positive, there were potential limits to the extent the alliance would allow Ukraine to enter. \u201cIt will hopefully inspire confidence in NATO\u2019s support for Ukraine but at the same time, everyone knows including Ukrainian politicians that US domestic politics will decide Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership,\u201d said Leonard Schuette, senior researcher at Munich Security Conference. Officials have stated that Ukraine could only enter the alliance once the war with Russia on its territory was over. During the summit, the US also announced it would deploy long-range missiles in Germany. When fully developed, these conventional\u00a0long-range fire units will include SM-6, Tomahawk, and developmental hypersonic weapons, which have significantly longer ranges than current land-based systems in Europe. Green MP Sebastian Schaefer, who sits on the parliamentary defence committee, told Euronews that Germany should focus on re-arming itself. \u201cThis is one of the realities of the 21st century. It\u2019s not a very good thing to see, but it\u2019s just necessary. It would be much wiser if we would live together in peace on this planet. But this is currently not the case so we need to prepare,\u201d Schaefer said. Despite this, Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said that the ruling coalition approved less than a fifth of the increase he had requested for its military.

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"9 July  NATO announces that it will establish a senior representative to Kyiv to coordinate with Ukrainian officials and strengthen Ukraine's ties with the bloc.","text":"Jake Sullivan says US remains \u2018committed\u2019 to supporting Ukraine as world leaders join NATO summit in Washington, DC. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will appoint a senior representative in Ukraine\u2019s capital to deepen ties to the war-torn country, a senior United States official has said, as world leaders gather for a NATO summit in Washington, DC. Speaking at a summit defence industry event on Tuesday afternoon, White House adviser Jake Sullivan said the representative in Kyiv would seek to \u201cdeepen Ukraine\u2019s institutional relationship with the alliance\u201d. The post will also \u201cserve as the focal point for NATO\u2019s engagement with senior Ukrainian officials\u201d, Sullivan said. The announcement comes as NATO officials and world leaders have travelled to the US capital for the organisation\u2019s annual summit, which began on Tuesday. Continued support for Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s invasion of the country is at the top of the agenda, particularly amid a string of recent Russian attacks, including a deadly bombing of a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv. In a social media post after his arrival in Washington, DC, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would be pushing for more air defence systems, financial assistance, and aircraft, including F-16s.

This is not just crucial for our country \u2013 it is essential for everyone \u2013 for every partner and all nations.\u201d Zelenskyy and US President Joe Biden are each scheduled to deliver speeches later on Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Institute to mark the start of the NATO summit. The pair will also hold a meeting on Thursday afternoon, the White House said. Aides said Biden\u2019s opening speech will highlight what his administration sees as a key accomplishment: a stronger and more united NATO, under the US\u2019s leadership, with more members and a resolve to meet their collective security needs. That brings, they say, tangible results for American voters, namely a safer country, with a strong international economic position, as well as more alliances and power abroad, and less at risk of conflict with its adversaries. This week\u2019s NATO summit falls at a critical time for Biden, who is facing questions domestically about his health and ability to serve another term in the White House after he delivered a disastrous 2024 election debate performance last month. The Democratic president, who is expected to face off against his Republican predecessor Donald Trump in November\u2019s vote, has dismissed calls to drop out of the race. Biden administration officials sought to downplay reports that Washington\u2019s NATO allies are anxious over the president\u2019s staying power before the arrival of the 32 NATO member countries\u2019 leaders in Washington, DC. Speaking to reporters on Monday, White House adviser John Kirby said the administration was \u201cnot picking up any signs\u201d that any foreign leaders were concerned. The leaders \u201cwouldn\u2019t be coming \u2026 to a NATO Summit if they didn\u2019t believe in American leadership and how important it is and if they didn\u2019t believe that President Biden takes that responsibility extremely seriously\u201d, Kirby said. But as doubts swirl over Biden, the alliance has been nervously eyeing a potential return to the White House by Trump after the elections in November. Trump has repeatedly criticised fellow NATO members who failed to meet an agreed-upon goal of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defence. European anxiety was heightened in February when Trump warned NATO allies in a campaign speech that he \u201cwould encourage\u201d the Russians \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d to countries that do not meet defence spending goals if he returns to the White House. Trump and his Republican allies in the US Congress have also criticised Biden for providing an \u201cendless flow of American treasure\u201d to Ukraine. During Tuesday afternoon\u2019s NATO event in Washington, DC, Sullivan \u2013 the White House adviser \u2013 said the Biden administration was \u201ccommitted\u201d to standing with Ukraine \u201cfor the long term\u201d. Sullivan said NATO later this week would announce a new military command in Germany that will launch a \u201ctraining, equipping and force development programme for Ukrainian troops\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll also make announcements outlining how we plan to strengthen critical Ukrainian air defence capabilities and build Ukraine\u2019s air power through the provision of F-16s,\u201d he said. The new measures, Sullivan added, aim to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he \u201ccannot divide us, he cannot outlast us, he cannot weaken us, and Ukraine \u2013 not Russia \u2013 will prevail in this war\u201d. The Kremlin said it was following the NATO summit \u201cwith the greatest attention\u201d, including \u201cthe rhetoric at the talks and the decisions that will be taken and put on paper\u201d.

Ukraine received the biggest number of gold medals at the Olympics since 2012, when it won five at the London Games. Ukraine's Olympic triumphs were celebrated back home, where positive news is rare and Russian troops continue to launch daily attacks against civilians while steadily advancing on the battlefield. The Olympics kicked off on July 24, with some events held two days before the opening ceremony on July 26. Only 140 Ukrainian athletes competed at the Olympic Games in Paris this year, the smallest number in the history of the country's participation in the games, as Russia's war has damaged or destroyed sports' facilities and frequent air raid alerts interrupt training. China took first place at the Olympics, winning 40 gold, 27 silver, and 24 bronze medals, followed by the U.S. and Japan. Russian and Belarusian athletes were allowed to compete in the games \u00a0as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) with \"strict eligibility conditions\" \u2013 which included being banned from team participation and displaying any flags or official identification with either country. Sports Ministry recommends Ukrainian athletes keep distance from Russians at Olympics The recommendations were developed to protect the 89 Ukrainian athletes who have qualified to compete at the Olympics, their coaches, and members of Ukraine\u2019s official delegation \u201cfrom provocative situations\u201d and promote their safety in Paris, the UOC and Sports Ministry said. The Kyiv Independent Elsa Court Among Ukraine's highlights of the Olympics are the women's saber fencing team winning the war-torn country's first gold at the games and two of its athletes placing first and third in women's high jumps. Fencer Olga Kharlan led her team to the finals in women's saber fencing after taking bronze on July 29. The six-time Olympic medalist beat South Korea's Choi Se-bin 15-14 in a fiercely contested match. Ukrainian high jumpers Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Iryna Gerashchenko won gold and bronze at the Olympics. The 22-year-old Mahuchikh, currently the world record holder for women's high jump , won the competition with a jump of 2.00 meters. Ukrainian wrestlers Parviz Nasibov and Zhan Beleniuk also won silver and bronze, respectively, at the Olympics. Beleniuk, who won gold in Tokyo and is also a Ukrainian lawmaker , retired after winning bronze in men's Greco-Roman wrestling in the 87-kilogram category, beating Polish athlete Arkadiusz Kulynycz. Wrestler-politician Zhan Beleniuk starts last Olympic run aiming for back-to-back gold Winning his first Olympic gold medal in Tokyo after taking a months-long break from parliament, Ukrainian lawmaker Zhan Beleniuk is set to repeat his successful run and quit wrestling for good.

In May, the EU\u2019s 27 member states reached an agreement to use the interest earned on some 210 billion euros ($225 billion) in Russian central bank assets for military support for Ukraine and rebuilding efforts in the war torn country. The money, most of which is held in Belgium, was frozen as part of sanctions packages in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion. Brussels estimates that the interest on those assets could provide around 3 billion euros each year. \u201cThe EU stands with Ukraine. Today we transfer 1.5 billion euros in proceeds from immobilised Russian assets to the defence and reconstruction of Ukraine. There is no better symbol or use for the Kremlin\u2019s money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live,\u201d European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. The move comes days after Moscow announced it had recaptured two villages in Eastern Ukraine. A recent push by Kremlin forces in eastern and northeastern Ukraine has made incremental gains and Kyiv is worried that without financial support, Russia may advance further.

The minister was referring to a tragic episode in Polish-Ukrainian history in 1943 when members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) massacred tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the issue came to the forefront of public discussion several times, namely during the tenure of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, ruling between 2015 and 2023. Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Poland supports Ukraine against Russian aggression as much as it can, but the relations are \"not perfect\" due to unresolved historical issues. Warsaw has been Kyiv's staunch supporter since 2022. The Polish defense minister noted that Ukraine would not join the EU without resolving the Volyn issue, echoing the words of former Polish Foreign Ministry's Undersecretary of State Pawel Jablonski. Jablonski said last November that Ukraine \"cannot dream of joining the European Union\" without resolving the issue of the exhumation of Volyn massacre victims' remains on Ukrainian territory. While Kosiniak-Kamysz is a member of the center-right Polish People's Party (PSL), one of the groups making up the broad coalition that ousted PiS in last year's elections, Jablonski sat in office for PiS. Ukraine opened accession talks with the European bloc last June, but a consensus of all members will be necessary to finalize the entry. Poland prepares Ukrainian Legion, \u2018several thousand\u2019 already registered Poland has begun preparing the first Ukrainian Legion of volunteers with \u201cseveral thousand\u201d people already having registered to participate, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, said on July 11. The Kyiv Independent The Kyiv Independent news desk Ukrainian historian Serhii Plokhy, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, estimates that the number of Polish victims of the massacre varies from 60,000 to 90,000. The number of Ukrainians killed by Poles in Volyn ranges between 2,000 and 3,000, according to Polish historian Grzegorz Motyka. Since 2016, July 11, a pivotal day in the massacre, sometimes called \"Bloody Sunday,\" has been recognized by Poland as the National Day of Remembrance of Genocide Victims. Ukraine denies the term \"genocide\" to describe the Volyn massacre. President Volodymyr Zelensky promised in 2019 to lift the Ukrainian moratorium on the exhumation of Volyn victims, imposed in reaction to cases of destruction of UPA memorials in Poland. The matter has not yet been resolved, however, and Polish President Andrzej Duda said last August that obtaining permission for the exhumations plays a crucial role in Polish-Ukrainian relations. Earlier this month, a newly erected memorial to the Volyn massacres in Poland sparked controversy by featuring a depiction of a baby impaled on what resembled a Ukrainian trident. The unveiling ceremony was attended by figures from the far-right Confederation party, while the monument itself was funded by the Polish Army Veterans' Association in America.

A man walks next to an office building of FSD, a nongovernmental humanitarian organisation, damaged during a Russian missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, July 24, 2024 [Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy\/ Reuters] Published On 25 Jul 2024 25 Jul 2024 This is where the war stands on Thursday, July 25, 2024: Fighting Russia launched a series of attacks on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region, killing three people, wounding at least six and damaging the office of a Swiss mine-clearing NGO, local officials said. The attack on Kharkiv came as Russia also launched a barrage of drones on southern Ukraine from Russian territory and the occupied Crimean peninsula. The attack wounded three people and damaged port infrastructure as well as commercial and residential buildings in the city of Izmail on the River Danube, local officials said. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 17 of the 23 drones, most of them over the southern Odesa region. Ukraine\u2019s navy, meanwhile, said Russia had pulled all its vessels out of the Sea of Azov, a body of water connected to the Black Sea. In the Russian capital, Moscow, a car bomb exploded injuring an officer from Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency and another person, according to local media. Turkey later announced that a Russian citizen suspected of involvement in the attack had been arrested in the city of Bodrum, having arrived there from Moscow by plane. Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry also said it scrambled a Su-27 fighter jet to escort two British Typhoon fighter jets and an RC-135 reconnaissance plane over the Black Sea. Advertisement Politics and diplomacy Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in the city of Guangzhou and told him that Kyiv is open to talks with Russia, provided that Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity were fully respected. Kuleba, however, said Ukraine does not see a readiness from Russia to negotiate in \u201cgood faith\u201d. The Kremlin told reporters that Kuleba\u2019s remarks on a willingness to hold talks appeared to tally with Russia\u2019s position, but more details were needed. Russia banned 13 Japanese business leaders from entering the country in retaliation for Tokyo\u2019s sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Japan lodged a protest over the entry ban. The European Commission said it is seeking more information on Hungary and Slovakia\u2019s request for mediation with Ukraine after Kyiv placed Russian producer Lukoil on a sanctions list, stopping supplies to the two countries via a pipeline that crosses Ukrainian\u00a0territory. The United States warned India\u2019s banks that financial institutions that do business with Russia\u2019s military-industrial base risk losing access to the country\u2019s financial system, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a letter from the US Treasury Department. Latvia has appealed a decision by the European Union Court of Justice that annulled sanctions imposed on Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and his business partner Petr Aven. The pair were sanctioned in 2022-23 on allegations of supporting the Kremlin\u2019s actions or policies against Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lauded the fact that Ukraine was participating in the Olympic Games in wartime and added that the athletes\u2019 presence in Paris would help people back home maintain \u201cnormal lives\u201d.

In June, Kyiv imposed sanctions blocking the transit of pipeline oil from Lukoil to Central Europe to cut off the Kremlin's source of income used to support its military. Kyiv's ban does not apply to other Russian oil exporters who still use the pipeline. Fico has heavily criticized the move, previously saying Slovakia \"doesn't intend to be a hostage to Ukrainian-Russian relations.\" The restrictions have created supply shortages in Budapest, which depends on Russia for 70% of its oil supply, with Lukoil providing half of that volume, according to Politico . Fico, a pro-Russian populist, halted military aid to Ukraine after taking office in September 2023. The move was a stark reversal of Slovak foreign policy. In May, Fico was shot and seriously injured in an assassination attempt . He made his first public appearance since the shooting on July 5, addressing supporters in a speech that praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban .

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"3 August  S&P Global downgrades Ukraine's credit rating to \"SD\" for 'selective' default after being unable to pay a US$34 million international bond payment, while stating that Ukraine's credit rating would fall to \"D\" representing a complete default following restructuring of Ukraine's debt.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has threatened to cut off diesel supplies to Ukraine if Kyiv does not resume the transit of pipeline oil from Russia's Lukoil company to Central Europe, he said on July 29. \"If the transit of Russian oil through Ukraine is not resumed shortly, ( Slovak oil refining company) Slovnaft will not resume the supply of diesel fuel to Ukraine, which covers a tenth of Ukrainian consumption,\" he said in a post on Facebook . In June, Kyiv imposed sanctions blocking the transit of pipeline oil from Lukoil to Central Europe to cut off the Kremlin's source of income used to support its military. Kyiv's ban does not apply to other Russian oil exporters who still use the pipeline. Fico has heavily criticized the move, previously saying Slovakia \"doesn't intend to be a hostage to Ukrainian-Russian relations.\" The restrictions have created supply shortages in Budapest, which depends on Russia for 70% of its oil supply, with Lukoil providing half of that volume, according to Politico . Fico, a pro-Russian populist, halted military aid to Ukraine after taking office in September 2023. The move was a stark reversal of Slovak foreign policy. In May, Fico was shot and seriously injured in an assassination attempt . He made his first public appearance since the shooting on July 5, addressing supporters in a speech that praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban .

Although some defense experts do not expect F-16s to become game-changers in the war, the jets may strengthen Ukraine's air defense capabilities and shield the country's population centers from Russia's daily bombardments. Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said that the delivery of F-16s to Ukraine would also challenge Russia's \"full dominance\" of the skies over the Black Sea. Denmark and the Netherlands indicated that they would allow Ukraine to strike with F-16s inside Russia, although Copenhagen said that such a move would \" depend on the circumstances .\" Belgium said that its F-16s are intended only for use on Ukrainian territory.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Mali breaks diplomatic relations with Ukraine following reports of the latter's involvement in an attack on Malian and Wagner Group forces by Tuareg separatists in July.","text":"Mali cuts diplomatic ties with Ukraine over Wagner ambush claims 5 August 2024 Share Save Adam Durbin BBC News Share Save Getty Images Mali says it has cut diplomatic relations with Ukraine, after a military official suggested Kyiv had played a role in deadly fighting near the Algerian border last month. Dozens of Malian soldiers and mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group were killed in days of clashes with Tuareg separatist rebels and fighters linked to al-Qaeda. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence, said last week that the rebels had been given the \"necessary information\" to conduct the attacks. A top Malian official, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, said his government was shocked to hear the claim and accused Ukraine of violating Mali's sovereignty. Yusov's comments \"admitted Ukraine's involvement in a cowardly, treacherous and barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups\" that had led to the deaths of Malian soldiers, Col Maiga's statement said. Mali has decided to break off relations \"with immediate effect\", he said. Last week, Mali's army admitted it had suffered \u201csignificant\u201d losses during several days of fighting earlier that erupted on 25 July. The clashes took place in the desert near Tinzaouaten, a north-eastern town on the border with Algeria. Reports say the Malian and Russian forces were ambushed by Tuareg rebels and fighters from al-Qaeda affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin while waiting for reinforcements, after retreating from Tinzaouaten. Neither Mali\u2019s military nor Wagner - which has since morphed into a group called the Africa Corps -  have given exact figures, but the estimated death toll for Wagner fighters ranges from 20 to 80. The Russian mercenary outfit's losses are thought to be the heaviest it has suffered in Mali since it began helping the military government fight the insurgents two years ago. Wagner has acknowledged that one of its commanders was killed and a Russian helicopter was downed in \"fierce fighting\", saying they had been attacked by around 1,000 fighters. Tuareg-led separatists claimed on Thursday they had killed 84 Wagner mercenaries and 47 Malian soldiers. More than a decade ago, Mali's central government lost control of much of the north following a Tuareg rebellion, which was sparked by a demand for a separate state. The country's security was then further complicated by the involvement of Islamist militants in the conflict. When seizing power in coups in 2020 and 2021, the military cited the government's inability to tackle this unrest. The new junta severed Mali's long-running alliance with former colonial power France in favour of Russia, in a bid to quell the unrest.

The Russian military said Ukrainian forces launched an attack with up to 300 soldiers, 11 tanks and more than 20 armored combat vehicles at 8:00 a.m. Moscow time. \u201cTroops defending the border, together with military units of the FSB border force, are repelling attacks and inflicting damage on the enemy,\u201d the defense ministry said in a statement. The Russian military said Ukrainian forces were focusing their attack on the villages of Nikolaevo-Darino and Oleshnya, which both lie directly on the border with northeastern Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region. Kursk region acting Governor Alexei Smirnov said three people were killed in Ukrainian attacks throughout the day \u2014 a woman in the attempted border incursion and two people whose vehicles were hit in separate drone attacks. Earlier, Smirnov said Russian border guards and soldiers thwarted incursions into the Kursk region districts of Sudzha and Korenevo. \u201cThe situation in the border area remains difficult, but our defenders are successfully working to destroy the enemy,\u201d the acting governor wrote on Telegram.

Armed combatants from Ukraine have carried out a number of incursions into Russia\u2019s border regions since last year.

Kyiv's surge into Russian territory last week caught Moscow by surprise. Russian forces that began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had been grinding out steady gains all year. Sign up here. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he met top officials to discuss the humanitarian situation and establishing a military commandant's offices \u201cif needed\u201d in an occupied area that Kyiv says exceeds 1,000 sq km (390 sq miles). \"We continue to advance further in Kursk,\" Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram, \"from one to two km in various areas since the start of the day\". Later, in his nightly address, Zelenskiy referred to the growing number of Russian prisoners of war taken in Kursk who could be exchanged for Ukrainian fighters. \"Our advance in Kursk is going well today \u2013 we are reaching our strategic goal. The 'exchange fund' for our state has also been significantly replenished.\" Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said creation of a \"buffer zone\" was \"designed to protect our border communities from daily enemy attacks\". Russia has been pummelling Ukraine with strikes launched from adjacent border territories, including Kursk. Ukraine complains its defence against such attacks has been hamstrung by the need to respect Western countries' compunction about using their weapons against Russia's hinterland rather than against its forces in occupied Ukraine. Zelenskiy once more urged Western allies to permit long-range missile strikes into Russia. RUSSIA SAYS IT DOWNS UKRAINIAN DRONES Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to expel the Ukrainian troops. He says they aim, with Western backing, to give Kyiv a stronger hand in possible future ceasefire talks. But more than a week of intense battles have so far failed to oust them. \"The situation remains difficult,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, an influential Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. Ukraine's General Staff said Kyiv hit four Russian military airfields overnight in the Russian regions of Voronezh, Kursk and Nizhniy Novgorod, targeting fuel stores and aerial weapons. Zelenskiy called the attack \"timely\" and \"accurate\". The aim of the long-range drone strike was to undermine Russia's ability to attack Ukraine with glide bombs, a Ukrainian security source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Ukraine's military said it had destroyed a Russian Su-34. Moscow said it shot down 117 of the Ukrainian drones as well as four missiles. The Russian Defence Ministry posted a video on Telegram that it said showed Sukhoi Su-34 bombers striking Ukrainian positions in Kursk region. Later, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks inside Kursk, including at Russkoye Porechnoye, 18 km (11 miles) from the border. Some pro-Russian war bloggers said the front had been stabilised, while state television said Moscow's forces were turning the tide. Russia's National Guard said it was beefing up security at the Kursk nuclear power plant, just 35 km (22 miles) from the fighting. In the Russian border region of Belgorod, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov declared a state of emergency. Russia says it has already evacuated around 200,000 people from the border zone. The acting governor of the Kursk region late on Wednesday said on Telegram that residents of the border settlement of Glushkovo were ordered to evacuate. UKRAINE PLANS CIVILIAN EVACUATION CORRIDORS Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Kyiv would open humanitarian corridors for evacuating civilians toward both Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said Kyiv would also arrange access for international humanitarian organisations, likely to include the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations. The unprecedented incursion carries major risks for Russia, Ukraine and the West, which is keen to avoid a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance that has helped arm Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden said U.S. officials were in constant touch with Kyiv over the incursion, although the White House said Washington had not received advance notice and had no involvement. Russian officials say Ukraine's Western backers must have known of the attack. \"Of course they are involved,\" lawmaker Maria Butina told Reuters. The offensive could leave Ukrainian forces more exposed on other parts of the front, where Russia has been slowly adding to the 18% of Ukrainian territory it now controls. The heaviest fighting is still in the Donetsk region, and Zelenskiy said his forces there would receive more weapons than planned from the next Western support package. Ukraine's top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian town of Sudzha, a transhipment hub for Russian natural gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine, was fully under Ukrainian control. Natural gas was still flowing on Wednesday. \"Sudzha is under Ukrainian control. However, Ukraine has no intention of claiming someone else\u2019s land,\" the Kyiv foreign ministry said on X. The Russian rouble fell further against the dollar on Wednesday, for a loss of over 8% since the incursion began.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Niger breaks diplomatic relations with Ukraine, citing claims of support for \"terrorist\" groups.","text":"Ukraine is seeking support from the Global South, but several West African states are ditching Western ties to turn to Russia. Russia has accused Ukraine of opening a \u201csecond front\u201d in the war between them in Africa after Mali and Niger broke off diplomatic relations with Kyiv, accusing it of supporting \u201cterrorist groups\u201d. The claim by Moscow followed an announcement from Niger\u2019s military government on Tuesday that it has cut ties with Ukraine. Several states in West Africa have recently ditched longstanding ties with the West to turn to Russia. Niamey said on Tuesday that the change in relations with Ukraine would happen \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. The move was in line with that of neighbouring Mali\u2019s military government, which on Sunday announced it was severing relations with Kyiv over its role in an attack in the north of the country in which Tuareg rebels said they killed dozens of Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers. Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s military spy agency, said that the Malian rebels had received the \u201cnecessary\u201d information to conduct the operation. \u201cThe government of the Republic of Niger learned with great amazement and deep indignation, the subversive and unacceptable remarks of Mr Andriy Yusov,\u201d Amadou Abdramane, a spokesperson for Niger\u2019s military government, said as he announced the diplomatic break. Niger will ask the United Nations Security Council to debate Ukraine\u2019s \u201caggression,\u201d he added. On Monday, Ukraine condemned Mali\u2019s decision to sever relations as short-sighted and hasty, saying Kyiv rejected the allegation of Ukrainian support for international terrorism. Ukraine did not immediately respond about the move by Niger. Niger and Mali are both run by military governments that took power in recent coups. Both have since ripped up defence agreements with France and turned to Russia for military support. \u201cUnable to defeat Russia on the battlefield, the criminal regime of Volodymyr Zelenskyy has opened a second front in Africa,\u201d Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, as she accused Ukraine of \u201cpandering to terrorist groups in countries on the continent friendly to Moscow.\u201d On July 25, three days of intense fighting erupted near the Mali-Algeria border at a military camp at Tinzaouatene . Tuareg-led separatists said they had killed 84 fighters from Wagner and 47 Malian soldiers. Mali\u2019s army has admitted it suffered a \u201clarge number\u201d of deaths during the fighting but has not released figures. As well as condemning Yusov\u2019s comments, Niger, Mali and others in West Africa have blasted those of Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Senegal\u2019s foreign ministry summoned Ukrainian ambassador Yurii Pyvovarov on Friday over a video it said the Ukrainian embassy had posted on its Facebook page in which Pyvovarov provided \u201cunequivocal and unqualified support for the terrorist attack\u201d in Mali. The spat is viewed as a significant hit to Ukraine\u2019s efforts to win global support as it defends itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, and, in particular, to broaden its appeal in the Global South.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Ukrainian troops and military vehicles enter Russia's Belgorod Oblast with the region declaring a state of emergency. Heavy fighting is reportedly underway.","text":"SUMY REGION, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s offensive into Russia has expanded to the region of Belgorod, with fierce fighting underway there as Kyiv\u2019s forces in the neighboring region of Kursk showed signs of solidifying control Thursday. The new details about the fighting in Belgorod, described by Ukrainian soldiers wounded there and evacuated across the border to Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region, came as Ukraine on Thursday appointed a military commander to manage the parts of Kursk it has taken.\n\nUkraine\u2019s intelligence service also announced Thursday the detention of more than 100 Russian troops, in what it said amounted to the \u201clargest mass capture\u201d of enemy soldiers at one time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe celebratory mood over the surprise advance into Russian territory persisted among many troops returning from Kursk to Sumy on Thursday to refuel their armored vehicles and buy espressos and hot dogs in Ukraine before returning to their posts across the border in Russia.\n\nIn a village close to the border crossing Ukrainian forces overran last week, the director of Ukraine\u2019s national war museum beamed Thursday evening as he sorted through items collected by Ukrainian soldiers in Russia. He piled Russian movie posters, military uniforms and even a communist flag into the back of his silver van, saying he plans to display them in Kyiv.\n\nBut in contrast to the jubilance of some who fought in Kursk, the fighting in Belgorod has been fierce.\n\nThree wounded Ukrainian soldiers, including one commander, described how after months of being deployed along the border, they were sent into Russia four days ago. They crossed in a fleet of armored vehicles in broad daylight, said Hacker, 24, speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his call sign, in keeping with Ukrainian military rules.\n\nAs they prepared to cross the border at Kolotilovka, in the same location where prisoners of war have previously been exchanged, Hacker recalled thinking to himself that this was a \u201ccrazy\u201d move.\n\nThe Russian troops in Belgorod appeared prepared for their arrival, the soldiers said, in contrast to the quick advances Ukrainian units made through Kursk. Although some had retreated, the area was fortified with dragon\u2019s teeth antitank obstacles and heavily mined. Ukrainians came under intense attack by artillery, drones and aerial bombs almost immediately.\n\nThe Ukrainians pushed forward about six miles, the soldiers said, seizing abandoned Russian troop positions. But the fighting remained intense. \u201cAll our group was injured the day we arrived,\u201d Hacker said. Many Ukrainian troops were concussed or heavily wounded, while others were killed and had to be left behind, he said.\n\nShelling remained so intense that survivors had to take cover in Russian trenches for days, until an armored vehicle arrived to evacuate them for medical treatment early Thursday. Some were injured more than once as they waited for help.\n\nHacker said he feared he might be killed in Russia \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t know their territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were working blind,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has not acknowledged ground fighting in Belgorod, but the governor there declared a state of emergency earlier in the week.\n\nAmong the six who were evacuated was Hacker\u2019s commander Serhii, 48, whose right leg was badly wounded in a drone attack a day earlier. He underwent surgery immediately upon arrival in Ukraine on Thursday. \u201cWe were shelled by everything,\u201d he said. A nurse came to adjust his bloody leg as other injured troops recuperated around him. One\u2019s face was bloodied and swollen. Two others had injuries to their arms.\n\nRussian forces in Belgorod may have been put on high alert after the operation into neighboring Kursk, and that could have contributed to the stiffer resistance, said Brady Africk, an open-source analyst and senior media associate at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThat posture was probably buttressed by defensive line construction since last summer, Africk said, a buildup after cross-border raids led by Russian militias aligned with Kyiv.\n\n\u201cThere is a pattern of Russia being attacked in a way that they didn\u2019t expect, losing territory either temporarily or permanently, and responding by dramatically increasing the construction of defenses,\u201d Africk said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an open question whether Ukrainian forces who fought in Belgorod were aided by the same level of planning and support that aided their counterparts in Kursk, Africk said.\n\nDespite some losses, Ukrainian officials have seized on the momentum in Kursk, with military chief Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky announcing Thursday the appointment of a military commander for the region \u201cto maintain law and order and ensure the basic needs of the population.\u201d The announcement echoes Russia\u2019s own moves to administer the parts of Ukraine it occupies. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to press toward the eastern city of Pokrovsk, with regional authorities on Thursday announcing mandatory civilian evacuation from the key rail hub.\n\nUkrainian soldier Kniaz, 32, who stopped in Sumy to refuel his vehicle Thursday, said he has interacted with older Russian civilians across the border, including some who spoke Ukrainian and thanked the troops for their mission. \u201cThey want peace and quiet,\u201d he said. When asked whether he believed Ukraine would try to hold on to the territory indefinitely, Kniaz, whose call sign is an ancient Slavic royal title, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. \u2026 I just have to do my job.\u201d\n\nThe detention of more than 100 Russian troops amounted to the \u201clargest mass capture\u201d of enemy soldiers at one time, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service said, amid talks that they will be exchanged for Ukrainian captives.\n\nSpeaking about the operation, which took place the previous day, a Ukrainian intelligence officer said that special forces from Ukraine\u2019s state security service, or SBU, \u201ccaptured and cleared a sprawling \u2026 and well-fortified stronghold of a company,\u201d taking 102 Russian service members prisoner.\n\nThe captured soldiers were from Russia\u2019s 488th Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment and the Akhmat unit, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA video provided by the official showed dozens of soldiers lying in a line, face down in an open field. Their faces and battle insignia were not visible. The Washington Post could not independently verify the footage.\n\nA Ukrainian official said Russia has been in contact about a prisoner swap \u2014 something it had promised to discontinue after the incursion into the southern Kursk region began.\n\n\u201cThere was an initiative from the Russian counterpart regarding this issue. I really hope that, despite the public statements by Russian media that allegedly the Russians have decided to halt exchanges, we are still exchanging information at this time,\u201d Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s human rights commissioner, told local media late Wednesday.\n\nIn a video address Tuesday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that \u201chundreds of Russian soldiers have already surrendered.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials have said that a main reason for the surprise incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region was to halt cross-border missile attacks and shelling into Ukraine\u2019s neighboring Sumy region.\n\nUkraine was creating a \u201csecurity zone\u201d in Kursk, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram post Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere are Russian civilians within the specified zone,\u201d Vereshchuk wrote. \u201cThey are under the protection of international humanitarian law, with which Ukraine fully complies.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s efforts to take back ground in Kursk, meanwhile, have been hampered by infighting between different military and security units, according to nationalist military bloggers who are blaming various military commanders and calling for their dismissal.\n\nAfter the initial swift advance, Ukraine\u2019s progress in the Kursk region has slowed as it has faced tougher resistance. Maxar satellite images show Russian forces digging trenches in an effort to halt any possible advance toward Lgov, west of the city of Kursk.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, a civilian economist appointed in May for his capacity to ramp up military production and enhance efficiency, announced plans at a meeting of regional governors to increase supplies of military hardware and manpower to the Kursk region.\n\nThe meeting appeared to be tacit admission of inadequate manpower and hardware and poor coordination in the 10 days since the attack began. Belousov said the military had prepared a plan \u201cto enhance the efficiency of troop control in coordination with other security agencies\u201d in the region.\n\nOn Thursday, an additional district in the Kursk region, Glushkovo, with a population of 18,000, was evacuated, taking the total number ordered to evacuate to about 180,000.","question":"What region of Russia did Ukrainian forces expand their offensive into in August 2024?","answer":"Ukrainian forces expanded their offensive into Russia's Belgorod region in August 2024.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u0423 \u044f\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0456\u043e\u043d \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0423 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0454\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0411\u0454\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer '\u0411\u0454\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c' matches the expected answer '\u0411\u0454\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457' in terms of the region specified.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"10 August  President Zelenskyy confirms ordering a major cross-border operation inside Russia's Kursk Oblast.","text":"Kursk attack will pressure Russia and 'restore justice,' Zelenskiy says By Vitalii Hnidyi and Oleksandr Kozhukhar August 12, 2024 12:11 PM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Summary Companies Moscow forces fight Kyiv's troops in Kursk for sixth day At least 13 injured in Kursk from downed missile Russian authorities rush to evacuate residents SUMY REGION, Ukraine, Aug 11 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had launched an incursion into Russian territory to \"restore justice\" and pressure Moscow's forces, in his first acknowledgement of Kyiv's surprise offensive into the western Kursk region. Moscow's forces on Sunday were in their sixth day of intense battle against Kyiv's largest incursion into Russian territory since the start of the war, which left southwestern parts of Russia vulnerable before reinforcement started arriving. Sign up here. Russian authorities rushed to evacuate residents and imposed a sweeping security regime in three border regions on Saturday, after the attack which military analysts say caught the Kremlin off-guard. Belarus, a staunch ally of Moscow, also sent more troops to its border with Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of violating its air space. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said he had discussed the operation with top Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, vowing to respond in kind after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. \"Today, I received several reports from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi regarding the front lines and our actions to push the war onto the aggressor's territory,\" he said late on Saturday. \"Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and is ensuring the exact kind of pressure that is needed - pressure on the aggressor.\" Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday it had destroyed 14 Ukrainian drones and four Tochka-U tactical ballistic missiles overnight over the Kursk region, and 18 drones over other Russian regions that Ukraine frequently attacks. In a statement, it called the ground incursion \"barbaric\" and said it made no military sense. Ukraine has at most occupied several tens of square kilometres of Russian territory without laying claim to it, while Russia controls more than 100,000 sq km of Ukraine's internationally recognised territory. Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, said on Wednesday the attacks had been halted, but Russia has not pushed the Ukrainian forces back over the border. Russian military bloggers said the situation had stabilised after Russia's reinforcements, though they said Ukraine was swiftly building up forces. INJURIES AND EVACUATIONS Zelenskiy said on Sunday Russia had launched nearly 2,000 cross-border strikes on Ukraine's Sumy region from the region of Kursk this summer and that such strikes deserved a Ukrainian response.

We also record missile strikes, and each such strike deserves a fair response,\" the Ukrainian leader said. Earlier, Kursk officials said 13 people were injured in the city after debris from a destroyed Ukrainian missile fell onto a nine-storey residential building. An image posted by Kursk's mayor showed flames rising through a shattered apartment block surrounded by charred debris. It was not clear whether there was further damage. Moscow and Kyiv rarely disclose the full extent of damage inflicted by attacks on them unless there are injuries or damage to residential buildings. Alexei Smirnov, Kursk's acting governor, ordered local authorities to speed up the evacuation of civilians in areas at risk. On Saturday, Russia's TASS state news agency reported that more than 76,000 people had been evacuated. Kyiv and Moscow deny targeting civilians in their attacks in the war, which has killed thousands of people and displaced millions of Ukrainians, and has no end in sight. Russian military bloggers say fighting is taking place as deep as 20 km (12 miles) inside the Kursk region, prompting some of them to question why Ukraine was able to pierce the Kursk region so easily. A few dozen Russian soldiers, including fighters from Chechnya, who were captured allegedly in Kursk were shown in a video posted by \"I want to live,\" a project which is linked to Ukraine's military spy agency. Reuters could not immediately verify the video. After a father and his 4-year-old son were killed near Kyiv in what Zelenskiy said was a Russian air attack using a North Korean missile, the Ukrainian leader asked Western partners for \"strong decisions\" allowing his troops to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons. \"When Ukraine's long-range capabilities have no limits, this war will definitely have a limit,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X. Russian Human Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova said she had sent an appeal to the United Nations demanding it condemn Ukraine's actions in Kursk.

General Oleksandr Syrskyi says that the administration will \"maintain law and order\" in the region.","text":"Ukraine sets up military office inside Russia Image source, Getty Images Article information Author, Ian Aikman Role, BBC News 15 August 2024 Ukraine has set up a military administrative office in Russia's western Kursk region, where its surprise incursion into Russian territory continues, according to its top military commander. Gen Oleksandr Syrsky said the office would \"maintain law and order\" and \"meet the immediate needs\" of the population in the area. In a video posted on social media, Gen Syrsky is seen telling a meeting chaired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the office has been created \"on the territories controlled by Ukraine\". Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov has said Moscow will send reinforcements to \"safeguard\" the population in the region. Advertisement Image source, Facebook \/ Volodymyr Zelensky Image caption, President Zelensky chaired a meeting with top Ukrainian commanders on Thursday Ukraine also claimed to have made further gains in its incursion on Thursday. Ukrainian troops were 35km inside the Kursk region, where they control 1,150sq km of territory, including 82 settlements, Gen Syrsky said. Now on its 10th day, this is Ukraine's deepest incursion into Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. But Kyiv has said it is not interested in \"taking over\" Russian territory. Instead, the incursion is an attempt to pressure Moscow into agreeing to \"restore a just peace\", Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy told reporters on Wednesday. In light of the incursion, Russian officials have prepared plans for \"additional measures\" to safeguard the population and infrastructure in areas bordering Ukraine. The measures involve improving the \"management of troops\" in the Belgorod region, which neighbours Kursk, according to a video published on the Russian defence ministry's Telegram channel. Interfax news agency said the plan would also apply to Kursk and Bryansk regions. All three border Ukraine. Russia has also declared a federal level emergency in the Belgorod region. On Monday, 11,000 people were evacuated from the Krasnaya Yaruga district in Belgorod, according to Russian state news agency Tass. Despite this, Moscow also claims it has recaptured some lost territory. In a statement, the defence ministry said it had regained control of the Krupets settlement in the Kursk region. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov chaired a meeting in Moscow to discuss security in regions bordering Ukraine The developments came as a UK source confirmed to the BBC that tanks donated by the UK had been used during Ukraine's Russian incursion. The UK Ministry of Defence did not officially comment on which specific UK weapons have been used by Ukraine, but the department reiterated that Ukraine had a \"clear right\" to use UK-supplied weapons for \"self-defence against Russia's illegal attacks\". The UK was one of the first countries to provide modern Western battle tanks to Ukraine, donating 14 Challenger 2 tanks in the past year.  But that was for a Ukrainian offensive to recapture its own territory. The Ministry of Defence has insisted that there has been no change in policy. UK-donated tanks used in Kyiv's Russia incursion 15 August 2024 Military equipment supplied by the United States and Germany is also being used for Ukraine's incursion. None of those countries have raised objections about their equipment being used for the offensive. But given the secrecy surrounding the operation, few would have known Ukraine's intentions in advance. There may still be concerns in the West about what happens next. Not just over whether Ukraine could suffer significant losses and come back asking for more. But more importantly, there will be some who may worry about how Russia responds. The Kremlin has already accused the West of being behind the attack on its territory. The fact that Western weapons are involved could be seen as evidence for that charge. Escalation is always a worry when it involves a nuclear armed state, and the Kremlin has not been afraid to occasionally rattle its nuclear sabre. But it has also set down many red lines that have already been crossed. It warned the West not to supply Ukraine with tanks in the first place. That warning was eventually ignored. There is, however, still one big restriction. No Western country has given Kyiv the green light to use their long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Britain, France and the US have all provided some \u2013 but with the caveat they must be used inside Ukraine, which does include its southern Crimea peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. President Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded for those caveats to be lifted.","question":"Who was appointed as the senior commander of Ukraine's military administration in Sudzha in August 2024?","answer":"Major General Eduard Moskalyov was appointed as the senior commander.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u0425\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0456 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b-\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0440 \u0415\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043e\u0432.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0454 \u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0456\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0456 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443.","correct":false,"refusal":true,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer states that there is no publicly available information about the appointment of a senior commander for the military administration in Sudzha in August 2024 as of June 2024.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Germany issues an indefinite ban on requesting or providing new military aid to Ukraine that has not already been approved in order to reduce federal budget spending. The moratorium results in a \"tangible dispute\" within the Scholz coalition government.","text":"News Defense Germany to halt new Ukraine military aid: Report The ban, which is already in place, will affect all new requests for assistance to Kyiv, Germany\u2019s FAZ newspaper reported. Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Free article usually reserved for subscribers The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report. | Alexander Koerner\/Getty Images August 17, 2024 1:03 pm CET By Giovanna Coi The German government will stop new military aid to Ukraine as part of the ruling coalition's plan to reduce spending, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Saturday. The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report , which cited non-public documents and emails as well as discussions with people familiar with the matter. In a letter sent to the German defense ministry on Aug. 5, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds from frozen Russian assets , according to the German newspaper. Advertisement Germany and other G7 countries in June struck a preliminary deal to use the value of some $300 billion of Russia\u2019s sovereign assets immobilized in Western financial institutions to secure a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But governments have yet to agree on the details of the scheme, and technical talks might drag on for months. Berlin, which is Europe's main supplier of military aid to Kyiv, had already signaled a change in course on Ukraine last month , when the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals adopted a preliminary deal on a draft budget for 2025. The compromise seen by POLITICO detailed plans to slash future assistance to Ukraine by half to \u20ac4 billion to fulfill other spending priorities. Speaking after the Cabinet approved the draft budget in mid-July, Lindner said Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from \"European sources\" as well as the frozen Russian assets. But it's still unclear if, and when, that money will flow. Contentions over Ukraine aid reportedly deepened the rifts in the ruling coalition in Berlin, already tattered by weeks of internal fights over a series of issues from the budget to welfare. Green leader and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said this week he plans to run for chancellor as the Greens\u2019 candidate in the 2025 federal election, casting doubt on the survival of the governing alliance of which he is a member. \u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground,\u201d Habeck said regarding the recent disputes. \u201cThe ideas are falling apart.\u201d Advertisement Related Tags Aid and development Air defense Budget Defense Defense budgets Elections European Defense European defense policy Finance and banking Military War in Ukraine Welfare Related Countries Germany Russia Ukraine Related People Christian Lindner Olaf Scholz Robert Habeck Related Organizations G7 German defense ministry Our readers read next Macron calls report on new snap elections \u2018complete nonsense\u2019 1 HR ago 2 mins read Spain terminates Israeli ammo contract after uproar threatened to topple coalition 1 HR ago 3 mins read UK lifts sanctions on Syria\u2019s defense ministry 2 HRS ago 1 min read Trump crashes the home stretch of Canada\u2019s election 3 HRS ago 3 mins read More from Giovanna Coi Why von der Leyen\u2019s Big Tech tax plan is bluster There are major hurdles to overcome for the EU to retaliate against U.S. digital companies.

David Blevins: Trump closer to throwing in towel than ending war Live reporting by Adam McGroarty 16:24:53 Podcast: What happens if the US walks away from a Ukraine peace deal? JD Vance is the latest senior member of\u00a0Donald Trump's administration to say the US will walk away from peace talks if\u00a0there isn't\u00a0a yes from both Ukraine\u00a0and\u00a0Russia. But the US plan to recognise Russia's claim to Crimea would be a breach of Ukraine's constitution and so not something Volodomyr Zelenskyy can agree to even if he wanted to keep the talks alive. On today's Sky News Daily, Niall Paterson talks to our international affairs editor Dominic Waghorn about what will happen to Ukraine\u00a0and Russia - and\u00a0to the UK's and Europe's relations with the US - if Trump\u00a0walks away from peace talks.

That number has now risen again from 10 to 12, according to Ukraine's interior ministry. It said that at least 90 people have also been injured in the attack, and emergency and rescue operations are ongoing. 15:50:18 Starmer vows crackdown on Russian energy revenues until Putin agrees ceasefire Away from the battleground for a moment, Sir Keir Starmer has been hosting the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at an energy summit in London. He used part of his speech to send a message to Vladimir Putin, saying Russia must never be able to \"blackmail\" Europe on energy. \"Until Russia comes to the table and agrees a full and unconditional ceasefire, we must continue to crack down on their energy revenues which are still fuelling Putin's war chest,\" he said. \"This is the moment to act.\" Watch: 'The world has changed', Starmer says 15:32:05 Number killed in Kyiv strike rises to 10, Ukraine says We've just received an update from Ukraine's interior ministry after Russia's overnight attack on Kyiv. At least 10 people have died after firefighters recovered another body from under the rubble of a collapsed building. The interior ministry adds that at least 90 people have been injured in the attack, with emergency and rescue operations continuing. Watch the moment of the strike in the video below. 15:25:01 What will Europe do if US deal insists on recognising Russian control of Crimea? European nations are facing a dilemma after Donald Trump's peace plan reportedly commits the US to acknowledging Moscow's control of Crimea. Some officials are fearing that differences over Washington's proposal will put bilateral relations with London, Berlin and other capitals to the test, the Financial Times reports. \"Things don\u2019t look good at all,\" an EU official told the newspaper, adding that any move by the US to recognise Crimea as Russian or demand that European capitals ease sanctions on Moscow would \"kill EU unity\". \"[It\u2019s] all looking messy,\u201d the official added. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been firm in his stance that Ukraine would not accept the move, saying it is against its constitution, and most of the international community agrees with him. But Trump accused Ukraine's president of prolonging the war due to his red line over Crimea, and urged him to \"get it done\". 15:03:01 Explained: Russia and North Korea's special relationship Sources in Ukraine's military said today that the missile that killed eight people in Kyiv overnight was manufactured in North Korea (see 10.33am post). If true, it highlights the ever-growing partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang which has seen North Korean weapons deliveries become the most significant direct military aid to Russia's war effort in Ukraine. Both sanctioned countries signed a bilateral defence pact last year, with North Korea later sending soldiers to Moscow to help turn the tide on a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Despite taking initial heavy casualties, the estimated 14,000 troops sent by Kim Jong Un no doubt helped Russia get to the point today where Ukraine's presence in Kursk has been all but removed. But, as evidenced in Kyiv overnight, North Korea has offered more than just the lives of its soldiers in Russia. It has also sent armaments which flow to Ukraine's eastern front. Pyongyang has been accused of sending millions of shells to Russia in massive shipments via sea and train. It's also dispatched ballistic missiles and long-range artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, according to a Reuters investigation. \"North Korea's contribution has been strategically vital,\" says Hugh Griffiths, who from 2014-2019 was coordinator of the UN panel of experts that monitored sanctions on North Korea. \"Without Chairman Kim Jong Un's support, President Vladimir Putin wouldn't really be able to prosecute his war in Ukraine.\" 14:40:13 NATO chief to meet top US officials in Washington NATO's secretary general will meet top US officials over the next two days in Washington. Mark Rutte has been holding talks with US defence secretary Pete Hegseth, and will also meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Donald Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz. The meetings come after Rubio pulled out of high-level talks in London yesterday alongside envoy Steve Witkoff, leaving somewhat sidelined Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg to lead the delegation. It's Rutte's second trip to the US capital in as many months, after he met Trump at the White House in March. 14:23:46 Watch: Moment of strike on Kyiv Here's the moment a Russian missile successfully avoided Ukraine's air defences and struck Kyiv overnight. As we've reported, authorities say at least eight people were killed and dozens more injured during Russia's attack. 13:52:01 In pictures: Aftermath of Kyiv attack Emergency workers are still trying to clear the destruction caused by last night's missile and drone attack on Kyiv. At least eight people died as a result of the attack - the deadliest night in Ukraine's capital since July 2024. 13:32:51 'Vladimir, STOP!': Trump 'not happy' with Kyiv strikes Donald Trump has shared his thoughts on last night's Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv. Posting on Truth Social, the US president says: \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. \"Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let's get the Peace Deal DONE!\" Yesterday, Trump claimed he found it easier to negotiate with Moscow than he did with Ukraine, saying he thought \"we have a deal with Russia\". He also accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of prolonging the war in Ukraine due to his stance over Crimea (see 9.41am post).","question":"What did the United Kingdom announce regarding Ukraine's use of British weaponry in August 2024?","answer":"The United Kingdom announced that Ukraine could use British weaponry, including Challenger 2 tanks, for military operations inside Russia.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u0429\u043e \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0456\u044f \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043e \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0457 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0456\u044f \u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430, \u0449\u043e \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u044e, \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0447\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 Challenger 2, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0423 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043d\u0456 2024 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0456\u044f \u043e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u044e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432 \u043f\u043e \u0446\u0456\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer aligns closely with the expected answer, confirming that the UK allowed Ukraine to use British weapons, including strikes on Russian territory.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Free article usually reserved for subscribers The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report. | Alexander Koerner\/Getty Images August 17, 2024 1:03 pm CET By Giovanna Coi The German government will stop new military aid to Ukraine as part of the ruling coalition's plan to reduce spending, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Saturday. The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report , which cited non-public documents and emails as well as discussions with people familiar with the matter. In a letter sent to the German defense ministry on Aug. 5, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds from frozen Russian assets , according to the German newspaper. Advertisement Germany and other G7 countries in June struck a preliminary deal to use the value of some $300 billion of Russia\u2019s sovereign assets immobilized in Western financial institutions to secure a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But governments have yet to agree on the details of the scheme, and technical talks might drag on for months. Berlin, which is Europe's main supplier of military aid to Kyiv, had already signaled a change in course on Ukraine last month , when the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals adopted a preliminary deal on a draft budget for 2025. The compromise seen by POLITICO detailed plans to slash future assistance to Ukraine by half to \u20ac4 billion to fulfill other spending priorities. Speaking after the Cabinet approved the draft budget in mid-July, Lindner said Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from \"European sources\" as well as the frozen Russian assets. But it's still unclear if, and when, that money will flow. Contentions over Ukraine aid reportedly deepened the rifts in the ruling coalition in Berlin, already tattered by weeks of internal fights over a series of issues from the budget to welfare. Green leader and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said this week he plans to run for chancellor as the Greens\u2019 candidate in the 2025 federal election, casting doubt on the survival of the governing alliance of which he is a member. \u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground,\u201d Habeck said regarding the recent disputes. \u201cThe ideas are falling apart.\u201d Advertisement Related Tags Aid and development Air defense Budget Defense Defense budgets Elections European Defense European defense policy Finance and banking Military War in Ukraine Welfare Related Countries Germany Russia Ukraine Related People Christian Lindner Olaf Scholz Robert Habeck Related Organizations G7 German defense ministry Our readers read next Macron calls report on new snap elections \u2018complete nonsense\u2019 1 HR ago 2 mins read Spain terminates Israeli ammo contract after uproar threatened to topple coalition 1 HR ago 3 mins read UK lifts sanctions on Syria\u2019s defense ministry 2 HRS ago 1 min read Trump crashes the home stretch of Canada\u2019s election 3 HRS ago 3 mins read More from Giovanna Coi Why von der Leyen\u2019s Big Tech tax plan is bluster There are major hurdles to overcome for the EU to retaliate against U.S. digital companies.

Only Russia,\" Podolyak said as part of his written comments. Sign up here. The multi-billion dollar Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines transporting gas under the Baltic Sea were ruptured by a series of explosions in September 2022, seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday that Poland had received a European arrest warrant issued by Berlin in connection with the attack, but the suspect, a Ukrainian man named as Volodymyr Z, has already left Poland. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that top Ukrainian officials were involved in what happened. \"Ukraine has nothing to do with the Nord Stream explosions,\" Podolyak said, adding that Ukraine did not gain any strategic or tactical advantage from the blasts. Russia has already blamed the United States, Britain and Ukraine for the blasts, which largely cut Russian gas off from the lucrative European market. Those countries have denied involvement. Germany, Denmark, and Sweden all opened investigations into the incident, and the Swedes found traces of explosives on several objects recovered from the explosion site, confirming the blasts were deliberate acts.

Similarly, Ukraine\u2019s long-term senior unsecured debt-category rating in foreign currency has been downgraded to SD, from CC. No Outlook is assigned on long-term issuer ratings in selective default. The long-term issuer and senior-unsecured debt ratings in local currency have been affirmed at CCC, maintaining Stable Outlooks. Additionally, the Agency has affirmed short-term issuer ratings of Ukraine in local- and foreign-currency at S-4, maintaining Stable Outlooks. The rated Eurobond instruments (as listed within the rating announcement) have been downgraded to C*, from CC. The C ratings of the rated Eurobonds are thereafter placed under review for downgrade. The long-term domestic debt instrument ratings of Ukraine in local- and in foreign-currency are affirmed at CCC, and Stable Outlooks are unchanged. The downgrade of Ukraine\u2019s long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt-category ratings in foreign currency to selective default reflects moratorium of Eurobond-debt payments in force since 1 August pending approval of a Eurobond restructuring agreement placed to bond holders on 9 August. A February-2026 Eurobond not rated by the Agency had a coupon payment due 1 August 2024 following conclusion of an earlier two-year debt-servicing suspension. This payment was bypassed as anticipated and not made whole within the 10-day grace concluding 10 August. As such \u2013 consistent with Scope\u2019s credit rating announcement dated 10 May 2024, this failure to meet the payment obligation constitutes a selective default on long-term foreign-currency debt, as Ukraine has unilaterally suspended debt payment. The downgrade of Eurobond instrument ratings to C reflects the high likelihood of near-term restructuring of and the anticipated losses for the rated Eurobond securities. Scope debt-instrument ratings are evaluated on the expected loss given default. The placement of the C Eurobond ratings under review for downgrade represents expectation of the securities near term entering a rating in default \u2013 furthermore considering the average to moderately-below-average losses that investors may incur during this debt restructuring, compared against historical averages observed in sovereign debt restructurings. On 22 July 2024, the Government of Ukraine reached an agreement in principle on debt restructuring with the members of an Ad Hoc Creditor Committee representing holders of >20% of aggregate Eurobond principal. The Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation were launched on 9 August 2024 \u2013 opening the voting for bond holders. Bond holders have until 27 August to vote, with the Eurobond restructuring targeted for settlement 30 August 2024 or shortly thereafter. The affirmation of the long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings in local currency and of the long-term domestic-debt instrument ratings in local- and foreign-currency at CCC and maintenance of the Stable Outlook reflect exclusion of the domestic debt from external debt restructuring. Nevertheless, risks for the domestic debt remain given a challenging debt-sustainability outlook even following external commercial and bilateral-official debt restructuring. The affirmation of the short-term issuer ratings at S-4 in local- and in foreign-currency represents exclusion of short-term debt by original maturity from the Eurobond restructuring. Outstanding Ukrainian short-term debt in foreign currency \u2013 such as outstanding domestic short-term debt in foreign currency (in dollar and in euro) \u2013 continues to be fully serviced. Download the rating report. Ukraine unilateral suspension of debt service following the conclusion of the two-year bilaterally-agreed debt-servicing suspension on 31 July 2024. The downgrade of long-term issuer ratings in foreign currency to selective default reflects the moratorium on Eurobond debt servicing since 1 August 2024. Before the conclusion on 31 July 2024 of the 2022-24 debt-servicing suspension of Eurobond debt, Ukraine approved a law 1 last month imposing a temporary ban of Eurobond-debt payments for effect from 1 August until as late as 1 October of this year until a Eurobond restructuring has been concluded and voted into force. The February-2026 Eurobond had a coupon payment due 1 August 2024. This payment was bypassed as anticipated \u2013 as Ukraine plans appropriately not to service legacy Eurobond securities so long as the Eurobond restructuring remains subject to completion and the moratorium signed last month is in effect. The payment was not made whole within the associated 10-day grace. This is considered a selective default through Ukraine having unilaterally suspended debt payment. Agreement in principle for debt restructuring has been achieved and voting process for bond holders planned for conclusion late this month. The Eurobond restructuring is targeted to enter into effect 30 August 2024 (or shortly thereafter). The Government of Ukraine announced on 22 July 2024 2 achievement of an agreement in principle with members of an Ad Hoc Creditor Committee representing holders of more than 20% of aggregate Eurobond principal. This agreement \u2013 achieved following the second round of concerted negotiations \u2013 outlines the restructuring terms of thirteen Ukrainian Eurobonds alongside of a single sovereign-guaranteed Eurobond of the roads-operator Ukravtodor. The proposed agreement forgoes USD 8.67bn of claims and enables Ukraine to save USD 22.75bn in debt payments by 2033 3 . The agreement was endorsed by the International Monetary Fund as compatible with debt-sustainability objectives outlined under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Group of (G-7) Creditors of Ukraine. It includes the exchange of the fourteen legacy Eurobonds for two new bond \u201cparts\u201d each having four bond series having lengthened maturities, principal reductions and varying grace periods followed by step-ups of coupon payments. The final two bond series of the second part (or Bond B) furthermore can add further principal by 2029 if Ukraine out-performs specific economic performance benchmarks (which could hypothetically reduce the aggregate write-off for consenting bond holders from 37% to as low as 25%). Ukraine has launched parallel debt-restructuring negotiations with the holders of sovereign-guaranteed Ukrenergo notes (due 2028), GDP-warrant securities (maturing 2041) and varying external commercial loans not rated by Scope but relevant for the long-term issuer rating in foreign currency. The Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation for the Eurobond restructuring were launched 9 August 2024 4 . Bond holders have until 27 August to vote. Those who agree by 23 August may see effectively just a 35.75% write-off after considering the (early) consent payment (and possibility of reduction to 23.75% if Ukrainian nominal output significantly out-performs). Non-consenting bondholders face a deeper write-off of 49.65% (if the restructuring gets voted through even absent their \u2018yes\u2019 votes that is). In net-present-value (NPV) terms, the NPV haircut is around 50% on the securities (excluding the contingent added principal on final two series of Bond B). Results of the exchange offer are to be announced on 28 August or shortly thereafter with restructuring taking effect on or after Friday, 30 August. As such, Ukraine\u2019s long-term ratings in foreign currency may be upgraded from the selective-default grade as early as 30 August. Shortly following this date, the maturity of the 1-September-2024 Eurobond as well as the due date of further Eurobond coupon payments are due by 1 September \u2013 incentivising settlement of the agreement ahead of this date. Nevertheless, even following upgrade of the long-term issuer rating in foreign currency from default, this rating is seen staying low as Ukraine negotiates restructuring of complementary external commercial claims separately over the forthcoming months. The completion of the Eurobond restructuring requires a minimum of two-thirds of bond holders of the aggregate principal of each series of notes and at least half of the bonds of each series incorporated to approve the agreement. Under the sovereign-rating methodology, execution of the agreement is considered a \u201cdistressed debt exchange\u201d. The long-term debt-sustainability outlook remains challenging even after Eurobond restructuring, so long as war continues. There is expected to be a near-term improvement of the Agency\u2019s long-run debt-sustainability outlook because of the Eurobond debt restructuring agreement. Nevertheless, the debt-sustainability outlook remains challenging. Assuming the Eurobond debt restructuring currently being considered (shaving around 5.3pps from general government debt\/GDP from a 37% write-off), debt-to-GDP is nevertheless forecast to rise to around 92.2% of GDP by end-2024 and remain slightly under 100% of GDP over the forecast horizon to 2029. This reflects a rise from an estimated 84.4% of GDP as of end-2023 and 48.9% as of 2021 before escalation of the war. Ongoing challenges reflect higher government deficits than forecast amid rises of military expenditure against an expanded conflict, weaker assumptions on economic recovery and inflation, and more-significant currency depreciation assumed this year. The government plans to raise and broaden war and excise taxes, while selling state assets and reducing spending. Under the fourth review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of Ukraine 5 , IMF pre-restructuring baseline scenarios forecast debt reaching 97.3% of GDP by end-2024 before \u2013 and more optimistically than Scope assumptions \u2013 declining to 73.5% by end-2033. The IMF assumes the war winds down by end-2024. Under forecasting of the Agency \u2013 debt sustainability stays challenging even following completion of the Eurobond debt operation and scheduled restructuring of some of the legacy bilateral official debt by 2027. Under the third review of the EFF 6 , the IMF outlined goals for the Eurobond restructuring: i) public debt ought to reach 65% of GDP by 2033; ii) gross government financing needs should average 8% of GDP during the \u201cpost-programme\u201d period (2028\u201333); and iii) as complementary objectives, public debt should be reduced to 82% of GDP by 2028 and achieve debt-service flow relief on external debt obligations of 1\u20131.8% of GDP a year. Based on such objectives, additional restructuring of Eurobond debt is not ruled out under any scenario of extended conflict. Challenges for the post-restructuring ratings of external commercial debt reflect furthermore most Ukrainian debt service remaining on domestic debt instruments, which are not up for re-profiling so long as the war continues under an intense phase. The majority of remaining debt service and about half of the aggregate principal of Ukrainian debt is furthermore today linked to multi-lateral loans, where multi-lateral institutions do not participate under debt relief. Resultantly, the 15% of Ukrainian debt (as of end-2023) and declining segment representing Eurobond securities may remain sub-ordinated even following completion of the restructuring. Domestic-debt ratings helped by resilient domestic financial system and foreseen remaining excluded from debt restructuring. The banking system has been so far resilient, supporting the domestic-debt ratings especially. Although capital adequacy (tier 1 capital ratio) has recently declined to 12.0% of risk-weighted assets by February 2024, from 14.9% as of October-2023 highs, and non-performing loans are elevated, risks around dollarisation (33% of banking-system deposits and 25% of loans being denominated in foreign currency as of June of this year) and profitability (above pre-invasion levels) have each eased to a degree from 2022 peaks. The domestic debt has been appropriately excluded from debt restructuring. The domestic sector is fundamental for filling a remaining financing gap for war, reconstruction and humanitarian spending requirements \u2013 especially given slowdown of international financing, and this dependence on the domestic banks (and especially state-owned banks) is seen as important not to jeopardise. This is furthermore as Ukraine wants to prudently sustain the elimination of monetary financing of the sovereign since January 2023 \u2013 placing greater pressure on the domestic banking system as purchasers since then to fund war and reconstruction in hryvnia. The significantly-increased holdings of the central bank of the domestic government debt (holding around 40% of hryvnia debt currently) since the war escalated furthermore complicates any contemplation around domestic bond restructuring. Nevertheless, medium- to long-run, given the challenging debt-sustainability outlook, there remain relevant vulnerabilities for the domestic debt \u2013 captured by the CCC ratings. Near-term funding stresses have eased moderately following approval of USD 61bn of American financing of Ukraine, although disbursements of said funds remain slow. The EU last week disbursed a EUR 4.2bn tranche from a separate EUR 50bn facility for Ukraine. 7 *NB. Scope debt-instrument ratings are evaluated on loss-given-default bases, while issuer and debt-category ratings are evaluated on the probability of default. There is no Outlook assigned on the foreign-currency issuer rating at the selective-default grade. The rated Eurobond instruments are expected to enter a rating in default near term. The upside scenario for the long-term issuer rating in foreign currency is: The Stable Outlook on the domestic debt ratings represents the consideration that risks for the ratings are balanced over the forthcoming 12 to 18 months. Upside scenarios for the domestic debt ratings and Outlooks are if (individually or collectively): The downside scenario for the domestic debt ratings and Outlooks is if: Scope\u2019s SQM, which assesses core sovereign credit fundamentals, signals a first indicative credit rating of \u2018b+\u2019 for Ukraine. Under Scope\u2019s sovereign methodology, the indicative rating receives: 1) no positive adjustment from the methodological reserve-currency adjustment; and 2) a three-notch negative adjustment from the methodological political-risk quantitative adjustment, reflecting the presence of war on sovereign territory. On this basis, a final SQM quantitative rating of \u2018ccc\u2019 is reviewed by the analyst-driven Qualitative Scorecard (QS) and can be changed by up to three notches up or down depending on the size of qualitative credit strengths or weaknesses of the sovereign compared against those of an SQM-assigned peer group of sovereign states. Scope identified the following QS relative credit strength of Ukraine: i) monetary policy framework; ii) debt profile and market access; iii) current account resilience; iv) financial sector oversight and governance; and v) financial imbalances. Conversely, the following relative credit weaknesses have been identified under the QS: i) macro-economic stability and sustainability; ii) long-term debt trajectory; iii) environmental factors; iv) social factors; and v) governance factors. On the aggregate, the QS generates no net adjustment for the final indicative credit rating. So, aggregate adjustments signal a long-term issuer credit rating in local currency of CCC for Ukraine. A final three-notch negative adjustment is applied for Ukraine\u2019s long-term issuer rating in foreign currency by additional considerations, reflecting two rating notches for an expectation of completion of Eurobond debt restructuring over the forthcoming weeks. Finally, one rating notch represents selective default on long-term debt denominated in foreign currency \u2013 specifically adoption of the debt moratorium since 1 August 2024 on the servicing of Eurobond securities and associated bypassed payment on the February-2026 Eurobond since 1 August 2024. This results in a final SD long-term foreign-currency issuer rating for the borrower. A rating committee has discussed and confirmed these results. Scope explicitly factors in ESG issues in its ratings process vis-\u00e0-vis the sovereign-rating methodology\u2019s stand-alone ESG sovereign-risk pillar, which holds a significant 25% weighting under the quantitative model (SQM) and 20% weight under the methodology\u2019s qualitative overlay (QS). With respect to environmental risks \u2013 Ukraine scores poorly under the SQM on carbon emissions per unit of GDP (a proxy variable for \u201ctransition costs\u201d in achieving a greener economic model long run) although Ukraine scores comparatively well on greenhouse gas emissions per capita. Ukraine scores near a global median on the degree of exposure and vulnerability to natural-disaster risk \u2013 as measured by the ND-GAIN index. The sovereign\u2019s marks are furthermore very strong under the SQM regarding the ecological footprint of consumption compared against the country\u2019s available biocapacity. Under the methodology, environmental objectives and challenges are furthermore considered by the analyst under the QS via an assessment of \u2018weak\u2019 for Ukraine on the \u2018environmental factors\u2019 QS sub-category compared against Ukraine\u2019s sovereign peer group. Ukraine ranked an improved 41 st on the 2024 Environmental Performance Index from 180 countries. 8 Ukraine plans to cut emissions while growing the economy, reducing poverty and simultaneously combatting aggression from neighbouring Russia \u2013 aiming to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from 62% under 1990 levels as of 2019 to 65% below 1990 levels by 2030, thereafter achieving full climate neutrality not later than 2060. However, the war is triggering sizeable, long-lasting environmental damage and an increase of the carbon footprint because of the use of weapons, contributing to elevating greenhouse gas emissions. Socially-related credit factors are likewise captured by the SQM and the QS qualitative overlay. Under the SQM, Ukraine receives a middle-of-the-road score on income inequality (as captured by the ratio of the income share of the bottom 50% of the population), moderate marks on labour-force participation, and relatively weak scoring with respect to the old-age dependency ratio. In addition, the comparatively modest GDP per capita as a lower-middle-income economy is captured by the SQM. A long-run decline of the working-age population undermines economic growth potential (estimated at 2.5% a year). Under the assessment of Ukraine\u2019s \u2018social factors\u2019 QS analytical category, Scope evaluates this qualitative analytical category as \u2018weak\u2019 on balance compared against Ukraine\u2019s sovereign peers. Finally, under governance-related factors captured by the SQM, Ukraine scores under the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs) represent a credit-rating constraint. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2021, given meaningful institutional reforms, percentile ranks had improved across WGI categories \u2013 although scores except on control of corruption have declined since 2022 compared against 2021 due to effects of the Russian full-scale invasion. This WGI evaluation includes the three-notch downside adjustment for the SQM indicative rating based on the political-stability WGI category. In a separate assessment of \u2018governance factors\u2019 under the QS, Scope evaluates this qualitative analytical category as \u2018weak\u2019 against \u2018ccc\u2019 indicative sovereign peers of Ukraine.

Scope Ratings does not, however, independently verify the reliability and accuracy of the information and data. Prior to the issuance of the Credit Rating action, the Rated Entity was given the opportunity to review the Credit Ratings and\/or Outlooks and the principal grounds on which the Credit Ratings and\/or Outlooks are based. Following that review, the Credit Ratings and\/or Outlooks were not amended before being issued. Regulatory disclosures These Credit Ratings and\/or Outlooks are issued by Scope Ratings GmbH, Lenn\u00e9stra\u00dfe 5, D-10785 Berlin, Tel +49 30 27891-0. The Credit Ratings and\/or Outlooks are UK-endorsed. Lead analyst: Dennis Shen, Senior Director Person responsible for approval of the Credit Ratings: Dr Giacomo Barisone, Managing Director The Credit Ratings\/Outlooks were first released by Scope Ratings on 28 January 2022. The Credit Ratings\/Outlooks were last updated on 10 May 2024. As a \"sovereign rating\" (as defined in EU Credit Rating Agency (CRA) Regulation 1060\/2009 \"EU CRA Regulation\"), the ratings of Ukraine are subject to certain publication restrictions set out in Art. 8a of the EU CRA Regulation, including publication in accordance with a pre-established calendar (see \"Publication Calendar 2024: Sovereign, Sub-Sovereign and Supranational Ratings\" published on 30 April 2024 on www.scoperatings.com). Under the EU CRA Regulation, deviations from the announced calendar are allowed only in limited circumstances and must be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the reasons for deviation. In this case, the deviation was due to selective default on long-term debt in foreign currency following a debt-servicing moratorium since 1 August 2024 and conclusion of an associated grace of the February-2026 Eurobond \u2013 an event that Scope has highlighted previously would see a rating change. In addition, the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation under Eurobond restructuring were presented to bond holders on 9 August 2024 for voting over the coming weeks. This event has prompted publication of this credit-rating action on a date deviating from previously-scheduled release dates per Scope\u2019s sovereign release calendar.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Ternopil residents are urged to remain indoors after Russian drone strikes an industrial facility, causing a large fire and an increased concentration of chlorine in the air.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance An increased level of chlorine air concentration was detected in the western city of Ternopil following a Russian missile attack against an industrial facility on Aug. 20, authorities said. Russia carried out the attack overnight , with a fire breaking out in a fuel and lubricant warehouse in an unspecified facility at 3 a.m. No casualties or injuries have been reported as a result of the strike. Oksana Chaichuk, the head of the regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention, warned Ternopil's residents to limit exposure to open air and close windows. \"With a norm of 0.1 milligrams (of chlorine) per cubic meter (mg\/m\u00b3), there is an excess of 0.4 to 1.01,\" Chaichuk said at a press briefing, adding that this means the chlorine air concentration is from four to 10 times higher than the norm. According to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists , chlorine inhalation can cause health issues at concentrations above 1.5 mg\/m\u00b3 in case of long-term exposure and at 2.9 mg\/m\u00b3 for short-term exposure. Chlorine exposure can lead to irritation of the eyes, nose, and sore throat at lower concentration levels but can also cause more serious problems and death at higher levels. Ternopil is a city in western Ukraine with a population of roughly 225,000. Lying hundreds of kilometers from the front line, the city is not a common target of Russian attacks.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Free article usually reserved for subscribers The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report. | Alexander Koerner\/Getty Images August 17, 2024 1:03 pm CET By Giovanna Coi The German government will stop new military aid to Ukraine as part of the ruling coalition's plan to reduce spending, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Saturday. The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report , which cited non-public documents and emails as well as discussions with people familiar with the matter. In a letter sent to the German defense ministry on Aug. 5, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds from frozen Russian assets , according to the German newspaper. Advertisement Germany and other G7 countries in June struck a preliminary deal to use the value of some $300 billion of Russia\u2019s sovereign assets immobilized in Western financial institutions to secure a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But governments have yet to agree on the details of the scheme, and technical talks might drag on for months. Berlin, which is Europe's main supplier of military aid to Kyiv, had already signaled a change in course on Ukraine last month , when the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals adopted a preliminary deal on a draft budget for 2025. The compromise seen by POLITICO detailed plans to slash future assistance to Ukraine by half to \u20ac4 billion to fulfill other spending priorities. Speaking after the Cabinet approved the draft budget in mid-July, Lindner said Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from \"European sources\" as well as the frozen Russian assets. But it's still unclear if, and when, that money will flow. Contentions over Ukraine aid reportedly deepened the rifts in the ruling coalition in Berlin, already tattered by weeks of internal fights over a series of issues from the budget to welfare. Green leader and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said this week he plans to run for chancellor as the Greens\u2019 candidate in the 2025 federal election, casting doubt on the survival of the governing alliance of which he is a member. \u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground,\u201d Habeck said regarding the recent disputes. \u201cThe ideas are falling apart.\u201d Advertisement Related Tags Aid and development Air defense Budget Defense Defense budgets Elections European Defense European defense policy Finance and banking Military War in Ukraine Welfare Related Countries Germany Russia Ukraine Related People Christian Lindner Olaf Scholz Robert Habeck Related Organizations G7 German defense ministry Our readers read next Macron calls report on new snap elections \u2018complete nonsense\u2019 1 HR ago 2 mins read Spain terminates Israeli ammo contract after uproar threatened to topple coalition 1 HR ago 3 mins read UK lifts sanctions on Syria\u2019s defense ministry 2 HRS ago 1 min read Trump crashes the home stretch of Canada\u2019s election 3 HRS ago 3 mins read More from Giovanna Coi Why von der Leyen\u2019s Big Tech tax plan is bluster There are major hurdles to overcome for the EU to retaliate against U.S. digital companies.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger write to the United Nations Security Council to complain that Ukraine is supporting rebel groups in West Africa's Sahel region.","text":"Membership of the court, which prosecutes crimes against humanity, also advances Ukraine\u2019s EU aspirations. Ukraine\u2019s parliament has voted to join the International Criminal Court (ICC), with politicians billing the move as a means of enabling the country to \u201cpunish\u201d suspected Russian war criminals. Parliament voted on Wednesday to ratify the Rome Statute, which paves the way for full membership of the ICC , with 281 in favour of the measure, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, posting on Telegram. One politician in the 450-member body voted against ratification, The Kyiv Independent reported. The ICC prosecutes grave offences like genocide and crimes against humanity, and has the power to issue arrest warrants that its 124 members are obliged to execute. Last year, the court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his children\u2019s ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-controlled territory. The Hague-based court issued warrants in June for former Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. \u201cUkraine\u00a0has already worked effectively with the\u00a0ICC\u00a0to ensure comprehensive accountability for all Russian atrocities committed in the course of Russian aggression,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on X. \u201cThis work will now be even more effective.\u201d    Full membership of the ICC also advances Ukraine\u2019s aspiration to eventually join the European Union. All EU member states are signatories and the bloc has been one of the court\u2019s strongest supporters. Ukraine signed the Rome Statute that founded the court in 2000, but had not ratified it, as some political and military figures expressed fears that Ukrainian soldiers could face prosecution. In June, senior presidential adviser Iryna Mudra described attempts to hold up the ratification process as a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d falsely suggesting Ukrainian troops would be more vulnerable to prosecution. In an interview, she described Kyiv\u2019s bid for ICC membership as \u201ca long journey full of challenges, myths and fears. None of them have been true\u201d.

Ukraine\u2019s parliament has voted to join the International Criminal Court (ICC), with politicians billing the move as a means of enabling the country to \u201cpunish\u201d suspected Russian war criminals. Parliament voted on Wednesday to ratify the Rome Statute, which paves the way for full membership of the ICC , with 281 in favour of the measure, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak, posting on Telegram. One politician in the 450-member body voted against ratification, The Kyiv Independent reported. The ICC prosecutes grave offences like genocide and crimes against humanity, and has the power to issue arrest warrants that its 124 members are obliged to execute. Last year, the court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his children\u2019s ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and Russian-controlled territory. The Hague-based court issued warrants in June for former Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. \u201cUkraine\u00a0has already worked effectively with the\u00a0ICC\u00a0to ensure comprehensive accountability for all Russian atrocities committed in the course of Russian aggression,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on X. \u201cThis work will now be even more effective.\u201d    Full membership of the ICC also advances Ukraine\u2019s aspiration to eventually join the European Union. All EU member states are signatories and the bloc has been one of the court\u2019s strongest supporters. Ukraine signed the Rome Statute that founded the court in 2000, but had not ratified it, as some political and military figures expressed fears that Ukrainian soldiers could face prosecution. In June, senior presidential adviser Iryna Mudra described attempts to hold up the ratification process as a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d falsely suggesting Ukrainian troops would be more vulnerable to prosecution. In an interview, she described Kyiv\u2019s bid for ICC membership as \u201ca long journey full of challenges, myths and fears. None of them have been true\u201d.

The latest package of aid includes air defense missiles, munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelins and an array of other anti-armor missiles, counter-drone and counter-electronic warfare systems and equipment, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, vehicles and other equipment. The formal announcement came on Friday, which is the eve of Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day. The weapons are being provided through presidential drawdown authority, which means they are taken from Pentagon stockpiles and can be delivered more quickly. The aid comes as Ukrainian forces continue to broaden their surprise offensive into Russia , where officials say they have taken about 100 square kilometers (62 square miles) of territory in the Kursk region. Russian troops, meanwhile, are making gains in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, around the city of Pokrovsk , a critical logistics hub.

If Pokrovsk falls , the defeat would imperil Ukraine\u2019s defenses and bring Russia closer to its stated aim of capturing the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers are now just 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away.

He said Kyiv\u2019s military had taken control of another Russian village and captured more prisoners of war.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"The Verkhovna Rada passes a bill banning the activities of all Russia-associated religious groups across Ukraine, including the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), following arrests of dozens of the church's clerics on treason charges for alleged involvement in Russian espionage and the transfer of a cleric to Russia in a prisoner swap. The bill is signed into law by President Zelenskyy on 24 August.","text":"FILE - The Monastery of the Caves, also known as Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, one of the holiest sites of Eastern Orthodox Christians, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, March 23, 2023. (AP Photo\/Efrem Lukatsky, File) By PETER SMITH Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Ukraine\u2019s parliament has banned the activities of religious groups tied to the Russian Orthodox Church or any other faith group supporting Russia\u2019s invasion \u2014 a measure widely seen as targeting a Ukrainian religious body, despite its claim to independence from Moscow. The bill creates the legal tools for the government to ban the activities of any religious group deemed to be too closely connected to Russia or to support its invasion of Ukraine.. The Verkhovna Rada approved the bill on Tuesday with 265 affirmative votes and only 29 opposed. The explicit ban on the Russian Orthodox Church is seen as aimed at the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which historically has been tied to the Russian church. The UOC has proclaimed its loyalty to Ukraine and insists that it has broken from the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church. But the Ukrainian government says it remains canonically tied to the Russian church and its Moscow-based patriarch, who has depicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a holy war. A large majority of Ukrainians are Orthodox, but they are divided between two main groups with similar names: the UOC and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which would not be affected by the legislation. Many Ukrainians continue to call the UOC the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate, as it was commonly known, despite its recent claims to independence. RELATED COVERAGE In rare criticism of Putin, Trump urges the Russian leader to \u2018STOP!\u2019 after a deadly attack on Kyiv Russian strike on Kyiv kills 12 in biggest attack on Ukrainian capital since last summer Trump says Zelenskyy is prolonging war in Ukraine by resisting calls to cede Crimea to Russia The approval of the legislation comes more than a year and a half after it was first endorsed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and underwent multiple revisions. The bill requires Zelenskyy\u2019s signature, which is expected. \u201cIt is our common duty to guarantee Ukrainian spiritual independence,\u201d Zelenskyy said earlier this month. The bill authorizes the government to investigate suspect religious groups, though final court enforcement of any action could not take effect until nine months after the law\u2019s publication. The bill explicitly prohibits activities of the Russian Orthodox Church, calling it \u201can ideological extension of the regime of the aggressor state\u201d and \u201can accomplice to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d It also bans religious organizations with ties to any organization located in a state carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine, or supporting such aggression. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has had a centuries-long affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church. Three months after Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, the UOC declared its \u201cfull self-sufficiency and independence\u201d from Moscow, and it has repeatedly declared its loyalty and called on members to fight for Ukraine as a sacred duty. But many Ukrainians remain suspicious of the church. Since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, criminal proceedings have been initiated against over 100 clerics of the UOC for alleged war-related crimes, the Security Service of Ukraine said on Tuesday. Almost 50 of them have already been charged, and 26 have received court sentences, it said. Some clerics were exchanged for Ukrainians held in Russian captivity, according to the service. After searching UOC church sites , the nation\u2019s security agency has shared photos of the evidence it found, including rubles, Russian passports, and pro-Russian leaflets The State Service of Ukraine for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience has said after examining the UOC\u2019s governing documents that the church remains a structural unit of the Russian Orthodox Church. A lawyer representing the UOC denounced the legislation as a \u201cgrotesque violation of religious freedom.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rare in law to find a bill so contemptuous of legal standards as this bill,\u201d attorney Robert Amsterdam, whose firm is based in Washington and London, said in an interview. \u201cWe will go to every court we can. We will go to the United Nations.\u201d Amsterdam called the measure \u201creligious cleansing.\u201d He insisted that the new law makes it impossible for the UOC to defend itself because it targets any religious organization that the Russian Orthodox Church claims, in its own governing documents, to control. Amsterdam said the UOC can\u2019t control what\u2019s in the ROC charter. He noted the bill also targets any religious organization whose \u201cauthorized persons\u201d are convicted for crimes against Ukraine\u2019s security. He said that amounts to illegal \u201ccollective punishment\u201d against an entire church and its believers for the alleged actions of its leaders. The Ukrainian bill also prohibits any religious organization promoting the \u201cRussian world\u201d ideology. The bill is yet another manifestation of a deep-rooted religious and cultural struggle behind the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified the invasion in part on the claim that Moscow oversees a wider \u201cRussian world,\u201d a sphere of cultural and spiritual influence across present-day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Ukrainians consider that concept as ideological aggression, noting that Kyiv adopted Christianity in the 10th century and was the region\u2019s political and spiritual center long before the rise of Moscow. Moscow Patriarch Kirill, who oversees the Russian Orthodox Church, has portrayed the war as part of a metaphysical struggle against the West and gay pride parades. In March, Kirill oversaw a council that declared Russia\u2019s invasion a \u201choly war\u201d in defense of the region\u2019s \u201csingle spiritual space.\u201d The document claims Russia is protecting the world from \u201cglobalism and the victory of the West that has fallen into Satanism.\u201d The OCU was formed by a merger of two breakaway churches created in parallel with Ukraine\u2019s assertion of political independence from Russia. The OCU received recognition in 2019 as completely independent \u2014 or \u201cautocephalous\u201d \u2014 by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, who is deemed the \u201cfirst among equals\u201d among Orthodox patriarchs. But unlike a pope, he doesn\u2019t have universal authority in the church, and Kirill fiercely rejected Bartholomew\u2019s decree. Leaders of other religious groups in Ukraine say that in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, minority faiths are severely persecuted. ___ AP journalists Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The Ukrainian Defense Forces do not believe pilot error was behind the incident, the source added. Pilot Oleksiy Mes, known as \u201cMoonfish,\u201d was killed in the crash while \u201crepelling the biggest ever aerial attack\u201d by Russia against Ukraine, said the source, adding that the pilot was buried on Thursday. The crash is being investigated and international experts will be invited to participate in the probe, the source added. The General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s army said later on Thursday that several F-16\u00a0jets were deployed alongside anti-aircraft missile units to fight the Russian attack. \u201cDuring the approach to the next target, communication with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died,\u201d the General Staff said in the update. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has long demanded the F-16s to aid his country's fight agains Russia. Sergei Supinsky\/AFP\/Getty Images Related article Ukraine confirms F-16s have arrived in country as Zelensky heralds \u2018new chapter\u2019 in fight against Russia The death of the pilot is a major blow for Ukraine. The first F-16s only arrived in the country earlier this month and Moonfish was one of the few pilots trained to fly them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that the Ukrainian Air Force used the F-16 to destroy missiles and drones launched by Russia on Monday, the first time any Ukrainian official confirmed the jets were being used in combat. Kyiv waited a long time to get hold of the F-16s, and Zelensky has been asking its\u00a0Western allies for the fighter jets since the start of the full-scale invasion. But as with\u00a0other equipment, Western countries hesitated before finally agreeing to provide F-16s. The Netherlands and Denmark pledged to provide them early summer in 2023, but it took another few weeks\u00a0for the United States to green-light\u00a0the transfer. When they arrived earlier this summer, Zelensky said he and his government\u00a0held \u201chundreds of meetings and negotiations\u201d to secure the jets. A group of Ukrainian pilots started their F-16 training in the US in the fall. While\u00a0it can take years to get\u00a0fully trained up to fly the planes, Moonfish and others had to do it in six months. Ukraine is hoping the F-16 will give it a much-needed boost. The jets are multi-role: they can provide air cover for troops, attack ground targets, take on enemy planes and intercept missiles. With the right armament, F-16s could deter Russian fighter-bombers from approaching the battlefield. Still, the jets are no silver bullet. Ukraine can use them to deny Russia control over the skies, but experts say their capabilities are inferior to the most modern Russian combat aircraft that would likely prevail in an air battle with the F-16. Oleksiy Mes known as \u201cMoonfish\u201d was one of a few Ukrainian pilots trained to fly the F-16 fighter jets. CNN Moonfish: Top pilot who lobbied hard for F-16 Moonfish and another pilot Andriy Pilshchikov, known by the call sign \u201cJuice,\u201d became the faces of Ukraine\u2019s campaign to get the F-16s. It was an uphill battle, but Juice and Moonfish pulled through it together. They were young and enthusiastic, spoke good English and were willing to fight to get the US jets into Ukrainian skies. Flying the F-16 was their dream and when Juice died in a plane crash during a combat mission last\u00a0August, Moonfish made it his goal to fulfill it.

But when Juice died, Moonfish had to take his place. In a rare interview with CNN, he admitted that if Juice were alive, he\u2019d be giving interviews. A man of few words, passionate about his job, he had his emotions under control. A straight talker who knew everything about F-16s. \u201cAndriy was the \u2018ideas man\u2019 and the main driving force behind it all,\u201d Moonfish said. \u201cAnd I feel responsible to him for ensuring these planes arrive.\u201d Speaking to CNN while in training, he said it was necessary for him and other Ukrainian pilots to undergo a truncated version of the training. \u201cWe would have had a lot of time to study the jet completely in peacetime, but we do not have the time,\u201d he said. In a statement issued later on Thursday, the Ukrainian Air Force said Moonfish destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack drone on Monday, before he was killed in the crash. The air force said he was posthumously awarded the rank of colonel. CNN\u2019s Kosta Gak contributed reporting.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"Audits conducted by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense determine that between March and July, multiple Armed Forces of Ukraine units never received nearly US$4.2 million in military aid labeled as \"humanitarian aid\" to bypass customs fees, prompting embezzlement and illicit enrichment investigations.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance Ukraine's Defense Ministry and the State Customs Service have discovered that from March to July, various military units did not receive the designated humanitarian aid worth nearly Hr 172 million ($4.2 million). In Ukraine , the \"humanitarian aid\" label used by customs includes goods meant for the army, such as protective equipment or cars. Such goods are free of customs fees. The joint audit by the ministry and customs service found that a number of goods imported as \"humanitarian aid\" and meant for specific military units have never made it to their alleged destination, meaning that the goods were likely deliberately mislabelled to avoid customs fees. These problematic imports included nearly 500 tons of goods, carried in 424 vehicles, the statement read. As a result, the ministry appealed to law enforcement agencies to investigate unspecified officials, alleging illicit enrichment, embezzlement , and abuse of power. In 2023, the State Customs Service said that almost a third of imported \"humanitarian aid \" did not reach the Ukrainian military due to customs violations. The agency reported checking 9,000 instances of importing goods labeled \"humanitarian aid\" during the first nine months of 2023. In some 3,000 of such cases, the Customs Service said, the designated military units could not confirm that they had received the goods. On March 1, 2022, days after Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine and humanitarian aid poured into the country, the government issued a decree allowing the import of certain goods tax-free. In December 2022, the list of goods that can be imported tax-free as humanitarian aid was amended. According to the State Customs Service, some importers allegedly used these provisions to avoid tax.

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"President Zelenskyy dismisses Mykola Oleshchuk as the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force following the fatal crash of an F-16 fighter jet on 26 August and replaces him with Anatolii Kryvonozhko,","text":"Zelensky sacks Ukraine air force chief after F-16 crash 31 August 2024 Share Save Mallory Moench BBC News Share Save Getty Images Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk was sacked the day amid debates over the downing of an F-16 fighter jet President Volodymyr Zelensky has sacked the commander of Ukraine's air force amid debate over the destruction of one of the country's valuable new F-16 fighter jets. Mr Zelensky did not specify the reason for dismissing Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk, but said he had a responsibility to \"take care of all our warriors\". The US-made F-16 - one of several delivered earlier this month by Ukraine's Western allies - went down on Monday, killing the pilot. Even though it happened during a barrage of Russian missiles, Ukraine said the cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy strike, and Lt Gen Oleshchuk sparred with some politicians over who was to blame for the loss. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has seized a large part of territory in the east of the country. But Ukraine also launched a surprise incursion into Russia's western Kursk region early this month - and says its troops have been advancing deeper into Russia. In response, Russia has intensified its attacks across Ukraine. On Friday, a 14-year-old girl was killed after a Russian guided bomb hit a playground in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials say. At least six other people were killed and 59 injured as a 12-storey residential building was also hit in the city which is close to the Russian border. President Zelensky renewed his calls for all Ukraine's international partners to allow it to hit targets inside Russia to prevent such attacks. His office said Moscow's forces had fired more than 400 drones and missiles at Ukraine over the past week. Ukraine F-16 destroyed during Russian attack, BBC told Ukraine receives first F-16 fighter jets - Zelensky In a post on Telegram, Mr Zelensky said he had decided to replace Lt Gen Oleschuk, noting that \"at the command level, we must strengthen ourselves and protect our people\". Ukraine's air force earlier named the killed pilot as Col Oleksiy Mes. \"He fought heroically his last battle in the skies,\" it said, adding that he had shot down three cruise missiles and a drone on 26 August. Col Mes, whose call sign was Moonfish, was one of Ukraine's most experienced pilots. He had been trained abroad for F-16 missions. Lt Gen Anatolii Kryvonozhko was appointed interim commander of Ukraine's air force, the army's general staff said in a statement. He previously oversaw the central air command, leading operations in the centre of the country. He takes charge as officials have clashed over the loss of the F-16 jet, which has ignited fierce debate in Ukraine. Ukrainian politician Mariana Bezuhla, who sits on a parliamentary defence committee, claimed on Thursday that the jet was downed by Ukraine's Patriot air defence system. Mr Oleshchuk responded earlier on Friday that an investigation was under way and no-one was hiding anything. He accused Ms Bezuhla of discrediting military leadership and said the time would come for an apology. Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023. Mr Zelensky has dismissed several military commanders since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. In February this year, he sacked the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. And in June, he dismissed Lt Gen Yuriy Sodol after public criticism of excessive casualties and accusations of incompetence.

The court alleges Putin is responsible for war crimes, saying he failed to stop the deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Issued on: 30\/08\/2024 - 17:55 2 min By: NEWS WIRES Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, August 26, 2024. \u00a9 Alexander Kazakov, Reuters The Kremlin said Friday it was not worried that Mongolia could arrest President Vladimir Putin during his visit there next week, despite it being a member of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) which has issued a warrant for the Russian leader. Putin will travel to Mongolia on Tuesday, in a first trip to an ICC member since The Hague-based court issued a warrant for his arrest over the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children in March 2023. \u201cThere are no worries, we have a great dialogue with our friends from Mongolia,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Asked if Moscow had discussed the arrest warrant with Ulaanbaatar ahead of Putin\u2019s trip, he said: \u201cAll aspects of the visit were carefully prepared.\u201d Russia does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC. Ukraine on Friday urged Mongolia to arrest Putin when he visits the country. \u201cThe Ukrainian side hopes that the government of Mongolia is aware of the fact that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal,\u201d Kyiv\u2019s foreign ministry said.

Under the treaty, any of the 124 ICC member states would be expected to implement the warrant if Putin were to set foot on its territory. But the ICC has no police of its own and relies on the co-operation of its member states to carry out any arrest warrants. Read more ICC\u2019s bold move on Gaza warrants brings fresh scrutiny of Prosecutor Karim Khan Failure to do so will prompt the court to report the matter to the ICC\u2019s managing body called the Assembly of State Parties, which meets once a year. Limited success But such referrals in the past have had limited success, with the assembly\u2019s options confined mainly to verbal sanctions against errant states. Of the 49 arrest warrants issued since 2002, only 21 have resulted in detentions and court appearances. Some top leaders wanted by the ICC have thumbed their noses at the court and travelled to member countries with impunity. Former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir , who was toppled in 2019, has travelled to member states such as Jordan and South Africa without consequences even though he is the subject of two ICC arrest warrants. Moscow has also brushed off the warrant but Putin\u2014who had already vastly scaled down foreign visits since launching the Ukraine offensive in 2022 -- has not travelled to an ICC member state since the warrant was issued. Last year he called off a visit to a BRICS summit in South Africa, which is an ICC member, after internal and external pressure on Pretoria to arrest the Russian leader should he attend the conference. Putin is visiting Mongolia for the 85 th anniversary of a battle between Japanese and Soviet and Mongolian forces during Japan\u2019s occupation of nearby Manchuria.

The educational institution building was partially destroyed. Search and rescue operations at the site of the Russian missile attack on the city concluded on Sept. 5. The number of people killed at that time was 55, while other 328 were injured. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with NBC News that the missiles flew only three minutes before hitting the buildings, giving people little time to hide in the shelter.

And according to international law, this right does not stop at the border,\" Stoltenberg told the paper, adding that NATO had not been informed about Ukraine's plans beforehand and did not play a role in them.

The NATO chief said Ukraine was running a risk with the advance onto Russian territory but that it was up to Kyiv how to conduct its military campaign. \"(Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskiy has made clear that the operation aims to create a buffer zone to prevent further Russian attacks from across the border,\" he said. \"Like all military operations, this comes with risks. But it is Ukraine's decision how to defend itself.\" Kyiv launched a major cross-border incursion into the Kursk region on Aug. 6, while Moscow's troops keep pressing towards the strategic hub of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. The incursion was also discussed at a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine-Council on Wednesday that was requested by Kyiv amid Moscow's biggest wave of air attacks on its neighbour. The council, grouping members of the Western military alliance and Ukraine, was established last year to enable closer coordination between the alliance and Kyiv. Russia has called the Kursk operation a \"major provocation\" and said it would retaliate.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his political allies could move to fill the positions to create order before he travels this month to the United States, where he hopes to present a \"victory plan\" to U.S. President Joe Biden , a key ally. \"Autumn will be extremely important for Ukraine. And our state institutions should be configured so that Ukraine achieves all the results that we need - for all of us,\" Zelenskiy said in his evening address. \"For this, we must strengthen some areas of the government and changes in its make-up have been prepared. There will also be changes in the (president's) office.\" Zelenskiy has also dismissed Rostyslav Shurma, one of his deputy chiefs of staff whose portfolio is the economy, according to a decree published on the presidential website. David Arakhamia, a senior lawmaker for Zelenskiy's party, said there would be a \"major government reset\" that would see more than half of the ministers change. \"Tomorrow a day of sackings awaits us, and a day of appointments the day after,\" he said. Stefanishyna, whose portfolio has centred around Kyiv's bid to join the European Union and NATO military alliance, could be named as head of a bigger ministry that combines her old role and that of the justice ministry, the Suspilne public broadcaster cited a source in Zelenskiy's party as saying. Meanwhile, Kamyshin has spearheaded Ukraine's effort to ramp up defence production of everything from attack drones to long-range missiles to battle Russia, a much better-armed and larger foe. \"I will continue working in the defence sector but in a different role,\" Kamyshin, who is 40 and considered a rising star in government, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. He was appointed in March 2023 after carving out an image as an effective manager of the national railways, a vital logistics artery for both civilians and the military in the first year of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Since he took over defence production, Ukraine has produced thousands of long-range drones to attack Russia. Last month, Zelenskiy said Kyiv had for the first time used a new \"drone-missile\" and also test run a new ballistic missile. CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN WAR On the battlefield, Ukraine is pressing a risky cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region as Moscow's troops inch forward with increasing speed in the east of Ukraine. Russia has stepped up its long-range missile strikes. At least 50 people were killed and 271 wounded on Tuesday in the deadliest attack of the year when Russia hit a military institute in the central town of Poltava with two ballistic missiles. Lawmakers and political analysts have expected major changes in the government since the summer began. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has suggested the possibility of streamlining the government and folding several portfolios into one ministry. At least five portfolios have been vacant since ministers were fired or resigned earlier this year, including the important agriculture and infrastructure portfolios. Opposition lawmaker Iryna Herashchenko said: \"It's a government without ministers ... an intellectual and personnel crisis that the authorities are closing their eyes to\". She called for a government of national unity that would end the tight grip on the reins of power held by Zelenskiy's political team.

Brekelmans also clarified that the permission to strike Russia directly also applies to the F-16 fighters that the Netherlands will provide to Ukraine and called on other Western countries to lift restrictions on the use of weapons they supply to Ukraine. Despite the Dutch assertion there may still be an issue concerning the use of US made weapons or even weapons that contain components of US origin, such as Harpoon anti-ship missiles or Stinger, man-portable surface-to-air missile system (MANPADS). This could complicate things for Kyiv, if they have to seek additional authorization from Washington before they can engage targets deep inside Russia with weapons donated by the Netherlands.

In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly asked Western partners for permission to use the weapons they have provided to attack military facilities and airbases deep within Russia. These requests have increased since May, after Moscow launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region which saw intensified missile and guided bomb attacks on populated areas. Kyiv\u2019s requests took on more urgency after its forces began an offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region in early August.

For example, the White House allowed its missiles to be used only within a 100-kilometer zone near the Ukrainian-Russian border.

One does not commit evil by praying. If someone commits harm against their people, they will be guilty of that, but they cannot have done harm because they prayed,\" Pope Francis said following his Sunday Angelus blessing. \"Let those who wish to pray in what they consider their Church be allowed to do so.\" The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), which is legally subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church, has been suspected of links and sympathies to Russia throughout the full-scale war . It is not to be confused with the autocephalous (autonomous) Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which is fully separate from Moscow. A number of clergymen of the UOC-MP have been accused of collaborating with Russia and justifying Russian aggression, including bishops and other high-ranking members . Over 100 UOC-MP clergy members have come under criminal investigation since the outbreak of the full-scale war, the Security Service of Ukraine's (SBU) press service told the Kyiv Independent. Almost 50 of them have been charged, and sentences have been issued in 26 cases, the SBU said. The law enters into force 30 days after its publication, but UOC-MP communities will have nine months to fully break ties with the Russian church.

{"year":"2024","month":"09","event_desc":"9 September  Ukraine begins the implementation of \"dragon drones\" that spray molten thermite on forest cover to reveal and help destroy Russian military units and equipment.","text":"Ukraine is ramping up the use of little-known fire-spitting drones that could \u2018terrify\u2019 Russian units, analysts say. Ukraine is adding little-known incendiary weapons to its armoury in its battle to fend off the ongoing Russian invasion , including \u201cfire-spitting\u201d drones reminiscent of dragons. On Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s Defence Ministry posted videos on the social media platform X showing a Ukrainian drone raining down what appeared to be fire \u2013 but was molten metal \u2013 on forested positions presumed to be hiding Russian units. \u201cA \u2018dragon drone\u2019 in the direction of Kharkiv\u201d, the post from the ministry read, referring to Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, which has been the target of repeated Russian bombing. A \"dragon drone\" in the Kharkiv direction. \ud83d\udcf9: 42nd Mechanized Brigade pic.twitter.com\/4M1qAJdx3o \u2014 Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) September 4, 2024   Analysts say the weapon is a new and innovative introduction of an age-old weapon into the strategy of a Ukrainian military that has shown its growing proficiency in using small drones. Here\u2019s what to know about the new \u201cdragon drones\u201d: Dragon drones carry a substance called thermite. The mixture is made from metal powder \u2013 most often aluminium \u2013 and powdered iron oxide or rust. Thermite is not explosive, but generates heat at such extreme temperatures \u2013 more than 2,200 degrees Celsius (4,000 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2013\u00a0 that it burns through and damages nearly any material \u2013 clothing, trees and foliage, even military-grade vehicles. It can also burn underwater. Used on humans, the weapon could be fatal, or cause extensive burns and bone damage. It could also lead to respiratory issues and psychological trauma for survivors. Combining thermite with high-precision drones that can bypass traditional defences makes dragon drones \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d, according to the United Kingdom-based anti-war advocacy organisation Action on Armed Violence (AOAV). Dragon drones tend to be low-flying because thermite is more effective when it\u2019s in close contact with the target. Aside from delivering significant damage on their own, the weapons are also likely aiding Ukrainian units with reconnaissance missions. With foliage cover burned off, follow-up bombing campaigns are likely to be more precise, analysts say. Some of the drones are believed to be developed by Ukrainian startup Steel Hornets , a private unmanned weapons systems manufacturer. The company\u2019s thermite offerings include a light weapon it claims can burn through 4mm metal in under 10 seconds. The United States military also produces thermite grenades, but though Washington is a principal supplier of weapons to Ukraine, it is unclear if the US supplies thermite-grade weapons to Kyiv. Thermite\u2019s destructive effects are similar to those of other incendiary substances like white phosphorus and napalm, designed to cause damage through burn or respiratory injury. It\u2019s not illegal to use weapons like dragon drones on military targets in warfare. However, it\u2019s against international law to use incendiary weapons on civilians. It\u2019s also illegal to use them on military targets inside populated areas, or on forested areas \u2013 unless the green cover is believed to be hiding military objects. In general, the use of these substances is discouraged because the fires they produce are hard to contain, and they could affect civilians while also causing massive environmental damage, according to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs. Ukrainian units have so far used thermite on military targets, AOAV notes. Russian units also appear to have used the substance. It was possibly used in March 2023 on civilian targets in the eastern Ukraine town of Vuhledar, according to the AOAV. Thermite bombs are \u201cparticularly dangerous\u201d because their effects are hard to contain, even when targeting military positions, unlike conventional weapons, the AOAV said, warning that thermite\u2019s use should be discontinued. \u201cThe widespread use of thermite bombs increases the likelihood of these weapons being deployed in populated areas,\u201d AOAV director Iain Overton said in a statement. \u201cThe result could be catastrophic, with horrific injuries and loss of life among civilians.\u201d \ud83d\udd25Examples of the use of thermite projectiles  from the \u201cbirds of Madyar\u201d\u2620\ufe0f #UkraineWar #UkraineRussianWar #UkraineWarNews pic.twitter.com\/o2oGkniZqV \u2014 \u271d \u2694\ufe0f Hunter UA \u2720 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@UaCoins) February 10, 2024  Yes \u2013 this is not the first time countries at war are using the substance. German zeppelins dropped thermite-laden bombs during World War I. The air raids were regarded as an innovation at the time. They also often missed their targets and caused significant civilian casualties. During World War II, Germany as well as the Allies used thermite aerial bombs to destroy each other\u2019s military vehicles. The substance was discovered by German chemist Hans Goldschmidt in 1893 and patented in 1895. Its earliest commercial use was in the German town of Essen where construction workers used thermite to weld tram tracks. Fear of liquid fire falling from the sky at any moment is likely going to cause more psychological damage to the enemy than physical destruction, some experts say. Recently, a new development in drone warfare has been sighted - the so-called Dragon drones. Ukrainian drones are pouring thermite on Russian positions. This is something different from FPVs and bombers, and from a psychological viewpoint rather terrifying.  1\/\ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com\/MB48apP8JM \u2014 Emil Kastehelmi (@emilkastehelmi) September 6, 2024  \u201cThis is a new twist to the fear of drones,\u201d Finland-based military history expert Emil Kastehelmi posted on X, adding that its effects are \u201cterrifying\u201d. \u201cImagine: out of nowhere, fire starts raining down from the sky, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop it. You can\u2019t put it out with water. Your comrades are screaming, caught in flames, like human torches.\u201d However, Ukraine appears to have limited thermite capabilities at the moment, the analyst added, so it is unclear how much Kyiv can \u2014 or plans to \u2014 use them as a mainstream weapon. Some experts believe Russia could also ramp up its use of dragon drones if they prove effective for Ukraine.

Ukraine's army remains in the Kursk region more than a month after launching the assault, in which President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Kyiv has taken control of about 100 settlements. Russia's Defence Ministry said on Monday its forces had regained control of two more villages. Sign up here. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he had instructed his ministry to invite the UN and ICRC to work in the Kursk region on Sunday. The ministry confirmed that it had issued the requests. \"Ukraine is ready to facilitate their work and prove its adherence to international humanitarian law,\" Sybiha said on X after visiting the Sumy region, from where Ukrainian forces launched the cross-borer attack. He said the Ukrainian army was ensuring humanitarian assistance and safe passage to civilians in the Kursk region. The Foreign Ministry said the invitations had been sent to the ICRC and UN, \"taking into account the humanitarian situation and the need to properly ensure basic human rights in the territory of the Kursk region.\" It said it had asked the ICRC to monitor Ukraine's compliance with the principles of international humanitarian law. It was not immediately clear how or whether the UN or ICRC had responded. Russia's state-run TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying such statements were \"provocative\". He made clear Moscow, which began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, expected the UN and ICRC not to accept the invitations. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the Kremlin's reaction showed a disregard for the humanitarian needs of its own people and a fear of letting international observers see the situation in Kursk. Russia's state-run RIA news agency said ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric had arrived on a visit to Moscow and planned to meet Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Last week, Russian shelling killed three Ukrainians working for the ICRC and wounded two others in a village in the frontline Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Spoljaric has condemned the attacks.

If you don't support it, then help us stop Russia,\" Zelensky said . \"(Should we) just give up our land, forget that they are killing our people? What is the compromise in that? That's why I think it's destructive. It's just a political statement.\" Brazil and China pitched a six-point peace plan in May that called on both Russia and Ukraine to avoid \"escalation of hostilities\" and \"provocations.\" It came as a parallel plan to Ukraine's peace efforts based on Zelensky's 10-point peace formula, which included a global peace summit in Switzerland in June. China did not attend the summit despite the invitation, while the Brazilian representative who was present did not sign the resulting communique. The document was primarily backed by Ukraine's traditional Western partners, showing that Ukraine had little success in engaging the Global South. \"How can you offer 'here is our initiative' without asking anything from us?\" Zelensky asked, saying the plan lacked respect for Ukraine and its territorial integrity. The president added that he offered to discuss the proposals with Chinese and Brazilian leaders. \"Why did you suddenly decide that you should take Russia's side or be somewhere in the middle? In the middle of what?\" Zelensky said, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a murderer and saying that he himself must take steps toward ending the war. The six-point plan from Brazil and China calls for: Non-escalation or provocations by either side. An international peace conference accepted by both Russia and Ukraine, and which includes \"fair discussion\" of all peace plans. An increase of humanitarian assistance to \"prevent a humanitarian crisis on a larger scale,\" as well as an exchange of POWs, and no attacks on civilians. All possible efforts must be made to \"prevent nuclear proliferation and avoid nuclear crisis.\" Attacks on nuclear power plants and other peaceful nuclear facilities \"must be opposed.\" Enhanced international cooperation on several issues in order to \"protect the stability of global industrial and supply chains.\" Moscow has previously said it would accept Brazil and China as intermediaries for possible peace talks. The two countries refused to publicly take sides in the war, with China quietly serving as Russia's key economic lifeline and a source of dual-use goods . There have been no direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since early 2022. Moscow named Ukraine giving up on occupied territory and ceding additional ground as conditions for talks. In turn, Kyiv's 10-point peace formula includes a complete Russian withdrawal from the country.

Ukrainian officials distanced themselves from Routh on Monday, saying they had no links with him and warning that Russia would use his support for Ukraine as propaganda. Sign up here. CNN, Fox News and the New York Times identified Routh , 58, of Hawaii, as the suspect in Sunday's incident, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment and Reuters could not independently verify his identity. \"A lot of the other conflicts are grey but this conflict is definitely black and white. This is about good versus evil,\" Routh said in an interview posted by Newsweek Romania in June 2022. His comments suggested he was in Kyiv at the time. Reuters video footage showed him in Kyiv in May 2022 at protests calling for international support for Ukrainian fighters. A photograph taken in Kyiv at the time shows him holding a Ukrainian flag and wearing a scarf with the U.S. stars and stripes on it. Videos posted on X also showed Routh attending events that month backing Ukraine, including a protest held in support of the Azov brigade, which took part in the particularly fierce battle for the southern city of Mariupol. Some four months into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Routh perceived the war to be at a critical juncture and called for more international support. Routh told Newsweek Romania his initial goal in Ukraine was to fight but the plan did not work out because his age and lack of military experience meant he was not accepted. Instead, he turned to promoting the cause to others, he said. \"If the governments will not send their official military, then we, civilians, have to pick up the torch and make this thing happen and we have gotten some wonderful people here but it is a small fraction of the number that should be here,\" Routh said. Reuters could not independently verify his assertions. Hundreds of non-Ukrainians have fought against Russian forces in Ukraine and others have helped try to recruit them. PROPAGANDA WARNING Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the suspected assassination attempt, saying on X: \"I am glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe and unharmed.\" The Kremlin said Routh's reported association with Ukraine showed that \"playing with fire\" had consequences. Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation said Sunday's incident was already a \"topic for Russian propaganda\" and suggested Moscow would spread conspiracy theories attempting to show a \"Ukrainian trace\" to the apparent assassination attempt. \"Of course, all of this is a lie,\" Andriy Kovalenko, who leads the center, said. The Azov brigade's press service denied any connections with Routh, saying it had never communicated with him. The International Legion, where many of the foreign fighters serve, also said it had no links with Routh and that he had never been part of it. Routh told the Semafor news outlet in March 2023 that he had tried to recruit U.S.-trained Afghan fighters to fight for Ukraine against Russia but that Ukraine's defence ministry had not agreed to issue visas to them. An official source in Kyiv said authorities were looking into his role, if any, in Ukraine. The defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Semafor article identified Routh as the head of the International Volunteer Center, which it said helped foreigners wanting to support Ukraine through military and humanitarian means. Reuters contacted an aid group with the same name. Its founder said the NGO had no connection with Routh.

An official source in Kyiv said authorities were looking into his role, if any, in Ukraine. The defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Semafor article identified Routh as the head of the International Volunteer Center, which it said helped foreigners wanting to support Ukraine through military and humanitarian means. Reuters contacted an aid group with the same name. Its founder said the NGO had no connection with Routh.

Ukrainian officials distanced themselves from Routh on Monday, saying they had no links with him and warning that Russia would use his support for Ukraine as propaganda. Sign up here. CNN, Fox News and the New York Times identified Routh , 58, of Hawaii, as the suspect in Sunday's incident, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. The FBI declined to comment and Reuters could not independently verify his identity. \"A lot of the other conflicts are grey but this conflict is definitely black and white. This is about good versus evil,\" Routh said in an interview posted by Newsweek Romania in June 2022. His comments suggested he was in Kyiv at the time. Reuters video footage showed him in Kyiv in May 2022 at protests calling for international support for Ukrainian fighters. A photograph taken in Kyiv at the time shows him holding a Ukrainian flag and wearing a scarf with the U.S. stars and stripes on it. Videos posted on X also showed Routh attending events that month backing Ukraine, including a protest held in support of the Azov brigade, which took part in the particularly fierce battle for the southern city of Mariupol. Some four months into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Routh perceived the war to be at a critical juncture and called for more international support. Routh told Newsweek Romania his initial goal in Ukraine was to fight but the plan did not work out because his age and lack of military experience meant he was not accepted. Instead, he turned to promoting the cause to others, he said. \"If the governments will not send their official military, then we, civilians, have to pick up the torch and make this thing happen and we have gotten some wonderful people here but it is a small fraction of the number that should be here,\" Routh said. Reuters could not independently verify his assertions. Hundreds of non-Ukrainians have fought against Russian forces in Ukraine and others have helped try to recruit them. PROPAGANDA WARNING Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the suspected assassination attempt, saying on X: \"I am glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe and unharmed.\" The Kremlin said Routh's reported association with Ukraine showed that \"playing with fire\" had consequences. Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation said Sunday's incident was already a \"topic for Russian propaganda\" and suggested Moscow would spread conspiracy theories attempting to show a \"Ukrainian trace\" to the apparent assassination attempt. \"Of course, all of this is a lie,\" Andriy Kovalenko, who leads the center, said. The Azov brigade's press service denied any connections with Routh, saying it had never communicated with him. The International Legion, where many of the foreign fighters serve, also said it had no links with Routh and that he had never been part of it. Routh told the Semafor news outlet in March 2023 that he had tried to recruit U.S.-trained Afghan fighters to fight for Ukraine against Russia but that Ukraine's defence ministry had not agreed to issue visas to them. An official source in Kyiv said authorities were looking into his role, if any, in Ukraine. The defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Semafor article identified Routh as the head of the International Volunteer Center, which it said helped foreigners wanting to support Ukraine through military and humanitarian means.

Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election , made the announcement on Thursday, just hours after Democratic President Joe Biden announced more than $8 billion in new military aid for the U.S. ally. Sign up here. Zelenskiy has long sought a meeting with Trump. The two men spoke by phone in July but have not met in person since Trump's term as president ended in 2021. During a press conference on Thursday, Trump repeated his claims that he could rapidly negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine if he defeats Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris , the Democratic candidate in the race for the White House. \"President Zelenskiy has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower\" in New York, Trump said. Asked by a reporter if Ukraine might have to give up any of its territory to reach a peace deal with Moscow - a non-starter for Kyiv - Trump did not rule it out. \"We'll see what happens,\" he said. Shortly before Trump's comments, Harris pledged support for Ukraine and - in a veiled reference to Trump - said those who would have Ukraine swap land for peace with Russia were supporting \"proposals of surrender.\" Harris was speaking alongside Zelenskiy at the White House, a day after Trump assailed him for not making a deal with Russia that Trump said could have ended the war and shortly after the White House announcement of the new aid package. It was Harris' seventh meeting with Zelenskiy and the third this year.

REUTERS\/Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab ZELENSKIY SOUGHT MEETING WITH TRUMP Earlier in the week, Trump looked poised to reject Zelenskiy's meeting request. The Ukrainian leader had said before departing for New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly that he hoped to present his \"victory plan\" to win the war with Russia to Harris, Trump and Biden. But he upset Trump's campaign after visiting a munitions factory over the weekend in the battleground state of Pennsylvania with that state's governor, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and a Harris ally. Trump has stood by his criticisms of Zelenskiy on the campaign trail. He said on Monday that Zelenskiy wanted Harris to win the election, and on Wednesday he called the Eastern European nation \"dead\" and \"demolished.\" The U.S aid announced by Biden includes the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb called the Joint Standoff Weapon, with a range of up to 81 miles (130 km). The medium-range missile gives Ukraine a major upgrade to the weapons it is using to strike Russian forces, allowing the Ukrainians to do it at safer distances. The bulk of the new aid, $5.5 billion, is to be allocated before Monday's end of the U.S. fiscal year, when the funding authority is set to expire. Another $2.4 billion is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from U.S. stocks. Biden also said he would order the Pentagon to expand training of Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year. Zelenskiy thanked Biden and the U.S. Congress for the new military aid package, saying Ukraine would use it \"in the most efficient and transparent manner\". \"I am grateful to the United States for providing the items that are most critical to protecting our people,\" Zelenskiy said on X, mentioning a Patriot battery, drones and long-range missiles.

Some Republicans, particularly those closest to former President Donald Trump , have been fuming over Zelenskiy's visit on Sunday to an ammunition plant in President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is one of the swing states seen as crucial to victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election . Sign up here. During the trip, Zelenskiy appeared with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - who has campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris - Senator Bob Casey and U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright. All are Democrats. \"The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because \u2013 on purpose \u2013 no Republicans were invited,\" wrote Johnson, who is not expected to meet with Zelenskiy when the Ukrainian leader comes to Congress. \"The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,\" he said. The Ukrainian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. TRUMP BLASTS ZELENSKIY Trump has repeatedly criticized the Ukrainian president on the campaign trail this week. \"Those cities are gone, they\u2019re gone, and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refused to make a deal, Zelenskiy. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn\u2019t have been better than the situation you have right now,\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"You have a country that has been obliterated, not possible to be rebuilt.\" The former president also blamed Biden and Harris for Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already announced that it would investigate whether Zelenskiy's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris' campaign. It is common practice for governors to meet with foreign leaders who travel to their states. In July, Zelenskiy visited a factory in Utah and was hosted by that state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox. Additionally, a series of foreign leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have traveled to Florida, in recent months to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home. Trump won Florida by only 3 percentage points in the 2020 election, and recent polls have shown a close race there between Harris and Trump. On Thursday, Zelenskiy is expected to thank congressional leaders for approving billions of dollars in funding for his country as it grapples with a 2-1\/2-year-long Russian invasion, and to make the case for more. After becoming speaker last year, Johnson, who had voted repeatedly against aid for Kyiv, waited until April before allowing the House to vote on Biden's October request for financial assistance for Ukraine. However, he said on Wednesday his letter to Zelenskiy was not a threat to stop funding. \"I'm not making any threats,\" he told reporters.

REUTERS\/Valentyn Ogirenko Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab KYIV, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European governments should halt welfare benefits to Ukrainian men of military age who are living in their countries, Poland's foreign minister said, a measure he said would help Ukraine call up more troops to fight Russian forces. Following a meeting in Kyiv with his Ukrainian counterpart, Poland's Radoslaw Sikorski said ending social benefits for Ukrainian male refugees would also benefit state finances in host countries in Western Europe. Sign up here. More than 4.1 million Ukrainians had temporary protection status in European Union countries as of July this year, and about 22% of them were adult men, according to data from the EU statistics office, Eurostat. \"Stop paying those social security payments for people who are eligible for the Ukrainian draft. There should be no financial incentives for avoiding the draft in Ukraine,\" Sikorski said at a conference of international leaders in Kyiv. \"It's not a human right to be paid to avoid the draft, to defend your country. We in Poland don't do it.\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha welcomed Sikorski's call. \"It's time really to raise the question of the European Union developing programmes to return Ukrainians home. Certainly, appropriate conditions should be created for this. But this should be on the agenda. And I support the idea of Minister Sikorski,\" Sybiha said. Nearly 31 months into the war against Russia and with Moscow's forces slowly but steadily advancing in eastern Ukraine , Kyiv needs more soldiers to maintain its defence lines, rotate out exhausted troops and make up for losses. Russia has a significant advantage in staff numbers and weapons on the battlefield. Earlier this year, Ukraine adopted new legislation and implemented other measures, including lowering the call-up age for combat duty to 25 from 27 to increase the pace of mobilisation into the army. Under the new law, Kyiv ordered Ukrainian men living abroad to renew their military draft information online and encouraged them to return to Ukraine and join the fight. Ukraine imposed martial law at the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022, banning men aged 18 to 60 from travelling abroad without special permission and beginning a rolling mobilisation of civilian men into the armed forces. But many men of military age have still fled abroad to avoid the draft amid reports of corruption in the army recruitment system, allowing some men to bribe their way out of army service.

Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia's Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31. The Russian border region has seen heavy battles since Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive in early August. Moscow has deployed North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast to reinforce the defenses there while its most experienced units continue advancing in Ukraine's east . President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target \"every camp\" in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. Recently, Kyiv has been issuing warnings that the deployment of North Korean troops in combat is only a matter of days. Ukraine believes that Russia is preparing to send 12,000 North Korean soldiers to join its war, including special forces. According to Zelensky , Russia has confirmed to the West the involvement of Pyongyang's forces in the war.

{"year":"2024","month":"10","event_desc":"13 October  President Zelenskyy accuses North Korea of sending soldiers to participate in the Russian invasion.","text":"Ukraine\u2019s president says his country and its allies need to evolve their response in light of Russia\u2019s deepening alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused North Korea of sending not only weapons but also soldiers to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. \u201cWe see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his video address on Sunday night. \u201cThis is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.\u201d He said Ukraine and its allies needed to evolve their response in light of Russia\u2019s deepening alliances and reiterated his call for increased military support to prevent a bigger war. \u201cThe front line needs more support,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we talk about giving Ukraine greater long-range capabilities and more decisive supplies for our forces, it\u2019s not just a list of military equipment. It\u2019s about increasing the pressure on the aggressor \u2013 pressure that will be stronger than what Russia can handle. And it\u2019s about preventing an even larger war.\u201d Zelenskyy\u2019s pleas to Ukraine\u2019s allies to allow it to use longer-range missiles to attack military targets deep inside Russia and reduce its capacity for war have so far failed. He said he would continue to try and secure that approval. \u201cTrue peace can only be achieved through strength and the entire next week will be dedicated to working with our partners for the sake of such strength, for the sake of true peace,\u201d he said. Western leaders were due to meet on the issue in Germany last week, but United States President Joe Biden delayed his trip as Hurricane Milton bore down on Florida. He is now expected to travel to Germany this week with the war in Ukraine high on the agenda. South Korea\u2019s Minister of National Defense Kim Yong-hyun said last week that there was a \u201chigh possibility\u201d of North Korea sending soldiers to help Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine. He also said that it was \u201c highly likely \u201d that reports that North Korean officers had been killed in a Ukrainian attack on Russian-occupied territory were true. Russia dismissed the comments as \u201cfake news\u201d. Relations between North Korea and Russia have deepened since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un made a rare visit outside his country in September 2023, travelling by train to eastern Russia where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin and visited military bases and arms factories. Putin, meanwhile, travelled to Pyongyang in June on his first visit to the country in 24 years with Kim promising his \u201c full support and solidarity \u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.

The phrase originated on Feb. 24, 2022, when a Ukrainian border guard used it during Russia\u2019s capture of Snake Island.

{"year":"2024","month":"10","event_desc":"22 October  Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin resigns after a number of scandals involving medical exemptions for men of military age to avoid being conscripted into the Ukrainian military.","text":"Andriy Kostin steps down after corruption scheme involving false disability diagnoses for draft exemptions is uncovered. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin has announced his resignation amid a scandal involving dozens of officials alleged to have abused their position to receive disability status and avoid military service. In early October, it emerged that dozens of public prosecutors in the western region of Khmelnytskyi had falsely been awarded disability permits and were receiving special pensions. Kostin said on Tuesday he was taking responsibility for the scandal and announced his resignation. He called the situation around the false disability diagnoses \u201cclearly amoral\u201d. \u201cIn this situation, I believe it is right to announce my resignation from the position of prosecutor general,\u201d Kostin said. The announcement followed a meeting of the National Security and Defence Council. After the meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree to dismantle the current system of medical and social commissions responsible for registering individuals as disabled by the end of the year, eliminating a loophole that allowed draft evasion through bribery.    After the scandal erupted earlier this month, Kostin ordered an investigation, which he said had discovered the number of prosecutors in the Khmelnytskyi region with disabilities was 61, and that 50 of them had been registered disabled before the war. \u201cIt is very important to establish why they were granted disability status, because the share of such employees in Khmelnytskyi region is very high,\u201d he said. The chief prosecutor\u2019s resignation still needs to be approved by parliament, where Zelenskyy\u2019s party holds a majority. Following the president\u2019s public call for accountability, it is widely expected that parliament will endorse it. In his evening address, Zelenskyy told the nation that such corruption extended much wider than just to prosecutors. \u201cThere are hundreds of such cases of obviously unjustified disabilities among customs, tax, pension fund and local administration officials,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this needs to be dealt with thoroughly and promptly,\u201d he said. The whole process must be digitalised, he added, saying that currently \u201cpeople who have received a real disability, particularly in combat, often cannot get the appropriate status and fair payments\u201d. The Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) had earlier issued a statement saying 64 officials within the Medical and Social Expert Commissions had been notified they were being investigated for illegally issuing disability certificates. \u201cAnother nine people have already been convicted,\u201d the SBU said in their statement, adding that 4,106 disability certificates \u201cwere cancelled\u201d. Mobilisation in Ukraine is a hotly contested and controversial issue that has polarised society after a large-scale military recruitment drive earlier this year to bolster Ukraine\u2019s struggling forces as they fight against Russia\u2019s invasion . Since the president signed a renewed mobilisation law in April 2024, men between the ages of 25 and 60 are now eligible. Previously, the range was 27 to 60. Soldiers have reported difficult conditions including relentless days of heavy fire without relief due to a lack of reinforcements. Front-line troops have shared with the media that they have been moving from one battle to the next with minimal rest. Prosecutions for desertion from Ukraine\u2019s army are thought to have hit at least 30,000 already this year. This is several times the number in 2022, the year the war began when citizens and foreigners voluntarily poured into the military.

The number of new cases of coronavirus infection in Ukraine has significantly decreased from 6,000 to 9,000 cases a day at the beginning of January to 2,516 new cases on January 25, the fewest since early September. \"Such statistics, which indicate the stabilisation of the situation, the improvement of the situation could be obtained only thanks to you, Ukrainians,\" health minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing. \"We believe that this (lockdown) has significantly improved the situation now and in the future,\" he said. He said Ukraine, which has registered around 1.2 million cases of coronavirus with 21,924 deaths, would retain some restrictions, mainly related to the work of the service sector, restaurants and transport. Stepanov said the ministry would analyse the results of the lockdown this week and would then like to return to a system of local restrictions responding to conditions in a particular city or region. Ukrainian officials earlier this month said the health ministry expected it would not have to introduce any further strict measures in the future.

(file photo) Share Ukraine Takes First Delivery of AstraZeneca Vaccine For COVID-19 share Print The first batch of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine has arrived in Ukraine. Some 500 doses of the vaccine , produced by the Serum Institute of India, arrived at Boryspil airport in Kyiv on February 23, a day after it was officially registered for use in the country. \"We are urgently unloading the cargo and the vaccine will go to the regions right away so that we can start vaccinating according to the first stage of our vaccination plan,\" Health Minister Maksym Stepanov said on his Facebook page . The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, has been approved by the World Health Organization. It has also been approved for use in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and India. Earlier in February, Ukraine's government banned the registration of vaccines for COVID-19 from Russia even though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been criticized for his government's sputtering vaccination plan. Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine would begin the first phase of the vaccination campaign in February, adding that by early 2022 at least half of the country's 41 million population will be vaccinated. Kyiv-Moscow relations have been tense since Russia forcibly seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and threw its support behind pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's east, where the ongoing conflict has claimed more than 13,200 lives. Ukraine has also agreed to get COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Novav\u0430\u0445, and China's Sinovac Biotech. As of February 23, the number of registered coronavirus cases in Ukraine was 1,311,844, including 25,309 deaths.

No vaccine has yet been approved in Ukraine but authorities have repeatedly said Kyiv will not approve or use vaccines from Russia, with which Ukraine's ties are strained. \"One political force just created some hysteria over the registration of the Russian vaccine,\" Ukraine's Health Minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing. \"I can say at once: You can be hysterical for a very long time, no one will register the Russian vaccine in the country.\" Biolik, a Ukrainian pharmaceutical company backed by Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent Russia-leaning opposition figure, said earlier this month it had applied for state approval to make Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, a sensitive move given the poor relations between Kyiv and Moscow.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, on Tuesday, and urged for Ukraine to be put on a pathway to future membership to halt the long-running conflict in the eastern Donbas region. A statement released by the Ukraine presidency following the call said that \u201cthe most urgent issue\u201d in relation to Nato was \u201cthe possibility of obtaining the Nato membership action plan\u201d, seen as a pathway to future membership. EU and UK pledge backing to Ukraine after Russian military buildup Read more The Ukrainian president has been engaged in a frantic round of diplomatic activity in the past few days as Russia has markedly increased the number of troops deployed to the north and east of Ukraine and in occupied Crimea. Russia\u2019s purpose in the military buildup is unclear, but many western analysts are concerned about the scale of the posturing at a time of increased tensions between Moscow and Washington, after Joe Biden told reporters he thought his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was \u201ca killer\u201d . Similar requests for a pathway to Nato membership were made by Zelenskiy in calls with Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, on Monday and again on Tuesday with Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s PM. Following the call with the UK, Ukraine called on the country, along with allies, to \u201cstrengthen its presence\u201d in the region. \u201cNato is the only way to end the war in Donbas. Ukraine\u2019s MAP [membership action plan] will be a real signal for Russia,\u201d Zelenskiy told Stoltenberg, according to Kyiv\u2019s readout of their conversation. Stoltenberg tweeted that he had spoken to Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201cto express serious concern about Russia\u2019s military activities in and around Ukraine\u201d and said the alliance \u201cfirmly supports Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. Nato sources said alliance members discussed the Russian buildup last Thursday and continued to monitor the situation closely. But officials also said that Ukraine would have to \u201cfocus on domestic reforms\u201d and \u201cdevelop its defence capabilities in accordance with Nato standards\u201d in order to be considered for membership. Russia has not denied the troop movements but insisted it was \u201cnot threatening anyone\u201d. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters on Tuesday that Nato membership for Ukraine would do no good in resolving the conflict. \u201cWe very much doubt that this will help Ukraine settle its domestic problem,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cFrom our point of view, it will only worsen the situation. If you ask the opinion of several million people living in the self-declared republics [in the east of the country] you will see that for them Nato membership is deeply unacceptable.\u201d Renewed clashes have been taking place in the east of Ukraine, in a simmering conflict that dates back to 2014. Kyiv said two soldiers were killed on Monday and Tuesday on the frontline, battling separatists who are widely believed to have Russian backing, something which Moscow denies. Dr Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: \u201cWe are seeing more and more commentators and analysts saying this is more serious than just a show of strength.

{"year":"2021","month":"04","event_desc":"Russia warns that having the country join NATO \"would exacerbate the Donbas conflict\" after Ukraine urged NATO to \"speed up\" its membership application.","text":"news \u2018We deeply doubt it will help\u2019 Kremlin warns that Ukraine joining NATO would exacerbate Donbas conflict 4:54 pm, April 7, 2021 Source: Meduza Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during a joint press conference in Brussels on June 4, 2019 John Thys \/ AFP \/ Scanpix \/ LETA Following Ukraine reiterating its desire to take the next step toward joining NATO this week, the Kremlin has warned that this would only exacerbate the conflict in Donbas. Nevertheless, on Wednesday, April 7, Lithuania announced that it will call on its NATO allies to support a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine. This comes amid a growing escalation of the conflict in Donbas, and rising concerns as Russia amasses troops near Ukraine\u2019s border. Though Ukraine doesn\u2019t meet NATO\u2019s membership standards as of yet, the United States has expressed its support for Kyiv\u2019s ongoing efforts to carry out the necessary reforms. Against the backdrop of escalating tensions in Donbas, Ukraine has reiterated its desire to join NATO. On April 5 and 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg , as well as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . Zelensky asked Johnson and Trudeau to increase international pressure on Russia and support a NATO Membership Action Plan ( MAP ) for Ukraine. In conversation with Stoltenberg, Zelensky said that \u201cNATO is the only way to end the war in Donbas. Ukraine's MAP will be a real signal for Russia.\u201d On April 7, Lithuania announced that it will invite NATO allies to offer Ukraine a MAP. The Kremlin has warned that Ukraine\u2019s admission to NATO would exacerbate the crisis in Donbas. \u201cWe deeply doubt that it will somehow help Ukraine to deal with its internal problem. From our point of view, it will only exacerbate the situation further because people\u2019s opinions cannot be overlooked in any way when you talk about joining NATO. And if you ask opinions of several million people in the self-proclaimed republics, you will understand that such a membership in NATO is deeply unacceptable for these people,\u201d said Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov. In turn, the U.S. said that it welcomes new NATO members, but they must meet the standards of the alliance. \u201cWe continue to urge the Government of Ukraine to implement the deep, comprehensive, and timely reforms necessary,\u201d said the State Department\u2019s spokesman Ned Price. Asked if the U.S. plans to accelerate the process of Ukraine\u2019s NATO accession against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s military build-up along the border with Ukraine, Price simply reiterated Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine\u2019s ongoing reforms. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that while the U.S. supports Kyiv\u2019s NATO aspirations, the decision on Ukraine joining the alliance is for NATO to make. As of yet, Ukraine doesn\u2019t meet the necessary standards for joining NATO. According to experts , this is due in particular to Ukraine\u2019s high-levels of corruption and lack of transparency in the defense sector, on top of its unresolved territorial disputes. According to the alliance\u2019s \u201cStudy on NATO Enlargement\u201d (which guides its decisions on accepting new member states), countries seeking to join NATO have to settle such disputes by peaceful means. The document also says that \u201cthere is no fixed or rigid list of criteria\u201d for inviting new members to join NATO, and that these decisions are made on an individual basis. Ukraine first announced its goal of eventual NATO membership under President Leonid Kuchma in 2002. However, during Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s presidency in 2010, the country adopted non-aligned status, which meant not participating in any military-political alliances. Following Yanukovych\u2019s ouster in 2014, and Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, Ukraine resumed its course towards joining NATO. In 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted in favor of having Ukraine\u2019s \u201cirreversible course toward European and Euro-Atlantic integration\u201d stipulated in the country\u2019s constitution. The Ukrainian authorities now expect to join NATO by 2030. A growing escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine began in late March. Analysts from the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) called the recent concentration of Russian troops near the Russian-Ukrainian border the largest one seen since the war\u2019s \u201chot phase\u201d in 2014\u20132015. Kyiv also confirmed the build-up of Russian troops near its borders, saying that Moscow is \u201cflexing its muscles.\u201d The United States has asked Russia to explain the \u201cprovocations\u201d on Ukraine\u2019s border. Meanwhile, American President Joe Biden had a phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking the first time the two have spoken since Biden took office. The Kremlin insists that Russia is moving troops within its own territory, and that \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t cause concern to anyone\u201d and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t pose a threat.\u201d Read more about the escalation in Donbas \u2018The Kremlin\u2019s calculations have changed\u2019 Russia is building up troops near the border with Ukraine.

{"year":"2021","month":"04","event_desc":"16 April  The country receives 117,000 doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine through the COVAX vaccine-sharing initiative.","text":"Press release First COVID-19 vaccines shipped by COVAX arrive in Ukraine 16 April 2021 UNICEF \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 English Today, Ukraine received the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine shipped via the COVAX Facility, an unprecedented initiative of global solidarity of different countries for global access to COVID-19 vaccines. This is the first delivery in the framework of COVAX to Ukraine. \u00a0Ukraine receives 117,000 doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine free of charge. Supplies of vaccines of different manufacturers within COVAX will continue and are expected to cover up to 20% of the population in Ukraine by the end of 2021. UNICEF, on behalf of the COVAX Facility, procures and supplies COVID-19 vaccines that meet WHO\u2019s established safety and efficacy criteria. \u201cToday, an important step was made to protect those who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill and even dying from COVID-19. More vaccines will be delivered to Ukraine as part of the COVAX Facility and UNICEF continues to support the Government of Ukraine to protect people from detrimental effects of COVID-19 on lives and economy. We hope for a quick and effective vaccination, otherwise people will continue losing loved ones and the medical system will remain overwhelmed. It is very important that vaccination is organized safely: with physical distancing, not in tight spaces, so that people waiting for the procedure do not contract COVID-19,\u201d said Lotta Sylwander, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. Maksym Stepanov, Minister of Health of Ukraine, highlighted:\u00a0 \"Ukraine has set ambitious goals to cover the majority of the adult population with COVID-19 vaccination by the end of the year. This is a huge challenge and to achieve this we are looking forward to the parallel launch of different platforms, the use of different vaccines and all possible supply routes. We are pleased to receive the first batch of vaccines under the global COVAX initiative and support from international partners.\u00a0 It is important for Ukraine that under fierce competition and\u00a0 struggle for access to vaccines in the world, COVAX confirms the fulfilment of the tasks for which this global partnership was created - to provide fair opportunities for all.\" 117,000 doses of Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine will primarily be used for vaccination of staff and residents of nursing homes. Then - employees of the State Emergency Service and border guards. \u201cUkraine's accession to the COVAX mechanism has become possible thanks to the joint efforts of all supporters of COVAX, such as governments, international organizations and private companies. COVID vaccination is\u00a0 an additional measure we have now to curb the pandemics and is a priority in Ukraine and in the world, and WHO is working on ensuring the availability and accessibility of vaccines, as well as on providing a safe and effective vaccination process in Ukraine. Furthermore, in Ukraine, partners as of WHO, UNICEF, European Union, USAID, UK and the World Bank have prioritized COVID vaccination and allocated resources to support the efforts now. Ensuring equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine, especially to protect the most vulnerable, will allow mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the health of the population and the economy\", said Dr Jarno Habicht, the WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine. A few days earlier, UNICEF also delivered to Ukraine some 140,000 syringes for mixing up the vaccine with diluent and injections and over 1,300 safety boxes for their disposal, under COVAX. UNICEF, WHO and partners have been supporting the Government of Ukraine in COVID-19 response and vaccination roll-out. This includes assisting with the development of the national vaccination plan, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as training of health workers in how to store and handle the vaccines, provide quality immunization services, effective counselling and communication about vaccines and working with communities in addressing misinformation. It is important that the country continues to apply tried-and-tested measures to successfully prevent and control transmission, such as physical distancing, masks, ventilation and hand hygiene, alongside robust programmes to test, trace, isolate and treat. It is also important to continue to expand access to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19, including access to oxygen support. COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the\u00a0Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Vaccine Alliance Gavi, and the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013\u00a0working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, governments of\u00a0US, UK, European Union, Canada, Germany, World Bank, and others. The airplane with vaccines has landed in Kyiv Sikorsky International Airport.\u00a0 \u201cOur \u00a0airport is a reliable partner, always open for cooperation.

{"year":"2021","month":"04","event_desc":"21 April  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invites his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to a face-to-face meeting on the front line in the war-torn Donbas to negotiate an end to the conflict.","text":"World Mid-East Europe Americas Asia Pacific Africa Syrian Crisis Islamophobia Ukraine's Zelenskiy invites Putin to meet on front line by French Press Agency - AFP KYIV Apr 21, 2021 - 12:17 pm GMT+3 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visits positions of armed forces near the front line with Russian-backed separatists in Donbass region, Ukraine, April 9, 2021. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Service via Reuters) by French Press Agency - AFP Apr 21, 2021 12:17 pm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy invited Russian leader Vladimir Putin to meet in war-torn eastern Ukraine where Moscow has been moving troops in the tens of thousands in recent weeks to assist separatists . The blunt offer for talks came following a flare-up in clashes between Ukraine's army and pro-Russian separatists controlling two regions in the country's east, raising concerns of a major escalation in the simmering war . In an address to the nation, Zelenskiy said that Ukrainian and Russian negotiators had recently discussed plans for officials to travel to the front lines of the trench conflict to assess the situation. \"I am ready to go even further and invite you to meet in any part of the Ukrainian Donbass where war is ongoing,\" Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president, elected in 2019 on promises to bring an end to the conflict, accused Russia of participating in peace negotiations while gathering troops on Ukraine's border. \"A considerable number of Russian troops are concentrated near our border,\" he said. \"Officially, Russia calls this military exercises. Unofficially, the whole world calls this blackmail.\" \"The Russian president once said that if a fight is inevitable, you need to hit first. But every leader needs to understand that a fight must not be inevitable when it... concerns a real war and millions of human lives,\" Zelenskiy said. Ukraine, the European Union and the United States have recently sounded the alarm over renewed tensions and accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of military personnel on the northern and eastern borders of the ex-Soviet country. The EU on Monday estimated the number of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border to be more than 100,000 during talks with Ukraine's foreign minister, who encouraged Western countries to hit Russia with a deeper package of economic sanctions over the conflict. Fears of major escalation Kyiv has been battling pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions since 2014, following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula \u2013 a move that plunged Russia's ties with the West to new lows and led to economic penalties. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, has seen 30 Ukrainian soldiers killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 in all of 2020. The escalation along the front line as well as sharp rhetoric has spurred fresh rounds of talks. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met earlier this week and also on Tuesday, although they have so far failed to secure any breakthroughs. Zelenskiy said in his address to the nation that although Ukraine did not want war, it was prepared to fight. \"Will Ukraine defend itself if something happens? Always. Our principle is simple: Ukraine does not start a war first, but Ukraine always stands to the last,\" he said. On the front line, however, fears were growing of a major escalation, with soldiers set to repel attacks and streets in towns near the front line empty over fears of a return to war. Yuliya Yevchenko, 27, who lives in a partially destroyed residential building in Krasnogorivka under government control said the sounds of loud shelling could be heard recently in the town just kilometers from the front line. \"We had a truce, and now it is war again,\" the mother of four said, holding her one-year-old son in her arms. \"I don't know what to do. We have nowhere to go at the moment.\" Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, Zelenskiy has requested help from the West. But some of Ukraine's battle-weary soldiers did not appear optimistic. \"The world says it wants to help Ukraine,\" Taras, a 24-year-old soldier, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in the front line village of Mariinka west of the separatist stronghold Donetsk. \"But for now, we are fighting against Russia on our own.\" shortlink copied Last Update: Apr 21, 2021 1:43 pm KEYWORDS ukraine-russia relations volodymyr zelenskiy vladimir putin eastern ukraine crimea The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what\u2019s happening in Turkey,\n                    it\u2019s region and the world.

{"year":"2021","month":"04","event_desc":"23 April  A United Nations aid convoy brings 23 tons of humanitarian aid to the region around Donetsk, passing the contact line into separatist-controlled territory at the Novotroitske crossing point.","text":"Facebook Twitter Print Email Twenty-three tonnes of\u00a0urgently needed\u00a0aid items have reached\u00a0the\u00a0eastern Ukrainian province around\u00a0Donetsk,\u00a0after a humanitarian convoy crossed the contact line into non-Government-controlled territory, the UN said on Friday. This is the second UN-organised convoy to pass through the\u00a0Novotroitske\u00a0crossing point,\u00a0since it reopened for the delivery of humanitarian cargo a little over a week ago. The crossing is currently the only one that is operational for humanitarian aid deliveries along the contact line. It had been closed for humanitarian cargo movement since 24 February owing to security concerns. \u201cThe opening is welcome as needs remain very high with nearly 1.7 million people in need of assistance in the non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk and\u202fLuhansk\u201d,\u00a0said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for UN\u00a0humanitarian office ( OCHA ). The first delivery was on 15 April, when five trucks crossed with 18 tons of COVID-19 supplies to the non-government-controlled area in Donetsk (NGCA). \" Since March last year , we have seen an almost complete closure of civilian crossings over the contact line due to COVID-19 restrictions\u201d,\u00a0Mr Laerke told journalists in Geneva. \u201cFor humanitarian deliveries, only this one crossing point was available, where we used to have four or five\u201d,\u202fhe added. The recent surge in hostilities along the \u201ccontact line\u201d after seven months of relative calm following the July 2020 ceasefire has also resulted in more hardship and security risks for people forced to cross the contact line to access essential services. Unconfirmed reports have indicated that people have resorted to taking the uncontrolled Ukrainian-Russian crossing point, which can be subject to administrative fines and legal challenges, in addition to incurring high travel costs. Access restrictions to non-Government-controlled areas have \u201ca direct impact on the capacity of the UN and\u00a0our humanitarian partners to help the affected people\u201d, said Mr Laerke. The current COVID-19 situation in the country means that needs are \u201cobviously not decreasing but rather increasing\u201d, he continued. \u201cIn March, Ukraine experienced the tripling of the number of COVID-19 cases nationwide compared with February, so the curve is going up and not down,\u201d\u202fexplained Mr Laerke. \u201cBut access is not the only challenge. Our 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan for Ukraine requires $168 million but remains severely underfunded at 13 per cent\u201d,\u00a0he added. Although a ceasefire in Eastern Ukraine has led to a significant decrease in civilian casualties, the overall situation remains fragile unless progress is made on the security and political fronts, the UN\u2019s political affairs chief told the Security Council on Thursday.

(Georgian Interior Ministry via AP, File) By YURAS KARMANAU Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine and NATO on Monday launched Black Sea drills that will involve dozens of warships, an exercise that follows last week\u2019s incident with a British destroyer off Crimea. Moscow said one of its warships fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of British destroyer Defender on Wednesday to force her out of an area near the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. Britain denied that account, insisted its ship wasn\u2019t fired upon and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters. The Sea Breeze 2021 maneuvers that began Monday and will last for two weeks are set to involve about 30 warships and 40 aircraft from U.S. and its NATO allies and Ukraine. U.S. destroyer Ross has arrived in the Ukrainian port of Odessa for the drills. U.S. Navy Capt. Kyle Gantt noted Monday that a large number of participants in the exercise reflects a shared commitment to ensuring free access to international waters. Moscow has criticized the drills, and the Russian Defense Ministry said it would closely monitor them. In Wednesday\u2019s incident, Britain insisted the Defender had been making a routine journey through an internationally recognized travel lane and remained in Ukrainian waters near Crimea. The U.K., like most of the world, recognizes Crimea as part of Ukraine despite the peninsula\u2019s annexation by Russia. Russia denounced the Defender\u2019s move as a provocation and warned that next time it could fire to hit intruding warships if they again try to test Russian military resolve.

Russia will on Friday begin returning troops to permanent bases inside the country, pulling them back from near the border with Ukraine, Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti news agency reported. Thursday\u2019s announcement comes after weeks of tensions between Moscow, Kyiv and the latter\u2019s Western allies over a major Russian military build-up near its western border with Ukraine and in annexed Crimea, which reportedly involved tens of thousands of troops. Russia has argued that the build-up was defensive, while Ukraine \u2013 backed by Germany and other Western powers \u2013 has accused Moscow of attempting to provoke hostilities. \u201cI believe the objectives of the snap inspection have been fully achieved. The troops have demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defence for the country,\u201d RIA quoted Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as saying. \u201cIn this regard, I have decided to complete the inspections in the southern and western military districts,\u201d he added. The deployments took place against the backdrop of renewed clashes in Ukraine\u2019s conflict-stricken eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatist forces since the rebels seized a swath of territory there in April 2014. It was not immediately clear whether the rebasing order covered all of the forces involved in the recent military build-up. The Russian military has not publicly declared the number of additional troops that it has moved, but the European Union\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell said after EU foreign ministers were briefed by Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister that the number was higher than 100,000. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the announcement.

Moscow has repeatedly rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the build-up, maintaining that it is free to deploy its forces anywhere on Russian territory. The Kremlin has also routinely denied playing any role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The US said it will \u201ccontinue to watch\u201d the situation \u201cvery closely\u201d after Russia\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard words. I think what we\u2019ll be looking for is action,\u201d State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday. Defence Minister Shoigu said the troops would return to their bases by May 1. His comments came after he oversaw exercises in Crimea, near Ukraine\u2019s southern border, on Thursday. The Russian Defence Ministry said the drills in the Black Sea region involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles. The exercise featured the landing of more than 2,000 paratroopers and 60 military vehicles on Thursday. Fighter jets covered the airborne operation. Shoigu flew in a helicopter over the Opuk firing range in Crimea to monitor proceedings. He later declared the drills over, but ordered the military to stand ready to respond to any \u201cunfavourable\u201d developments during NATO\u2019s Defender Europe 2021 exercise, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency reported.

In a July 9 statement, the Defense Ministry said the \u201centire Kremlin propaganda machine\u201d was involved in the hacking operation, which published false documents and fake news on the Navy\u2019s website related to the Sea Breeze drills. \"The threat has now been eliminated and the Navy's website will be restored in the near future,\" it said, adding that there have also been unsuccessful denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) on the Defense Ministry portal. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of being behind a string of cyberattacks, something Moscow denies.

The exercises include 5,000 troops, 32 ships, 40 aircraft, and 18 special operations and dive teams and will last through July 10. Russia opposes the drills and has said it is monitoring the actions of military forces taking part in the exercises. Late last month, Russia tested its air-defense systems in occupied Crimea. Moscow seized control of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after sending in troops and staging a referendum dismissed as illegal by at least 100 countries. Moscow is also backing separatists in a war in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 13,000 people since April 2014.

Published June 23, 2021 at 6:57 pm A medical worker prepares a dose of Chinese-developed Sinovac Biotech vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the vaccination center established in the International Exhibition center in Kyiv, on May 29, 2021. Photo by Volodymyr Petrov The most transmissible COVID-19 variant yet, Delta, was detected in Ukraine. A woman and a teenager who arrived from Russia tested positive and were hospitalized in Kyiv, according to the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksiy Danilov\u2019s comments for the TSN news TV program. Delta is around 60% more transmissible than the already highly infectious Alpha, also known as the \u201cBritish\u201d variant, first detected in the United Kingdom in December. It also may lead to higher rates of hospitalization. The Delta variant has already spread to at least 92 countries, and will soon become the dominant variant in the world, scientists warn. Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council convened on June 23 to discuss threats presented by the new variant. Ukraine might soon face a fourth wave of coronavirus infections but the Ukrainian government is worried that the medical laboratories are not well-equipped to detect the new Delta variant. \u201cWe have four laboratories that can detect the new variant, two private and two public laboratories, but we do not have the specific tests that detect the (Delta) variant,\u201d Danilov said, adding that Ukraine has requested help from the World Health Organization. Delta, which was first discovered in India, is difficult to detect with conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. PCR tests can only identify some variants, but not all. In other words, the test will detect a COVID-19 infection, but doctors won\u2019t be able to pinpoint which specific variant it is. There are other technologies that can detect Delta, like a new testing method that uses a robot and sequencing platform called SPAR-seq. However, it\u2019s unclear which technologies Danilov said Ukraine is missing. \u201cThe Foreign Ministry and Health Ministry should prepare proposals on the possibility of introducing additional controls and restrictions on travel between Ukraine and countries where the Delta strain is rapidly spreading,\u201d said the statement published by President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s office on June 23.","question":"When were the first two cases of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant detected in Ukraine?","answer":"The first two cases were detected on June 23, 2021.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0438\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0456 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0443 SARS-CoV-2 \u0414\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430?","answer_translated":"\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0456 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0438\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e 23 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u044f 2021 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443.","model_answer":"Answer: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0456 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0443 SARS-CoV-2 \u0414\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0438\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e 23 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u044f 2021 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer exactly in terms of the date and the information provided.

President Alexander Lukashenko says it is part of an attempt by outside powers to overthrow his authoritarian regime. Mr Lukashenko claimed - without providing proof - that his security services had uncovered a foreign-backed terrorist sleeper cells plotting to oust him from power. \"They have crossed the line. We cannot forgive them,\" he said. He alleged the weapons were being shipped to terrorist cells funded by Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and the US. \"A huge amount of weapons is coming from Ukraine to Belarus. That's why I ordered border-security forces to fully close the border with Ukraine,\" Mr Lukashenko said, at a ceremony marking the country's 30 years of independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union. He said he would confront Germany's Angela Merkel and other leaders about the claims. Ukraine denied interfering in Belarus's domestic affairs and said closing the 1,084-km (674-mile) border would make its people \"suffer\". Belarus shares a border with Ukraine in the south. It borders Poland and Lithuania in the west, Latvia in the north, and Russia in the east. Belarus plane: What we know and what we don't Could tougher European action hurt Belarus? The move deepens a standoff between Belarus and outside powers.

The remains of between 5,000 and 8,000 people were found in 29 graves in the southern city of Odessa. The site, believed to date back to the late 1930s, was uncovered during exploration works for a planned expansion of an airport. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are believed to have died during Joseph Stalin's rule of the Soviet Union. Sergiy Gutsalyuk, the head of the regional branch of Ukraine's National Memory Institute, told AFP that the victims were likely to have been killed by the Soviet secret police unit during the late 1930s. However, he said it would not be possible to identify the victims as any records were held in Russia. According to the Ukrinform website, around 8,600 people in Odessa were sentenced to death by the Soviet secret police between 1938 and 1941. Revealing the horror of Stalin Memories of Ukraine's silent massacre The National Memory Institute had initially said it was not possible to estimate the number of people executed at the site, but that it already appeared to be one of the largest mass graves ever found in Ukraine. One of the historians who worked on the discovery, Aleksander Babich, said on Facebook that there were likely to be even more bodies than had already been found, as excavations had not been completed in some parts of the site. He added that there could also be further graves on a nearby site belonging to a military unit. Ukrainian historians say that hundreds of thousands of people were killed during Joseph Stalin's violent repression of the 1930s, with other mass graves found in Odessa and elsewhere in Ukraine. AFP Bykivnia, another mass grave site, lies near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv One of the largest sites is at Bykivnia, a forest outside the capital Kyiv, where some estimates say that more than 200,000 executed political prisoners may have been buried. Millions of Ukrainians also died during a Stalin-era famine from 1932-1933, which is seen by many in Ukraine as an act of genocide carried out by the Soviet leader - although Russia denies this.

Herszenhorn The presidents of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine on Monday jointly proclaimed their commitment to a European future, standing with European Council President Charles Michel in what amounted to a triple rebuff of Russia, which has menaced all three countries in an effort to thwart their Western aspirations. The striking display of pro-EU unity came at the annual Batumi Conference , on Georgia\u2019s Black Sea coast. \u201cWe have a lot in common,\u201d Georgian President Salom\u00e9 Zourabichvili\u00a0said, standing with Michel, alongside Maia Sandu of Moldova and Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine. Advertisement \u201cA common past, common challenges to our sovereignty and territorial integrity, common challenges to our security and those destabilization attempts that can come from outside forces, as well as from internal forces,\u201d Zourabichvili said. \u201cBut we have in common also that we do not want to return to the past. We are ready and determined to fight for our European future.\u201d She added: \u201cOur response is clear. It is a European response. Neither adventure nor resignation or stagnation, but advance, advance steadily in the right direction \u2014 in the direction of Europe and that is called resilience.\u201d Monday\u2019s event was a marked triumph for the EU\u2019s 12-year-old Eastern Partnership initiative, an effort to reach out to former Soviet states, that has suffered numerous setbacks over the years and, at times, seemed at risk of doing more harm than good . A decision by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to turn away from the Eastern Partnership, breaking a promise to his own citizens, led to the Maidan Revolution, as well as Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of Crimea, and the now seven-year-long military conflict in Donbas, which remains unresolved. Russia has supported frozen military conflicts within the territories of all three countries in an effort to hinder their bids to move closer to the EU. Zelenskiy, in a symbolic gesture, on Monday visited the line of contact in the conflict over the Georgian region of Abkhazia, which is occupied by Russia and recognized by Moscow as an independent state. Advertisement Last month, the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, withdrew his country from the Eastern Partnership program, after the EU imposed batteries of sanctions over a fraudulent presidential election last August, repression of pro-democracy demonstrators, and the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger jet. In Moldova, Sandu\u2019s Party of Action and Solidarity won a resounding victory in parliamentary elections this month by campaigning on a pro-EU platform. And in recent years, the Georgian and Ukrainian governments have consistently reiterated their aspirations to join both the EU and NATO. In Batumi on Monday, the three presidents signed a declaration committing to \u201ctrilateral cooperation among our countries on European integration and reiterate our pledge to work together for the peaceful, democratic and prosperous European future for Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.\u201d Michel, who raised his profile in the region by helping to resolve an internal political crisis in Georgia earlier this year, delivered a speech in Batumi in which he suggested that the three countries should make a contest out of their efforts to integrate with the EU. \u201cWhy not introduce competitive benchmarking on key reforms,\u201d Michel said. \u201cThis would help galvanize the reform momentum and increase mutual support among partners and help secure your ever-closer ties with the EU.\u201d Michel also proclaimed the Eastern Partnership initiative a success. \u201cI believe our Eastern Partnership is the locomotive for transformation, prosperity and growth,\u201d he said. In statements to the press later in the day, Sandu cited the political association agreements and comprehensive free trade agreements signed by the Eastern Partnership countries as \u201cthe backbone of our national reform agendas.\u201d \u201cThe Eastern Partnership is a major success for our countries,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWith our Georgia and Ukrainian friends today we shared our views on the next steps that our countries could take to strengthen the Eastern Partnership even more \u2026 as countries that want to build Europe at home, but also become part of the European family.\u201d Advertisement Related Tags Cooperation Crisis Eastern Partnership Elections Military Rights Sanctions Security Trade Agreements Related Countries Belarus Georgia Moldova Russia Ukraine Related People Alexander Lukashenko Charles Michel Maia Sandu Viktor Yanukovych Vladimir Putin Our readers read next German coalition member backs US easing Nord Stream sanctions in Russia peace talks 9 MINS ago 2 mins read Macron calls report on new snap elections \u2018complete nonsense\u2019 1 HR ago 2 mins read Spain terminates Israeli ammo contract after uproar threatened to topple coalition 1 HR ago 3 mins read Protesters drench Belgium\u2019s francophone liberal chief in beer 1 HR ago 2 mins read More from David M.

In turn, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference Ukraine was meddling. \"(European) gas consumption will not decline, and Gazprom's role will not decline either,\" Szijjarto said after Gazprom and Hungarian energy group MVM executives signed the deal. \"For Hungary, energy safety is a matter of security, sovereignty and economy rather than a political matter,\" he said. \"You cannot heat homes with political statements.\" Russia, which used to ship natural gas primarily through Ukraine, has diversified export routes, constructing the undersea Nord Stream pipelines direct to Germany and the TurkStream link from Russia to Turkey. read more Under the deal finalised with Hungary at the end of August, effective from Oct. 1 and signed on Monday, Gazprom will ship 4.5 billion cubic metres of gas to Hungary annually, via two routes: 3.5 billion cubic meters via Serbia and 1 billion cubic meters via Austria. read more Apart from saying the deal was political, the statement from Ukraine's foreign ministry said it would have a significant impact on the energy security of Ukraine and Europe and it would ask the European Commission to assess whether the deal respected European energy law. \"Hungary will start receiving Gazprom's gas starting from Oct. 1 already via TurkStream and the pipelines of South-Eastern Europe,\" Gazprom's head Alexei Miller said in a statement. TurkStream via the Black Sea as well as the Nord Stream pipelines on the bed of the Baltic Sea are part of Russia's plans to bypass its political foe Ukraine when selling its gas to Europe. The European Commission had no immediate comment. A surge in benchmark gas prices as demand rebounds following pandemic lockdowns is a politically charged issue. Some European politicians have called for an investigation into Gazprom and accused it of holding back extra supplies. read more When Hungary agreed the terms of the new supply deal at the end of August, Szijjarto said the price had been agreed but did not give details. On Monday he said retail consumers would continue to pay one of the lowest gas prices in Europe. The deal will supply around half of Hungary's annual gas consumption of between 9 and 10 billion cubic meters. Hungary has reduced its reliance on Russian gas in recent years, opening cross-border interconnectors with most of its neighbours.

Oligarchs would be forbidden from financing political parties or taking part in privatisations. Top officials, including the president, prime minister and head of the central bank, would be required to declare dealings they had with them. Zelenskiy says it is necessary to protect the country from powerful businessmen who have corrupted its political system for decades. His opponents say they fear it will be applied selectively to concentrate more power in the president's hands. \"Thanks to the anti-oligarch law, Ukraine gets a historic chance to build a civilized and clean relationship between big business and the state,\" Zelenskiy said in a statement. \"Yes, many politicians do not like it. Yes, they want to live as before, working for the oligarchs. Yes, there was a lot of pressure on our deputies, a lot of intrigue and even blackmail.

Thursday's second reading, which passed with 279 votes in the 450-seat parliament, means it now goes to Zelenskiy for approval.

Shefir's car was sprayed with gunfire on Wednesday by unidentified attackers as he travelled between two villages outside the capital. read more Shefir was unharmed though his driver was wounded. Police are searching for the weapon and interviewing possible witnesses who were picking mushrooms nearby, Interior Ministry spokesperson Artem Shevchenko said on Thursday. Zelenskiy, a former TV comic, won a landslide election in 2019 promising to tackle corruption and curb the influence of tycoons who have dominated business, the media and politics since the end of the Soviet era. Opponents say he owes his own rise to the tycoon whose TV channel backed his earlier career. Opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko, from former President Petro Poroshenko's party, said by giving a presidential body the authority to determine who is an oligarch, the law \"creates huge scope for corruption\". Kira Rudyk, the leader of the Voice party, said the bill was designed \"only to strengthen the power, strengthen the position of the president and make it so that he can, together with the National

The \"Zapad-2021\" war games ran on Russia's and Belarus' western flanks, including sites close to the European Union's borders, and alarmed Ukraine and some NATO countries. In this photo released by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service, a joint strategic exercise of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus Zapad-2021 is seen in the Nizhny Novgorod region, Russia, Saturday, Sept. 11, 2021. Ukraine said the \"Rapid Trident 2021\" exercises would involve 6,000 troops from 15 countries \u2014 Ukraine, the United States and other NATO members \u2014 and would last until Oct. 1. \"The main goal is to prepare for joint actions as part of a multinational force during coalition operations,\" it said in a statement. Ukraine views the military exercises with Western partners as an important step on the path to NATO, believing that membership in the alliance would strengthen the country's resistance to Russian aggression. Kyiv's relations with Moscow deteriorated in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and backed pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donbass region. The seven-year war with separatists killed more than 13,000 people. Ukraine's relations with Belarus also have worsened since Kyiv called the 2020 presidential election in Belarus neither free nor fair and condemned violence against protesters.

{"year":"2021","month":"10","event_desc":"26 October  The country confirms it has carried out its first drone strikes using the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2, destroying a pro-Russian separatist D-30 howitzer. A Ukrainian soldier is killed and another wounded by rebel artillery near Hranitne in Donetsk Oblast.","text":"Ukraine Destroys Pro-Russian Artillery in Its First Use of Turkish Drones Oct. 27, 2021 The Bayraktar TB2. armyinform.com.ua Ukraine has destroyed the artillery of pro-Russian separatists in the country\u2019s east in its first combat deployment of a Turkish drone, the Ukrainian military announced Tuesday. Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces\u2019 D-30. The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line. \u201cBayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,\u201d the Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 general staff said in a statement. \u201cAfter that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.\u201d The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People\u2019s Republic as saying Wednesday. The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People\u2019s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line. Tuesday\u2019s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July. The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a \"medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions\" with a range of up to 27 hours. Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country. The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d relations with Ankara. The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies. AFP contributed reporting.

Her comments on gas supply come\u00a0amid\u00a0strong opposition in Ukraine to the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Von der Leyen also committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and the Minsk agreements. Signed in 2014 and 2015, they sought\u00a0to end Russia's war in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is hosting European Council President Charles Michel and von der Leyen, along with other EU officials. They are discussing the worsening situation in eastern Ukraine as well as seeking to further strengthen economic and political ties. What else is being discussed? In addition to pledges to ensure Ukraine's energy security, the EU's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell met with Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba. \"The EU stands firmly behind Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Borrell tweeted following the meeting. Tensions between Ukraine and neighbor Russia escalated again this year after Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border . The EU and Ukraine also signed an aviation agreement to open the country to more low-cost air routes and boost tourism. Ukraine\u00a0fears energy security The Nord Stream 2 pipeline transports gas\u00a0directly from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine and other central and eastern European countries. Ukraine is concerned that the pipeline's path will cause it to miss\u00a0out on gas transit fees. This is despite a deal from Germany that sets out plans to boost investment in the country. Ukraine is also worried that the pipeline could increase Russia's political leverage in the region. Further energy concerns sparked a bilateral row between Ukraine and its EU neighbor Hungary last month, after Budapest signed a new long-term energy deal with Russia that sidelined Ukraine as a transit country. The deal also brings into question Ukraine's ability to take reverse flows of Russian gas from Hungary.

{"year":"2021","month":"10","event_desc":"Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov warns that the delivery and first operational deployment of the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 in Donbas by the country may \"destabilize the situation\" in the region.","text":"Ukraine Destroys Pro-Russian Artillery in Its First Use of Turkish Drones Oct. 27, 2021 The Bayraktar TB2. armyinform.com.ua Ukraine has destroyed the artillery of pro-Russian separatists in the country\u2019s east in its first combat deployment of a Turkish drone, the Ukrainian military announced Tuesday. Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces\u2019 D-30. The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line. \u201cBayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,\u201d the Ukrainian armed forces\u2019 general staff said in a statement. \u201cAfter that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.\u201d The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People\u2019s Republic as saying Wednesday. The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People\u2019s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line. Tuesday\u2019s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July. The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a \"medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions\" with a range of up to 27 hours. Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country. The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d relations with Ankara. The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies. AFP contributed reporting.

Ukraine had registered 2.94 million infections and 68,027 deaths as of Nov. 1. Only 7.4 million people, or less than a fifth of the total population of around 41 million, has been fully vaccinated so far. Sign up here. From Monday residents of Kyiv will have to present vaccine certificates or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test to use restaurants, cafes, gyms, entertainment facilities and shopping malls. Staff working in those places must have been vaccinated. City authorities have said special teams will monitor compliance with the restrictions on public transport. Reuters correspondents saw police and National Guard members stationed at entrances to the metro checking people's vaccination certificates. Restaurant and cafe staff carried out similar checks on their customers. \"I consider all this a necessity because otherwise people unfortunately do not understand. You need to be vaccinated. They need to motivate people somehow,\" Julia Lisok, a bank employee, told Reuters. \"Unfortunately Ukraine has one of the lowest levels of vaccination and this does not bring us closer to Europe,\" she added. The government has made vaccinations against COVID-19 compulsory for some state employees, and authorities hope the new requirements will speed up vaccination.

(Ukraine Interior Ministry Press Service\/Handout via Reuters) Share Ukraine to Deploy Troops, Helicopters to Guard Belarus Border share Print KYIV \u2014 Ukraine will deploy another 8,500 troops and police officers, and 15 helicopters, to guard its border with Belarus, aiming to prevent possible attempts by migrants to breach the frontier, the Ukrainian interior minister said on Thursday. The European Union has accused Belarus of encouraging migrants to come to its territory then pushing thousands of them to cross into Poland and other neighboring EU states in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Minsk. While not an EU member, Ukraine is wary of becoming another front in the migrant crisis. Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy said the new forces would include 3,000 border guard servicemen, 3,500 servicemen of the National Guard and 2,000 police officers. \"Aviation [from] the interior ministry will also be on duty, in particular 15 helicopters, which will ensure mobility and, if necessary, will transfer our forces to the border,\" he said. Monastyrskiy said earlier on Thursday that Ukrainian border guards, police and the national guard would hold drills on the border with Belarus. \"In order to counter the potential crisis with migrants, we will involve all five structures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs without exception,\" the minister was quoted as saying in the statement. Monastyrskiy said the latest actions would deter migrants from entering Ukraine, but the former Soviet republic needed to radically re-equip its border with neighboring Russia and Belarus in order to avoid similar problems in the future.

{"year":"2021","month":"11","event_desc":"7 November  The country receives 2,930,300 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine distributed through the COVAX initiative.","text":"Press release UNICEF delivers close to 3 million doses of Moderna vaccine to Ukraine under COVAX 07 November 2021 UNICEF \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 English Kyiv, 7 November, 2021 - Today, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) delivered to Ukraine 2,930,300 doses of mRNA vaccine from COVID-19 manufactured by Moderna. Ukraine receives vaccines under the COVAX Facility free of charge. COVAX is an unprecedented initiative of solidarity among the international community to support access to effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines for all countries. Together with the newest supply, UNICEF has delivered 7,415,810 doses of vaccines by various manufacturers (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sinovac) as part of COVAX. Deliveries on behalf of the initiative will continue to protect as many people in Ukraine as possible from COVID. \"So far, 11 million Ukrainians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Today, vaccination is primarily the responsibility of everyone to themselves and others. The state has done everything to ensure that Ukrainians have the opportunity to be vaccinated and even choose vaccines. Moderna is the fourth vaccine available in Ukraine for vaccination against COVID-19. I thank the international partners for their systematic support and common desire to overcome the pandemic,\" said Viktor Lyashko, Minister of Health of Ukraine. \u201cVaccination is the only way to protect life from COVID-19 and I urge all Ukrainians to use this protection. Thanks to the efforts by donors and partners within COVAX, COVID-19 vaccines are now available to anyone. In particular, we hope all educators complete their vaccination as soon as possible, including with vaccines from this batch, so schools are open and children return to classrooms. It hurts to watch people suffocate in crowded hospitals. In contrast, vaccinated people are 5 times less likely to become infected and have more than 10 times lower risk of hospitalization than those unvaccinated. According to the latest UNICEF survey, 42% of Ukrainians who have not been vaccinated yet are ready to get vaccinated, which is encouraging. Please get protection now,\u201d said Murat Sahin, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. \"Since late October, Ukraine reports a record-high level of new infections and deaths from the coronavirus. While every fifth Ukrainian has received COVID vaccination, the majority of people who are hospitalized and require critical care have not received their full course of the COVID-19 vaccine. WHO welcomes the delivery of the Moderna vaccine through COVAX Facility in Ukraine. With everybody\u2019s efforts, there are now vaccines available to administer a hundred thousand vaccines daily. We encourage Ukrainians to use the opportunity to get vaccinated and stay united to address the pandemic,\" said Dr. Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of WHO Country Office in Ukraine . In-country storage and logistics of shipments of mRNA vaccines from COVAX, in accordance with the correct cold chain requirements, are provided by\u00a0USAID. Vaccination is the only way to prevent severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. Even if infection occurs in a vaccinated person, it is most likely to be mild. All adults and children from 12 years of age can be vaccinated against COVID-19. It is vital that people with chronic diseases (diabetes, oncology, bronchial asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis patients) and pregnant women who may be severely affected by the disease are vaccinated as soon as possible. The only real contraindication to vaccination with COVID-19 is anaphylactic shock at the first dose of the vaccine. COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the\u00a0Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ), the Vaccine Alliance Gavi , and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) \u2013\u00a0working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, governments of\u00a0US, UK, European Union, World Bank, and others.

In a message to European countries that are heavily dependent on Russian gas, the prime minister suggested he believes Vladimir Putin could be serious about restricting supplies from pipelines that run through eastern Europe, if the west signals its intention to defend Ukraine. He also accused Belarus\u2019s authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of Russia, of an \u201cabhorrent\u201d attempt to engineer a migrant crisis on the border with Poland in an effort to undermine European unity. EU foreign ministers are now expected to expand sanctions against Belarus to include airlines, travel agents and individuals alleged to be helping to entice migrants to Europe in what is being described as a \u201chybrid attack\u201d on the bloc. Speaking at the Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet, Johnson said: \u201cWhen our Polish friends asked for our help to deal with a contrived crisis on their border with Belarus, we were quick to respond. And we hope that our friends may recognise that a choice is shortly coming between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines and sticking up for Ukraine and championing the cause of peace and stability, let me put it that way.\u201d Nato chief warns Russia against \u2018further provocation\u2019 amid Ukraine tensions Read more Earlier in the day, Downing Street also voiced concern about the buildup of Russian forces along the border with Ukraine. Russia dismissed claims that it is preparing to invade, after the Ukrainian defence ministry reported that about 90,000 Russian troops were massing in the area. However, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cWe are seeing a concerning situation at the border. We remain in unwavering support for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and will continue to support them in face of Russian hostility.\u201d Over the weekend, Gen Sir Nick Carter, the outgoing head of the army, said the west would have to be prepared for an escalation of tensions with Russia. Asked whether it could turn into a shooting war, Carter said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think we have to be on our guard and make sure deterrence prevails and critically we have to make sure there is unity in the Nato alliance and we don\u2019t allow any gaps to occur in our collective position.\u201d Johnson also used his speech at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet to speak about the Cop26 summit, saying it was \u201cfrustrating\u201d to have seen the commitment to phasing out coal weakened to \u201cphasing down\u201d the fossil fuel. But he added: \u201cI have been watching politics a long time now and I know when a tipping point is reached. \u201cThe language does matter, but whether you are talking about phasing down or phasing out, the day is now not far off when it will be as politically unacceptable, anywhere in the world, to open a new coal-fired power station as it now is to get on an aeroplane and light a cigar.\u201d He went on to make a plea for international cooperation, saying the Cop26 summit was perhaps helped by \u201ca collective sense of embarrassment at the way internationalism failed us during Covid: the squabbles over PPE, the crazy decisions of some countries to try to stop the export of vaccines to others, something we were victims of at the start of this year.\u201d In the wide-ranging speech, he also made a pledge to make the UK into a \u201cscience superpower\u201d, promising to \u201cgo big on quantum computing\u201d. \u201cIf AI can mimic the intuitive flair of the human brain, then quantum computing will enable us to process information so fast that we can process an almost infinite number of solutions at once,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we could perfect it, there are so many problems we could solve, including how to turn nitrogen into fertiliser and feed the world without creating so much CO 2 . \u201cSo I am setting the ambition that the UK will aim to build a general-purpose quantum computer, and secure the single biggest share of a global quantum computing market by 2040.\u201d Explore more on these topics Boris Johnson Ukraine Russia Gas Europe Commodities Vladimir Putin news Share Reuse this content","question":"What accusation did Boris Johnson make against Belarus's president in November 2021?","answer":"Johnson accused Belarus's president, Alexander Lukashenko, of orchestrating a migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border to undermine European unity.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0441\u0443\u043d\u0443\u0432 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0456 \u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0456 2021 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0456 \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041b\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u043c\u0456\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u0456\u0436 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0435\u044e \u0442\u0430 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u044e \u0437 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u044e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0454\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d \u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0456 2021 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0456 \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041b\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0443 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u0456\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0456\u0432 \u044f\u043a \"\u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0457\" \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0456 \u0437 \u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043e\u043c, \u0437\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0435\u044e.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer aligns with the expected answer in terms of the accusation made by Boris Johnson against the President of Belarus.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv has had to defend its right to independence, and that NATO membership would \"facilitate the development of the common security system\". Two refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats intended to bolster the Ukrainian navy arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday as a part of $2.5 billion package of assistance to Kyiv since 2014. read more Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk\nWriting by Matthias Williams and Pavel Polityuk\nEditing by Timothy Heritage and Peter Graff Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Europe Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Trump tells Putin to 'STOP' after Russian attack kills 12 in Kyiv 2:56 PM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago United Kingdom category UK PM Starmer nears EU defence pact in shadow of Trump trade talks 12:33 PM UTC Europe category Student killed in stabbing at French school, police say 1:50 PM UTC Sustainability category Greece to deploy record number of firefighters this year amid global warming, minister says 11:06 AM UTC","question":"What was Russia's stated position regarding its troop movements near Ukraine in November 2021?","answer":"Russia denied plans for an assault and accused Ukraine and the U.S. of escalating tensions.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0456\u044e \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0457\u0445 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044f \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0456 2021 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f \u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0456 2021 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0430, \u0449\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0457\u0457 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0456\u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0454 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0448\u043d\u044c\u043e\u044e \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0456 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0456\u043d\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432. \u0412\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u043e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0443, \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0447\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0454\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0417\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0443 \"\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u044e\" \u0442\u0430 \"\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f\u043c\u0438\".","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer aligns with the expected answer by stating that Russia denied plans to attack Ukraine and accused the West of provocation.

(file photo) Share Biden Vows 'Unwavering Support' For Ukraine Amid Heightened Tensions With Russia share Print U.S. President Joe Biden has reiterated \"unwavering support\" for Kyiv as Russia and Ukraine both launched military exercises near their border amid rising tensions between the two neighbors. The November 24 events follow reports of a large Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border that raised fears of a possible invasion. In a November 24 statement honoring the millions of Ukrainians who died in the Holodomor famine of the 1930s, Biden said that the United States \"reaffirms our commitment to the people of Ukraine today and our unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\" SEE ALSO: 'A Gift To Posterity': Four Men Who Risked The Wrath Of Stalin To Photograph The Holodomor Russia seized Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in March 2014 and has been backing separatists in eastern Ukraine in an ongoing conflict that has claimed more than 13,200 lives since April 2014. Kyiv and its Western backers have raised alarm bells in recent weeks over a Russian military buildup near Ukraine, whose military intelligence chief claimed on November 21 that Russia has amassed 92,000 troops near its borders and was readying an attack for early February. Moscow has called such allegations \u201cgroundless.\u201d Russia staged military drills in the Black Sea, south of Ukraine, saying it needed to sharpen the combat-readiness of its conventional and nuclear forces because of what Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu called \"the growing activity of NATO countries near Russia's borders.\" During the drills, Russian warplanes and ships practiced repelling air attacks on naval bases and responding with air strikes, Interfax reported. Ukraine, meanwhile, launched exercises of its own near its northern frontier, which it said were meant to beef up preparedness for a potential spillover of a monthslong migrant crisis on the border between European Union member Poland and Belarus. Russian President Vladimir Putin on November 24 told European Council President Charles Michel that he was concerned by Ukraine's \"provocations\" to inflate tensions in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Putin \"expressed concern in connection with continuing provocations of the Ukrainian side aimed at exacerbating the situation on the line of contact,\" it said in a statement. The previous day, Shoigu complained that U.S. bombers had rehearsed a nuclear strike on Russia, coming too close to the Russian border -- drills the Pentagon said had adhered to international protocols. Michel confirmed his call with Putin in a tweet and said that the EU \u201cis following closely the military buildup along Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine.\u201d \u201cStressed Russia\u2019s responsibility for advancing peaceful settlement in eastern Ukraine,\u201d he wrote in a separate tweet. SEE ALSO: NATO Chief, Alliance Heavyweights Warn Russia Over Troop Buildup Near Ukraine Meanwhile, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas expressed her Baltic state's shared concern after talks in Paris with French President Emmanual Macron, and she urged the European Union to be \"clear on the European side that the price of taking any steps toward Ukraine will be so high that it will act as a deterrent and make Russia reconsider.\" She warned it was urgent for the EU and the United States to agree on a common deterrent because a migrant crisis on the EU-Belarus border blamed on Belarusian strongman Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the postelection transition in Berlin, and France's run-up to a presidential election could present a \"perfect storm\" for Putin to test the West's resolve. Amid questions about Putin's intentions in the current atmosphere, Reuters quoted sources in U.S. policy circles as suggesting the Russian leader could be angling for a second summit with Biden, who met with the Kremlin leader in Switzerland in June with mutual relations reportedly at their worst since the Cold War. The United States and NATO have reaffirmed their support for Ukraine including through warship maneuvers this month in the Black Sea and a delivery of U.S. patrol boats to the Ukrainian Navy. Ukraine's Border Guard Service, meanwhile, held what it called a \"special operation\" at the border with Belarus on November 24, including drone exercises and military drills for anti-tank and airborne units amid concerns that a migrant crisis at the Polish-Belarusian frontier could spill into Ukrainian territory. The service said in a statement that the operation is part of measures to \"increase the protection and defense of the Ukrainian border in order to prevent a migration crisis and combat illegal activities.\"\u200b The operation was conducted jointly with the National Guard, the National Police, and the Armed Forces, the service said . Volodymyr Nikiforenko, the deputy head of the Border Guard Service, said the main task of the operation was to prevent illegal migrants from crossing the state border and entering Ukraine. Kyiv has also voiced worries that the border with Belarus, a close Russian ally, could be used by Russia to stage a military assault. Ukraine has deployed 8,500 troops and police officers to guard its border with Belarus, aiming to prevent possible attempts by migrants to breach the frontier. It also said some of its airborne units carried out paratrooper jumps in the southern Mykolayiv region, near the country's main seaport of Odesa and Russian-occupied Crimea. Amid the rising tensions in the region, the U.S. and Russian top military officers spoke over the phone on November 23. SEE ALSO: U.S., Russian Military Chiefs Speak On The Phone Amid Heightened Tensions Over Ukraine General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, and General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, discussed \"current questions of international security,\" Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement on November 23. The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed the call, saying in a statement that Gerasimov and Milley discussed \"security-related issues of concern.\" The Russian Defense Ministry and the Pentagon did not provide further details.

{"year":"2021","month":"11","event_desc":"26 November  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of plotting a coup against him and says that Ukrainian tycoon Rinat Akhmetov was being enlisted to help plan the coup. Zelenskyy says that his country \"is prepared for any scenario\" as tensions rise.","text":"Zelenskiy says Ukraine uncovers coup plot involving Russians; Kremlin denies role By Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk November 26, 2021 5:20 PM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Summary Zelenskiy says plotters tried to rope in Ukraine's richest man Tycoon Akhmetov: Zelenskiy's statements are \"absolute lie\" Ukraine fully prepared for Russia escalation: Zelenskiy Ukraine sovereign bonds tumble on security concerns KYIV, Nov 26 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday said Ukraine had uncovered a plot to overthrow his government next week, involving individuals from Russia caught on tape talking about roping Ukraine's richest businessman into backing a coup. The Kremlin denied any role in any coup plot, and the businessman called the president's account an \"absolute lie.\"  Zelenskiy himself gave few details and stopped short of saying whether he believed the Kremlin was behind the plot. Sign up here. But the accusation raised the temperature at a time when Kyiv and its Western allies have already accused Moscow of massing troops near the Ukrainian border for a possible assault, a suggestion Moscow dismisses as false and alarmist. Speaking at an hours-long news conference, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian intelligence had obtained audio recordings of the plotters talking about involving business magnate Rinat Akhmetov into joining their coup. \"We have challenges not only from the Russian Federation and possible escalation - we have big internal challenges. I received information that a coup d'etat will take place in our country on Dec. 1-2,\" Zelenskiy said. Akhmetov said in a statement: \"The information made public by Volodymyr Zelenskiy about attempts to draw me into some kind of coup is an absolute lie. I am outraged by the spread of this lie, no matter what the president's motives are.\" \"As a Ukrainian citizen, the country's biggest investor, taxpayer, and employer, I will continue to defend a free Ukraine, a free economy, democracy, and freedom of speech.\" Ukraine's sovereign dollar bonds tumbled to their lowest level in more than a year on Friday and the cost of insuring exposure to the country's debt soared amid rising security concerns. UKRAINE PREPARED FOR ESCALATION Zelenskiy did not give full details of the coup plot. Asked explicitly whether he thought the Kremlin was involved, he said: \"I'm sorry, I can't talk about it.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attends a news briefing following the Ukraine-EU summit in Kyiv, Ukraine October 12, 2021. REUTERS\/Valentyn Ogirenko\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab But he also spoke at length at the news conference of a threat of Russian military escalation, and said Ukraine would be ready for it. \"We are in full control of our borders and are fully prepared for any escalation,\" Zelenskiy said. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet last week that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February. Ukraine, which wants to join the NATO military alliance, has blamed Moscow for supporting separatists in a conflict in its east since 2014. It received a large consignment of U.S. ammunition and Javelin missiles earlier this year, prompting criticism from Russia. U.S. officials were in touch with Ukraine to get additional information on the plot, said Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried. Ministers from NATO member states, including U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken, would also meet Ukrainian officials during a summit in Latvia next week, Donfried told reporters in a telephone briefing. Zelenskiy also said his chief of staff Andriy Yermak would soon be contacting representatives of Russia about the standoff between the two countries. Separately, Yermak said he would be contacting senior Kremlin official Dmitry Kozak. Russia has said it suspects Ukraine of wanting to recapture separatist-controlled territory by force. Zelenskiy said Ukraine had no such plans and added that Russia's rhetoric opposing Ukraine's bid to join NATO was a worrying signal. A former actor who once played a fictional president in a popular sitcom, the 43-year-old Zelenskiy came to power by a landslide in 2019 promising to end the war in eastern Ukraine, which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people. But after a lull in fighting and confidence-building measures including prisoner swaps, tensions with Russia rose this year.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would send ideas to Washington within a week to follow up his talks with Biden on Tuesday about the Ukraine crisis. Sign up here. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said he hoped there would be an announcement by Friday of high-level meetings with Russia and major NATO allies to discuss Moscow's \"concerns relative to NATO writ large\" and the possibility of \"bringing down the temperature along the eastern front.\" The United States has voiced growing unease about a Russian military buildup near Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has tilted toward the West since 2014. Moscow denies aiming to invade Ukraine and instead warns of a creeping NATO expansion eastward. Biden said the United States had a moral and legal obligation to defend NATO allies if they are attacked, but that obligation did not extend to Ukraine. \"That is not on the table,\" Biden said when asked if U.S. troops would be used to stop a Russian invasion of Ukraine. \"It would depend upon what the rest of the NATO countries were willing to do as well,\" Biden said. \"But the idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not ... in the cards right now.\" He said he made it clear to Putin during their talks on Tuesday that there would be economic consequences like none before if Russia invades Ukraine, and that he is confident Putin got the message. Biden warned Putin on Tuesday that the West would impose \"strong economic and other measures\" on Moscow if it invaded, while Putin demanded guarantees that NATO would not expand to the east. read more Neither side spoke of a breakthrough after the two-hour video call but agreed to keep talking about what the Kremlin called \"this complex confrontational situation.\" \"We agreed we will continue this discussion and we'll do it in a substantive way. We will exchange our ideas in the very near future. Russia will draw up its ideas literally in the coming days, within a week we will give this to the U.S. side to consider,\" Putin told reporters on Wednesday. In his first public comments since the conversation, Putin said it was \"provocative\" to pose the question of whether Russia planned to attack Ukraine, and again accused Kyiv and NATO of threatening Russia's security.

FIGHTER JETS Russia, Ukraine and NATO have all stepped up military exercises as tensions have mounted in the past month. Russian military aircraft were scrambled on Wednesday to escort French Rafale and Mirage fighter jets flying over the Black Sea, RIA news agency quoted the Defence Ministry as saying. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it had handed a note of protest to the U.S. Embassy over \"dangerous\" flights of U.S. and NATO military planes near Russia's borders. Zelenskiy welcomed Biden's role in trying to attain peace in eastern Ukraine, where Ukraine says more than 14,000 people have been killed in seven years of fighting with Russian-backed separatists. read more Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Reuters the talks between Biden and Putin had served the purpose of \"deterrence and de-escalation\". read more A Russian Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying the United States might be included for the first time in a group of countries working to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. RIA quoted the official, Oleg Krasnitsky, as saying there was no reason why the United States should not join the so-called Normandy grouping - comprising Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany - that has tried but so far failed to end the war. \"A lot depends on the position of Washington in settling the Ukrainian conflict. In principle, if the U.S. is really ready to make a contribution, we've always been open to America exercising its influence on Kyiv,\" he was quoted as saying. The remarks appeared to indicate that Moscow was open to an offer by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week for Washington to facilitate talks on the fighting.

(AP\/Efrem Lukatsky) At an event in Jerusalem marking 30 years of Israel-Ukraine ties, Ukraine\u2019s Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk says his country could recognize the city as Israel\u2019s \u201cone and only capital\u201d in the next year, and open a branch of its embassy during a visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Korniychuk tells The Times of Israel that he believes recognition is a matter of months, not years, but that Zelensky has certain preconditions in the security and defense relationship between the countries before that happens. \u201cAs soon as I get permission, I will do it immediately,\u201d says Korniychuk. The announcement comes after Jerusalem Affairs Minister Ze\u2019ev Elkin, who grew up in Ukraine, expresses during his address at the event his hope that Zelensky will open an embassy branch in Jerusalem. Elkin presented Korniychuk with a 2,700-year-old artifact bearing the word \u201cJerusalem\u201d in Hebrew, and the Ukrainian envoy then takes the microphone and makes the unprepared remarks. While this does not equal official recognition, it shows the direction ties are moving, Elkin tells The Times of Israel. \u201cI have worked for years to have more countries open embassy branches in Jerusalem, and I hope to see this come to fruition,\u201d he says. The embassy branch would deal with promoting bilateral ties in trade and technology. It's not (only) about you.

Share Polish, Lithuanian Leaders Back Kyiv And Call For No 'Concessions' To Russia share Print Poland and Lithuania have joined Ukraine in calling for stronger sanctions against Russia, with Polish President Andrzej Duda saying that \u201ceverything must be done\u201d to prevent potential Russian military aggression against Ukraine. In a joint statement issued after their December 20 meeting in the western Ukrainian village of Huta, the Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish presidents \u201ccalled upon the international community to step up sanctions on the Russian Federation over its ongoing aggression against Ukraine and once again urged the Kremlin to de-escalate the situation by withdrawing its troops from the Ukrainian borders and temporarily occupied territories.\u201d The trilateral summit, which was part of the Lublin Triangle regional forum, comes as Kyiv and its Western backers accuse Russia of massing about 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine as a possible prelude to an invasion as early as next month. The European Union has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia over its March 2014 seizure and illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, as well as for Moscow\u2019s backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine in an ongoing conflict that has killed more than 13,200 people since April 2014. SEE ALSO: How Long Could Ukraine Hold Out Against A New Russian Invasion? Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Polish President Andrzej Duda said he was \u201cabsolutely against any policy of concessions to Russia.\u201d It is \u201cabsolutely undesirable to yield to such an ultimatum, to such blackmail,\" he added. \u201cOur common task is to deter the threat posed by Russia and defend Europe from Russia's aggressive policies,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, while his Lithuanian counterpart, Gitanas Nauseda, said that any attempts by Russia to draw \u201cred lines\u201d are \u201cunacceptable in Europe in the 21st century.\u201d The bloc has urged Russia to de-escalate the current situation and engage in renewed diplomacy instead of conflict, threatening strong new sanctions in coordination with Britain and the United States if there were any attack. Russia denies it has plans to launch an offensive and has issued a series of demands about Ukraine\u2019s potential membership in NATO and the alliance's activities near its western border. Ukraine and another former Soviet republic bordering Russia, Georgia, are seeking to join the Western military alliance -- which Moscow vehemently opposes. U.S. and European officials have called some of the Russian proposals unacceptable and said Russia cannot \"dictate\" terms to NATO.

Russia and Georgia fought a brief war in 2008 and Russian troops have since remained in the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. \"In 2008, there was an attack on Georgia. Six years passed. In 2014, there was an attack on Ukraine. A few more than six years have passed, and here we have the current situation. Seven years have already passed since 2014. Russia has once again gathered strength. Russia is once again flexing its muscles,\" Duda said.

REUTERS\/Leonhard Foeger\/Files Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Summary Proposals handed over to United States this week Tensions high amid build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine U.S. says it will talk, but some demands unacceptable MOSCOW, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, part of a wish list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West. Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. Sign up here. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine , opens new tab - that the West has already ruled out. Others would imply the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe and the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the Soviet Union. In Washington, a senior administration official said the United States was prepared to discuss the proposals but added: \"That said, there are some things in those documents that the Russians know are unacceptable.\" The official said Washington would respond some time next week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Washington would talk to its allies. \"We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy, free from outside interference,\" she said. NATO diplomats told Reuters that Russia cannot have a veto on further expansion of the alliance and NATO has the right to decide its own military posture. \"Russia is not a member of NATO and doesn't decide on matters related to NATO,\" Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said. Ukraine's foreign ministry said Kyiv had an \"exclusive sovereign right\" to run its own foreign policy, and only it and NATO could determine the relationship between them, including the question of Ukrainian membership. It urged Moscow to re-engage with a peace process in eastern Ukraine, where some 15,000 people have been killed in a seven-year conflict between Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed separatists. 'SMOKESCREEN' Some Western political analysts suggested Russia was knowingly presenting unrealistic demands which it knew would not be met to provide a diplomatic distraction while maintaining military pressure on Ukraine. \"Something is very wrong with this picture, the pol(itical) side appears to be a smokescreen,\" Michael Kofman, a Russia specialist at Virginia-based research organization CNA, wrote on Twitter. Sam Greene, professor of Russian politics at King's College London, said President Vladimir Putin was \"drawing a line around the post-Soviet space and planting a 'keep out' sign\". \"It's not meant to be a treaty: it's a declaration,\" he said. \"But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean this is a prelude to war. It\u2019s a justification for keeping Moscow\u2019s hair-trigger stance, in order to keep Washington and others off balance.\" Presenting Moscow's demands, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia and the West must start from a clean sheet in rebuilding relations. \"The line pursued by the United States and NATO over recent  years to aggressively escalate the security situation is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous,\" he told reporters. Ryabkov said Russia was not willing to put up with the current situation any longer, and urged Washington to come up with a constructive response fast. He said Russia was ready to start talks as soon as Saturday, with Geneva a possible venue, but Russian news agency TASS quoted him as saying later that Moscow was extremely disappointed by the signals coming from Washington and NATO. TROOP BUILD-UP Moscow handed over its proposals to the United States this week as tensions rose over the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. It says it is responding to what it sees as threats to its own security from Ukraine's increasingly close relations with NATO and aspirations to become an alliance member, even though there is no imminent prospect of Kyiv being allowed to join. The Russian proposals were set out in two documents - a draft agreement with NATO countries and a draft treaty with the United States, both published by the foreign ministry. The first, among other points, would require Russia and NATO  not to deploy additional troops and weapons outside the countries where they were in May 1997 - before the accession to NATO of any of the former communist states in East Europe that for decades were dominated by Moscow. It would mean NATO abandoning any military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. The treaty with the United States would prevent Moscow and  Washington from deploying nuclear weapons outside their national territories. That would mean an end to NATO's so-called nuclear-sharing arrangements, where European NATO members provide aircraft capable of delivering U.S. nuclear weapons.

{"year":"2021","month":"12","event_desc":"U.S. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby says a small Department of Defense team has returned from the country after assessing its air defences.","text":"News & Features Around The Globe Europe Ukraine Pentagon Team Has Returned From Assessing Ukraine\u2019s Air Defense Needs There are rumblings that the U.S. government could bolster Ukraine's air defenses as a possible new Russian invasion looms. By Joseph Trevithick Updated Dec 21, 2021 10:40 AM EST 0 www.twz.com The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A small Department of Defense team recently returned from Ukraine after a trip to that country to discuss and evaluate its air and missile defense needs . This comes as Ukrainian officials continue to warn that Russia could be just weeks away from launching a new major military intervention against their country, which might involve a flurry of air and missile strikes that they currently have relatively limited capabilities to defend against. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby mentioned the team\u2019s return at a press conference earlier today, but did not have any further details to share about the results of the trip. Air Force Magazine , citing a senior Ukrainian defense official, reported that the team was on the ground earlier this month , but is not entirely clear when they first arrived. The group was also in the country to discuss Ukraine\u2019s ability to respond to Russian naval , electronic warfare , and cyber warfare threats, not just air and missile defenses, according to that outlet. Air and missile defense capacity has been a growing point of concern for Ukraine vis a vis Russia since 2014. That year, the Kremlin seized the Crimean Peninsula from the government in Kyiv and subsequently began actively supporting ostensibly local \u201cseparatist\u201d groups, which all have significant ties to Russian intelligence agencies , in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbass region. Since then, the Ukrainian government has worked to bolster its capabilities with an eye toward deterring further Russian encroachment , or at least being able to better respond to it should it occur. While there had been some efforts to increase the country\u2019s air and missile defense capabilities, as well as its own fleets of combat aircraft and longer-range missiles, the Ukrainian military still relies mostly on aging Soviet designs and refurbished and modernized derivatives thereof. \u201cWe have a well-developed and a powerful land force,\u201d Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov said at a press conference during a visit to Washington, D.C. in November. \u201cThe need is an air defense and missile defense.\u201d There have been reports for weeks now that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has been actively engaged in discussions with Ukrainian officials about what air and missile defense capabilities the U.S. government might be able to provide in the near term. Media reports have regularly talked about Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, as well as Stinger shoulder-fired heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), as potential options. These same deliberations have reportedly covered other kinds of military assistance , including the potential transfer to Ukrainian forces of Mi-17 helicopters and other assets that previously belonged to the now-defunct Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, or were earmarked for them, but never delivered. A significant hurdle in any such discussions is likely the U.S. government\u2019s disinterest in deploying actual American troops to Ukraine on missions where they might be called upon to directly engage Russian forces. What this means is that simply sending things like U.S. Army Patriot batteries, which are in short supply to begin with, to the country is unlikely to be on the table at all. US Army personnel fire a Patriot surface-to-air missile during an exercise in Romania in June 2021., US Army Selling or otherwise transferring Patriots to Ukraine directly, something officials in Kyiv have previously expressed interest in , would almost certainly be a complex process legally and logistically. On top of that, Ukrainian forces have no experience with that system and would have to be trained to operate it effectively. All of this would take time, something that is in short supply in the current crisis, with Ukrainian and U.S. officials, among others, warning that a new Russian intervention could come as soon as January or February. MANPADS like Stinger , many of which can also be fired by launchers mounted on light vehicles , would be easier for Ukrainian troops to become proficient with. American allies in Europe, such as Poland , produce more modern designs that are derived from Soviet-era systems that might be better suited to Ukraine\u2019s needs, as well. At the same time, unfortunately, these shorter-range systems offer only point defense capabilities that could be of limited effectiveness by themselves against an onslaught of Russian aircraft and missiles. Even so, they would still impose a cost on the Kremlin. \u201cEven with weak air defenses, we can shoot down a couple aircraft,\u201d an anonymous Ukrainian official told Air Force Magazine earlier this month. \u201cHow many casualties will they sustain?\u201d A US Army Avenger air defense system, which has two launchers that each hold four Stinger missiles, as well as a .50 caliber M3P machine gun, is seen here mounted on a Humvee light tactical vehicle., US Army With nothing in American inventory air defense-wise between Patriot and Stinger, not counting the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) that the U.S. Army has arrayed around Washington, D.C., the U.S. military just has limited options when it comes to what it might be able to easily transfer or otherwise expedite the export of. Various American allies and partners do operate middle-tier surface-to-air missile systems that might be better suited to Ukraine\u2019s current needs, or help them field a more comprehensive air and missile defense network. However, similar kinds of procedural, logistical, and training issues would still apply and limit the Ukrainian military\u2019s ability to truly field any new systems. The U.S. government could try to source additional Soviet-era systems of various kinds that Ukrainian forces do have more experience with from third countries, which could include any stockpiles of such weapons that might still remain in former Warsaw Pact countries that are now part of NATO. These are all almost certainly the kinds of issues that the Pentagon team has been sent to discuss with Ukraine in the first place. At the same time, as these discussions drag out, the sense of urgency is only likely to grow. American and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed that there are no indications that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a firm decision to launch a new major offensive against his neighbor. However, the Kremlin has deployed tens of thousands of ground troops near Russia\u2019s borders with Ukraine and has postured itself to rapidly increase that number , as well as sustain all of these forces during extended combat operations. The Russian military is also regularly demonstrating its air and naval capabilities in the region. This included sending a pair of Tu-22M3 bombers on a patrol over neighboring Belarus , which is embroiled in a separate crisis with its European neighbors to the west, this weekend. Last week, the Russian government also put out a pair of draft security agreements that included a list of impossible demands for the United States and NATO in order to defuse tensions with Ukraine. U.S. Senator Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and the top member of his party on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, derided the proposals as \u201ctrying to create a pretext for war.\u201d With all this in mind, the Pentagon team that recently went to Ukraine is undoubtedly aware of the importance of bolstering Ukraine\u2019s air and missile defense capabilities and doing so as quickly as possible. At the same time, their conclusions and recommendations will have into account the various realities that limit what the U.S. government can realistically do in the near term.

The incident came at a moment of acute tension between the two countries, with Ukraine saying it fears a possible Russian invasion and Moscow denying it has any such plan. Sign up here. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had made arrests in 37 of Russia's more than 80 regions and that two of those held had planned attacks on educational institutions. An FSB statement identified the alleged group as the MKU, which state television said stood for the words \"Maniacs. Cult of Murder\". The FSB said the group was set up by a Ukrainian under the patronage of Ukraine's intelligence services. Ukraine's SBU security service said: \"The current statements of the FSB are part of a coordinated information operation which should only be viewed through the prism of hybrid warfare.\" It said in a written comment to Reuters that the FSB was playing to a Russian domestic audience and trying to discredit it. Russia has aimed a barrage of hostile rhetoric at Kyiv in recent weeks as Ukraine, the United States and Western capitals have raised fears over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine and the possibility of an invasion. Moscow has denied planning an attack and blamed Ukraine and NATO for stoking tensions, demanding assurances from the U.S.-led alliance that it will not grant membership to Kyiv. Washington has said it believes Russia may be planning to use alleged \"provocations\" by Ukraine to justify military aggression. Mutual recriminations between Russia and Ukraine have been rising for weeks. Ukraine last month accused Russia of being behind an alleged coup plot against President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which the Kremlin denied. Russia said on Dec. 2 it had arrested three suspected Ukrainian intelligence agents, including one accused of planning to carry out an attack using two homemade bombs, allegations that Kyiv dismissed as trumped up.

Another four people are being treated for severe burns following the blaze in Kosiv, western Ukraine, on Tuesday. According to officials, it began when a candle was lit by a member of staff near five oxygen concentrators - which instantly caught fire. It is the latest in a number of deadly hospital fires during the pandemic. Pure oxygen in high-pressure cylinders which are commonly found in hospitals - and have been heavily relied on to treat Covid-19 patients - is very reactive and can cause spontaneous fires that are difficult to put out. Local emergency services said that \"ignorance of the elementary laws of physics and disregard for safety rules have led to irreparable losses\". The local prosecutors office is investigating the incident, Interfax news agency reported. According to a statement, the people who died were two women and a man, while three doctors suffered burns. Oxygen cylinders are believed to have been a factor in a number of hospital fires during the Covid-19 pandemic - both in Ukraine and elsewhere. In February, there were two deadly hospital fires in Ukraine. Meanwhile, in September, at least 14 people were killed in North Macedonia after fire engulfed a makeshift hospital treating coronavirus patients. At the time, officials said they suspected oxygen cylinders had exploded. Last December, 10 people died in a fire at Gaziantep in Turkey, and a similar blaze claimed 10 lives in Peatra Niamt in Romania in November 2020.

{"year":"2017","month":"03","event_desc":"Murder of Denis Voronenkov in Kyiv.","text":"Ukraine This article is more than 2 years old Denis Voronenkov: ex-Russian MP who fled to Ukraine killed in Kiev This article is more than 2 years old Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman dismisses claims that Moscow is linked to the killing of Kremlin critic who left Russia last year and renounced citizenship Shaun Walker in Moscow Thu 23 Mar 2017 14.20\u00a0EDT First published on Thu 23 Mar 2017 07.24\u00a0EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Denis Voronenkov who was shot dead outside an upmarket hotel in central Kiev.\nPhotograph: Oleksandr Synytsia\/AP A former Russian MP who had fled to Ukraine was shot dead on a busy street in central Kiev on Thursday. Denis Voronenkov, who had spoken out against Vladimir Putin and Kremlin policies, was shot three times outside the upmarket Premier Palace hotel. Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro Poroshenko, quickly pointed the finger at Russian authorities, calling the killing an act of \u201cstate terrorism\u201d. Kiev\u2019s head of police said Voronenkov, who had been granted Ukrainian citizenship after he fled in 2016, was shot three or four times in the head and neck and died at the scene. A firefight broke out between Voronenkov\u2019s bodyguard, believed to have been provided by the Ukrainian security services, and the assassin. Both were wounded and taken to hospital, where the assassin died a few hours later. The former MP, 45, had been a member of Russia\u2019s Communist party. His wife, the opera singer Maria Maksakova, was an MP with the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. She reportedly fled to Ukraine with her husband five months ago. \u201cHe told me he was receiving threats from the FSB,\u201d Ilya Ponomarev, another former MP who has also fled Russia, told the Guardian by telephone from Kiev. \u201cTo be honest, I had thought he was being a bit paranoid.\u201d He added that Voronenkov had asked Ukrainian security services for armed protection after receiving the threats. Ponomarev said he had been speaking to Voronenkov every day recently and had been due to meet him on Thursday morning. After meeting Ponomarev, Voronenkov was apparently planning to give evidence in a case against Ukraine\u2019s former president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after the Maidan revolution in 2014. In the aftermath of the uprising, Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatist forces in east Ukraine in a war that has killed 10,000 people. After fleeing to Kiev, Voronenkov claimed he had supported the annexation of Crimea as an MP because of political pressure. Senior Ukrainian officials quickly painted the killing as a Kremlin plot, with the prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, writing on Facebook that it was \u201ctypical public Kremlin punishment of a witness\u201d. Lutsenko said Voronenkov had already given testimony that implicated Yanukovych in providing cover for Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Poroshenko released a statement saying Voronenkov was one of the \u201cmain witnesses of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and, in particular, the role of Yanukovych regarding the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine\u201d. Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was absurd to look for a link to Moscow in the killing. The foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the \u201ckiller regime\u201d in Kiev \u201cwill do its best to make sure that no one will ever know the truth about what happened\u201d. Voronenkov had spoken about the possibility of retribution from Russia after he fled , but said he refused to go into hiding. He gave a number of interviews after his defection that were sharply critical of the Russian president and Kremlin policy in Ukraine. He compared modern Russia to Nazi Germany and called the annexation of Crimea illegal. \u201cI believe that whatever will happen will happen. I don\u2019t intend to hide,\u201d he said in a recent television interview . He said he believed the Ukrainian security services were able to keep him safe. In an interview with the Washington Post this week, he said he and his wife were considered traitors in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine we will be forgiven,\u201d he said. Voronenkov had been put on a Russian wanted list in connection with an alleged $5m (\u00a34m) property fraud. Earlier this month, a Moscow court sanctioned his arrest in absentia. The anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny released a video after Voronenkov\u2019s flight to Kiev last October calling the former MP a hypocrite who had engaged in corrupt dealings and enthusiastically backed Putin before fleeing. Tweets Voronenkov posted in 2014 gloated over the annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin-backed uprising in east Ukraine. Many Ukrainians were sharply critical of the decision to award citizenship to an MP from Russia who had voted to annex Crimea and suggested he may have changed his views to win citizenship and flee his troubles with the law in Russia. Ponomarev, who was the only member of Russia\u2019s Duma to vote against the annexation of Crimea, said this was unfair: \u201cTo be honest, I think he was never that interested in high politics and decisions like Crimea. Nobody is perfect, but I don\u2019t think he was engaged in serious corruption. He was doing some investigations and was very dangerous for the FSB.\u201d Ukrainian security services said they would be offering protection to Ponomarev and Voronenkov\u2019s wife Maksakova in the aftermath of the killing. Maksakova arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and was escorted away. The couple were raising an infant son. Separately, in the early hours of Thursday, an explosion at an ammunitions depot in east Ukraine caused a huge fire and prompted the evacuation of more than 20,000 people. Ukrainian authorities said the explosion was sabotage and Poroshenko said \u201cit is no coincidence\u201d that the explosion and Voronenkov\u2019s killing came on the same day, although he offered no evidence linking the events.

{"year":"2023","month":"01","event_desc":"Two British aid workers are killed during a humanitarian evacuation from Soledar in Donetsk Oblast.","text":"Ukraine: Chris Parry and Andrew Bagshaw killed in Soledar rescue attempt 25 January 2023 Share Save Andre Rhoden-Paul BBC News Share Save Watch: Archive video shows Chris Parry and Andrew Bagshaw British nationals Chris Parry and Andrew Bagshaw, who were reported missing in eastern Ukraine, have been killed, their families have said. Mr Bagshaw, 47, and Mr Parry, 28, were last seen heading to the city of Soledar on 6 January. Mr Bagshaw's family said the pair were attempting to rescue an elderly woman when their cars were hit by a shell. The family of Mr Parry said the men had died while \"attempting a humanitarian evacuation\". Earlier this month, the Russian mercenary group Wagner claimed the body of one of the men had been found. Soledar had been the focus of intense fighting and earlier this month Russia's military claimed to have captured the Ukrainian salt-mine time town after a long battle. In a statement issued by the UK Foreign Office, Rob, Christine and Katy Parry wrote: \"It is with great sadness we have to announce that our beloved Chrissy has been killed along with his colleague Andrew Bagshaw whilst attempting a humanitarian evacuation from Soledar, eastern Ukraine.\" Piecing together last known movements of missing Brits in Ukraine 'Sometimes it's better to step back, then crush the enemy' Speaking of Mr Parry, originally from Truro in Cornwall, they said: \"His selfless determination in helping the old, young and disadvantaged there has made us and his larger family extremely proud. We never imagined we would be saying goodbye to Chris when he had such a full life ahead of him. He was a caring son, fantastic brother, a best friend to so many and a loving partner to Olga. \"Chris was a confident, outward looking and adventurous young man who was loyal to everyone he knew. He lived and worked away as a software engineer but Cornwall was always his home. He loved rock climbing, cycling, running and skydiving and wanted to travel the world. \"He found himself drawn to Ukraine in March in its darkest hour at the start of the Russian invasion and helped those most in need, saving over 400 lives plus many abandoned animals. \"It is impossible to put into words how much he will be missed but he will forever be in our hearts. \"We feel so privileged that he chose our family to be part of.\" Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw had been in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine doing voluntary work. Scientific researcher Mr Bagshaw was a British national but lived in New Zealand. He had been a volunteer in Ukraine since April. His parents, Dame Sue and Prof Phil Bagshaw, said the men had been delivering food and medicines and helping the elderly. Chris Parry spoke to BBC Cornwall on 2 January In a statement released via news outlets they said Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw \"were attempting to rescue an elderly woman from Soledar, in an area of intense military action, when their car was hit by an artillery shell. \"Andrew selflessly took many personal risks and saved many lives; we love him and are very proud indeed of what he did.\" They added: \"The world needs to be strong and stand with Ukraine, giving them the military support they need now, and help to rebuild their shattered country after the war.\" Belgian journalist, Arnaud de Decker, who interviewed the pair three days before they went missing, described the evacuations they were carrying out in Ukraine as \"one of the most dangerous jobs you could do right now\". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the journalist said Mr Parry had just returned from an evacuation mission and \"seemed very experienced\". \"He saved a lot of lives\", said Mr Decker, adding that Mr Parry's actions were \"truly heroic\". Mr Parry's last words on camera were \"as long as people are willing to be evacuated, I will be ready to go\", Mr Decker told the BBC. \"I think you can only conclude one thing, that's a very inspiring personality - I'm sure that the family must be very proud of the actions of Chris.\" The Foreign Office has previously warned against all travel to Ukraine, saying there is \"a real risk to life\". British nationals still in Ukraine should leave immediately if it is safe to do so, it said. Ukraine's airspace is closed and for those in the vicinity of military activity, the Foreign Office has advised people to stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments. Mr Parry previously spoke to BBC Radio Cornwall on 2 January from the Bakhmut area in eastern Ukraine. Explaining his motivation for being there, he said he wanted to help children in particular. \"To be able to get them out of these war-torn areas, it makes it definitely more worthwhile than anything else that I can imagine,\" he said.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he had revoked the citizenship of Viktor Medvedchuk, once seen as Russian leader Vladimir Putin's top ally in Kyiv and accused of high treason. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. (Photo by Mandel NGAN\/AFP) Medvedchuk, a former Ukrainian lawmaker who was handed over to Russia in a prisoner exchange last September, was stripped of his citizenship along with three others, Zelensky said in his daily address. Based on materials prepared by Ukraine's security and state migration services and in accordance with the constitution, \"I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons,\" Zelensky said. He said the actions were appropriate for those who \"choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine\". Zelensky also warned that these would not be \"the last such decisions.\" Medvedchuk was one of more than 50 prisoners handed over to Russia in September in exchange for 215 Ukrainian imprisoned soldiers. The swap was the biggest exchange between the warring sides since the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian tycoon was captured in April last year by Ukraine's special services, after fleeing home arrest when Russia invaded. The super-rich powerbroker -- once dubbed the \"dark prince\" of Ukrainian politics -- was accused of high treason and attempting to steal natural resources from Russia-annexed Crimea and of handing Ukrainian military secrets to Moscow. The others to lose their Ukrainian citizenship include Andriy Derkach -- an alleged Russian agent and wealthy former member of the Ukraine parliament. In June Derkach was accused by the Ukrainian government of supporting Russia's invasion and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The US Justice Department has said Derkach also took part in an effort to smear President Joe Biden over his son Hunter Biden's Ukraine ties. Another to lose their Ukrainian citizenship, Taras Kozak, has been accused by the United States of being involved in operations by Russia's FSB intelligence service to undermine the Ukrainian government and economy. Renat Kuzmin, also a Ukrainian politician suspected of links with Russia, was the fourth man Zelensky said would be stripped of his citizenship.

But every time I talk to Ukrainska Pravda something really happens, it\u2019s an interesting sign.\u201d Budanov, now 37, was appointed by Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his job running Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence agency on Aug. 5, 2020. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov attends the funeral ceremony held for the victims of a helicopter crash in the city of Brovary, on Jan. 21, 2023, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Mustafa Ciftci\/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) A veteran of the simmering eight-year conflict with Russia that preceded the full-scale invasion, Budanov began serving in the Donbas region shortly after Russia and its separatist allies there began attacking in 2014. He was wounded twice in that fighting, once in 2015 and again a year later while on missions for the special operations forces GUR. Given his position and close relationship with Zelensky, Budanov has been a frequent target of assassination attempts. In 2019, a bomb was placed under his car but detonated prematurely and there have been at least 10 assassination attempts, a source close to Budanov recently told The Washington Post . \u201cBeing marked for death has led him to live a cautious personal existence, but risky operations are still in his wheelhouse,\u201d the newspaper reported. \u201cBudanov lives at his office. He rarely goes out in public. Classical music plays round-the-clock in his office \u2014 perhaps a defense against any attempts to listen in on what is said inside.\u201d The head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, Maj. Gen.  Kyrylo Budanov at his office (Photo by Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Back in November 2021, Budanov predicted the basic nature and timing of Russia\u2019s full-on invasion. Moscow pushed back hard against his assessment, but then proved him right on Feb. 24 when it began what has been a devastating and deadly war on its smaller neighbor. Since then, Budanov has provided other valuable insights into Ukraine\u2019s efforts to fight back, including how Ukraine was striking the long, stalled column of military vehicles advancing toward Kyiv and how Ukraine hit a Russian transport ship in the port of Berdyansk with a ground-based missile. In October 2022, Budanov spoke to The War Zone for a wide-ranging hour-long discussion about when and how the war will end, whether the Russians will use nuclear weapons, when Ukraine will attempt to retake Crimea and much, much more. Budanov would take over at a key point in Ukraine\u2019s year-long defense against the full-on Russian invasion and be tasked with running a bureaucracy far bigger and more complex than the GUR, which is just one piece of the MoD. After being pushed back in the Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts, Russia is beginning to make incremental gains in the Donbas. On Friday, Budanov\u2019s spokesman reiterated the GUR assertion that the ongoing Russian push in the Donbas is a reaction to Vladimir Putin\u2019s order to recapture the entire territory by March. \u201cWe expect very active events in February-March,\u201d GUR spokesman Adrii Yusov said Friday, according to the GUR Telegram channel. \u201cPutin\u2019s task is to seize Donbas by March. Nothing will work. These dates have already been postponed many times. The intensity that we are currently observing in Donbas is an attempt to implement these plans.\u201d Meanwhile, as head of the defense ministry, Budanov would also oversee the implementation of new donated weapons systems into the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Many western allies have promised and in some cases already have delivered tanks, other armored vehicles, multiple launch rocket systems, air defense systems and a wide range of other weapons. And on Friday the U.S. announced it would send Ukraine an undisclosed number of Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB). The GLSDB has a range of around 94 miles, or 150 kilometers. That\u2019s roughly over double the range of the guided munitions fired by the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System ( MLRS ), and variants thereof, and the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ).\u00a0You can read more about how GBSDB will help Ukraine in our deep dive here . Combined, these weapons could help Ukraine realize its goal of retaking Crimea, something that Budanov told The War Zone will happen this year. But whether any of those weapons arrive in time to help with that, or even against a looming new Russian offensive the GUR has been warning about, remains to be seen. It will take months, if not a year, for Ukrainians to be trained on and provided with some of these items. Regardless, this job would be bigger than any Budanov has undertaken before. His nomination would be another sign of the level of confidence Zelensky has in his abilities. We will certainly keep an eye on this developing story.

Jordan Sivayavirojna\/U.S. Army via AP) By LOLITA C. BALDOR Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit A MILITARY BASE IN SOUTHEASTERN POLAND (AP) \u2014 The top U.S. military officer, Army Gen. Mark Milley, traveled to a site near the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday and talked with his Ukrainian counterpart face to face for the first time \u2014 a meeting underscoring the growing ties between the two militaries and coming at a critical time as Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine nears the one-year mark. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met for a couple of hours with Ukraine\u2019s chief military officer, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, at an undisclosed location in southeastern Poland. The two leaders have talked frequently about Ukraine\u2019s military needs and the state of the war over the past year but had never met. The meeting comes as the international community ramps up the military assistance to Ukraine , including expanded training of Ukrainian troops by the U.S. and the provision of a Patriot missile battery, tanks and increased air defense and other weapons systems by the U.S. and a coalition of European and other nations. It also marks a key time in the war. Ukraine\u2019s troops face fierce fighting in the eastern Donetsk province , where Russian forces \u2014 supplemented by thousands of private Wagner Group contractors \u2014 seek to turn the tide after a series of battlefield setbacks in recent months. RELATED COVERAGE Crimea is a focus of discussions to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so coveted In rare criticism of Putin, Trump urges the Russian leader to \u2018STOP!\u2019 after a deadly attack on Kyiv Photos: Kyiv pummeled by deadly Russian drone and missile strikes Army Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Milley, told two reporters traveling with the chairman that the two generals felt it was important to meet in person. The reporters did not accompany Milley to the meeting and, under conditions set by the military, agreed to not identify the military base in southeastern Poland where they were located. \u201cThese guys have been talking on a very regular basis for about a year now, and they\u2019ve gotten to know each other,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThey\u2019ve talked in detail about the defense that Ukraine is trying to do against Russia\u2019s aggression. And it\u2019s important \u2014 when you have two military professionals looking each other in the eye and talking about very, very important topics, there\u2019s a difference.\u201d Butler said there had been some hope that Zaluzhnyi would travel to Brussels for a meeting of NATO and other defense chiefs this week, but when it became clear on Monday that it would not happen, they quickly decided to meet in Poland, near the border. While a number of U.S. civilian leader s have gone into Ukraine, the Biden administration has made it clear that no uniformed military service members will go into Ukraine other than those connected to the embassy in Kyiv. Butler said only a small group \u2014 Milley and six of his senior staffers \u2014 traveled by car to the meeting. He said that the meeting will allow Milley to relay Zaluzhnyi\u2019s concerns and information to the other military leaders during the NATO chiefs\u2019 meeting. Milley, he said, will be able to \u201cdescribe the tactical and operational conditions on the battlefield and what the military needs are for that, and the way he does that is one by understanding it himself but by also talking to Zaluzhnyi on a regular basis.\u201d Milley also will be able to describe the new training of Ukrainian forces that the U.S. is doing at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany. The chairman, who got his first look at the new, so-called combined arms instruction during a nearly two-hour visit there on Monday, has said it will better prepare Ukrainian troops to launch an offensive or counter any surge in Russian attacks. More than 600 Ukrainian troops began the expanded training program at the camp just a day before Milley arrived. Milley and Zaluzhnyi\u2019s meeting kicks off a series of high-level gatherings of military and defense leaders this week. Milley and other chiefs of defense will meet in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday, and then the so-called Ukraine Contact Group will gather at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Thursday and Friday. That group consists of about 50 top defense officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and they work to coordinate military contributions to Ukraine. The meetings are expected to focus on Ukraine\u2019s ongoing and future military needs as the hard-packed terrain of the winter months turns into muddy roads and fields in the spring. After several months of losing territory it had captured, Russia in recent days claimed it took control of the small salt-mining town of Soledar . Ukraine asserts that its troops are still fighting, but if Moscow\u2019s troops take control of Soledar it would allow them to inch closer to the bigger city of Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for months. And in a barrage of airstrikes over the weekend, Russia struck Kyiv, the northeastern city of Kharkiv and the southeastern city of Dnipro, where the death toll in one apartment building rose to 44. Western analysts point to signs that the Kremlin is digging in for a drawn-out war, and say the Russian military command is preparing for an expanded mobilization effort. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine .

A top adviser, four deputy ministers and five regional governors left their posts on Tuesday. Their departures come as Ukraine launches a broad anti-corruption drive. Recently, authorities have seen bribery claims, reports of officials buying food at inflated prices and one figure accused of living a lavish lifestyle. Senior aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Mr Zelensky was responding to a \"key public demand\" that justice should apply to everyone. The president has already banned state officials from leaving the country unless on authorised business. The first to resign on Tuesday was Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the president's deputy head of office, who oversaw regional policy and had earlier worked on Mr Zelensky's election campaign. After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February he became a frequent spokesperson for the government. He was accused by Ukrainian investigative journalists of using several expensive sports cars throughout the war - though denies any wrongdoing. In a Telegram post, he thanked Mr Zelensky for \"the opportunity to do good deeds every day and every minute\". Deputy Defence Minister Vyacheslav Shapovalov also resigned, following reports he oversaw the purchase of military food supplies at inflated prices from a relatively unknown firm. The department called this a \"technical mistake\" and claimed no money had changed hands. The defence minister himself - Oleksii Reznikov - has been under scrutiny for the same reason. A host of other top officials were dismissed on Tuesday, including: Deputy Prosecutor General Oleskiy Symonenko Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories Ivan Lukerya Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories Vyacheslav Negoda Deputy Minister for Social Policy Vitaliy Muzychenko And the regional governors of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Sumy and Kherson Ukraine has a history of corruption and in 2021 Transparency International ranked the country at 122 out of 180 countries in its ranking of corrupt states. A crackdown is one of the EU's key demands if the country is to advance its application to join the bloc. In an address on Sunday, Mr Zelensky promised there would be \"no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions\" used to live. His comments followed the arrest of Ukraine's Deputy Infrastructure Minister Vasyl Lozinskyi on Saturday on suspicion of accepting a bribe worth over $350,000 (\u00a3285,000) over the supply of electricity generators. He has denied the charges. David Arakhamia, the head of Mr Zelensky's Servant of the People party, has said that corrupt officials could face jail. \"Officials at all levels have been constantly warned through official and unofficial channels: focus on the war, help the victims, reduce bureaucracy and stop doing dubious business. \"Many of them have actually listened, but some, unfortunately, did not,\" he said in a Telegram statement. \"If it doesn't work in a civilised way, it will be done according to the laws of wartime.

Interior minister Denys Monastyrsky, deputy minister of internal affairs Yevhen Yenin, and state secretary of internal affairs Yurii Lubkovych are among those killed.","text":"Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy among 14 killed in helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv. At least 14 people, including Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, have been killed after a helicopter crashed in a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, according to Ukrainian emergency services. One child was among the dead and 25 others were wounded in Wednesday\u2019s incident. They were being treated in hospital, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU) said. A local official had earlier put the death toll at 18. There was no immediate official statement on the cause of the crash. Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly 11 months ago, has yet to comment. Here is what we know so far: The helicopter came down at about 8:20am local time (06:20 GMT) near a nursery and residential building in the town of Brovary, on the Ukrainian capital\u2019s northeastern outskirts. Videos shared on social media showed a burning building at the purported location where the helicopter crashed. People could be heard screaming in the footage. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, said the helicopter \u2013 which belonged to SESU \u2013 was flying towards front-line positions in the country\u2019s east when it crashed.  SESU said in a Facebook post that all nine people who were on board the helicopter had died in the crash. Four others, including a child, were also confirmed dead as of 3pm local time (13:00 GMT), SESU said. A further 25 people, including 11 children, were hospitalised with wounds sustained in the incident, the service added. Earlier, Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv region, had said 18 people were killed in the crash. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy, his deputy Yevhen Yenin and State Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Yurii Lubkovych were among those travelling on the helicopter. Monastyrskyy was in charge of the Ukrainian police and other emergency services. It was not immediately clear what had caused the helicopter to come down. Ukrainian officials did not provide an immediate explanation and made no reference to any Russian attack in the area at the time. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said authorities had launched an investigation into the incident. \u201cFor now, we are considering all possible versions of the helicopter crash accident,\u201d Kostin said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Ukrainian officials lamented the death toll from Wednesday\u2019s incident, which came just four days after a Russian missile attack on an apartment building in the central city of Dnipro killed 45 civilians, including six children. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the helicopter crash was a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d that had caused \u201cunspeakable\u201d pain. \u201cI have instructed the Security Service of Ukraine, in cooperation with the National Police of Ukraine and other authorised bodies, to find out all the circumstances of what happened,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram, hailing the interior ministry leadership team who lost their lives as \u201ctrue patriots\u201d of Ukraine. Prime Minister Denys Shmygal echoed Zelenskyy\u2019s message and described the death of Monastyrskyy as a \u201cgreat loss\u201d for Ukraine\u2019s government. \u201cMy sincere condolences to the families of all the victims,\u201d Shmygal said in a Telegram post. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Finland\u2019s Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto also called the crash \u201ca very tragic event\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad day,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. \u201cChildren are [also] involved in this accident and are in intensive care, so this is a very dramatic event.\u201d British Home Secretary Suella Braverman called Monastyrskyy \u201ca leading light in supporting the Ukrainian people during [Russian President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s illegal invasion\u201d. \u201cWhen we spoke in October I was struck by his determination, optimism and patriotism,\u201d she said on Twitter. Meanwhile, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in a statement she had sent her condolences to the Ukrainian government \u201cand offered Germany\u2019s support in identifying the causes of the helicopter crash\u201d.

This was stated by\u00a0the Father and Head of\u00a0the UGCC, His Beatitude Sviatoslav, on\u00a0the live broadcast of\u00a0\u201cLive TV,\u201d announcing the decision of\u00a0the Synod of\u00a0Bishops of\u00a0the UGCC in\u00a0Ukraine.

The UGCC in\u00a0Ukraine will switch from September 1, according to\u00a0the new style (beginning of\u00a0the Indictus) of\u00a0the Year of\u00a0our Lord 2023, to\u00a0a\u00a0new style for fixed holidays with the preservation of\u00a0the current Paschalia. B. For those parishes or\u00a0separate communities that feel they are not yet ready for such a\u00a0step (with the individual blessing of\u00a0the diocesan bishop), to\u00a0keep the possibility of\u00a0liturgical life according to\u00a0the Julian calendar for the period until the Year of\u00a0Our Lord 2025,\u201d says the 5 th resolution of\u00a093\u00a0rd\u00a0session of\u00a0the Synod of\u00a0Bishops of\u00a0the UGCC in\u00a0Ukraine, which took place on\u00a0February 1\u20132, 2023\u00a0in\u00a0Lviv-Bryukhovychi. According to\u00a0this decision, starting from September 1\u00a0this year, the UGCC in\u00a0Ukraine will celebrate all fixed feasts in\u00a0the new style. Primarily, Christmas\u00a0\u2014 on\u00a0December 25, Epiphany\u00a0\u2014 on\u00a0January 6, Annunciation of\u00a0the Blessed Virgin Mary\u00a0\u2014 on\u00a0March 25, Intercession of\u00a0the Blessed Virgin Mary\u00a0\u2014 on\u00a0October 1, St. Nicholas Day\u00a0\u2014 on\u00a0December 6, etc. \u201cI\u00a0would emphasize that it\u00a0is\u00a0not only Christmas! During the summits and preparations for our Synod, we\u00a0did not talk about Christmas but all the holidays that belong to\u00a0the fixed cycle. Because it\u00a0is\u00a0absolutely against any liturgical rules to\u00a0change the date of\u00a0celebration of\u00a0only one holiday, you cannot change the date of\u00a0Christmas, moving it\u00a0to\u00a0December 25, and leave all the others in\u00a0the old style,\u201d explained His Beatitude Sviatoslav. The transition to\u00a0the new style will take place on\u00a0September 1, which marks the beginning of\u00a0the new liturgical year. Parishes that are not yet ready for such a\u00a0step will have the opportunity, with the permission of\u00a0their bishop, to\u00a0celebrate fixed feasts in\u00a0the old style until September 2025 (Christmas\u00a0\u2014 January 7, Epiphany\u00a0\u2014 January 19, Annunciation\u00a0\u2014 April 7, etc.). \u201cFor those parishes or\u00a0separate communities that do\u00a0not feel ready for such a\u00a0step (with the individual blessing of\u00a0the diocesan bishop), to\u00a0keep the possibility of\u00a0liturgical life according to\u00a0the Julian calendar for the period until the year 2025,\u201d follows the 2\u00a0nd\u00a0paragraph of\u00a0the 5 th resolution of\u00a0the Synod. The UGCC in\u00a0Ukraine will celebrate Easter and all related holidays in\u00a0the old style, as\u00a0before. \u201cWe\u00a0are switching to\u00a0the new style only for fixed holidays. We\u00a0have decided to\u00a0leave Paschalia as\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0today. The actual Paschalia remains valid,\u201d said the Head of\u00a0the UGCC. According to\u00a0the Primate, the calendar reform of\u00a0the UGCC in\u00a0Ukraine will have two stages. The first step has already been taken. Regarding the celebration of\u00a0Easter, the bishops \u201cdecided to\u00a0wait for a\u00a0while.\u201d His Beatitude Sviatoslav explained that in\u00a02025\u00a0the 1700 th anniversary of\u00a0the First Council of\u00a0Nicaea would be\u00a0celebrated. In\u00a0preparation for this anniversary, collaborative work is\u00a0underway in\u00a0a\u00a0dialogue between Rome and Constantinople on\u00a0a\u00a0renewed Paschalia, according to\u00a0which all Christians will celebrate Easter on\u00a0the same day. The Head of\u00a0the UGCC noted that when the survey was conducted, the bishops decided that if\u00a0about 70\u00a0%\u00a0of\u00a0those support the decision to\u00a0reform, we\u00a0can move forward. \u201cBut it\u00a0turned out that there is\u00a0support for almost 90\u00a0%, which is\u00a0in\u00a0nearly every diocese. That is, the desire and need for the calendar reform were much more potent than we\u00a0could have hoped, and this is\u00a0good news,\u201d His Beatitude Sviatoslav emphasized asking all the faithful to\u00a0listen to\u00a0their Mother Church\u2019s voice and maintain unity and unanimity during the calendar reform.

The US president, closely surrounded by a large security detail, was escorted by his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on a walkabout around central Kyiv as air-raid sirens could be heard, confirming rumours of a visit that had been circulating during the morning. Biden arrived in Kyiv after a 10-hour train journey from the Polish border, a route taken by other international leaders before him, and after leaving Washington in secrecy with a small group of officials and a small pool of reporters. Arriving in the Ukrainian capital, Biden got a short first-hand taste of the terror that Ukrainians have lived with for close to a year as sirens sounded over the capital as he and Zelenskiy were exiting the gold-domed St Michael\u2019s Cathedral. In a post on his social media channels, Zelenskiy welcomed Biden to Kyiv posting a photograph of the two men standing in front of Ukrainian and US flags. \u201cJoseph Biden, welcome to Kyiv! Your visit is an extremely important sign of support for all Ukrainians,\u201d he said on Telegram . 1:16 Biden and Zelenskiy hug in Kyiv after paying tribute to fallen soldiers \u2013 video While US presidents have visited conflict areas before \u2013 including Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 it is unusual for presidents to visit an area not under US air control, making his trip more reminiscent of John F Kennedy\u2019s visit to Berlin in 1963 at the height of the cold war. While the specifics of Biden\u2019s visit remained unclear, it emerged that Washington had \u201cbasic communication with the Russians \u2026 to ensure deconfliction\u201d immediately before the visit to avoid a dangerous misjudgement, although officials were cagey about what information was passed on. Wearing a striped blue and yellow tie \u2013 the colours of Ukraine \u2013 Biden was filmed walking with Zelenskiy in Mikhailovsky Square and past the Mariinskyi Palace, the Ukrainian president\u2019s official residence. The visit came as it was disclosed that Biden would announce an additional $500m in military aid including artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems, and air surveillance radars in the coming days. The timing \u2013 before a planned address by Vladimir Putin \u2013 was seen as a deliberate rebuke of the Russian president. In a statement issued by the White House, Biden said he was in Kyiv to reaffirm the US\u2019s \u201cunwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine\u2019s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity\u201d. \u201cWhen Putin launched his invasion nearly one year ago, he thought Ukraine was weak and the west was divided,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong.\u201d View image in fullscreen Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Joe Biden in Kyiv on Monday. Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff\/AFP\/Getty Images Speaking later alongside Zelenskiy at Mariinsky Palace, Biden recalled the fears nearly a year ago that Russia\u2019s invasion forces might quickly take the Ukrainian capital. \u201cOne year later, Kyiv stands,\u201d Biden said, jamming his finger for emphasis. \u201cAnd Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.\u201d Zelenskiy said he and Biden spoke about \u201clong-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine, even though it wasn\u2019t supplied before\u201d. But he did not detail any new commitments. Amid tight security, and in a visit that appears to have been long in the planning, a number of key roads and central areas around the city were shut to traffic. Rumours were swirling in the run-up to Biden\u2019s planned Europe trip that he might meet Zelenskiy, either in Warsaw or at Poland\u2019s border with Ukraine. His visit to Kyiv, almost a year since the city was almost surrounded by Russian troops in the early days of the war, sends a strong signal of US support for Ukraine to Moscow and the international community, not least due to security concerns. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to a Jim La Porta of Rolling Stone magazine, who had become aware of the visit in advance and was asked to keep it under wraps, Biden had been presented with an \u201carray of plans\u201d for this Ukraine trip including meeting Zelenskiy at the Polish border or in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Biden, however, was reportedly insisted that he should visit Kyiv, which became a symbol of resistance in the early weeks of the war. Fighting continues in the east of Ukraine and Russia regularly carries out missile attacks beyond the frontlines. On New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day several missiles hit civilian buildings and houses in Kyiv, killing at least five people and injuring dozens more. Several major roads in the city centre were blocked off and a long motorcade of minibuses and armoured vehicles was filmed driving into the area. Biden\u2019s trip came as EU foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss jointly procuring ammunition to provide to Ukraine. \u201cIt is the most urgent issue. If we fail on that, the result of the war is in danger,\u201d the EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said before the meeting. Politico reported on Sunday that the Biden administration was pressuring Ukraine to \u201cconsolidate its gains and perhaps launch its own counterstrike\u201d as western analysts and officials said Russia was unable to launch a large-scale or surprise counteroffensive of its own. Zelenskiy pushed for more western aid to speed up the war at the Munich security conference over the weekend, where western politicians expressed their continued support for Ukraine but failed to rally the global south behind the cause. Meanwhile, the US said China may be on the brink of supplying Russia with military aid.

Issued on: 08\/02\/2023 - 14:41 Modified: 08\/02\/2023 - 14:56 3 min France's President Emmanuel Macron (L) welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky upon his arrival at the Elysee presidential palace for a meeting with France's President and German Chancellor in Paris, on 8 February, 2023. AFP - EMMANUEL DUNAND By: RFI Follow Advertising Read more UPDATE: 21:30 GMT (Paris+1:00) Zelensky touched down at Paris Orly airport aboard a UK government plane from London. He was due to hold a late dinner meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, joined by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. According to an interview in the right-leaning Le Figaro , Zelensky believes Macron has undergone a significant change on his stance towards Ukraine after seeking to keep channels open to Russia in the early phase of the conflict. During the visit,\u00a0Macron presented Zelensky with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, the highest distinction a French president can bestow on another head of state. Zelensky earlier held talks with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and King Charles III following an address to the UK parliament on what is only his second overseas trip since the war began. \"The United Kingdom was one of the first to come to Ukraine's aid,\" Zelensky said on social media, adding he wanted to \"personally thank\" the British people. The UK government said it would offer advanced training for Ukrainian fighter jet pilots and marines, as Western allies debate stepping up military aid for Kyiv against a feared new Russian offensive in the east . British MPs applauded Zelensky as he addressed members of the lower and upper houses in the UK parliament's ancient Westminster Hall. The Ukrainian president thanked the UK for its support and pledged that \"freedom will win\".

Accept Manage my choices 'Ukraine belongs to Europe' Meanwhile, Britain announced a fresh round of sanctions targeting organisations relied on by the Russian military, yet\u00a0Putin remains defiant. Updated maps of Russia have reportedly gone on sale in Moscow bookstores that include four annexed Ukrainian regions: Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Lugansk and Donetsk. Putin regularly refers to them as \"our historical lands\". Ahead of the 24 February anniversary of Russia's invasion, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was clear that Moscow would not win and assured Ukraine its future was in the EU. \"Putin will not achieve his goals \u2013 not on the battlefield and not through a dictated peace. That much, at least, is certain after a year of war,\" Scholz said in a speech to parliament. \"Ukraine belongs to Europe, its future lies in the European Union. And this promise holds true,\" Scholz said. EU promises continued support for Ukraine at Kyiv summit EU says it will train double the number of Ukrainian soldiers NATO fighter jets After the Downing Street talks and his speech in parliament's historic Westminster Hall, Zelensky is due to join Sunak on a visit to Ukrainian troops receiving military training in southwest England. Britain has already trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops \"to battle readiness\" over the past six months and will train a further 20,000 this year. The training will \"ensure pilots are able to fly sophisticated NATO-standard fighter jets in the future,\" although Western countries have so far ruled out sending jets themselves. On Tuesday, Moscow said that Russian forces were advancing towards Bakhmut and Vugledar \u2013 two key centres of fighting in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, now the flashpoint of the war. This comes as Zelensky is makes a stop-over in Paris this evening, ahead of going to Brussels on Thursday to meet with EU leaders ,\u00a0as the European Union has committed to finding a way to fast-track Ukraine's accession to the bloc.

(Russian Presidential Press Office via AP) Read More By Karl Ritter Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the occupied port city of Mariupol , his first trip to Ukrainian territory that Moscow illegally annexed in September and a show of defiance after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest on war crimes charges. Putin arrived in Mariupol late Saturday after visiting Crimea , southwest of Mariupol, to mark the ninth anniversary of the Black Sea peninsula\u2019s annexation from Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Sunday. He was shown chatting with Mariupol residents and visiting an art school and a children\u2019s center in Sevastopol, Crimea. Mariupol became a worldwide symbol of resistance after outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian forces held out in a steel mill there for nearly three months before Moscow finally took control of it in May. Much of the city was pounded to rubble by Russian shelling. Putin has not commented on the arrest warrant, which deepened his international isolation despite the unlikelihood of him facing trial anytime soon. The Kremlin, which does not recognize the authority of the ICC, has rejected its move as \u201clegally null and void.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Crimea is a focus of discussions to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so coveted In rare criticism of Putin, Trump urges the Russian leader to \u2018STOP!\u2019 after a deadly attack on Kyiv Photos: Kyiv pummeled by deadly Russian drone and missile strikes The surprise trip also came ahead of a planned visit to Moscow by Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, expected to provide a major diplomatic boost to Putin in his confrontation with the West. In an essay published Monday in the People\u2019s Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee, Putin said: \u201cWe are grateful for the balanced line (of China) in connection with the events taking place in Ukraine, for understanding their background and true causes. We welcome China\u2019s willingness to play a constructive role in resolving the crisis.\u201d China in February released a position paper calling for an end to fighting in Ukraine and for upholding all countries\u2019 sovereignty and territorial integrity. It did not address how to resolve Russia\u2019s illegal claim to have annexed four regions of Ukraine. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that any call for a cease-fire in Ukraine coming out of the Putin-Xi meeting would be unacceptable to the U.S. because it would only \u201cratify Russian\u2019s conquest to date,\u201d and give Moscow \u201ctime to refit, retrain, re-man and try to plan for a renewed offensive.\u201d Putin arrived in Mariupol by helicopter and then drove himself around the city\u2019s \u201cmemorial sites,\u201d concert hall and coastline, Russian news reports said. The state Rossiya 24 channel on Sunday showed Putin chatting with locals outside what looked like a newly built residential complex, and being shown around one of the apartments. Following his trip to Mariupol, Putin met with Russian military leaders and troops at a command post in Rostov-on-Don, a southern Russian city some 180 kilometers (about 112 miles) farther east, and conferred with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who is in charge of the Russian military operations in Ukraine. Peskov said. Peskov said the trip had been unannounced, and that Putin intended to \u201cinspect the work of the (command) post in its ordinary mode of operation.\u201d Speaking to the state RIA-Novosti agency, Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made clear that Russia was in Mariupol to stay. He said the government hoped to finish the reconstruction of its blasted downtown by the end of the year. \u201cPeople have started to return. When they saw that reconstruction is underway, people started actively returning,\u201d Khusnullin told RIA. Mykhailo Podolyak, chief of staff for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, heaped scorn on Putin\u2019s trip to Mariupol. \u201cThe criminal is always drawn to the crime scene,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the countries of the civilized world are announcing the arrest of the \u2018war director\u2019 in the event of crossing the border, the organizer of the murders of thousands of Mariupol families came to admire the ruins of the city and mass graves.\u201d When Moscow fully captured the city in May, an estimated 100,000 people remained, out of a prewar population of 450,000. Many were trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings. Mariupol\u2019s plight first came into international focus with a Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital on March 9, 2022, less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine began. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in the bombing of a theater being used as the city\u2019s largest bomb shelter. Evidence obtained by The Associated Press suggested the real death toll could be closer to 600 . A small group of Ukrainian fighters held out for 83 days in the sprawling Azovstal steel works in eastern Mariupol before surrendering, their dogged defense tying down Russian forces and coming to symbolize Ukrainian tenacity in the face of Moscow\u2019s aggression. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world denounced as illegal, and moved in September to officially claim four regions in Ukraine\u2019s south and east as Russian territory, following referendums that Kyiv and the West described as a sham. The ICC on Friday accused Putin of bearing personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. U.N. investigators also said there was evidence for the forced transfer of \u201chundreds\u201d of Ukrainian children to Russia. According to Ukrainian government figures, over 16,000 children have been deported to Russian-controlled territories or Russia itself, many of them from Mariupol. While the ICC\u2019s move was welcomed by Kyiv, the chances of Putin facing trial are slim because Moscow does not recognize the court\u2019s jurisdiction or extradite its nationals. Ukrainian officials reported Sunday that at least three civilians had been killed and 19 wounded by Russian shelling in the previous 24 hours. The deaths were in the eastern Donetsk region, amid fierce battles for control of the city of Bakhmut, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko on Ukrainian TV. Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said in a Telegram update that a 51-year-old woman was \u201cfighting for her life\u201d after being hit by shrapnel as Russian troops fired on the border town of Dvorichna. Top Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak said Ukrainian troops were holding the line near Bakhmut, a key target of a long, grinding Russian offensive, adding that the enemy\u2019s plan to occupy the city \u201care now foundering.\u201d The spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s eastern forces said Russian troops are \u201ctactically unable to complete\u201d Bakhmut\u2019s capture. \u201cYes, there are very active battles, (the Russians) continue to carry out several dozen attacks by inertia, but they suffer huge losses,\u201d Serhii Cherevaty said on Ukrainian TV, adding that Ukrainian defenses are \u201cbleeding the enemy, breaking his fighting spirit.\u201d Taking Bakhmut would give the Kremlin a battlefield victory after months of setbacks, and could pave the way for Russia to threaten other Ukrainian strongholds in the region, including Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Russian forces shelled a house in Bilozerka, a suburb west of the southern city of Kherson, and a woman who was pulled from the rubble was hospitalized, according to the Kherson regional military administration, writing on Telegram. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine","question":"What was the purpose of Putin's visit to Mariupol in March 2023?","answer":"Putin's visit to Mariupol was seen as a show of defiance following an International Criminal Court arrest warrant against him for war crimes, and it aimed to reinforce Russia's claim over the annexed Ukrainian territory.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0456\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0443 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0456\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0443 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0456 2023 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0412\u0456\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0456\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0446\u0456\u043d\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0432\u0441\u044f \u044f\u043a \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0456 \u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0442 \u041c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0454\u043d\u043d\u0456 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438, \u0456 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u044e \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0456\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0443 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044e.","model_answer":"Answer: \u041c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u044e \u0432\u0456\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0443 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0456\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0443 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0456 2023 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0443 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043c \u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0456\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0456\u0437\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0456\u044e \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0439. \u0412\u0456\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u043c\u0430\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0448\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0457 \u0430\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0438 \"\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\" \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c, \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0456\u044f\u043c\u0438.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer aligns with the expected answer in terms of demonstrating Russia's control over the occupied city, supporting Russian military, and legitimizing the annexation of Ukrainian territories.

Hanna Arhirova, Associated Press Hanna Arhirova, Associated Press Leave your feedback KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 More than 100 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been released as part of a major Easter exchange with Russia, a top official said Sunday, as Orthodox Ukrainians marked the holiday for a second time since Moscow unleashed its\u00a0full-scale war\u00a0more than a year ago. While celebrations were subdued because of security risks, with a curfew barring the faithful from customary all-night services, Ukrainian authorities and ordinary people shared messages of hope, linking the story of Jesus\u2019 resurrection to their longing for peace and a Ukrainian victory. Dozens of families had special reasons to rejoice, as presidential adviser Andriy Yermak announced that 130 soldiers, sailors, border guards and others captured by Moscow were on their way back home following a \u201cbig Easter prisoner exchange.\u201d Yermak said in a Telegram post on Sunday that those released included troops who fought near Bakhmut, the eastern mining city which has for months been the focus of Russia\u2019s grinding offensive. \u201cThe lives of our people are the highest value for us,\u201d Yermak said, adding that Kyiv\u2019s goal was to bring back all remaining POWs. There was no immediate information on how many Russian prisoners were released, but the press service of the founder of the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-affiliated paramilitary force whose fighters are prominent in eastern Ukraine, also released a video Sunday showing Ukrainian prisoners of war being readied for an exchange. READ MORE: Ukraine, Russia send home around 200 total troops in prisoner swap In his Easter address released on Sunday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the holiday as marking \u201cthe victory of good, the victory of truth, the victory of life,\u201d and he stressed what he said was Ukrainian unity in the face of Russian aggression. \u201cBelief in victory unites all of us always, and especially today. At Easter, which from time immemorial has been a family holiday for Ukrainians, a day of warmth, hope and great unity. We are one big family \u2014 Ukrainians. We have one big home \u2014 Ukraine. We have one big goal \u2014 victory for all,\u201d Zelenskyy said. In central Kyiv, people gathered in the courtyard of the landmark St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery on Sunday morning to have their Easter eggs and baskets of food blessed by a priest. A curfew had prevented most from attending the traditional all-night service there hours earlier, with many tuning into a live stream instead. Ukrainian churches are usually crowded on Orthodox Easter Sunday. But this year, the wide courtyard was barely half full, and the line of people waiting for the priest to sprinkle holy water on their adorned baskets was moving briskly. For a second year in a row, the war interrupted holiday routines. Ukraine\u2019s main security service this week issued a statement urging residents not to linger in churches on Sunday, in order to avoid crowding and minimize security risks. Alla Voronina, one of the people who came to St. Michael\u2019s with baskets containing Easter cakes and multi-colored eggs, said that the restrictions were \u201cvery hard\u201d on residents\u2019 morale. \u201cYou constantly recall how it used to be before the war,\u201d she told The Associated Press. She said that she and her family would nevertheless follow the security recommendations and go straight home after receiving the blessing. Another worshipper, Tetiana Voloshyna, said she was praying for Ukrainian troops \u201cwho defend us and make it possible for us to have this holiday.\u201d She added she had come to the monastery with her \u201cpersonal pain and personal requests to God for victory, peace and life.\u201d Russians also observed Easter, including President Vladimir Putin. He attended midnight services in Moscow\u2019s Christ the Savior Cathedral that were led by Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Kirill, who has firmly supported the war. READ MORE: Russian attacks continue across Ukraine amid Easter pleas for peace In a statement, Putin commended Kirill for \u201ctireless, selfless work aimed at preserving enduring historical, spiritual, moral and family values, the upbringing and education of the youth.\u201d Kirill has repeatedly spoken out in support of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In a video message broadcast on Russian state television late Saturday, before the start of the Easter service in Moscow, Kirill lamented \u201cgrave events taking place on our Russian historical land\u201d in reference to the war, echoing the Kremlin\u2019s claim that an independent Ukraine is essentially a fiction. Despite the shared Orthodox holiday, Russian shelling and missile attacks continued to sow destruction in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian regional officials. Officials in the country\u2019s south and east said that churches had not been spared. The governor of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, Serhii Lysak, said Russian forces stationed at Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant shelled a church in a nearby town, wounding two civilians. \u201cThe Russians have once again confirmed that they hold nothing sacred,\u201d Lysak said in his post. Earlier on Sunday, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia province reported that Russian shelling overnight hit an Orthodox church in the town of Komyshuvakha. Photos showed local residents rescuing icons from the church, its gutted frame visible in the background. At least four civilians were killed and eight others were wounded on Saturday and overnight, Ukrainian officials reported on Sunday morning. The national emergencies service said the death toll in a Friday attack on the city of Sloviansk rose to 13 as more bodies were found in the rubble of an apartment building. Across the front line, in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine\u2019s industrial east, the Kremlin-appointed head of the Donetsk region claimed that a Ukrainian strike killed one civilian and wounded six others in the province\u2019s namesake capital. Denis Pushilin wrote in a Telegram post that shelling hit the center of the city, near its Holy Transfiguration cathedral. The Russian defense ministry on Sunday announced that assault units from the Wagner group have captured two neighborhoods in the embattled city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut, a former mining hub now largely reduced to ruins, has been a key target of Russia\u2019s monthslong grinding campaign in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine's armed forces said in an evening update that Russian forces fired more than 100 missiles throughout the country and staged 12 air and 20 shelling attacks. The Facebook post said 61 cruise missiles were destroyed. Sign up here. Energy Minister German Galushchenko said Russia had hit power facilities in six regions with missiles and drones, causing blackouts across most of Ukraine. In Washington, the White House said President Joe Biden would travel to Poland from Feb. 20-22 to show support for Kyiv ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 and make clear additional security assistance and aid will be coming from the United States. \"The president will make it very clear that the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" said John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council. International Monetary Fund staff will meet with Ukrainian officials in Warsaw next week, a source familiar with the plans said on Friday, as Ukraine presses for a multi-billion dollar borrowing program to cover its funding needs given Russia's war. Global ratings agency Moody's on Friday downgraded Ukraine's sovereign rating to Ca as it expects the war with Russia to create long-lasting challenges for the country. Moody's website said the rating means debt obligations are \"likely in, or very near, default.\" The latest Russian attacks came as Zelenskiy ended a tour of European allies where he was enthusiastically received but secured no public promises of the fighter jets he sought. \"London, Paris, Brussels - everywhere I spoke these past few days about how to strengthen our soldiers. There are very important understandings and we received good signals,\" he said in his nightly video address. \"This concerns long-range missiles and tanks and the next level of our cooperation - fighter aircraft.\" Russia has repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure far from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat or water for days at a time in the middle of winter. The barrages have often followed Ukrainian diplomatic or battlefield advances. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 10 Russian missiles had been shot down over the capital after sirens blared during the morning rush hour and weary civilians took shelter. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine was without 44% of nuclear generation and 75% of thermal power capacity.

Russia denies targeting civilians and says it targets Kyiv's war effort. Ukraine has been bracing for a new Russian offensive, believing that after months of reverses President Vladimir Putin wants to tout a battlefield success before the anniversary of his Feb. 24 invasion. Ukrainian governors in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk said that thrust had begun. Putin will give his delayed annual showcase address to parliament on Feb. 21, the date last year when he recognised as independent the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk that were controlled by Russian-backed separatists, a prelude to invading. The complete capture of those provinces, among four Russia subsequently claimed to have annexed, would let Putin assert that one of his main priorities had been achieved. RUSSIAN ADVANCES Moscow's main recent focus has been Bakhmut, a small city from which most of the pre-war population of around 70,000 has fled, and the Ukranian military said it and surrounding areas had come under fresh tank, mortar and artillery fire. After months of static artillery battles both sides call the \"meat grinder\", Russian forces have begun to encircle the city. Their troops include the Wagner private army that has recruited tens of thousands of convicts with a promise of pardons. Russia's regular army is now also able to deploy many of the 300,000 or more men enlisted in a forced mobilisation late last year. Britain's Defence Ministry said Wagner forces appeared to have advanced 2 to 3 kilometres (1 to 2 miles) around the north of Bakhmut since Tuesday - a rapid push in a battle where front lines have barely moved for months. It said they were now threatening the main western access road to Bakhmut although a Ukrainian military analyst said supplies were still getting through. Britain also said Russian forces had made some advances near Vuhledar, a Ukrainian-held bastion that has been a linchpin between the southern and eastern fronts, but the limited Russian gains there had likely come at a high cost, including at least 30 armoured vehicles abandoned in one failed assault. Ukrainian positions in Vuhledar have held since the war started and this week's assault has been branded as a costly fiasco by some pro-war Russian military bloggers. Grey Zone , a semi-official Wagner channel on Telegram, said \"a disaster is unfolding around Vuhledar, and it is unfolding again and again\". Reuters could not verify the battlefield reports. Ukraine plans its own major military counteroffensive in the coming months to reclaim more of the nearly one fifth of Ukrainian territory that Russia occupies. But it appears likely to wait until it has received at least some of the new weapons, including hundreds of battle tanks and armoured vehicles, promised lately by the West.

Hanna Arhirova, Associated Press Hanna Arhirova, Associated Press Leave your feedback KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 More than 100 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been released as part of a major Easter exchange with Russia, a top official said Sunday, as Orthodox Ukrainians marked the holiday for a second time since Moscow unleashed its\u00a0full-scale war\u00a0more than a year ago. While celebrations were subdued because of security risks, with a curfew barring the faithful from customary all-night services, Ukrainian authorities and ordinary people shared messages of hope, linking the story of Jesus\u2019 resurrection to their longing for peace and a Ukrainian victory. Dozens of families had special reasons to rejoice, as presidential adviser Andriy Yermak announced that 130 soldiers, sailors, border guards and others captured by Moscow were on their way back home following a \u201cbig Easter prisoner exchange.\u201d Yermak said in a Telegram post on Sunday that those released included troops who fought near Bakhmut, the eastern mining city which has for months been the focus of Russia\u2019s grinding offensive. \u201cThe lives of our people are the highest value for us,\u201d Yermak said, adding that Kyiv\u2019s goal was to bring back all remaining POWs. There was no immediate information on how many Russian prisoners were released, but the press service of the founder of the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-affiliated paramilitary force whose fighters are prominent in eastern Ukraine, also released a video Sunday showing Ukrainian prisoners of war being readied for an exchange. READ MORE: Ukraine, Russia send home around 200 total troops in prisoner swap In his Easter address released on Sunday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the holiday as marking \u201cthe victory of good, the victory of truth, the victory of life,\u201d and he stressed what he said was Ukrainian unity in the face of Russian aggression. \u201cBelief in victory unites all of us always, and especially today. At Easter, which from time immemorial has been a family holiday for Ukrainians, a day of warmth, hope and great unity. We are one big family \u2014 Ukrainians. We have one big home \u2014 Ukraine. We have one big goal \u2014 victory for all,\u201d Zelenskyy said. In central Kyiv, people gathered in the courtyard of the landmark St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery on Sunday morning to have their Easter eggs and baskets of food blessed by a priest. A curfew had prevented most from attending the traditional all-night service there hours earlier, with many tuning into a live stream instead. Ukrainian churches are usually crowded on Orthodox Easter Sunday. But this year, the wide courtyard was barely half full, and the line of people waiting for the priest to sprinkle holy water on their adorned baskets was moving briskly. For a second year in a row, the war interrupted holiday routines. Ukraine\u2019s main security service this week issued a statement urging residents not to linger in churches on Sunday, in order to avoid crowding and minimize security risks. Alla Voronina, one of the people who came to St. Michael\u2019s with baskets containing Easter cakes and multi-colored eggs, said that the restrictions were \u201cvery hard\u201d on residents\u2019 morale. \u201cYou constantly recall how it used to be before the war,\u201d she told The Associated Press. She said that she and her family would nevertheless follow the security recommendations and go straight home after receiving the blessing. Another worshipper, Tetiana Voloshyna, said she was praying for Ukrainian troops \u201cwho defend us and make it possible for us to have this holiday.\u201d She added she had come to the monastery with her \u201cpersonal pain and personal requests to God for victory, peace and life.\u201d Russians also observed Easter, including President Vladimir Putin. He attended midnight services in Moscow\u2019s Christ the Savior Cathedral that were led by Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Kirill, who has firmly supported the war. READ MORE: Russian attacks continue across Ukraine amid Easter pleas for peace In a statement, Putin commended Kirill for \u201ctireless, selfless work aimed at preserving enduring historical, spiritual, moral and family values, the upbringing and education of the youth.\u201d Kirill has repeatedly spoken out in support of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In a video message broadcast on Russian state television late Saturday, before the start of the Easter service in Moscow, Kirill lamented \u201cgrave events taking place on our Russian historical land\u201d in reference to the war, echoing the Kremlin\u2019s claim that an independent Ukraine is essentially a fiction. Despite the shared Orthodox holiday, Russian shelling and missile attacks continued to sow destruction in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian regional officials. Officials in the country\u2019s south and east said that churches had not been spared. The governor of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, Serhii Lysak, said Russian forces stationed at Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant shelled a church in a nearby town, wounding two civilians. \u201cThe Russians have once again confirmed that they hold nothing sacred,\u201d Lysak said in his post. Earlier on Sunday, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia province reported that Russian shelling overnight hit an Orthodox church in the town of Komyshuvakha. Photos showed local residents rescuing icons from the church, its gutted frame visible in the background. At least four civilians were killed and eight others were wounded on Saturday and overnight, Ukrainian officials reported on Sunday morning. The national emergencies service said the death toll in a Friday attack on the city of Sloviansk rose to 13 as more bodies were found in the rubble of an apartment building. Across the front line, in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine\u2019s industrial east, the Kremlin-appointed head of the Donetsk region claimed that a Ukrainian strike killed one civilian and wounded six others in the province\u2019s namesake capital. Denis Pushilin wrote in a Telegram post that shelling hit the center of the city, near its Holy Transfiguration cathedral. The Russian defense ministry on Sunday announced that assault units from the Wagner group have captured two neighborhoods in the embattled city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut, a former mining hub now largely reduced to ruins, has been a key target of Russia\u2019s monthslong grinding campaign in eastern Ukraine.

In an interview with the Financial Times , Andriy Sybiha, the deputy head of the president\u2019s office, expressed Kyiv\u2019s interest in negotiations should Ukrainian forces reach the region\u2019s administrative border as a result of an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive many expect will begin in the coming months. \u201cIf we will succeed in achieving our strategic goals on the battlefield and when we will be on the administrative border with Crimea , we are ready to open a diplomatic page to discuss this issue,\u201d Sybiha said. He added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we exclude the way of liberation [of Crimea] by our army.\u201d It was unclear how serious Sybiha\u2019s remarks were or whether they might represent disinformation to lead Moscow to believe Kyiv\u2019s coming offensive will focus on the south in the direction of Crimea following previous successful military deception efforts by Kyiv last year. With Ukraine under continuing Russian pressure in the eastern city of Bakhmut, and Zelenskiy once again hinting at the potential for a withdrawal there, the remarks may also be aimed at bolstering Ukrainian public morale by projecting confidence over any counteroffensive\u2019s likelihood for success. The comments by Sybiha, a diplomat, appeared to represent a U-turn on Zelenskiy\u2019s previous statements in which he ruled out peace talks until Russian forces left all of Ukraine, including the Russian-occupied Crimea. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since February 2014 and was illegally annexed by Moscow the following month after a mock referendum. Tank tactics: how might Ukraine use its influx of western armour? Read more The comments came amid a continuing military buildup by Kyiv ahead of its anticipated spring offensive, with the arrival of western tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. With Ukraine still pushing for the supply of extra fighter jets that many analysts say it needs to pursue its wider military ambitions, Zelenskiy, during a visit to Warsaw , said Poland would help form a coalition of western powers to supply warplanes to Kyiv. Describing Poland as having been instrumental in getting western allies to send battle tanks to Ukraine, he said he believed it could play the same role in a \u201cplanes coalition\u201d. His comments came as the Polish government said it would send 10 more MiG fighter jets on top of four provided earlier, but there has been no agreement from the US or Ukraine\u2019s other major military backers to send F-16 fighters that Kyiv has requested. In addition to MiG-29s, Ukraine has pressed Nato for F-16 jet fighters, but a Polish foreign policy adviser, Marcin Przydacz, indicated Poland would not decide soon on whether to send any. Meanwhile, on the frontlines, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian troops faced a difficult situation in the battle for Bakhmut and the military would take \u201ccorresponding\u201d decisions to protect them if they were in danger of being encircled by Russian forces. \u201cWe are in Bakhmut and the enemy does not control it,\u201d Zelenskiy said, contradicting claims by Russian forces that they had captured the city, in ruins after months of attritional warfare and bombardment. Ukraine\u2019s military said in an update early on Thursday that Russian forces were storming Bakhmut with the intention of taking full control of it, adding that the city, along with the towns of Avdiivka and Marinka to the south-west, were \u201cthe epicentre of hostilities\u201d. However, the head of Russia\u2019s private Wagner group militia said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces were not abandoning the city. \u201cIt must be said clearly that the enemy is not going anywhere,\u201d he said on his Telegram channel. He said Ukrainian troops had organised staunch defences inside the city, particularly along railway lines and in high-rise buildings in the west, and that if they fell back they would take up new positions in the outskirts and in Chasiv Yar to the west. The battle for Bakhmut, one of the last urban centres yet to fall to Russia in eastern Donetsk province, has proven one of the bloodiest of Russia\u2019s invasion. Ukrainian military commanders have stressed the importance of holding it and other cities and inflicting losses on Russian troops before the anticipated counteroffensive. On the diplomatic front, the Kremlin on Thursday said it saw no \u201cprospect\u201d for China to mediate the Ukraine conflict and said it had \u201cno other way\u201d than to press on with its offensive. The comments came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited Beijing to try to dissuade China from supporting Moscow\u2019s campaign. \u201cUndoubtedly, China has a very effective and commanding potential for mediation,\u201d said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. \u201cBut the situation with Ukraine is complex, so far there are no prospects for a political settlement.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report Explore more on these topics Crimea Ukraine Russia Volodymyr Zelenskyy Europe news Share Reuse this content","question":"What military support did Ukraine seek from Western allies in April 2023 ahead of its anticipated counteroffensive?","answer":"Ukraine requested additional fighter jets, including F-16s, and received pledges of MiG-29s from Poland, while also securing Western tanks and armored vehicles.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0443 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0456\u0432 \u0443 \u043a\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043d\u0456 2023 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043e\u0447\u0456\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043c?","answer_translated":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0449\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0447\u0456, \u0437\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 F-16, \u0456 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0456\u0446\u044f\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0443 MiG-29 \u0432\u0456\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0456, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0437\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0456 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0443.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0423 \u043a\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043d\u0456 2023 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0456\u0432 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0443 \u0443 \u0432\u0438\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0456 \u0441\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0438 (\u0437\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432 Leopard 2, Challenger 2, Abrams), \u0431\u043e\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0456\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438, \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c, \u0431\u043e\u0454\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0456\u0432, \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0440\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445. \u0426\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0456\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer mentions modern armored vehicles (including Leopard 2, Challenger 2, Abrams tanks), infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, ammunition, air defense systems, and training for Ukrainian military personnel.

{"year":"2023","month":"05","event_desc":"6 May  Russian nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin is injured and his driver is killed when their vehicle is hit by a car bomb in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia.","text":"Zakhar Prilepin: Russian pro-war blogger injured in car bomb 6 May 2023 Share Save Matt Murphy BBC News Share Save Reuters Prilepin's car exploded on a remote road A prominent Russian writer and pro-war blogger has had surgery and is now under sedation after a car bomb attack, officials say. Zakhar Prilepin, a vehement supporter of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, was in a car blown up in a village in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod region. He suffered fractures and his driver was killed. Investigators say they are questioning a suspect named Alexander Permyakov who has admitted operating for Ukraine. That has not been confirmed by Kyiv. Nor has Kyiv denied involvement, or responded to a Russian foreign ministry allegation that Ukraine - backed by the US government - targeted Prilepin as an ideological enemy. Russian reports did not specify Prilepin's injuries. The Investigative Committee (SK), which handles serious crimes including terrorism, accuses Permyakov of having detonated a remote-controlled bomb, wrecking Prilepin's Audi. The SK says the suspect was caught in a neighbouring village. The region is more than 425km (265 miles) east of Moscow. The suspect \"admitted doing an assignment for the Ukrainian secret services\", the SK alleges. Reuters The bomb was allegedly planted on the road and detonated remotely It comes a month after another pro-Kremlin blogger, Vladlen Tatarsky, died in a bombing at a St Petersburg caf\u00e9. Saturday's explosion reportedly took place on a remote road some 80km from the town of Bor. The partisan group Atesh, which is made up of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, claimed it was behind the attack on Prilepin. \"We had a feeling that sooner or later he would be blown up,\" they wrote on Telegram. \"He was not driving alone, but with a surprise on the underside of the car.\" The BBC cannot verify Atesh's claims. As well as being one one of Russia's best-known novelists, Prilepin is known for his involvement with Russian ultra-nationalist politics. A veteran of Russia's bloody wars in Chechnya in the 1990s, the 47-year-old has admitted fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Reuters Prilepin rose to literary fame in the 2000s He has called for the \"return of Kyiv to Russia\". Last year a group founded by Prilepin called on officials to \"purge the cultural space\" of all who oppose the conflict. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the alleged bombing until the investigation was complete. But Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova sought to blame the attack on the UK and the US. \"The fact has come true: Washington and Nato fed another international terrorist cell - the Kiev regime,\" she wrote on Telegram. \"We pray for Zakhar.\" The attack is the latest to target high-profile supporters of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Vladlen Tatarsky was killed last month. The blogger had reported from the Ukraine front line and gained notoriety last year after posting a video filmed inside the Kremlin in which he said: \"We will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone as necessary. Just as we like it.\" Activist Darya Trepova, 26, was later arrested and was charged with terrorism following the publication of a video - believed to have been recorded under duress - in which she admitted bringing a statuette to the caf\u00e9 that later blew up. And in August 2022, Darya Dugina - the daughter of a close ally of Mr Putin - was killed in a suspected car bombing near Moscow.

{"year":"2023","month":"05","event_desc":"13 May  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with Pope Francis during a private audience in the Vatican.","text":"Ukraine war: Pope tells Zelensky he is 'praying for peace' 13 May 2023 Share Save Sofia Bettiza in Rome & Laura Gozzi in London BBC News Share Save EFE Saturday's talks between Pope Francis and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lasted about 40 minutes, the Vatican said Pope Francis has told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky he is constantly praying for peace after the two met privately at the Vatican. The pontiff also stressed on the urgent need to help \"the most fragile people, innocent victims\" of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia last year. Mr Zelensky earlier met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni who assured him of Rome's support for united Ukraine. More than 1,000 police are deployed and a no-fly zone over Rome is in place. In a statement on Saturday, the Holy See said Pope Francis and President Zelensky \"discussed the humanitarian and political situation in Ukraine caused by the ongoing war\" during a meeting that lasted about 40 minutes. The Argentine pontiff and President Zelensky \"both agreed on the need to continue humanitarian efforts to support the population\". The statement added: \"The Pope has assured his constant prayer and continuous invocation to the Lord for peace - since last February\" - when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion. Pope Francis has often said that the Vatican stands ready to act as a mediator in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Earlier this month, he stated that the Vatican was working on a peace plan to end the war, saying that the mission was \"not yet public. When it is public, I will talk about it.\" But the relationship between Ukraine and the Vatican has sometimes been uneasy. A few months after the war in Ukraine began, the Pope said in an interview that Moscow's invasion was \"perhaps somehow provoked\". And last August, Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican took the unusual step of criticising the Pope after the pontiff referred to Darya Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultra-nationalist figure, who was killed by a car bomb, as an \"innocent\" victim of war. Earlier on Saturday, President Zelensky had talks with his counterpart Sergio President Mattarella and then met Ms Meloni for a working lunch. Italy historically has strong ties with Moscow. Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the conservative Forza Italia party, is an old friend of President Putin. They went on trips together and exchanged birthday gifts. Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister, has frequently voiced pro-Russian sentiments and criticised military assistance to Ukraine. President Zelensky is not expected to meet either Mr Salvini or Mr Berlusconi during his trip. At the news conference that followed the meeting between Mr Zelensky and Ms Meloni, the Ukrainian leader invited \"all the Italian political leaders and representatives of civil society\" to visit Ukraine. He said they would be able \"to see what a single person was capable of doing to us, what Putin was capable of, and you will understand why we are fighting this evil\". Ms Meloni stressed that the war would only end when Russia stopped its \"brutal and unjust aggression\" and withdrew from all Ukrainian territory. She also pledged Italy's support for Ukraine for \"as long as is necessary\". Meanwhile, the German government unveiled its biggest military aid package for Ukraine yet, worth \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.4bn). Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelensky, said the aid indicated that Russia was \"bound to lose and sit on the bench of historical shame\". Earlier this week, German media reported that President Zelensky was planning to visit Germany following his trip to Italy, although this has not yet been confirmed. In other developments: President Zelensky's visit came after Russia carried out a new wave of air strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities overnight More than 20 people were injured in the western city of Khmelnytsky. Critical infrastructure, as well as homes and government buildings, was also hit Explosions were reported on Friday in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk, about 90km (56 miles) behind the front line in eastern Ukraine. Russian-backed separatist forces in the region accused Kyiv of using Storm Shadow missiles, which the UK said it had supplied Ukraine with earlier this week There were also more reports of blasts in Luhansk on Saturday A helicopter crashed in Russia's Bryansk region, on the border with Ukraine, injuring one woman. Footage circulating on social media purports to show an S-24 warplane also crashing in the region on Saturday - although the videos have not been verified.

{"year":"2023","month":"06","event_desc":"Thousands of civilians are being evacuated from the town of Nova Kakhovka and surrounding villages as the floods spread.","text":"Ukraine dam: Thousands flee floods after dam collapse near Nova Kakhovka 6 June 2023 Share Save Alex Binley in London and Paul Adams in Kyiv BBC News Share Save Watch: President Zelensky shared a video of the dam on Telegram Thousands of people are being evacuated downstream of a major dam which has collapsed in Russian-held Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 80 towns and villages may be flooded after the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka, which he blamed on Russia. Water is surging down the Dnipro river, and is said to pose a catastrophic flooding risk to the city of Kherson. Russia has denied destroying the dam - which it controls - instead blaming Ukrainian shelling. Neither Ukraine nor Russia's claim has been verified by the BBC. The Kakhovka dam, downstream from the huge Kakhovka reservoir, is crucial to the region. It provides water to farmers and residents, as well as to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is also a vital channel carrying water south to Russian-occupied Crimea. Ukraine's state-owned hydropower plants administrator Ukrhydroenergo warned that the peak of a water spill downstream from the emptying reservoir was expected on Wednesday morning. It said this would be followed by a period of \"stabilisation\", with the water expected to rapidly recede in four to five days. There are concerns about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - which uses reservoir water for cooling. The situation there is said to be under control and there is \"no immediate nuclear safety risk\" for the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Several towns are already flooded, while people in areas further downstream have been forced to flee by bus and train. Abound 40,000 people need to be evacuated, Deputy Prosecutor-General Viktoriya Lytvynova said on Ukrainian television - 17,000 people in Ukraine-controlled territory west of the Dnipro River and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled east. Also speaking on Ukrainian television, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said about 1,000 people had been evacuated so far and 24 settlements had been flooded. He accused Russia of shelling the southern region of Kherson, from where people were being evacuated, and issued a warning about the dangers posed by mines being exposed by the rising water levels. A building is seen floating along the Dnipro river in the Kherson region One local resident Andriy, who lives close to the dam - which was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - said he believed Russia wanted to \"drown\" his city. In the Ukraine-controlled city of Kherson, a woman called Lyudmyla - who was loading her belongings including a washing machine onto a trailer that was attached to an old car - said: \"We're afraid of flooding. We're taking our things a little higher up.\" She called for Russian forces to be \"kicked out of here... they're shooting at us. They're flooding us or doing something else\". Another resident of the city, Serhiy, said he feared \"everything is going to die here\". \"All the living creatures, and people will be flooded out,\" he said, gesturing at nearby houses and gardens. Reuters The city of Kherson is 50 miles downstream of the dam On the Russian-seized riverbank of Nova Kakhovka, the Moscow-installed mayor Vladimir Leontyev said the city was underwater and 900 people had been evacuated. He said 53 evacuation buses were being sent by the authorities to take people from the city and two other settlements nearby to safety. Water levels had risen to over 11m (36ft) and some residents had been taken to hospital, he added. The small town of Oleshky was also heavily flooded, Kremlin-appointed officials said. The Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank had been completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, it said in a post on its Facebook page. Watch: Swans seen swimming through Nova Kakhovka It is not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam in the early hours of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up. This seems plausible, as Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to advance into Russian-held territory, as part of their counter-offensive. For Russia, anxious to defend conquered territory in southern Ukraine, the dam represented an obvious problem. Just as Ukrainian forces attacked road and rail bridges further downstream last autumn in a successful effort to isolate Russian forces in and around Kherson, Russia may have decided to destroy the dam to hold up Ukraine's counter-offensive, which it fears could come from multiple directions. However, a Russian official claims Ukraine carried out the attack on the dam to detract from what they said were the failures of its counter-offensive and to deprive Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russian in 2014 - of fresh water. A major Ukrainian push has long been expected. Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun. On Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. \"We will still liberate all our land,\" he said in a video address. Earlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue. Maxar Technologies\/Reuters An aerial image shows water pouring through what appears to be a breach in the dam On Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the \"epicentre of hostilities\" in Bakhmut , but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun. Bakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow. Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of defence, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone intercepts suggest Russia wants to target more dams. \"They're actually calling to blow up more dams on the Dnipro river,\" he said. Ukraine has branded the attack on the dam \"ecocide\" and said that 150 tonnes of engine oil has spilled into the Dnipro river. Ukrhydroenergo said a power station linked to the dam had been \"completely destroyed... the hydraulic structure is being washed away\". World leaders have laid the blame for the blast at Russia's door, with some calling it a war crime. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam it would \"demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression\". The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said the destruction of the dam demonstrated once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said he was \"shocked by the unprecedented attack\". The Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians.

{"year":"2023","month":"05","event_desc":"14 May  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, Germany.","text":"Ukraine war: Kyiv not attacking Russian territory - Zelensky 14 May 2023 Share Save Laura Gozzi & Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save EFE Chancellor Scholz (right) pledged to support President Zelensky (left) and Ukraine \"for as long as it is necessary\" Ukraine has no plans to hit targets in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said in Germany, where Kyiv secured a big new defence aid package. \"We are not attacking Russian territory,\" he said after talks in Berlin with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \"We are preparing a counterattack to de-occupy the illegitimately conquered territories,\" Mr Zelensky added. Mr Scholz vowed to back Ukraine \"for as long as it is necessary\", promising \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.4bn) worth of weapons. This includes advanced German Leopard tanks and more anti-aircraft systems to defend Ukraine from almost daily deadly Russian missile and drone attacks. President Zelensky described the new tranche as \"the largest since the beginning of the full-scale aggression\" by Russia in February 2022. The war has transformed Germany's attitude towards Ukraine, moving from being a reluctant supplier of military hardware to virtually doubling its contribution overnight, the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin says. Russia accuses Ukraine of repeatedly hitting targets inside Russia, including a reported drone attack on Moscow's Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine denies the accusations, while also stressing that it has a legitimate right to use force and other means to fully de-occupy its territories currently under Russian control. These include four regions in the south and east, as well as the Crimea peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014. Later on Sunday, President Zelensky travelled to the western city of Aachen to receive the prestigious Charlemagne Prize awarded this year to him and the Ukrainian people. The honour is given for efforts to foster European unity. \"Ukraine incarnates everything the European idea is living for: the courage of convictions, the fight for values and freedom, the commitment to peace and unity,\" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the award ceremony. Previous winners include Winston Churchill, Pope Francis and Bill Clinton. In other developments on Sunday: Ukraine's air force says it destroyed 25 drones and three cruise missiles launched by Russia in yet another massive overnight attack Six people were killed and another 16 injured in the past 24 hours in Russian shelling of Ukraine-held areas in the eastern Donetsk region, local officials said One person was killed in Sunday's Russian artillery attack on the southern Kherson region Mobile internet is temporarily suspended in the Russian-seized areas of the eastern Luhansk region because of increased shelling by Ukrainian troops, Moscow-installed officials said President Zelensky flew to Germany from Italy overnight, his plane escorted by two German Air Force fighter jets. In Rome, the Ukrainian leader met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He also had a private audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican. The Argentine pontiff said he was constantly praying for peace in Ukraine. The Pope also stressed the urgent need to help \"the most fragile people, innocent victims\" of the Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Ms Meloni assured Mr Zelensky of Rome's support for united Ukraine. Later on Sunday, the Ukrainian leader arrived in Paris, where he went to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace for a working dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a parliamentary bill that aimed to \"abandon the Russian heritage of imposing Christmas celebrations\". In recent years, Kyiv has been cutting religious, cultural and other ties with Russia, aligning itself with the West. This process escalated following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Mr Zelensky signed the bill on Friday - two weeks after it had been passed by Ukrainian lawmakers. The legislation also moves another two state holidays, Day of Ukrainian Statehood, from 28 July to 15 July, and the Defenders' Day, which commemorates armed forces veterans, from 14 October to 1 October. Moscow has so far made no public comments on the issue. For centuries, first imperial Russia and then the Moscow-dominated Soviet Union had tried - but always failed - to totally control Ukraine. This included the imposed authority of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) over Ukraine's churches. But in 2019, the recently formed Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was granted independence by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians worldwide. The move provoked a furious response in the ROC, which is openly defending President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Until this year, the OCU - like several other Orthodox churches, including the ROC - celebrated Christmas Day on 7 January, in line with the Julian calendar. But the OCU has now officially switched to the more-precise Gregorian calendar used in most parts of the world. In recent years many Ukrainian worshippers have been joining the OCU, and the majority of them are now likely to be celebrating Christmas on 25 December. There will also be those marking Christmas twice. At the same time, millions still follow the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), the other established branch with parishes all over the country. The UOC has not commented on the latest developments. It officially declared a split from Moscow in 2022 - but a number of its clerics have recently been prosecuted for pro-Russian activities. The UOC says there is no evidence to support the charges of collaboration. Image source, Future Publishing via Getty Images Image caption, The Motherland Monument in Kyiv - one of the world's tallest statues - will be stripped of its Soviet emblem, and Ukraine's coat of arms, the Trident, will replace it Ukraine's decision to move Christmas is the latest step by the country to distance itself from its north-eastern neighbour. Cities and villages all over Ukraine have recently seen renaming of their streets linked to Russian and Soviet historical figures. Similarly, a number of monuments have been taken down, and Russian films made after 2014 banned in Ukraine. Those measures followed Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in March 2014.

{"year":"2023","month":"06","event_desc":"29 June  Former US Vice President Mike Pence makes a surprise visit to Kyiv.","text":"War in Ukraine Mike Pence meets with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in surprise trip to Ukraine In making the unannounced trip, the former vice president became the first GOP presidential candidate to meet with the Ukrainian leader during the campaign. Get more news Live on \/ Updated By Dasha Burns and Abigail Brooks KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Former Vice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Thursday, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the campaign. The visit comes at a crucial moment in the war, just after the Wagner mercenary group\u2019s rebellion and the deadly Russian missile strike on a pizza restaurant in Kramatorsk, Ukraine. Pence has been outspoken about his support for Ukraine, and the move sends a resounding message that he believes the U.S. should play a leading role in the country\u2019s fight against Russia. It also puts Pence in a unique position within the GOP \u2014 a party once dominated by hawks who advocated against growing Russian influence but is now led by a man who has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, and whose base is largely uninterested in supporting Ukraine. Pence met with Zelenskyy in Ukraine on Thursday. NBC News \"I believe America\u2019s the leader of the free world,\" Pence told NBC News. \"But coming here just as a private citizen \u2014 being able to really see firsthand the heroism of the Ukrainian soldiers holding the line in those woods, see the heroism of the people here in Irpin that held back the Russian army, to see families whose homes were literally shelled in the midst of an unconscionable and unprovoked Russian invasion \u2014 just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.\" Pence is spending the day getting a firsthand look at the atrocities Ukrainians have experienced over the last 16 months and visiting Moshchun, Bucha and Irpin \u2014 three cities the Russian forces occupied and ravaged \u2014 in addition to meeting with Zelenskyy. One of Zelenskyy\u2019s top advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Pence \u201cunderstands absolutely clearly what Russia is.\u201d Pence spoke with people in Irpin on a surprise visit to Ukraine on Thursday. David Gladstone \/ NBC News \u201cHe deeply understands Russia and deeply understands the nature of this conflict, that it is not about territories, not about any businesses, not about anything except the main thing \u2026 those values for which the United States were created,\u201d Podolyak said, naming \u201cfreedom, competition and democracy.\u201d \u201cThis is about helping a country that is willing to defend the fundamental, core values on which the United States as a whole is built,\u201d he added. The future of U.S. support for the Ukrainian war effort is in question, and the voters Pence is trying to woo in the Republican primary aren\u2019t eager to aid the country. In the latest NBC News national poll, 52% of GOP primary voters said they would be less likely to back a candidate who supports sending more funding and weapons to Ukraine, while just 28% said they would be more likely. \"I\u2019m here because it\u2019s important that the American people understand the progress that we\u2019ve made and how support for the Ukrainian military has been in our national interest,\" Pence said when asked by NBC News about the poll results. \"I truly do believe that now, more than ever, we need leaders in our country who will articulate the importance of American leadership in the world.\" \"We\u2019ll let the polls and the politics take care of themselves, but for me it was important to be here to better understand what the people of Ukraine have endured, the mindless violence that was perpetrated on them in an unprovoked invasion by the Russian military and the progress that they\u2019ve made in pushing back that military,\" he added. \"It\u2019s steeled my resolve, and it\u2019s made me better equipped to be able to go home as I speak to the American people about the vital importance of American support to repel Russian aggression.\" Mike Pence in Moshchun, Ukraine, on Thursday. David Gladstone \/ NBC News Pence criticized President Joe Biden's administration for being \"slow\" in providing military support to Ukraine. He also said that he did not support sending U.S. troops to the country to assist in the war. \"We should never send American troops into Ukraine, and we don't need to,\" Pence said. Pence\u2019s continued support for Ukraine sets him apart from some of his Republican rivals. And when talking about his views on foreign policy Thursday, he looked back to President Ronald Reagan as his guiding star. \"Ever since the days of Ronald Reagan, the American people have always stood with those who fought back to defend their own freedom,\" he said. \"We actually called it the Reagan doctrine \u2014 the idea that if you were willing to fight the Communists back in the day in your country, we\u2019ll give you the means to fight them there so that we don\u2019t ever have to fight them on our soil. It\u2019s part and parcel of what brought down the Soviet Union and made it possible for Ukraine to live in freedom to begin with. But I do believe that the majority of Republicans and the majority of Americans still hold to that cause of freedom.\" Florida Gov.

{"year":"2023","month":"09","event_desc":"2 September  A Ukrainian court places billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky under arrest over fraud and money laundering charges as part of corruption related activities.","text":"Court places billionaire businessman under arrest for two months over fraud and money laundering charges. A Ukrainian court has placed billionaire businessman Ihor Kolomoisky under arrest for two months over fraud and money laundering charges as part of the war-torn country\u2019s crackdown on corruption . The court on Saturday gave Kolomoisky the option of posting bail of more than 509 million hryvnias, equivalent to more than $13m. In an oblique reference to legal proceedings against the business magnate, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday thanked law enforcement bodies for bringing long-running cases to justice. \u201cI thank Ukrainian law enforcement officials for their resolve in bringing to a just outcome each and every one of the cases that have been hindered for decades,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Al Jazeera Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said the court\u2019s decision has caught many people by surprise. \u201cThis has come as a big shock here in Kyiv. There\u2019s been rumblings of it on social media all day. Kolomoisky is one of Ukraine\u2019s most high-profile, richest oligarchs in the country. He was a supporter of Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s presidential bid back in 2019. He has been under US sanctions since 2021,\u201d McBride said. \u201cThis comes amid a campaign by the Ukrainian government to tackle corruption and to be seen to be tackling corruption. There is a prevailing mood in the country at the moment that the government is tackling corruption. A number of officials have been dismissed and also been prosecuted,\u201d he added.    Early on Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s main security agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), named Kolomoisky as a suspect in a criminal investigation. \u201cIt was established that during 2013-2020, Ihor Kolomoisky legalised more than half a billion hryvnias [$14m] by withdrawing them abroad and using the infrastructure of banks under [his] control,\u201d the SBU said in a statement. Kolomoisky, who has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. The SBU published pictures on the Telegram messaging app of a group of detectives at the door of his home, Kolomoisky being served documents and signing them. The businessman is seen as one of the class of oligarchs who amassed huge industrial wealth after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and who have wielded outsize political and economic influence. Before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, Zelenskyy and his team tried to clip their wings with legislation requiring oligarchs to register and stay out of politics. The war has eroded their power as lucrative industrial assets have been destroyed in the east and south, and their television channels have been broadcasting under a centralised wartime signal.    Before he won the presidency, Zelenskyy rose to prominence as a comedian and played the role of president on a show aired on a Kolomoisky-owned TV channel. He denies Kolomoisky has had any influence over his government. During the war, Zelenskyy has been keen to stress Ukraine\u2019s crackdown on corruption as Kyiv has applied to join the European Union. It hopes to secure tens of billions of dollars to help rebuild the country after 18 months of war that has no end in sight. Two lawmakers \u2013 Yaroslav Zheleznyak and Iryna Gerashchenko \u2013 suggested on Telegram that the move against Kolomoisky was aimed at generating positive publicity among Ukraine\u2019s foreign backers as well as the public at home who are tired of the war and worried about the problem of entrenched corruption. The SBU\u2019s announcement on Saturday is not the first wartime move involving Kolomoisky. In November, the state took control of stakes in major strategic companies, some of which were associated with him, invoking wartime laws to help the war effort. This year, security officials searched Kolomoisky\u2019s home in connection with a separate investigation into embezzlement and tax evasion at the country\u2019s two largest oil companies, which were partially owned by the businessman. Kolomoisky is a former owner of leading Ukrainian bank PrivatBank, which was nationalised in late 2016 as part of a major cleanup of the banking system. He has owned an array of assets in the energy, banking and other sectors, including one of Ukraine\u2019s most influential television channels.

{"year":"2023","month":"09","event_desc":"Tens of thousands of Ukrainians oppose a asset declaration legislation critics believe hampers an effort to hold officials accountable by delaying a requirement to publicly declare their assets.","text":"Court places billionaire businessman under arrest for two months over fraud and money laundering charges. A Ukrainian court has placed billionaire businessman Ihor Kolomoisky under arrest for two months over fraud and money laundering charges as part of the war-torn country\u2019s crackdown on corruption . The court on Saturday gave Kolomoisky the option of posting bail of more than 509 million hryvnias, equivalent to more than $13m. In an oblique reference to legal proceedings against the business magnate, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday thanked law enforcement bodies for bringing long-running cases to justice. \u201cI thank Ukrainian law enforcement officials for their resolve in bringing to a just outcome each and every one of the cases that have been hindered for decades,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Al Jazeera Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said the court\u2019s decision has caught many people by surprise. \u201cThis has come as a big shock here in Kyiv. There\u2019s been rumblings of it on social media all day. Kolomoisky is one of Ukraine\u2019s most high-profile, richest oligarchs in the country. He was a supporter of Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s presidential bid back in 2019. He has been under US sanctions since 2021,\u201d McBride said. \u201cThis comes amid a campaign by the Ukrainian government to tackle corruption and to be seen to be tackling corruption. There is a prevailing mood in the country at the moment that the government is tackling corruption. A number of officials have been dismissed and also been prosecuted,\u201d he added.    Early on Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s main security agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), named Kolomoisky as a suspect in a criminal investigation. \u201cIt was established that during 2013-2020, Ihor Kolomoisky legalised more than half a billion hryvnias [$14m] by withdrawing them abroad and using the infrastructure of banks under [his] control,\u201d the SBU said in a statement. Kolomoisky, who has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. The SBU published pictures on the Telegram messaging app of a group of detectives at the door of his home, Kolomoisky being served documents and signing them. The businessman is seen as one of the class of oligarchs who amassed huge industrial wealth after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and who have wielded outsize political and economic influence. Before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, Zelenskyy and his team tried to clip their wings with legislation requiring oligarchs to register and stay out of politics. The war has eroded their power as lucrative industrial assets have been destroyed in the east and south, and their television channels have been broadcasting under a centralised wartime signal.    Before he won the presidency, Zelenskyy rose to prominence as a comedian and played the role of president on a show aired on a Kolomoisky-owned TV channel. He denies Kolomoisky has had any influence over his government. During the war, Zelenskyy has been keen to stress Ukraine\u2019s crackdown on corruption as Kyiv has applied to join the European Union. It hopes to secure tens of billions of dollars to help rebuild the country after 18 months of war that has no end in sight. Two lawmakers \u2013 Yaroslav Zheleznyak and Iryna Gerashchenko \u2013 suggested on Telegram that the move against Kolomoisky was aimed at generating positive publicity among Ukraine\u2019s foreign backers as well as the public at home who are tired of the war and worried about the problem of entrenched corruption. The SBU\u2019s announcement on Saturday is not the first wartime move involving Kolomoisky. In November, the state took control of stakes in major strategic companies, some of which were associated with him, invoking wartime laws to help the war effort. This year, security officials searched Kolomoisky\u2019s home in connection with a separate investigation into embezzlement and tax evasion at the country\u2019s two largest oil companies, which were partially owned by the businessman. Kolomoisky is a former owner of leading Ukrainian bank PrivatBank, which was nationalised in late 2016 as part of a major cleanup of the banking system. He has owned an array of assets in the energy, banking and other sectors, including one of Ukraine\u2019s most influential television channels. The United States imposed sanctions on Kolomoisky in 2021 \u201cdue to his involvement in significant corruption\u201d. US authorities have also alleged Kolomoisky and a business partner laundered stolen funds through the US. Kolomoisky has denied any wrongdoing.

{"year":"2023","month":"07","event_desc":"21 July  Zelensky fires Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko.","text":"Ukraine's ambassador to the United Kingdom Vadym Prystaiko in Westminster, London, in 2022. Tom Nicholson\/Reuters London CNN \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his ambassador to the United Kingdom on Friday. The ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, had criticized Zelensky over his reaction to recent remarks by British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, who had suggested Ukraine had not expressed sufficient \u201cgratitude\u201d for Western financial support. Prystaiko said Zelensky\u2019s response to Wallace amounted to \u201cunhealthy\u201d sarcasm. A statement published Friday on the Ukrainian presidency\u2019s website confirmed Prystaiko\u2019s dismissal but did not provide a reason. The tension began at a NATO summit in Lithuania earlier this month, when Wallace said that \u201cwhether we like it or not, people want to see gratitude for the West\u2019s military contributions to Ukraine\u2019s war effort. \u201cI said to the Ukrainians last June, when I drove 11 hours to be given a list \u2013 I\u2019m not Amazon,\u201d Wallace said. When asked about those remarks by a reporter at the NATO summit, Zelensky was nonplussed. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what he means. How else should we thank him? Well, let him write to me and tell me how I need to thank people so that we can be fully grateful. We can also wake up in the morning and thank the minister personally.\u201d Zelensky and Prystaiko leave following an audience with King Charlies III at Buckingham Palace, February 8, 2023. Kirsty O'Connor\/AFP\/Getty Images Prystaiko was interviewed about the exchange the following day on Sky News, where he was asked whether there was a \u201chint of sarcasm\u201d in Zelensky\u2019s response to Wallace. Prystaiko conceded there was \u201ca little bit of sarcasm,\u201d and went on to say: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this sarcasm is healthy.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have to show the Russians that we have something between us.

Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine's richest men and a so-called oligarch, was ordered into custody on suspicion of money laundering last week, and, according to media reports, is being treated as a suspect in an embezzlement case. Sign up here. A lawyer for Kolomoisky did not immediately respond to written requests for comment about asset seizures. The tycoon's lawyers have not commented on the embezzlement case. Kolomoisky has denied wrongdoing in the past. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said it had frozen more than 3 billion hryvnia in assets in addition to nearly 1,000 properties and more than 1,600 vehicles and vessels from the former owner of lender PrivatBank. The NABU statement did not name Kolomoisky. Kolomoisky is a former owner of PrivatBank, which was nationalised in late 2016 as part of a clean-up of the Ukrainian banking system. He is among the tycoons who built their fortunes in the ashes of the Soviet Union and amassed political power in Ukraine's fragile post-Soviet democracy. The moves against him come as Kyiv is trying to signal progress during a wartime crackdown on corruption that is important to its hopes of joining the European Union. Ukrainian officials have also said that \"de-oligarchisation\" is an important step to building a stronger state after the war with Russia.

Photograph: Jussi Nukari\/Shutterstock Ukraine This article is more than 1 year old Ex-Nato chief proposes Ukraine joins without Russian-occupied territories This article is more than 1 year old Former secretary general says partial membership would warn Russia it cannot stop Ukraine joining the alliance Patrick Wintour Diplomatic Editor Sat 11 Nov 2023 10.18 GMT Last modified on Sat 11 Nov 2023 13.03 GMT Share A former Nato secretary general has put forward a proposal for Ukraine to join the military alliance but stripped of the territories occupied by Russia. Anders Fogh Rasmussen has long worked alongside Andriy Yermak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, particularly ahead of the last Nato summit in Vilnius this year that ended with no invitation for Ukraine to join. The two men are again broadly discussing Ukraine\u2019s place in a new European security architecture, including practical questions around the extent of Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership. Rasmussen, who was Nato\u2019s secretary general between 2009 and 2014, insisted that a plan for partial Ukraine membership would not symbolise a freezing of the conflict, but would instead mark a determination to warn Russia that it cannot prevent Ukraine joining the western defensive alliance. Nato is due to hold its 75th anniversary summit in Washington next summer, and the issue of Ukraine\u2019s future membership is bound to be a major topic. Ukraine\u2019s leadership was left bitterly disappointed when, under US and German pressure, Nato at its summit this year issued a statement saying Ukraine would be offered an invitation when conditions allowed, effectively rejecting Ukraine\u2019s request to be given a specific date. Instead, Ukraine\u2019s relationship with Nato was elevated on the margins by setting up a Ukraine-Nato council and through an agreement that Nato members bilaterally would offer security guarantees to Ukraine. Rasmussen said the cause of Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership cannot be deferred again next year. He said: \u201cThe time has come to take the next step and extend an invitation for Ukraine to join Nato. We need a new European security architecture in which Ukraine is in the heart of Nato.\u201d Those advocating for Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership have been hamstrung by the near-impossibility of a country at war being offered membership, since under Nato\u2019s article 5 clause of collective self-defence, all Nato member states are required to come to the active defence of the country in conflict. Nato membership for all of Ukraine now would in effect be a notice to Russia by Nato that it was about to go to war with Moscow. By excluding from Nato territory held by Russia, the threat of a Russia-Nato conflict would be reduced, Rasmussen argues. Rasmussen denied the move would freeze the conflict, ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. He said: \u201cThe absolute credibility of article 5 guarantees would deter Russia from mounting attacks inside the Ukrainian territory inside Nato and so free up Ukrainian forces to go to the frontline.\u201d He said: \u201cTo make article 5 credible there would have to be a clear message to Russia that any violation of Nato territory would be met by a response.\u201d He said in some ways the proposal is similar to imposing a no-fly zone on Russia so that it could not fly over Ukrainian territory or send missiles into Ukrainian towns. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rasmussen said an imprecise precedent existed since west Germany joined the alliance in 1955, and article 5 covered its territory but not that of east Germany. He set out three principal reasons for Ukraine to be offered membership. Ukraine inside Nato would act as a bulwark against a still-aggressive Russia. Second, he said: \u201cWe have to realise that grey zones are danger zones. Neutrality in the old sense of the world does not exist any more. Grey zones become a temptation for Putin to attack.\u201d Finally, he argued the Ukrainian army is now the most battle hardened army in Europe and would be an asset and example to other European powers.

Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine's richest men and a so-called oligarch, was ordered into custody on suspicion of money laundering last week, and, according to media reports, is being treated as a suspect in an embezzlement case. Sign up here. A lawyer for Kolomoisky did not immediately respond to written requests for comment about asset seizures. The tycoon's lawyers have not commented on the embezzlement case. Kolomoisky has denied wrongdoing in the past. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said it had frozen more than 3 billion hryvnia in assets in addition to nearly 1,000 properties and more than 1,600 vehicles and vessels from the former owner of lender PrivatBank. The NABU statement did not name Kolomoisky. Kolomoisky is a former owner of PrivatBank, which was nationalised in late 2016 as part of a clean-up of the Ukrainian banking system. He is among the tycoons who built their fortunes in the ashes of the Soviet Union and amassed political power in Ukraine's fragile post-Soviet democracy. The moves against him come as Kyiv is trying to signal progress during a wartime crackdown on corruption that is important to its hopes of joining the European Union. Ukrainian officials have also said that \"de-oligarchisation\" is an important step to building a stronger state after the war with Russia.

Photograph: Jussi Nukari\/Shutterstock Ukraine This article is more than 1 year old Ex-Nato chief proposes Ukraine joins without Russian-occupied territories This article is more than 1 year old Former secretary general says partial membership would warn Russia it cannot stop Ukraine joining the alliance Patrick Wintour Diplomatic Editor Sat 11 Nov 2023 10.18 GMT Last modified on Sat 11 Nov 2023 13.03 GMT Share A former Nato secretary general has put forward a proposal for Ukraine to join the military alliance but stripped of the territories occupied by Russia. Anders Fogh Rasmussen has long worked alongside Andriy Yermak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, particularly ahead of the last Nato summit in Vilnius this year that ended with no invitation for Ukraine to join. The two men are again broadly discussing Ukraine\u2019s place in a new European security architecture, including practical questions around the extent of Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership. Rasmussen, who was Nato\u2019s secretary general between 2009 and 2014, insisted that a plan for partial Ukraine membership would not symbolise a freezing of the conflict, but would instead mark a determination to warn Russia that it cannot prevent Ukraine joining the western defensive alliance. Nato is due to hold its 75th anniversary summit in Washington next summer, and the issue of Ukraine\u2019s future membership is bound to be a major topic. Ukraine\u2019s leadership was left bitterly disappointed when, under US and German pressure, Nato at its summit this year issued a statement saying Ukraine would be offered an invitation when conditions allowed, effectively rejecting Ukraine\u2019s request to be given a specific date. Instead, Ukraine\u2019s relationship with Nato was elevated on the margins by setting up a Ukraine-Nato council and through an agreement that Nato members bilaterally would offer security guarantees to Ukraine. Rasmussen said the cause of Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership cannot be deferred again next year. He said: \u201cThe time has come to take the next step and extend an invitation for Ukraine to join Nato. We need a new European security architecture in which Ukraine is in the heart of Nato.\u201d Those advocating for Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership have been hamstrung by the near-impossibility of a country at war being offered membership, since under Nato\u2019s article 5 clause of collective self-defence, all Nato member states are required to come to the active defence of the country in conflict. Nato membership for all of Ukraine now would in effect be a notice to Russia by Nato that it was about to go to war with Moscow. By excluding from Nato territory held by Russia, the threat of a Russia-Nato conflict would be reduced, Rasmussen argues. Rasmussen denied the move would freeze the conflict, ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. He said: \u201cThe absolute credibility of article 5 guarantees would deter Russia from mounting attacks inside the Ukrainian territory inside Nato and so free up Ukrainian forces to go to the frontline.\u201d He said: \u201cTo make article 5 credible there would have to be a clear message to Russia that any violation of Nato territory would be met by a response.\u201d He said in some ways the proposal is similar to imposing a no-fly zone on Russia so that it could not fly over Ukrainian territory or send missiles into Ukrainian towns. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rasmussen said an imprecise precedent existed since west Germany joined the alliance in 1955, and article 5 covered its territory but not that of east Germany. He set out three principal reasons for Ukraine to be offered membership. Ukraine inside Nato would act as a bulwark against a still-aggressive Russia. Second, he said: \u201cWe have to realise that grey zones are danger zones. Neutrality in the old sense of the world does not exist any more. Grey zones become a temptation for Putin to attack.\u201d Finally, he argued the Ukrainian army is now the most battle hardened army in Europe and would be an asset and example to other European powers.

( AFP: HO\/Anti-Terrorists Operation ) abc.net.au\/news\/ukraine-bus-attack-leaves-10-civilians-dead-several-wounded\/6015548 Link copied Share Share article At least 10 civilians have been killed and many others wounded near a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine after a passenger bus came under heavy fire. Local police said the intercity bus suffered a direct hit near a checkpoint controlled by Ukrainian government forces. Photographs taken at the scene showed the bus and seats inside it peppered by holes. A long trail of blood marked the road beside where it stood near the town of Volnovakha. The bus was attacked by rebels using Grad rocket launchers while it was carrying civilians through a checkpoint, a regional Ukrainian administration spokesman said. \"Ten people have been killed and at least 13 are wounded,\" he said. However rebel forces denied Ukrainian police reports that pro-Moscow separatists were likely to be responsible. They said it was likely the shelling was from a stray rocket that was intended to hit troops guarding that checkpoint. The war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels broke out soon after Russia annexed Crimea last year, creating the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War. Western governments accuse Russia of backing the separatists, including by sending in troops, which it denies. Attempts to organise a peace summit this week have been abandoned because of a lack of progress towards ending the crisis that has cost nearly 5,000 lives since April last year. There were hopes talks involving Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France would result in a ceasefire that would actually hold, instead of the daily clashes that cost military and civilian lives. A senior official from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) called for maximum restraint from all sides in the conflict. \"Over the past 24 hours the situation has significantly deteriorated, especially near the Donetsk airport,\" said Ertugrul Apakan, head of the OSCE special monitoring mission in Ukraine. \"More civilian casualties have been reported elsewhere.\" ABC\/wires More on this story: Former Ukraine leader Yanukovych added to Interpol wanted list Attacks reported, drone spotted in eastern Ukraine despite ceasefire: military Ukraine 'ready for total war' with  Russia, Poroshenko says Explained: Ukraine conflict in maps Posted Tue 13 Jan 2015 at 8:45pm Tuesday 13 Jan 2015 at 8:45pm Tue 13 Jan 2015 at 8:45pm , updated Tue 13 Jan 2015 at 10:37pm Tuesday 13 Jan 2015 at 10:37pm Tue 13 Jan 2015 at 10:37pm Share options Copy link Facebook X\u00a0(formerly\u00a0Twitter) Top Stories This navy veteran overcame a suicide attack and losing his legs to march with his son Topic: ANZAC Day Photo shows A father stands with his arm around his young son's shoulders at war memorial.

Media caption, Drone footage filmed on Sunday shows the war-torn remains of Donetsk's airport Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Donetsk airport's main terminal, scene of bitter fighting in recent weeks. The government said the military still retained control of parts of the airport, but six soldiers had died and 16 had been wounded. In the centre of the rebel-held city, shelling hit a bus, killing 13 people. A spokesman for the president said he had called an emergency meeting to discuss the rebel attacks, which Kiev believes are backed by Russia. It was the second such meeting of the day. \"The plan how we will secure the end of operation of terrorist troops with the participation of regular troops of the Russian Federation... how to regroup forces and stop the aggression\" will be adopted on Wednesday evening, Reuters news agency quoted President Petro Poroshenko as saying. Earlier rebels paraded captured Ukrainian soldiers at the scene of the bus shelling, as onlookers shouted abuse and pelted them with debris from the blast site. The rebels and the government traded blame for the attack, which comes nine days after a shell also killed 13 people on a bus in the village of Buhas outside Volnovakha, 35km (22 miles) south-west of Donetsk.

Both sides seemed to be battling for new ground, keen to strengthen their negotiating positions. Instead, the violence derailed the talks. This conflict is costing Ukraine dearly, financially and in lives lost. But Ukrainian President Poroshenko has called up more troops, vowing to \"get Donbass back\". Russia is also paying a high price for supporting the insurgents, under Western sanctions. Perhaps that is why this week Moscow said it had persuaded the rebels to pull back from the original ceasefire line. But events on the ground move fast. And beyond the politics, this fight has become deeply personal. So much blood has now been spilled that whatever sparked the latest violence, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stop.

Media caption, \"It does remind us how this conflict is escalating,\" reports David Stern in Kiev 'Saboteurs' The airport just outside Donetsk, which has been reduced to rubble, has taken on symbolic value for both separatists and the government over the winter. Ukraine's defence ministry said 20 Ukrainian soldiers had withdrawn from the main terminal because their positions had been destroyed and they were under direct shelling. The loss of the main terminal is a major blow to pro-Kiev forces and will send political shockwaves back to the capital, the BBC's David Stern reports from Kiev. The defence ministry blamed separatists for the shelling of the trolleybus in the city centre, saying their own forces were 15km away. But the rebels blamed pro-government \"saboteurs\" in the city. Captured Ukrainian soldiers were led to the blast site by rebels who appeared to do little to stop people hitting them. \"They have to be punished, like Saddam Hussein,\" pensioner and local resident Zina told AFP news agency. \"They are killers. They killed our children. Our children cry every day.\" But another pensioner, Lyuda, said she was \"ashamed of what is happening\". \"I have pity for them,\" she said, weeping.

More than 4,800 people have been killed and some 1.2 million displaced since pro-Russian rebels seized parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions in April. The insurrection began after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March - weeks after Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych had been ousted. There have been reports of fighting in recent days near the town of Slovyanoserbsk, north-west of Luhansk - an indication that violence is spreading beyond the Donetsk region. Ukraine says Russia has more than 9,000 soldiers fighting alongside the rebels, a claim that Moscow denies. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday there had been a recent build-up in the numbers of Russian tanks and other heavy military equipment in eastern Ukraine. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich repeated Russian denials of intervention in Ukraine. \"We know that there are some Russians that fight on the side of those regions in Ukraine - some people that are coming on their own and fight,\" he told the BBC. \"We're trying to make sure that those people [in eastern Ukraine] are protected and to preserve their rights,\" he said. \"We need a peaceful Ukraine.\"","question":"What was the outcome of the shelling on a civilian bus in Donetsk in January 2015?","answer":"Thirteen people were killed in the explosion.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043b\u0443 \u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441\u0430 \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0443 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 2015 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0423 \u0432\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0445\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0456\u0431.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0423 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 2015 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043b\u0443 \u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441\u0430 \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0449\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0448\u0435 13 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439, \u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434 10 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides the same key information as the expected answer, which is that 13 people died in the attack.

Share Scores Dead, Injured As Missiles Hit Ukraine Military HQ, Civilian Area In Kramatorsk share Print President Petro Poroshenko said there are a \"significant\" number of casualties after missiles hit Ukraine's military headquarters and a residential area in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. The government later announced at least 15 people had been killed and more than 60 wounded in the February 10 attack. Poroshenko told parliament on February 10 that the attack hit the headquarters of the \"Antiterrorist Operation,\" as Kyiv calls the fight against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, and several civilian houses. He said both civilians and military officers were injured. The Kyiv-controlled Donetsk regional administration said the rockets were fired from the separatist-held area of Horlivka, which is about 50 kilometers from Kramatorsk. Eduard Basurin, a self-proclaimed separatist defense official, said the rebels \"did not strike Kramatorsk\" and contended that it was out of their range. On Twitter, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt wrote: \"We condemn Russian-backed separatist shelling of civilian areas #Kramatorsk.\" The body of a woman killed by shelling lies in a residential area in the eastern town of Kramatorsk on February 10. The missile attack came after a month of intense fighting that has prompted a diplomatic push for peace and added to Western pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the United States and NATO have called upon to abandon support for the rebels and withdraw troops and arms from Ukraine. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, who brought a peace proposal to Kyiv and Moscow last week, may meet with Putin and Poroshenko in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on February 11, but prospects for the talks were uncertain. Forces on both sides in the conflict claimed territorial gains ahead of the proposed talks. Ukraine\u2019s volunteer Azov battalion said on social media on February 10 that it has captured several villages northeast of Mariupol, pushing Russian-backed separatists away from the strategic Azov Sea port city. Rebel military spokesman Eduard Basurin said late on February 9 that separatist forces have surrounded the town of Debaltseve, a transport hub, cutting it off from a major highway.

Debaltseve has been the site of some of the fiercest fighting in the recent escalation of the conflict, which has killed more than 5,350 people since April. The United States has said the escalation is the result of a \"Russian-backed offensive\" by rebels in violation of an agreement signed in Minsk in September on a cease-fire and steps toward peace. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Stelmakh said on February 10 that there had been \"an increase in attacks by the enemy on Ukrainian positions\" in eastern Ukraine during the previous 24 hours. He said seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 23 wounded.

Steinmeier said much work must be done on \u201copen points\u201d before the meeting could take place. Russian President Vladimir Putin also has said the Minsk summit would not take place if the four leaders fail to agree on a \"number of points\" beforehand. Denis Pushilin, a leader of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk province, was in Minsk on February 10 for an expected meeting of a Contact Group that includes representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and the OSCE. A Ukrainian military truck tows a tank damaged during fighting with pro-Russian separatist forces outside Debaltseve on February 10. In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama says he is considering the option of sending lethal defensive weapons to Kyiv \"if diplomacy fails\" to end the war. Speaking after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on February 9, Obama said he hoped that a diplomatic solution was still possible. But he also said it is clear that Russia has violated the commitments it made on Ukraine under the deal reached in Minsk in September. Obama said: \"It's clear that they violated just about every commitment they made in the Minsk agreement. Instead of withdrawing from eastern Ukraine, Russian forces continued to operate there, training separatists and helping to coordinate attacks. Instead of withdrawing its arms, Russia has sent in more tanks and armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery.\" Putin has said he will not give in to Western ultimatums. In a telegram sent to Russian diplomats on February 10, Putin said that \u201cno matter how much pressure is put on us,\u201d Russia \u201cwill continue to pursue an independent foreign policy, to support the fundamental interests of our people and in line with global security and stability.\u201d Earlier on February 9, Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko accused Russia of sending an additional 1,500 troops and more than 300 military vehicles into eastern Ukraine during the previous two days. Last month, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that some 9,000 Russian troops were in Ukraine with 500 military vehicles, including tanks, Grad missile launchers, and heavy artillery.

Eliot focuses on the weapons used in the conflict in Syria, and open source investigation tools and techniques.

Of particular interest were BPM-97\u00a0mine-resistant, ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles\u00a0that feature briefly in the video.  These Russian vehicles are not used by the Ukrainian military, and their presence inside Ukraine would be compelling evidence Russia has sent military vehicles into Ukraine.

{"year":"2015","month":"01","event_desc":"- An attack on an open-air market in Mariupol, Ukraine leaves at least 27 people killed and more than 90 injured.  The pro-Russian rebel leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, announces an offensive on Mariupol.","text":"Pro-Russian rebels attack key port; Ukraine says at least 30 dead By Alessandra Prentice and Pavel Polityuk January 24, 2015 11:18 PM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Item 1 of 2 Ukrainian servicemen stand guard on a street near the burning building after a shelling by pro-Russian rebels of a residential sector in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine, January 24, 2015.

REUTERS\/Nikolai Ryabchenko Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab KIEV (Reuters) - Pro-Russian rebels launched an offensive against the strategic port of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, prompting the European Union's foreign policy chief to warn of a further \"grave deterioration\" in EU-Russian relations. Mariupol's city administration said the rebels had killed at least 30 people and injured 83 others by firing rockets from long-range GRAD missile systems. The city of 500,000, on the Sea of Azov, is vital for eastern Ukraine's steel and grain exports and straddles the coastal route from the Russian border to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula in southern Ukraine seized by Russia last March. President Petro Poroshenko, pledging to protect Ukrainian territory, said he would convene an emergency meeting of his country's security council on Sunday. \"Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. This will be the best possible monument to all our dead,\" Russia's RIA news agency quoted rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko as saying at a memorial ceremony in the separatist-held city of Donetsk. Zakharchenko said the separatists also planned to encircle Debaltseve, a town northeast of Donetsk, in the next few days, Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. Eastern Ukraine has seen an escalation of fighting in recent days that Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed on Kiev. The rebels have ruled out more peace talks. Poroshenko responded angrily to the fighting in Mariupol, a city the rebels tried to capture last autumn before a fragile ceasefire was agreed in eastern Ukraine. Kiev fears the rebels want to build a land bridge from Russia to Crimea. \"We are for peace, but we accept the challenge of the enemy. We will protect our motherland,\" Poroshenko said in a statement. EU AND U.S CONDEMN ATTACK EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini condemned the Mariupol attack and urged Moscow to lean on the rebel leaders. \"I ... call openly upon Russia to use its considerable influence over separatist leaders and to stop any form of military, political or financial support,\" Mogherini said. In a conversation with Poroshenko, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden condemned \"the attacks and violence in eastern Ukraine initiated by Russia-backed separatists,\" the White House said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to Zurich, said in a statement that the separatists' assault has been aided by Russia's \"irresponsible and dangerous decision to resupply them in recent weeks with hundreds of new pieces of advanced weaponry, including rocket systems, heavy artillery, tanks, armoured vehicles, in addition to continuing operational command and control.\" Moscow denies sending forces and weapons to east Ukraine, despite what Kiev and the West say is irrefutable proof. Last week Poroshenko said Russia had 9,000 troops stationed in his country and demanded their immediate withdrawal. The nine-month conflict, in which more than 5,000 people have been killed, has triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Russia and the West since the Cold War. Saturday's attack on Mariupol started in the early morning, said pensioner Leonid Vasilenko, 76, who lives in an eastern suburb of the city. \"The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house,\" he said by telephone. \"I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.\" Additional reporting by Lina Kushch, Alexander Winning in Moscow, Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Warren Strobel in Zurich; Editing by Gareth Jones and Leslie Adler Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: World Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Europe category Trump tells Putin to 'STOP' after Russian attack kills 12 in Kyiv 2:56 PM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago India category Pakistan closes air space for Indian airlines, warns against water treaty violation as ties plummet 1:51 PM UTC Europe category Pope Francis' funeral will feature huge security operation in Rome 3:03 PM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago World category China pushes for tariff cancellation to end US trade war 10:34 AM UTC","question":"What was the outcome of the pro-Russian rebel attack on Mariupol in January 2015?","answer":"The attack left at least 27 people dead and more than 90 injured.","region":"Ukraine","question_translated":"\u042f\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0456\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0443 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 2015 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443?","answer_translated":"\u0412\u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0449\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0448\u0435 27 \u043e\u0441\u0456\u0431, \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434 90 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f.","model_answer":"Answer: \u0412\u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0456\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0443 \u0441\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0456 2015 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0456\u0439\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043b \u0436\u0438\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0456\u0432 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430, \u0449\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0434\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043b\u0456 \u0449\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0448\u0435 30 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0456\u0432 \u0456 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434 100 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043b \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0432 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u0440\u0443\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0456\u043d\u0444\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0456\u0432.","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides a detailed account of the attack, including the number of casualties and injuries, which differs from the expected answer.

Media caption, For Putin \"this crisis over Ukraine is part of a wider battle - what he sees as Western aggression in his sphere of influence\", reports Lyse Doucet A peace plan drawn up by France and Germany is \"one of the last chances\" to end the conflict in east Ukraine, French leader Francois Hollande says. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was unclear if the plan would succeed, but it was \"definitely worth trying\". Mr Hollande said the plan would include a demilitarised zone of 50-70km (31-44 miles) around the current front line. The leaders are attempting to end the fighting in Ukraine between government troops and pro-Russia rebels. Russia is accused of arming pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine - claims it denies. Mr Hollande and Mrs Merkel are due to discuss the peace plan with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko by telephone on Sunday. Few details have emerged, but the plan is thought to be an attempt to revive a failed ceasefire deal signed in Minsk, in Belarus, in September. Since then, the rebels have seized more ground, raising alarm in Kiev and among Ukraine's backers. The UN says fighting has left nearly 5,400 people dead since April, when the rebels seized a big swathe of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions following Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Diplomatic talks have been continuing at an international security conference in the German city of Munich, where Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he \"sincerely\" hoped the latest peace plan would \"produce results\". Mrs Merkel told the conference that while there was no guarantee diplomacy would succeed, it was essential to try. \"I believe we owe that much to those who are affected in Ukraine,\" she said. Mr Hollande told French TV that eastern Ukrainian regions would need extensive autonomy. \"These people have gone to war,\" he said. \"It will be difficult to make them share a common life.\" Image source, AP Image caption, Rebels say they have captured the town of Vuhlehirsk in Donetsk The US is considering pleas to send weapons to Ukraine but Mrs Merkel said she could not \"imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian army leads to President Putin being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily\". The statement put her in opposition to Nato's top military commander, US Air Force general Philip Breedlove, who told reporters that Western allies should not \"preclude out of hand the possibility of the military option\". Analysis: Jonathan Marcus, BBC News, Munich The escalating winter war in Ukraine provides a grim backdrop to the talks in Munich. Behind the scenes here there have been serious efforts to try to breathe life into the peace process. But in public nobody was pulling any punches. US Vice-President Joe Biden made clear Washington's distrust of the Russians and its determination to \"allow Ukraine to defend itself\". Could that mean giving it weapons? That's the way US thinking seems to be going, to the horror of most of its European allies. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel for one spoke out passionately against such a move. But there's really no new peace plan in the offing, only a revamp of the old one that was never implemented - the Minsk Agreement of last year. If diplomacy fails and President Barack Obama goes ahead with arms deliveries to Ukraine, it may not only divide Nato, but provoke an even more aggressive Russian response. Bombs beyond the battle zone Why is east Ukraine hit by conflict? What was Minsk ceasefire deal? The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says that any peace plan would have to address the route of any new ceasefire line - given the rebel advances of recent weeks - how to enforce it, and the future status of the conflict zone. Russia is still denying any direct role in the conflict, while Kiev insists above all that Ukraine must remain united, our correspondent says. In Munich, Mr Poroshenko brandished what he said were passports of Russian troops who had come to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that he had seen evidence of increased supply of heavy military weapons to the rebels, some \"very advanced - they can only come from Russia\".

Five Ukrainian security forces were killed and 25 were wounded in fighting with the separatists, Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said. He said at least 129 violations of the ceasefire have already taken place \u2013 ranging from small arms fire to mortar attacks. But pro-Russian separatists have also blamed Ukraine for violations.

The ceasefire went into effect more than 24 hours earlier, at midnight Saturday night. Monday was slated to be a key day in the truce \u2013 when both sides are supposed to withdraw heavy weapons. But neither has done so. The Ukrainian army still has plans to pull heavy weapons out of the area, but it won\u2019t happen until the situation is quiet, Chalov said. \u201cWe emphasize that our military will only fire in response,\u201d Lysenko told reporters Monday.

Petro Poroshenko also accused Russia of \"significantly increasing\" its offensive despite the peace agreement reached in Minsk on Thursday. The US ambassador to Ukraine tweeted a satellite image , external that he said showed Russian artillery near Debaltseve. Shelling was heard in the rebel-held city of Donetsk early on Saturday. Fierce battles are said to be continuing around Debaltseve - a strategic government-held town almost encircled by pro-Russian rebel forces - and outside the southern port city of Mariupol. The BBC's David Stern in Kiev says that as the clock ticks down to the ceasefire, fears are rising that it won't be observed. Ukraine's military said on Saturday morning that seven service personnel had been killed and 23 wounded over the past 24 hours. \"Ahead of midnight (time of planned ceasefire) rebels are trying to complete tactically important plans to enlarge the territory under their control,\" spokesman Andriy Lysenko.

The US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, also said on Twitter , external that Russian units along the border were preparing a large shipment of supplies to separatist fighters. He pointed to satellite images of what he said was Russian artillery north of Debaltseve, taken on Thursday. 'Escalation expected' Correspondents say the fighting shows no sign of stopping. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Petro Mekhed said the rebels wanted to \"raise their flag\" over Debaltseve and Mariupol before the midnight ceasefire (22:00 GMT) kicked in. \"Ukraine is expecting an escalation and taking all necessary measures to be able to respond,\" Mr Mekhed told reporters.

Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed rebels failed Tuesday to start pulling back heavy weaponry from the front line in eastern Ukraine as a deadline passed to do so. Under a cease-fire agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France last week, the warring sides were to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line on Tuesday.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. 48.4457 38.2615 LUHANSKE, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Under a near-constant barrage of artillery fire, Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels fought fierce street battles Tuesday for control of the strategic railway hub of Debaltseve, a battle impeding implementation of a peace plan. Ukraine denied rebel claims to have taken control of the town but acknowledged the separatists had seized parts of it. The battle came despite a weekend cease-fire that obliged both sides to start moving back their big guns on Tuesday. A key railroad junction between the separatist east's two main cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, Debaltseve has been the focus of fighting over the past two weeks and capturing it would be a prize for the Russia-backed rebels. The defense ministry said street battles continued there Tuesday and government soldiers had been ambushed and taken prisoner, but gave no details on how many were seized. Rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin said hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered in Debaltseve. Associated Press journalists were turned back by Ukrainian forces at Luhanske, a village about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north of Debaltseve and were unable to assess the status of the fight. The leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, one of two separatist entities, was wounded in the leg and hospitalized in the neighboring Luhansk region, Russia's RIA-Novosti news agency quoted a Luhansk rebel official as saying. Zakharchenko's life was not in danger, the report said. The Ukrainian presidential office called on the European Union and NATO to condemn the Russia-backed rebels for violating the cease-fire brokered by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France last week. Vice President Joe Biden condemned violations of the cease-fire in eastern Ukraine which the White House is blaming on pro-Russian separatists and Russian forces. Biden spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The White House said the violation occurred in and around Debaltseve and it was confirmed by special monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Biden also condemned Russia and the separatists for blocking the monitors' access and said that has allowed the separatists to continue attacks unabated. He said if Russia keeps violating the agreements reached with Ukraine, costs for Russia will increase. The war in eastern Ukraine has already killed more than 5,600 people and displaced more than a million, the United Nations said Monday. It has also left the country's industrial heartland in ruins. On Tuesday, a deadline passed for both sides to begin pulling back heavy weapons from the front line. Rebel commander Vladimir Kononov said on Russian television that most of Debaltseve was under separatist control and urged the Ukrainian troops to surrender. \"Their only choice is to leave behind weaponry, lay down arms and surrender,\" he said. The announcement by the rebels came after fierce fighting that appeared to be focused on Debaltseve. Both sides in the conflict claim the town is on their side of the cease-fire line, and the issue was not resolved under the cease-fire deal. Rebel official Basurin announced in a televised briefing that the separatists \"will take the initiative\" and begin to pull back their big guns from some sections of the front line. He did not provide a timeline. The Ukrainian government, however, insisted on a comprehensive cease-fire before pulling back its weaponry. AP reporters saw near-constant artillery rounds fired Tuesday from Ukrainian government positions at rebel fighters around Debaltseve. Sustained shelling was heard in the area all morning, some coming from Grad rocket launchers. \"The situation in Debaltseve is extremely complicated and is changing by the hour,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Andruy Lysenko said late Tuesday. \"Several groups of the enemy have burst into the city.\" The cease-fire deal, which was to take effect early Sunday, specifies the pullout begin on the second day after the parties stop fighting. This condition has not been met, Lysenko said. \"As soon as the fire ceases ... we will be ready to begin the withdrawal,\" he said. Fighting has stopped or subsided in some parts of war-torn eastern Ukraine, however. Basurin said Tuesday the separatists had not seen any violations of the cease-fire in the area around the rebel stronghold of Donetsk since 8 p.m. Monday. The continued fighting comes as concern remains about whether the United States will decide to send lethal weapons to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday at a news conference in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, that, \"according to our information, these weapons are already being delivered.\" He did not elaborate but said the consequences of new weapons for Ukraine would be \"the number of victims, of course, can increase. But the result will be the same as it is today. This is unavoidable.\" He also suggested the Ukrainian forces in Debaltseve should lay down their arms. \"I reckon that the leaders of the fighters ... would not hold these people, prevent them from leaving the conflict zone and returning to their families,\" he said. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that the U.N. was \"alarmed\" by reports of continued shelling and has not been able to get reliable information on casualties or the well-being of civilians. \"It is unclear how many civilians are still there,\" he said. \"We are particularly concerned about the civilians trapped in the area. We believe there may be a few thousand hiding in cellars, struggling to get food, water and other basic necessities.\" Elsewhere, at least one rebel leader claimed that his troops had begun to withdraw their heavy weapons. \"I was at the front line last night, and our tanks, our artillery were pulling back,\" Igor Plotnitsky, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, northeast of Debaltseve, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency Tass. His claims could not be independently. However, Lysenko said Ukrainian troops \"have not noticed any such actions\" on the ground.

{"year":"2015","month":"03","event_desc":"- At least 17 miners die in a suspected gas explosion at the Zasyadko coal mine in rebel-held eastern Ukraine.","text":"Ukraine coal mine: Dozens feared dead in Zasyadko gas blast Published 4 March 2015 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Injured miner: \"When I came to, there was dust everywhere\" A suspected methane gas blast at a mine in a rebel-held area of east Ukraine is believed to have killed at least 30 people, the rebels told the BBC. They only confirmed 23 deaths at the Zasyadko coal mine. Ukraine's officials say as many as 33 people may have died. There are fears the rebels lack the resources to deal with the disaster, the BBC's Tom Burridge reports. Zasyadko was the scene of Ukraine's worst mine disaster nearly eight years ago, when 101 people were killed. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has demanded access to the mine for government rescuers and police. The mine is close to a front line where the pro-Russian rebels have been battling Ukrainian government troops. However, Ukraine's mine unions head Mykhailo Volynets told a Ukrainian TV channel there had been no fighting in the area in recent days. While Ukraine's economy has significantly shrunk since fighting began in April, many coal mines continue to operate in the conflict zone. Mining safety standards are poor, and there are frequent accidents. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Confusion surrounded the death toll in the hours after the blast, which occurred more than 1,000m (3,200ft) underground at 05:20 local time (03:20 GMT). In the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev, speaker Volodymyr Hroisman announced that 32 people had been killed and called for a minute's silence. However, he later retracted the figure, saying instead that one person was dead and the fate of about 30 others was unknown.

But the Ukraine-controlled Donetsk regional administration said later on Wednesday that 33 people died, and nine bodies had already been recovered. It is known that, at the time of the blast, 230 people were in the shaft. About 200 have now been accounted for. The sister of one miner who was in the pit at the time of the explosion, Alexei Novoselsky, stood at the entrance to the mine, in tears, Reuters reports. \"Tell me, are there survivors?\" she asked a passing rescue worker. \"Why are you concealing the truth?\" A welder at the mine, who gave his name as Oleg, said: \"I've been down the pit for 23 years, and this is the fourth explosion that I can recall. \"If they didn't get them out straight away, then later they will only retrieve bodies. An explosion is a terrible thing.\" The mine is one of Ukraine's biggest coal producers. At the end of last year, the mine was reportedly still supplying coal to coke and chemical works owned by Ukraine's wealthiest businessman, Rinat Akhmetov, in Donetsk region. Analysis: Olexiy Solohubenko, Ukraine analyst, BBC News Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Miners in eastern Ukraine have continued to work despite the ongoing conflict In the old coal-mining area of Donbas, the Zasyadko mine is one of the newest. It started operations in 1958 and is now said to be part-owned by Yukhym Zvyahilsky, a local leader with money and influence who was once an acting prime minister of Ukraine and is now an MP. The mine is also one of the most dangerous. It is deep and it has particularly hazardous levels of methane.  The year 2007 was particularly bad. It saw three accidents, the worst of which claimed the lives of 101 miners. In normal circumstances Ukraine has an established rescue procedure. There are many skilled local rescuers helped by teams that are brought in quickly from other parts of Ukraine. But these are not normal times. The war in eastern Ukraine caused a lot of material damage to infrastructure, power supply and road links across the Donbas. It also ruptured the existing links with central authorities. It is unlikely that the rebels will talk to Kiev and allow the rescue teams in but will they turn to Russia for help? Whatever the death toll of this accident, it adds to the depressing statistics in this part of Ukraine where the UN has reported more than 6,000 people killed by the conflict that is tearing it apart.
