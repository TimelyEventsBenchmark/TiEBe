'Remorseless, godless, callous' In recent months, Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) has intensified its attacks on Christians, security personnel and aid workers, setting up roadblocks on main roads and conducting searches. A previous video, seen by Reuters News Agency, said the captives had been taken from Maiduguri and Damaturu in Nigeria's northeast, where fighters have been attempting for years to set up a separate state under Islamic law. In that earlier video, the captives pleaded for the Christian Association of Nigeria and President Muhammadu Buhari \u00c2\u00a0to intervene and save them.\u00c2 191221181251739 On Friday, Buhari condemned the purported killers as \"remorseless, godless, callous gangs of mass murderers that have given Islam a bad name through their atrocities\".

The proposed legislation -\u00c2 officially named the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill 2019 - would allow\u00c2 Nigeria 's government to cut off internet access or block specific social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter at its own discretion. \"The law enforcement department may direct the NCC [Nigerian Communications Commission]\u00c2\u00a0to order the Internet access service provider to disable access by users in Nigeria to the online location and the NCC must give the Internet access service provider access blocking order,\" it says. More: How internet blackouts are going global Why the Global South should nationalise its data Transcript: Is there any way to combat misinformation online? Otherwise known as the Social Media Bill, the proposed act\u00c2\u00a0also contains provisions prohibiting statements online deemed \"likely to be prejudicial to national security\" and \"those which may diminish public confidence\" in Nigeria's government - offences that would be punishable by fines of up to 300,000 Naira ($825) or imprisonment for up to three years. Legislators backing the bill, which is advancing through Nigeria's Parliament, claim it will enhance security, peace and unity in Africa 's most populous country by\u00c2\u00a0curbing the spread of \"false statements\". But critics argue it could gag free speech, with many now\u00c2\u00a0speaking out\u00c2 via the very platforms they say are at risk of being curtailed. More than 85,000 people have\u00c2 signed \u00c2\u00a0an online petition demanding the bill be done away with.\u00c2\u00a0The bill's \"aim is to curb our use of social media with the reasoning that the Senate wants to curb the spreading of false information when in reality they want to limit our freedom of speech and our right to criticise them\", the petition says. A campaign on Twitter saw the\u00c2\u00a0#SayNoToSocialMediaBill hashtag\u00c2 top the platform's trending charts\u00c2\u00a0in Nigeria recently. \"The Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill ... is a backdoor approach to silence critical voices in Nigeria,\" said Adeboye Adegoke, a digital rights advocate and programme manager at the Nigeria-based social enterprise Paradigm Initiative. \"[It is a] dangerous path to tread ... [and] will serve to provide a legitimate justification for many illegitimate things that the Nigerian government already do,\" he told Al Jazeera. Legislative progress Despite the opposition, the legislation has continued its passage through Nigeria's legislature, passing a second reading and subsequent vote in the Senate in late November. It has since been moved to the Senate's Committee on\u00c2\u00a0Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters \u00c2 for a period of further consideration which could last up to four weeks.\u00c2 Senator Godiya Akwashiki, a spokesman for the Nigerian Senate, said the open discussions would allow for citizens' concerns over the effect of the bill to be aired. \"Nigerians still have a say over the bill during the public hearing,\" Akwashiki told Al Jazeera.\u00c2 \"[It] is an opportunity for the general public to express their views, in order [for them] to be captured in the bill.\"\u00c2 A spokesman for President Muhammadu\u00c2\u00a0Buhari meanwhile told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity that the government had \"not made a position\" yet on the act, which was introduced by legislators and has not been sponsored by the administration. Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have raised the alarm over the bill's possible effect on public discourse in a country\u00c2 with an estimated 113 million\u00c2 internet users ,\u00c2 30 million of whom are\u00c2 active on social media. \"Social media is one of the last remaining places where Nigerians can express their opinions freely,\"\u00c2\u00a0Seun Bakare,\u00c2\u00a0programmes manager for Amnesty's Nigeria branch,\u00c2\u00a0said in a\u00c2 statement \u00c2\u00a0on December 4. \"The harassment of journalists and bloggers and the introduction of the Cyber Crimes Act have already shrunk the civic space and created a climate of fear,\"\u00c2\u00a0Bakare added, citing a 2015 piece of legislation that criminalised a broad range of online activity. 'Problematic for many reasons' Other critics have meanwhile argued the legislation would not only prove restrictive, but also ineffective. Berhan Taye, a senior policy analyst at global internet advocacy organisation Access Now and leader of the group's #KeepItOn campaign in Africa, said the bill was \"extremely problematic for many reasons\". According to Taye, the provisions allowing for internet access to be cut off would not solve more fundamental problems about the veracity of content being shared online - a major talking point in Nigeria's latest presidential election in February. \"An internet shutdown does not solve the problems of disinformation and misinformation,\" Taye told Al Jazeera, adding that \"fake news is a global problem\". Any such move could also have major ramifications for Nigeria's economy, with a 24-hour blackout projected to cost $134m, according to the Cost of Shutdown Tool developed by non-profit organisation The Internet Society and Netblocks, a non-governmental internet governance observatory. However, supporters of the Social Media Bill have cast aside such concerns, arguing it can be applied effectively and deliver transformative security benefits. Senator Muhammad Sani Musa, a member of Buhari's political party and a co-sponsor of the legislation, said it would help stop the spread of fake news in Nigeria and hence curtail groups seeking to undermine the country's cohesion. \"Individuals and groups influenced by ideologies and deep-seated prejudices in different countries are using internet falsehood to surreptitiously promote their causes, as we have seen in Nigeria with the insurgency of Boko Haram ,\" Musa said while defending the bill in November.

In a statement posted on its website Thursday, the electoral commission said it was making the announcements well ahead \u201cin order to ensure certainty in our dates for elections, and to allow for proper planning by the Commission, political parties, security agencies, candidates and all stakeholders\u201d. \u201cTo that extent, the 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections will hold on Saturday, 16th February 2019, while the Governorship\/State Assembly\/Federal Capital Territory Area Council Elections will hold on Saturday 2nd March 2019.\u201d The commission also announced that 23 of its electoral officers being prosecuted for various electoral offences will be placed on half salary and will not report for duty pending the determination of their respective cases by the court. Read the full statement: Gentlemen of the Press, You are all welcome to yet another briefing, which is in fulfillment of our pledge to regularly brief the public on the Commission\u2019s activities. 1. Our democracy is maturing and the Commission believes that there should be certainty with regard to the timetable for elections. For instance, in the United States, general elections always hold on the second PRESS Tuesday of November in the election year. In Ghana, it\u2019s the 7th of December of the election year, while in other places like Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Costa Rica and Switzerland, the dates are also known in advance. In Nigeria, the constitution provides for elections to hold not earlier than 150 days and not later than 30 days to the end of the incumbent\u2019s tenure. In order to ensure certainty in our dates for elections, and to allow for proper planning by the Commission, political parties, security agencies, candidates and all stakeholders, the Commission has decided to fix the date for the National Elections for the third Saturday in February of the election year, followed by State elections two weeks later. To that extent, the 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections will hold on Saturday, 16th February 2019, while the Governorship\/State Assembly\/Federal Capital Territory Area Council Elections will hold on Saturday 2nd March 2019. 2. The Commission has also received a Report from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) of the Federation, informing us that 23 Electoral Officers indicted over the investigation into the 10th December Rivers Re-run elections have been charged to court. The Commission has repeatedly said that it will cooperate with security agencies for the prosecution of any of our staff found to have violated the integrity of the electoral process. Accordingly, at our meeting today, the Commission decided to apply the provisions of the INEC Terms and Conditions of Service to all those charged to court, since it constitutes gross misconduct. The penalty for this is interdiction. All the 23 Electoral Officers will be placed on half salary and will not report for duty pending the determination of their respective cases by the court. 3. Ladies and gentlemen, you will recall that last week, we informed you that a decision would be taken this week on the recommendation by the Disciplinary Committee on staff members indicted by the EFCC Report for misconduct during the 2015 General Elections. However, in view of the fact that some of the staff are also among those being prosecuted by the DPP, the Commission has decided to defer its decision on the EFCC Report to enable us reconcile the EFCC\/DPP reports. 4. And as part of our routine consultations with our stakeholders, the Commission has decided to hold the next regular quarterly meetings with stakeholders as follows: A. Tuesday 14th March \u2013Meeting with Political Parties B. Wednesday 15th March \u2013 Meeting with Civil Society Organizations C. Friday 17th March \u2013 Meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES). D. Monday March 21 \u2013 Meeting with Media organizations. Our invitations have been sent to the respective stakeholders 5. We wish to assure all Nigerians that the Commission will remain fully committed to the sanctity of the electoral process and will never protect any of its staff, no matter highly placed, found to have violated the provisions of the Electoral Act and our guidelines.

The attack happened on Sunday evening in the town of Madagali, in the north of Adamawa state, which has been repeatedly targeted despite a military counter-offensive against the Islamist rebels. \"They killed seven people and burnt 10 houses,\" said the former chairman of the Madagali local government area, Maina Ularamu, who said soldiers pursued the attackers into the bush. \"We are calling on the security agencies to launch a mission... to flush out the insurgents because they use the bush as their operational base from where they attack Madagali and its environs.\" Adamawa police spokesman Abubakar Othman confirmed Ularamu's account and said two people were injured. Madagali and nearby towns and villages have been repeatedly hit by Boko Haram raids in recent months, as they are pushed out of their Sambisa Forest stronghold just across the border in Borno state. On December 28, two female suicide bombers struck a market in Madagali, killing at least 30 people -- one of seven attacks last month that largely targeted hard-to-reach locations. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari had four days earlier declared the Islamic State group affiliate as \"technically\" defeated as a result of a months-long counter-offensive by troops. But security analysts believe the insurgents could be lying low until the military lowers its guard, as happened in 2013, when a state of emergency was declared in three northeastern states. Boko Haram increased the frequency and intensity of its campaign to create a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria in 2014, seizing swathes of territory in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. To underline the persistent threat, seven people were killed in a raid in the Gwoza area of Borno last week, while security fears remain after cross-border attacks in Niger, Chad and Cameroon. - AFP Comment Now COMMENTS Discussion Policy RELATED STORIES Nigeria president ready to negotiate Chibok girls release 31 December 2015 A total of 276 girls were taken from their school in the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014 by Boko Haram fighters, in a case that made global headlines.

The four-count charge against Mohammed, who was a former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was brought by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). BAM Project and Properties Ltd is listed as the other defendant. The prosecution said the defendants on March 17, 2015, under the jurisdiction of the court, took possession of N300 million from the Office of the National Security Adviser (NSA). It said Mohammed and his son ought to have known that the fund formed part of proceeds of an unlawful activity of the former NSA, retired Col. Sambo Dasuki. Dasuki is currently standing trial for alleged misappropriation of  2.1 billion dollars meant for the purchase of arms for the military. The prosecution said the ex-minister and his son committed an offence contrary to Section 15(2)(d) of the Money Laundering Act of 2011 as amended in 2012. It further held that the crime was punishable under Section 15 (3) of the law, which carries 14 years jail term for a convict. The prosecution accused the suspects of receiving the fund through a transfer from the account of the Office of the National Security Adviser for political campaigns, among others. However, the accused persons pleaded not guilty to the allegations. Mr. Abdulazeez Ibrahim and Mr. Ogala Osoka, counsel to the ex-minister and his son respectively filed bail applications for them. They urged the court to grant their clients bail on the grounds of ill health and personal recognition for the ex-minister, in particular. According to them, the accused persons will not jump bail and are prepared to clear their names from the charges. The counsel to the defendants also argued that the alleged offences were bailable. Opposing the applications, Mr. Aliyu Yusuf, the prosecution counsel, said the applicants failed to depose to how their remand in prison would aggravate their illnesses. According to him, the clinic in the Kuje Prison is equipped enough to handle any health situation. The presiding judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, reserved ruling on the applications till Thursday. The judge said: \u201cMeanwhile, the first accused person (Abba Mohammed) is to be remanded in the Kuje Prison while the second accused person (Bello Mohamed) is granted the permission to return to the Abuja Clinic on admission. \u201cI, therefore, hand his custody while in the Abuja Clinic to the Inspector-General of Police.\u201d The ex-minister is currently recuperating in the hospital from a surgery he had in the UK.

Acceptable Conditions of Work EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Nigeria is a federal republic composed of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). In 2015 citizens elected President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress party to a four-year term in the first successful democratic transfer of power from a sitting president in the country\u2019s history. Civilian authorities did not always maintain effective control over the security services. The insurgency in the Northeast by the militant terrorist group Boko Haram, and its splinter group Islamic State-West Africa, continued. The military drove the insurgents out of major population centers, but they remained in control of rural areas and capable of conducting complex attacks and suicide bombings. Casualty figures increased, and reports of serious human rights abuses by both Boko Haram and security forces continued. The most serious human rights abuses included those committed by Boko Haram, which conducted numerous attacks on government and civilian targets that resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, widespread destruction, the internal displacement of 1.8 million persons, and the external displacement of an estimated 191,000 Nigerian refugees to neighboring countries, principally Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. In its response to Boko Haram attacks, and at times in response to crime and insecurity in general, security services perpetrated extrajudicial killings and engaged in torture, rape, arbitrary detention, mistreatment of detainees, looting, and destruction of property. The country also suffered from ethnic, regional, and religious violence. Other serious human rights problems included vigilante killings; prolonged pretrial detention, often in poor conditions and with limited independent oversight; civilian detentions in military facilities, often based on flimsy evidence; denial of fair public trial; executive influence on the judiciary; infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy rights; restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and movement; official corruption; violence against women and children, including female genital mutilation\/cutting; sexual exploitation of children; trafficking in persons; early and forced marriages; discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; discrimination based on ethnicity, regional origin, religion, and disability; forced and bonded labor; and child labor. The government took few steps to investigate or prosecute officials who committed violations, whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the government, and impunity remained widespread at all levels of government. The government did not investigate or prosecute most of the major outstanding allegations of human rights violations by the security forces or the majority of cases of police or military extortion or other abuse of power. Boko Haram\u2019s numerous attacks often targeted civilians. The group, which recruited and forcefully conscripted child soldiers, carried out bombings\u2013including suicide bombings\u2013and other attacks on population centers in the Northeast and in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. The government investigated these attacks but prosecuted few members of Boko Haram; it detained the vast majority of suspected Boko Haram supporters in military custody without charge. Abductions by the group continued. The group subjected many abducted women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence, including forced marriages and rape. The government investigated attacks but rarely prosecuted Boko Haram members; it detained the vast majority of suspected Boko Haram supporters in military custody without charge. The United Nations and other international organizations reported that vigilante groups, collectively known as the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), which at times aligned with the military against Boko Haram, continued to recruit and use, sometimes by force, child soldiers. The government prohibited these actions and maintained that CJTF forces aligned with the government did not employ child soldiers. Nonetheless, the Borno State government continued to provide financial and in-kind resources to some members of the CJTF, which was also at times aligned with the Nigerian military in operations against Boko Haram. Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from: a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings There were numerous reports the government or its agents committed numerous arbitrary and unlawful killings. The national police, army, and other security services used lethal and excessive force to disperse protesters and apprehend criminals and suspects and committed other extrajudicial killings. Authorities generally did not hold police, military, or other security force personnel accountable for the use of excessive or deadly force or for the deaths of persons in custody. State and federal panels of inquiry investigating suspicious deaths did not make their findings public. The use by security services of excessive force, including live ammunition, to deal with protesters and disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings. On February 9, police and military personnel reportedly used live ammunition to disperse protesting members or supporters of the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) movement at a school in Aba, Abia State, killing at least nine. In June Amnesty International (AI) published the findings of an investigation, concluding that on May 29-30, police and military personnel in Onitsha, Anambra State, killed at least 17 IPOB members or supporters ahead of a planned political demonstration. According to a September AI report, since August 2015 security forces killed at least 150 IPOB members or supporters and arbitrarily arrested hundreds. As of December the government had not investigated these incidents. In January the government of Kaduna State appointed a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the December 2015 killing by Nigerian Army (NA) forces of members of the Shia group Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) in Zaria, Kaduna State. The federal government indicated it would wait for the results of this investigation before taking action, claiming it would be the most acceptable course of action. During the proceedings, from which the IMN abstained, claiming bias against the group, Kaduna officials revealed the existence of a mass grave holding the remains of 347 IMN members killed by the NA. The government of Kaduna made public the commission\u2019s nonbinding report on July 31. According to the document, 348 IMN members and one soldier died during the December 2015 altercations, which were followed by the government\u2019s destruction of IMN religious sites and property in and around Zaria. The commission found the NA used \u201cexcessive and disproportionate\u201d force and recommended the federal government conduct an independent investigation and prosecute anyone found to have acted unlawfully. It also called for the proscription of the IMN and the monitoring of its members and their activities. In December the government of Kaduna published a white paper accepting the commission\u2019s recommendation to investigate and prosecute allegations of excessive and disproportionate use of force by the NA. It also accepted the recommendation to hold IMN leader Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky responsible for all illegal acts committed by IMN members during the altercations and in the preceding 30 years. A federal court in December declared the continued detention without charge of Zakzaky and his wife illegal and unconstitutional. The court ordered the immediate and unconditional release of the IMN leader and his spouse but gave authorities 45 days to carry it out, reasoning that the government needed that time to provide the couple with a dwelling to replace the one destroyed in the wake of the 2015 Zaria incidents. As of December more than two hundred imprisoned IMN members continued to await trial on charges of conspiracy and culpable homicide. Security forces were allegedly responsible for extrajudicial killings, often arbitrarily killing many individuals at one time. For example, in August military personnel entered a village in Bosso Local Government Area (LGA), Niger State, and allegedly killed seven civilians for denying soldiers permission to enter their houses and search for arms and ammunition. The government of Niger State set up a commission of inquiry to investigate. As of December it had not issued a report. There were reports of arbitrary and unlawful killings related to internal conflicts in the Northeast and other areas (see section 1.g.). b. Disappearance According to AI, on August 16, armed men in a sport utility vehicle bearing government license plates shot and abducted pro-Biafra activist Sunday Chucks Obasi outside his home in Amuko Nnewi, Anambra State. In response to inquiries by his family, police in Anambra stated Obasi was not in their custody. As of December his whereabouts remained unknown. Criminal groups continued to abduct civilians in the Niger Delta and the Southeast, often to collect ransom payments. For example, according to press reports, in June gunmen kidnapped as many as seven cement company contractors, including several expatriates, in the outskirts of Calabar, Cross River State. The kidnappers released the men unharmed several days later. Other parts of the country continued to experience a significant number of abductions. Prominent and wealthy figures were often targets of abduction. For example, in March gunmen kidnapped, and later killed, NA Colonel Samaila Inusa in Kaduna State. In April kidnappers briefly abducted former minister of education Senator Iyabo Anisulowo in Ogun State, allegedly releasing him after a ransom payment. Boko Haram continued to conduct large-scale abductions in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States (see section 1.g.). c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment The constitution and law prohibit torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), passed in 2015, prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of arrestees; however, it fails to prescribe penalties for violators. Each state must also individually adopt the ACJA for the legislation to apply beyond the FCT and federal agencies. As of December only the states of Anambra, Ekiti, Enugu, and Lagos had adopted it. Final passage of an antitorture bill, initially passed in 2015 by both houses of the National Assembly but returned by President Buhari to the Senate for amendments, was pending. The Ministry of Justice established a National Committee against Torture (NCAT). Lack of legal and operational independence and lack of funding, however, continued to prevent NCAT from carrying out its work effectively. The law prohibits the introduction into trials of evidence and confessions obtained through torture. Authorities did not respect this prohibition, however, and police often used torture to extract confessions later used to try suspects. Police also repeatedly mistreated civilians to extort money. In September AI reported police officers in the Special Antirobbery Squad (SARS) regularly tortured detainees in custody as a means of extracting confessions and bribes. For example, SARS officers in Enugu State reportedly beat one victim with machetes and heavy sticks, releasing him only after payment of 25,500 naira ($81). In response to AI\u2019s findings, the inspector general of police reportedly admonished SARS commanders and announced broad reforms to correct SARS units\u2019 failures to follow due process and their use of excessive force. Local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international human rights groups continued to accuse the security services of illegal detention, inhuman treatment, and torture of demonstrators, criminal suspects, militants, detainees, and prisoners. Military and police reportedly used a wide range of torture methods, including beatings, shootings, nail and tooth extractions, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. According to reports, security services committed rape and other forms of violence against women and girls, often with impunity. For example, in July a police inspector allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl in Mkpat Enin, Akwa Ibom State. As of December there were no reports of any investigation into the incident. Police continued to use a technique commonly referred to as \u201cparading\u201d of arrestees, which involved walking arrestees through public spaces and subjecting them to public ridicule and abuse. Bystanders often taunted and hurled food and other objects at arrestees. The sharia courts in 12 northern states may prescribe punishments such as caning, amputation, and death by stoning. The sharia criminal procedure code allows defendants 30 days to appeal sentences involving mutilation or death to a higher sharia court. Statutory law mandates state governors treat all court decisions equally, including amputation or death sentences, regardless of whether issued by a sharia or a non-sharia court. Authorities, however, often did not carry out caning, amputation, and stoning sentences passed by sharia courts because defendants frequently appealed, a process that could be lengthy. Federal appellate courts had not ruled on whether such punishments violate the constitution because no relevant cases had reached the federal level. Although sharia appellate courts consistently overturned stoning and amputation sentences on procedural or evidentiary grounds, there were no challenges on constitutional grounds. There were no reports of canings during the year. Defendants generally did not challenge caning sentences in court as a violation of statutory law. Sharia courts usually carried out caning immediately. In some cases convicted individuals paid fines or went to prison in lieu of caning. In January a sharia court in Kano confirmed the death sentence for blasphemy of an Islamic cleric and eight others. They had allegedly made blasphemous statements the previous May at a religious gathering in honor of the founder of the Tijaniya sect. As of December the case remained on appeal. Prison and Detention Center Conditions Prison and detention center conditions remained harsh and life threatening. Prisoners and detainees were reportedly subjected to extrajudicial execution, torture, gross overcrowding, food and water shortages, and other abuses. The government often detained suspected militants outside the formal prison system (see section 1.g). Physical Conditions : Overcrowding was a significant problem. Although the total designed capacity of the country\u2019s prisons was 50,153 inmates, as of March they held 63,142 prisoners. Approximately 72 percent of inmates were in pretrial detention or remanded. There were 1,225 female inmates as of September 2015. Authorities sometimes held female and male prisoners together, especially in rural areas. In 2013 the NPS reported there were 847 juvenile inmates in juvenile detention centers, but prison authorities often held juvenile suspects with adults. Prisoners and detainees, the majority of whom had not been tried, were reportedly subjected to extrajudicial execution, torture, gross overcrowding, food and water shortages, inadequate medical treatment, deliberate and incidental exposure to heat and sun, and infrastructure deficiencies that led to wholly inadequate sanitary conditions that could result in death. Guards and prison officials reportedly extorted inmates or levied fees on them to pay for food, prison maintenance, and release from prison. Female inmates in some cases faced the threat of rape. Most of the 240 prisons were 70 to 80 years old and lacked basic facilities. Lack of potable water, inadequate sewage facilities, and severe overcrowding resulted in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. Disease remained pervasive in cramped, poorly ventilated prison facilities, which had chronic shortages of medical supplies. Inadequate medical treatment caused many prisoners to die from treatable illnesses, such as HIV\/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Although authorities attempted to isolate persons with communicable diseases, facilities often lacked adequate space, and inmates with these illnesses lived with the general prison population. There were no reliable statistics on the number of prison deaths during the year. Only prisoners with money or support from their families had sufficient food. Prison officials routinely stole money provided for prisoners\u2019 food. Poor inmates often relied on handouts from others to survive. Prison officials, police, and other security force personnel often denied inmates food and medical treatment to punish them or extort money. In general prisons had no facilities to care for pregnant women or nursing mothers. Infants born to inmate mothers usually remained with the mother until weaned. Although the law prohibits the imprisonment of children, minors\u2013many of whom were born in prison\u2013lived in the prisons. According to the Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS), in 2013 there were 69 infants in prison with their mothers. Results of a survey of women and children in prisons conducted by CURE-Nigeria and released in March revealed many children in custody did not receive routine immunizations, and authorities made few provisions to accommodate their physical needs, to include hygiene items, proper bedding, proper food, and recreation areas. According to a report by the NGO CURE-Nigeria, female inmates largely relied on charitable organizations to obtain female hygiene items. Generally, prisons made few efforts to provide mental health services or other accommodations to prisoners with mental disabilities (see section 6). Several unofficial military prisons reported by domestic and international human rights groups\u2013including the Giwa Barracks facility in Maiduguri, Borno State\u2013continued to operate (see section 1.g.). In May AI reported that at least 149 individuals, including 12 children and babies, had died since January at Giwa Barracks. According to the report, overcrowding coupled with disease and inadequate access to food and water were the most likely causes of the increase in mortality at the installation. The military reportedly detained many of those at Giwa Barracks during arbitrary mass arrests based on random profiling rather than reasonable suspicion of supporting Boko Haram. The military publicly denied the findings of the report but worked with the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and by October had released 876 children previously detained at the facility. It was unclear following their release how many other children or adults remained in detention at Giwa Barracks or other unofficial detention facilities. In 2014 AI reported the mass extrajudicial executions of more than 600 recaptured prisoners at Giwa Barracks following an escape attempt. In 2013 AI had revealed the existence of previously unknown military detention facilities in the Northeast\u2013including Giwa Barracks, and the Sector Alpha (also called \u201cGuantanamo\u201d) and Presidential Lodge (also called \u201cthe Guardroom\u201d) facilities in Damaturu, Yobe State. According to AI, the military subjected detainees in them to inhuman and degrading treatment; hundreds allegedly died due to of extrajudicial killings, beatings, torture, or starvation. In response to the Giwa Barracks allegations, the military indicated it would conduct an investigation. As of December the military had not released any reports of an investigation. Administration : Recordkeeping on prisoners was inadequate, and authorities did not take steps to improve it. Authorities maintained records for individual prisoners in paper form inconsistently and did not make them widely accessible. While prison authorities allowed visitors within a scheduled timeframe, few visits occurred, largely due to lack of family resources and travel distances. The country does not have an ombudsman to serve on behalf of convicted prisoners and detainees. The ACJA provides that the chief judge of each state, or any magistrate designated by the chief judge, shall conduct monthly inspections of police stations and other places of detention within the magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction, other than prisons, and may inspect records of arrests, direct the arraignment of suspects, and grant bail if previously refused but appropriate. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) conducts prison audits and in September announced the start of a new one. Despite an expressed willingness and ability to investigate credible allegations of inhuman conditions, however, the last audit report it publicly released was in 2012. Through its Legal Aid Council, the Ministry of Justice reportedly provided some monitoring of prisons under the Federal Government Prison Decongestion Program. Independent Monitoring : There was limited monitoring of prisons by independent nongovernmental observers. The International Committee of the Red Cross continued to have access to police detention and NPS facilities. It was also able to visit some military detention facilities. Improvements : Some individual attorneys general and prison administrators worked to improve local facilities and processes. CURE-Nigeria worked with the chief justice of the FCT to review the cases of FCT inmates incarcerated in neighboring states while awaiting trial or after having served their sentences. d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention Although the constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, police and security services employed these practices. According to numerous reports, since 2013 the military arbitrarily arrested and detained\u2013often in unmonitored military detention facilities\u2013thousands of persons in the context of the fight against Boko Haram in the Northeast (see section 1.g.). In their prosecution of corruption cases, law enforcement and intelligence agencies often failed to follow due process and arrested suspects without appropriate arrest and search warrants. ROLE OF THE POLICE AND SECURITY APPARATUS The National Police Force (NPF) is the country\u2019s largest law enforcement agency. An inspector general of police, appointed by the president and reporting to the minister of interior, commands the NPF. In addition to traditional police responsibilities of maintaining law and order in communities in each of the states and the FCT, the inspector general oversees law enforcement operations throughout the country involving border security, marine (navigation) matters, and counterterrorism. A state commissioner of police, nominated by the inspector general and approved by the state governor, commands NPF forces in each of the states and the FCT. Although administratively controlled by the inspector general, operationally the state commissioner reports to the governor. In the event of societal violence or emergencies, such as endemic terrorist activity or national disasters that necessitate the temporary deployment to a state of additional law enforcement resources, the governor may also assume operational control of these forces. The Department of State Services (DSS) is responsible for internal security and reports to the president through the national security adviser. Several other federal organizations have law enforcement components, such as the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Attorney General\u2019s Office, Ministry of Interior, and federal courts. Due to the inability of law enforcement forces to control societal violence, the government increasingly turned to the armed forces in many cases. In July, for example, the military launched Operation Accord to tackle an increase in the number of herder-farmer conflicts throughout the country. The police, DSS, and military reported to civilian authorities but periodically acted outside civilian control. The government lacked effective mechanisms and sufficient political will to investigate and punish security force abuse and corruption. The police and military remained susceptible to corruption, committed human rights abuses, and operated with widespread impunity in the apprehension, illegal detention, torture, and extrajudicial execution of suspects. The DSS also reportedly committed human rights abuses. In some cases private citizens or the government brought charges against perpetrators of human rights abuses, but most cases lingered in court or went unresolved after an initial investigation. In the armed forces, a soldier\u2019s commanding officer determined disciplinary action, and the decision was subject to review by the chain of command under the Armed Forces Act. In March the army announced the creation of a human rights desk to investigate complaints of human rights violations brought by civilians, although as of December that office\u2019s mandate remained unclear and no investigations had been formally initiated. ARREST PROCEDURES AND TREATMENT OF DETAINEES Police and other security services have the authority to arrest individuals without first obtaining warrants if they have reasonable suspicion a person committed an offense, a power they often abused. The law requires that, even under a state of emergency, detainees must appear before a magistrate within 48 hours and have access to lawyers and family members. In many instances government and security officials did not adhere to this regulation without being bribed. Police held for interrogation individuals found in the vicinity of a crime for periods ranging from a few hours to several months, and after their release, authorities frequently asked the individuals to return for further questioning. The law requires an arresting officer to inform the accused of charges at the time of arrest, transport the accused to a police station for processing within a reasonable time, and allow the suspect to obtain counsel and post bail. Families were afraid to approach military barracks used as detention facilities. Police routinely detained suspects without informing them of the charges against them or allowing access to counsel and family members; such detentions often included solicitation of bribes. Provision of bail often remained arbitrary or subject to extrajudicial influence. Judges often set exceedingly stringent bail conditions. In many areas with no functioning bail system, suspects remained incarcerated indefinitely under investigative detention. Authorities kept detainees incommunicado for long periods. Numerous detainees alleged police demanded bribes to take them to court hearings or to release them. If family members wanted to attend a trial, police often demanded additional payment. Arbitrary Arrest : Security force personnel arbitrarily arrested numerous persons during the year, although the number remained unknown. In the Northeast the military and members of vigilante groups, such as the CJTF, reportedly continued to round up individuals during mass arrests, often with no evidence against them. Security services detained journalists and demonstrators during the year (see sections 2.a. and 2.b.). Pretrial Detention : Lengthy pretrial detention remained a serious problem. According to NPS figures from March, 72 percent of the prison population consisted of detainees awaiting trial, often for years. The shortage of trial judges, trial backlogs, endemic corruption, bureaucratic inertia, and undue political influence seriously hampered the judicial system. In many cases multiple adjournments resulted in years-long delays. Many detainees had their cases adjourned because the NPF and the NPS did not have vehicles to transport them to court. Some persons remained in detention because authorities lost their case files. Detainee\u2019s Ability to Challenge Lawfulness of Detention before a Court : Detainees can challenge the lawfulness of their detention before a court and have the right to submit complaints to the NHRC. For example, in April an Abuja court ordered the EFCC to pay the sum of 10 million naira ($31,750) as damages to the former acting national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party after declaring his arrest and subsequent detention by the commission illegal. Nevertheless, most detainees found this approach ineffective because, even with legal representation, they often waited years to gain access to court. e. Denial of Fair Public Trial Although the constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, the judicial branch remained susceptible to pressure from the executive and legislative branches. Political leaders influenced the judiciary, particularly at the state and local levels. Understaffing, underfunding, inefficiency, and corruption prevented the judiciary from functioning adequately. Judges frequently failed to appear for trials. In addition, the pay for court officials was low, and they often lacked proper equipment and training. There was a widespread public perception that judges were easily bribed and litigants could not rely on the courts to render impartial judgments. Citizens encountered long delays and received requests from judicial officials for bribes to expedite cases or obtain favorable rulings. Although the Ministry of Justice implemented strict requirements for education and length of service for judges at the federal and state levels, no requirements or monitoring bodies existed for judges at the local level. This contributed to corruption and the miscarriage of justice in local courts. The constitution provides that, in addition to common law courts, states may establish courts based on sharia or customary (traditional) law. Sharia courts functioned in 12 northern states and the FCT. Customary courts functioned in most of the 36 states. The nature of a case and the consent of the parties usually determined what type of court had jurisdiction. In the case of sharia courts in the North, the impetus to establish them stemmed at least in part from perceptions of inefficiency, cost, and corruption in the common law system. The constitution specifically recognizes sharia courts for \u201ccivil proceedings,\u201d but they do not have the authority to compel participation by non-Muslims. Non-Muslims have the option to have their cases tried in the sharia courts if involved in civil disputes with Muslims. The constitution is silent on the use of sharia courts for criminal cases. In addition to civil matters, sharia courts also hear criminal cases if both complainant and defendant are Muslim and agree to the venue. Sharia courts may pass sentences based on the sharia penal code, including for \u201chudud\u201d offenses (serious criminal offenses with punishments prescribed in the Quran) that provide for punishments such as caning, amputation, and death by stoning. Despite constitutional language supporting only secular criminal courts and the prohibition against involuntary participation in sharia criminal courts, a Zamfara State law requires that a sharia court hear all criminal cases involving Muslims. Defendants have the right to challenge the constitutionality of sharia criminal statutes through the common law appellate courts. As of December no challenges with adequate legal standing had reached the common law appellate system. The highest appellate court for sharia-based decisions is the Supreme Court, staffed by common-law judges who are not required to have any formal training in the sharia penal code. Sharia law experts often advise them. TRIAL PROCEDURES Defendants are presumed innocent and enjoy the rights to: be informed promptly and in detail of charges (with free interpretation as necessary from the moment charged through all appeals); receive a fair and public trial without undue delay; be present at their trial; communicate with an attorney of choice (or have one provided at public expense); have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense; confront witnesses against them and present witnesses and evidence; not be compelled to testify or confess guilt; and appeal. The law grants defendants the right to apply directly or through a lawyer for access to government-held evidence. Authorities did not always respect these rights. Although accused persons are entitled to counsel of their choice, no law prevents a trial from going forward without counsel, except for certain offenses that carry the death penalty. Authorities held defendants in prison awaiting trial for periods well beyond the term allowed by law (see section 1.c.). Human rights groups alleged the government denied terror suspects detained by the military their rights to legal representation, due process, and to be heard by a judicial authority. Despite announcements in 2015 that the government was preparing to prosecute 350 Boko Haram suspects in custody, as of December there were no reports of the government initiating their prosecutions. Thousands of other individuals suspected of association with Boko Haram remained in detention with no investigations or prosecutions initiated against them. Under common law women and non-Muslims may testify in civil or criminal proceedings and give testimony that carries the same weight as testimony of other witnesses. Sharia courts usually accorded the testimony of women and non-Muslims less weight than that of Muslim men. Some sharia court judges allowed different evidentiary requirements for male and female defendants to prove adultery or fornication. Pregnancy, for example, was admissible evidence of a woman\u2019s adultery or fornication in some sharia courts. In contrast, sharia courts could convict men only if they confessed or there was eyewitness testimony. Sharia courts, however, provided women some benefits, including increased access to divorce, child custody, and alimony. Military courts tried only military personnel, but their judgments could be appealed to civilian courts. Members of the military are subject to the Armed Forces Act regarding civil and criminal matters. The operational commanding officer of a member of the armed forces must approve charges against that member. The commanding officer decides whether the accusation merits initiation of court-martial proceedings or lower-level disciplinary action. Such determinations are nominally subject to higher review, although the commanding officer makes the final decision. If the case proceeds, the accused is subject to trial by a four-member court-martial. The law provides for internal appeals before military councils as well as final appeal to the civilian Court of Appeals. In May the NA announced a special court-martial to try two generals on unspecified charges. In September the court convicted one of them of indiscipline and reduced his rank. In August the NA convened a court-martial to try 16 soldiers and four officers for offenses allegedly committed during operations in the Northeast. Their cases were pending as of December. POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES There were no new reports of political prisoners or detainees. Persons arrested in previous years for alleged treason remained in detention at year\u2019s end. CIVIL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES The constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary in civil matters, but the executive and legislative branches, as well as business interests, exerted influence and pressure in civil cases. Official corruption and lack of will to implement court decisions also interfered with due process. The law provides for access to the courts for redress of grievances, and courts may award damages and issue injunctions to stop or prevent a human rights violation, but the decisions of civil courts were difficult to enforce. f. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence The law prohibits arbitrary interference, but authorities reportedly infringed on these rights during the year, and police entered homes without judicial or other appropriate authorization. There were reports of warrantless arrests of young men in the Niger Delta region on suspicion of having links with militant groups. In their pursuit of corruption cases, law enforcement agencies reportedly carried out searches and arrests without warrants. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) continued to threaten to evict residents in communities not deemed in compliance with the Abuja city master plan. The FCDA typically claimed that demolished homes, businesses, or churches lacked proper permits (even if owners were able to produce documentation indicating the structures were built legally), were unsafe, or posed health hazards. Many civil society organizations and citizens claimed property developers with connections to government officials acquired vacated properties. No transparent legal process existed for deciding which homes the government would demolish. Persons who lost homes lacked recourse to appeal and received no compensation. Many observers viewed the demolitions as motivated primarily by corruption and discrimination based on socioeconomic class, since mostly lower- and middle-class persons lost their homes and property. For example, the government of Kaduna State issued demolition notices in March to residents of Gbagyi Villa despite a court injunction against the planned demolition. Residents claimed the government had not consulted with them or offered alternative housing or compensation. g. Abuses in Internal Conflict Killings : Units of the NA\u2019s Seventh and Eight Divisions, the NPF, and the DSS continued to carry out operations against Boko Haram in the Northeast. Some military forces allegedly killed suspected members of the group and engaged in retaliatory tactics against civilians believed to have harbored or associated with the group. Security forces also committed mass arrests of men and boys and torture. NGOs and former detainees alleged that starvation and other forms of torture by the military resulted in detainee deaths at military detention facilities, including Giwa Barracks. An AI report published in 2015 asserted that between 2013 and 2014, the military committed more than 1,200 extrajudicial killings in the course of operations against Boko Haram. In 2014 press and NGOs reported the NA illegally detained and killed suspected members of Boko Haram in Giwa Barracks, in one instance executing 622 prisoners following a Boko Haram attack on the installation. While President Buhari repeatedly reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to human rights, as of December there were no reports of investigations into or prosecutions for these incidents. Boko Haram continued its campaign of violence against secular authority and anyone perceived as disagreeing with the group\u2019s political or religious beliefs. While driven out of much of the territory it controlled in early 2015 and left only in control of some small towns and rural areas, the group was still capable of carrying out complex attacks and suicide bombings against civilian and military targets across the Northeast. Data compiled by an NGO based on media reports indicated approximately 2,900 persons (including civilians and fighters on both sides) died as a result of the conflict between Boko Haram and the government during the year. The terrorist group continued to attack population centers in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe. It also carried out attacks in Gombe. Women and children carried out many of the attacks. According to a study by UNICEF, nearly one in five suicide attacks by Boko Haram used a child, and more than two-thirds of the children were girls. On February 10, for example, two female suicide bombers ages 17 and 20 blew themselves up at an internally displaced persons\u2019 (IDP) camp in Dikwa, Borno State, killing 58 persons and wounding 78 others. Abductions : Allegations by NGOs and activists of enforced disappearances by security forces in the Northeast remained uninvestigated by the government as of October. One civil society-compiled list alone contained the names of 1,200 persons arrested in Borno State between 2011 and 2014 whose whereabouts remained unknown. Boko Haram continued to abduct men, women, and children, often in conjunction with attacks on communities. The group forced men, women, and children to fight on its behalf. Women and girls abducted by Boko Haram were subjected to physical and psychological abuse, forced labor, forced marriage, forced religious conversions, forced participation in military operations, and sexual abuse, including rape and sexual slavery. Boko Haram also used women and girls to lure security forces into ambushes, force payment of ransoms, and leverage prisoner exchanges. While some NGO reports estimated the number of Boko Haram abductees at more than 2,000, the total count of the missing was unknown since abductions continued, towns had repeatedly changed hands, and many families were still on the run or dispersed in IDP camps. Many abductees managed to escape Boko Haram captivity, but precise numbers remained unknown. As of November the military claimed to have rescued more than one thousand persons kidnapped by Boko Haram. Most of the 219 remaining students abducted by Boko Haram from the Chibok Government Girls Secondary School in 2014 remained in captivity. In May a vigilante group found one of the girls on the outskirts of Borno\u2019s Sambisa Forest, along with her baby and the man to whom Boko Haram had given her in marriage. In October the government confirmed the release of 21 of the kidnapped girls. Physical Abuse, Punishment, and Torture : Security services used excessive force in the pursuit of Boko Haram and other suspects, often resulting in arbitrary arrest, detention, or torture (see section 1.c.). Arbitrary mass arrests continued in the Northeast, and authorities reportedly held many individuals there in poor and life-threatening conditions. At one military detention facility, an NGO documented evidence indicating the presence of more than 120 boys between five and 16 years of age held incommunicado in a single cell. In 2015 AI reported that since 2009 security forces arbitrarily arrested approximately 20,000 persons in the region. Of these, AI estimated more than 7,000 died of thirst, starvation, suffocation, disease due to overcrowding, lack of medical attention, the use of fumigation chemicals in unventilated cells, and torture. Boko Haram engaged in widespread sexual violence against women and girls. Those who escaped or that security services or vigilante groups rescued faced ostracism by their communities and had difficulty obtaining appropriate medical and psychosocial treatment and care. Child Soldiers : Youths under age 18 participated in Boko Haram attacks. The group paid, forcibly conscripted, or otherwise coerced young boys and girls to serve in its ranks and perpetrate attacks and raids, plant improvised explosive devices, serve as spies, and carry out suicide bombings. According to an April UNICEF report, the number of boys and girls used by Boko Haram in suicide attacks rose sharply from four in 2014 to 44 in 2015. The group also used abducted girls as sex slaves and forced them to work for the group. In April the United Nations reported it had verified the recruitment during the year of 225 children by Boko Haram. Boko Haram used children to conduct suicide attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad. Although the government prohibited the recruitment and use of child soldiers, government security forces conducted on-the-ground coordination with vigilante groups, including the CJTF, some of which reportedly recruited and used children in hostilities. According to the United Nation\u2019s April report, the CJTF recruited and used 53 child soldiers during the year. These children manned checkpoints and served as messengers and spies. The Borno state government continued to provide financial and in-kind resources to some CJTF members. According to government officials, community members in the Northeast, and some international NGOs, only CJTF members who had been part of the Borno State Youth Empowerment Program\u2013a state-sponsored training and employment program whose participants underwent vetting to establish they were more than 18 years of age\u2013received any kind of support. Also see the Department of State\u2019s annual Trafficking in Persons Report at www.state.gov\/j\/tip\/rls\/tiprpt\/ . Other Conflict-related Abuses : As of August there were approximately 1.8 million persons internally displaced in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba, and Yobe. The Boko Haram insurgency was the main reason given for displacement by 97 percent of IDPs (see section 2.d.). Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: a. Freedom of Speech and Press Although the constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, the government frequently restricted these rights. Freedom of Speech and Expression : The constitution entitles every individual to \u201cfreedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\u201d Although federal and state governments usually respected this right, there were reported cases in which the government abridged the right to speech and other expression. Press and Media Freedoms : Freedom House\u2019s annual survey of media independence, Freedom of the Press 2016 , described the press as \u201cpartly free.\u201d A large and vibrant private domestic press frequently criticized the government. Because newspapers and television were relatively expensive and literacy levels low, radio remained the most important medium of mass communication and information. Violence and Harassment : Security services detained and harassed journalists, sometimes for reporting on sensitive problems such as political corruption and security. Security services including police occasionally arrested and detained journalists who criticized the government. For example, in May a journalist was driving to an assignment when he saw two police officers beating up a driver and his passenger by the side of the road. When he stopped to film the scene, one officer tried to prevent him from doing so while the other slapped him. After a struggle, the officers arrested the journalist and took him to the police station in Mushin LGA, Lagos State. After threatening him, the police released the journalist. In August EFCC agents arrested a popular blogger known as Abusidiqu after he published a post highly critical of the head of the EFCC. He was released two days later, amid widespread criticism of his arrest. Censorship or Content Restrictions : The government controlled much of the electronic media through the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), which is responsible for monitoring and regulating broadcast media. The law prohibits local television stations from transmitting programming from other countries except for special religious programs, sports programs, or events of national interest. Cable and satellite transmission was less restricted. For example, the NBC permitted live transmission of foreign news and programs on cable and satellite networks, but they must dedicate 20 percent of their programming time to local content. Journalists practiced self-censorship. Local NGOs claimed security services intimidated newspaper editors and owners into censoring reports of killings and other human rights abuses. Libel\/Slander Laws : Libel is a civil offense and requires defendants to prove the truth of the opinion or value judgment contained in news reports or editorials or pay penalties. This limited the circumstances in which media defendants could rely on the common law legal defense of \u201cfair comment on matters of public interest,\u201d and it restricted the right to freedom of expression. Defamation is a criminal offense carrying a penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and possible fines. INTERNET FREEDOM There were few government restrictions on access to the internet, but challenges with infrastructure and affordability persisted. Rising internet usage in the country was due to growing cell phone usage, although high-speed broadband penetration increased from 10 percent in 2014 to 14 percent during the year. According to the World Bank, 47 percent of individuals used the internet in 2015. Human rights advocates and business executives expressed concern over the inadequacy of laws to protect personal data and privacy rights. Some civil society organizations, government officials, and business executives expressed concern over the broad powers the Cybercrimes Act of 2015 gives law enforcement and other security agencies to intercept private communications. According to civil society organizations, business executives, and network providers, the government in the past conducted massive surveillance of citizens\u2019 telecommunications, and on occasion compelled network operators to release political dissidents\u2019 communication data. ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CULTURAL EVENTS There were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events. b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY Although the constitution and law provide for freedom of assembly, the government occasionally banned gatherings when it concluded their political, ethnic, or religious nature might lead to unrest. Open-air religious services held away from places of worship remained prohibited in many states, due to fears they might heighten interreligious tensions. In October several northern states enacted restrictions on religious activities shortly before the Shia commemoration of Ashura. When the IMN attempted to observe Ashura, security forces seeking to enforce the restrictions killed at least 15 IMN members. In November a similar situation between the IMN and the NPF during a pilgrimage march in Kano State resulted in the death of one police officer and more than 40 IMN members. The Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, a law prohibiting marriages and civil unions among persons of the same sex, criminalizes the free association of any persons through so-called gay organizations (see section 6, Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity). In areas that experienced societal violence, police and other security services permitted public meetings and demonstrations on a case-by-case basis. Security services continued to use excessive force to disperse demonstrators during the year (see section 1.a.). FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION The constitution and law provide for the right to associate freely with other persons in political parties, trade unions, or other special interest organizations. While the government generally respected this right, on occasion authorities abrogated it for some groups. In October the government of Kaduna State proscribed the IMN, alleging the group constituted a danger to public order and peace, and ordered the arrest of IMN spokesperson Ibrahim Musa for allegedly violating the ban. As of December Musa was in hiding. c. Freedom of Religion See the Department of State\u2019s International Religious Freedom Report at www.state.gov\/religiousfreedomreport\/ . d. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced Persons, Protection of Refugees, and Stateless Persons The constitution and law provide for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but security officials restricted freedom of movement at times by imposing curfews in areas experiencing terrorist attacks and ethnoreligious violence. The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and asylum seekers through the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants, and Internally Displaced Persons. In-country Movement : The federal, state, or local governments imposed curfews or otherwise restricted movement in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe in connection with operations against Boko Haram. Other states imposed curfews in reaction to events such as ethnoreligious violence. Police continued to conduct \u201cstop and search\u201d operations in cities and on major highways and, on occasion, set up checkpoints. Upon assuming office, the new inspector general of police renewed his predecessor\u2019s order to dismantle all checkpoints. Nonetheless, many checkpoints operated by military and police remained in place. Exile : There are no legal grounds for forced exile, and there were no examples of formal legal proceedings to exile a citizen. Some citizens chose self-exile for political reasons or for fear for their personal security. INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS In December the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported there were approximately 1.8 million persons displaced in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba, and Yobe. Insurgency was the main reasons for displacement, followed by communal clashes. The IOM estimated approximately 24 percent of IDPs lived in camps and camp-like settings and 76 percent with host families. More than half of the IDP population was female and 55 percent children under 18, 48 percent of them under five years of age. The true number of IDPs was likely much higher, as IOM\u2019s efforts did not encompass all states and did not include inaccessible areas of the Northeast. Food continued to be one of the IDPs\u2019 greatest immediate needs. The United Nations reported in December that 5.1 million persons in the three northeastern states, including most IDPs, were in urgent need of food assistance. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, 20 to 50 percent of children screened by October in recently accessible areas of Borno and Yobe States were acutely malnourished. According to NGOs, in Bama, Borno State, 120 IDPs died in May of starvation over the course of 10 days. In addition to food, IDPs faced shortfalls in clean water, health care, and shelter. After recognizing the severity of the crisis in the Northeast, in September the government appointed an interministerial task force to assess and revamp the response efforts of its various ministries, departments, and agencies. IDPs, especially those in the Northeast, continued to face severe protection issues. In April UNHCR published the results of a rapid protection assessment of IDPs in camps, settlements, and host communities in Maiduguri, Dikwa, and Damboa. In Maiduguri more than half of areas surveyed reported instances of survival sex in exchange for food or freedom to move in and out of IDP camps. Nearly half of all the areas surveyed reported rapes of women and girls in their camps and communities. A report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in October documented cases of rape and sexual exploitation of IDP women and girls committed by government officials and other authorities, including camp leaders, vigilante groups, police officers, and soldiers. The government responded quickly to HRW\u2019s findings, indicating it had already ordered investigations into the matter. In November the inspector general of police announced establishment of a special panel to investigate all the cases reported by HRW. Shortly after, the Borno Police Command announced it had deployed 100 female police officers to IDP camps. In December the inspector general announced the arrest of two police officers, one prison warden, two CJTF members, one civil servant, and three servicemen suspected of sexual misconduct toward IDPs. Slightly more than one-third of all sites in the UNHCR rapid protection assessment reported cases in which security services arrested and detained suspected Boko Haram members at IDP camps and in host communities; most families had not heard from the detainees since their arrest. Other protection concerns among respondents\u2019 included attacks or bombing, lack of accountability and diversion of humanitarian aid, drug abuse, hostility and insecurity, harassment of women and girls, and lack of humanitarian assistance for host communities. NGOs reported there were insufficient resources available to IDP victims of sexual and gender-based violence, who had limited access to safe, confidential psychosocial counseling and medical services or safe spaces. Women and girls abducted by Boko Haram, as well as the babies born as a result of rape during their captivity, faced stigmatization and community isolation. PROTECTION OF REFUGEES Access to Asylum : The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. According to UNHCR, as of November there were approximately 1,363 refugees (including more than 1,100 urban refugees) and 440 asylum seekers. They came mainly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Mali, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Togo, Sudan, and Guinea, the majority of them living in urban areas in Lagos and Ijebu Ode, in Ogun State. Employment : Refugees could move and work freely in the country but, like most citizens, had few opportunities for employment. Access to Basic Services : Refugees, like citizens, had poor access to police and the courts. Durable Solutions : The government, working with UNHCR, facilitated the voluntary repatriation of 616 Cameroonian refugees by February. It was also implementing a local integration work plan for protracted refugees. Temporary Protection : The government provided temporary protection to a few hundred individuals who may not qualify as refugees. Section 3. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process The law provides citizens the ability to choose their government in free and fair periodic elections based on universal and equal suffrage and conducted by secret ballot. The constitution and law allow the free formation of political parties. As of September, 40 parties were registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), an increase from the previous 28. The constitution requires political party sponsorship for all election candidates. Elections and Political Participation Recent Elections : INEC is the independent electoral body responsible for overseeing elections by regulating the process and preventing electoral misconduct. From November 2015 to August, INEC conducted 139 elections, including end of tenure and by-elections. There were allegations of malpractices in some elections, and INEC suspended 22 of them due to violence. Many elections, such as the Ondo State gubernatorial election in November, were relatively peaceful. Significant violence and intimidation of voters and election officials by political operatives, however, marred several of the off-cycle and rerun elections. As a result, INEC postponed elections in some states. There were several instances of INEC canceling, postponing, and rerunning gubernatorial or state legislative elections. In July INEC postponed rerun legislative elections in Rivers State. In the commission\u2019s view, incidents of violence in several of Rivers\u2019 LGAs, inflamed political rhetoric, and attacks against INEC facilities in the state threatened the exercise. The elections had originally taken place in 2015, but an election petition tribunal cancelled the results and ordered a rerun in response to a suit alleging intimidation of voters, unavailability of results sheets, the disappearance of electoral materials, and noncollation of results in several LGAs. According to NGO observers, serious irregularities marred the Three Rivers rerun elections in December. These included breach of the code of conduct and rules of engagement by the security forces and overt bias by electoral managers and others. There were serious cases of violence perpetrated by the NPF, NA, and DSS that resulted in several deaths. At least one police officer was killed. There was evidence of election malpractices and ballot hijacking by party agents under the watch of INEC and security agents. Civil society organizations reported no legal restrictions on their ability to comment or observe parts of the electoral process. They reported aspects of the electoral process, however, remained opaque, allegedly because of deliberate attempts to undermine or circumvent the integrity of the process by stakeholders or because of INEC\u2019s financial or logistical constraints. According to some civil society organizations, attempts to disenfranchise voters were on the rise through circumvention of permanent voter card procedures and targeted electoral violence. In response to some of these trends, INEC regularly cancelled votes from polling units that failed to use card readers properly. Participation of Women and Minorities : No laws prevent women or minority members from voting, running for office, or serving as electoral monitors. There were no incidents or reports of deliberate exclusion of any group from participating in the political process. Observers attributed fewer leadership opportunities for women in major parties and government, particularly in the North, to religious and cultural barriers. Women occupied approximately 5 percent of National Assembly seats, and six of the 36 cabinet members were women. Few women ran for elected office at the national level: in 2015 just 128 women of 746 total candidates (17 percent) and 270 of the 1,772 House of Representative candidates (15 percent) were women. Section 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Government Although the law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, the government did not implement the law effectively, and officials frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. Massive, widespread, and pervasive corruption affected all levels of government and the security services. The constitution provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for the president, vice president, governors, and deputy governors while in office. There were numerous reports of government corruption during the year. Corruption : The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) holds broad authorities to prosecute most forms of corruption. The EFCC writ extends only to financial and economic crimes. In October the ICPC had 82 prosecutions underway and 1,311 open investigations, and it had secured eight convictions between September 2015 and August. The EFCC had 66 corruption cases pending in court, had secured 13 convictions during the year, and had 598 open investigations. Although ICPC and EFCC anticorruption efforts remained largely focused on low- and mid-level government officials, following the 2015 presidential election both organizations started investigations into and brought indictments against various current and former high-level government officials. Many of these cases were pending in court. According to both ICPC and EFCC, the delays were the result of a lack of judges and the widespread practice of filing for and granting multiple adjournments. EFCC arrests and indictments of politicians continued throughout the year, implicating a significant number of opposition political figures and leading to allegations of partisan motivations on the part of the EFCC. In a case brought by the EFCC, in November a federal court convicted four firms allegedly used by a former aide of former president Goodluck Jonathan of laundering 1.67 billion naira ($5.3 million) in stolen funds. In its pursuit of corruption, the EFCC often did not observe all pertinent due process safeguards. In November the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice declared unlawful the arrest and detention in November 2015 of former national security advisor Sambo Dasuki. A court had released him on bail in a case brought by the EFCC for the alleged diversion of 13.6 billion naira ($43.2 million) intended to purchase military materiel during the Jonathan administration. In October and November, the DSS arrested several federal judges, including some Supreme Court justices, for corruption. Prominent civil society representatives denounced the arrests, alleging that as a domestic intelligence agency the DSS lacked the necessary law enforcement powers. Subsequent to their arrests, the government indicted some of the judges for various crimes, ranging from immigration violations to money laundering. Despite the announcement in 2015 of measures to tackle rampant police corruption and the 2013 propagation of a police code of conduct, as of November there were no reports of pending corruption cases against police officers. Financial Disclosure : The Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (CCBTA) requires public officials\u2013including the president, vice president, governors, deputy governors, cabinet ministers, and legislators (at both federal and state levels)\u2013to declare their assets to the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) before assuming and after leaving office. The constitution calls for the CCB to \u201cmake declarations available for inspection by any citizen of the country on such terms and conditions as the National Assembly may prescribe.\u201d The law does not address the publication of asset information. Violators risk prosecution, but cases rarely reached conclusion. In 2015 the CCB brought charges before the Code of Conduct Tribunal\u2013a court created by the CCBTA to try violations of that act\u2013against Senate President Bukola Saraki for false declaration of assets. In November the tribunal adjourned the trial until 2017. Public Access to Information : The law allows any person to request information from a government office. The office must grant access to the information, explain why access was denied within seven days of receiving the request, or transfer the request to the appropriate office within three days. By law all public offices must keep records and ensure that information, except as otherwise noted, is \u201cwidely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means, including print, electronic, and online sources.\u201d The law provides immunity for public officers against any form of civil or criminal proceeding for \u201cdisclosure in good faith of any information\u201d pursuant to the law, except for that information covered under the criminal code, penal code, and the Official Secrets Act. This exception hinders disclosure and access to information. The law provides a 30-day period during which anyone denied access by any public institution may submit the matter to court for a judicial review. The law includes a fine of 500,000 naira ($1,590) for any institution or public officer who wrongfully denies access to information or records. Destruction of records is a felony punishable by a minimum penalty of one year\u2019s imprisonment. Immunity from this law, however, is provided for the president, vice president, senate president, speaker of the House of Representatives, and all state governors. The law requires each public institution to submit an annual report on freedom of information requests and compliance to the attorney general and to make such information available to the public by various means; such information, however, was difficult to locate. Section 5. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights Domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials sometimes cooperated and responded to their views, but on some occasions dismissed allegations quickly without investigating the charges. Government Human Rights Bodies : The law establishes the NHRC as an independent nonjudicial mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights. The NHRC monitors human rights through its zonal affiliates in the country\u2019s six political regions. The NHRC investigates allegations of human rights abuses and publishes periodic reports detailing its findings, including torture and poor prison conditions. The law provides for recognition and enforcement of NHRC awards and recommendations as court decisions. Section 6. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons Women Rape and Domestic Violence : There is no comprehensive law for combatting violence against women. As a result, victims and survivors had little or no recourse to justice. While some, mostly southern, states enacted laws prohibiting some forms of gender violence or seeking to safeguard certain rights, a majority of states did not have such legislation. The Violence against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act addresses sexual violence, physical violence, psychological violence, harmful traditional practices, and socioeconomic violence. Under the VAPP, spousal battery, forceful ejection from the home, forced financial dependence or economic abuse, harmful widowhood practices, female genital mutilation\/cutting (FGM\/C), other harmful traditional practices, substance attacks (such as acid attacks), political violence, and violence by state actors (especially government security forces) are offenses. Victims and survivors of violence are entitled to comprehensive medical, psychological, social, and legal assistance by accredited service providers and government agencies, with their identities protected during court cases. Until adoption by the states, however, the provisions of the VAPP Act are only applicable to the FCT. The law criminalizes rape. The VAPP provides penalties ranging from 12 years\u2019 to life imprisonment for offenders older than 14 and a maximum of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment for all others. It also provides for a public register of convicted sexual offenders and appointment of protection officers at the local government level to coordinate with courts and ensure victims receive various forms of assistance (e.g., medical, psychosocial, legal, rehabilitative, reintegrative) provided by the VAPP. The act also includes provisions to protect the identity of rape victims and a provision empowering courts to award appropriate compensation to victims of rape. Rape remained widespread. According to a study, almost 20 percent of college students surveyed reported at least one incident of rape committed against them. In 2013 Positive Action for Treatment Access, an NGO focused on HIV treatment, released a countrywide survey of 1,000 preadolescents and adolescents (ages 10 to 19), which noted three in 10 girls reported their first sexual encounter was rape. Societal pressure and the stigma associated with rape reduced the percentage of rapes reported and the penalties imposed for conviction. Sentences for persons convicted of rape and sexual assault were inconsistent and often minor. No laws of nationwide applicability criminalize gender-based violence. The VAPP provides for up to three years\u2019 imprisonment, a maximum fine of 200,000 naira ($635), or both for spousal battery. It defines spousal\/partner battery as the intentional use of force or violence upon a person to include touching, beating, or striking with the intention of causing bodily harm. The act provides up to one year\u2019s imprisonment for anyone found guilty of intimidation by conveying a threat that induces fear, anxiety, or discomfort. It also authorizes courts to issue protection orders upon application by a victim and directs the appointment of a coordinator for the prevention of domestic violence to submit an annual report to the federal government. Notwithstanding these federal provisions, only the states of Cross River, Ebonyi, Jigawa, and Lagos had enacted domestic violence laws. Domestic violence remained widespread, and many considered it socially acceptable. The CLEEN Foundation\u2019s National Crime Victimization and Safety Survey for 2013 reported 30 percent of male and female respondents countrywide claimed to have been victims of domestic violence. Police often refused to intervene in domestic disputes or blamed the victim for provoking the abuse. In rural areas courts and police were reluctant to intervene to protect women who formally accused their husbands of abuse if the level of alleged abuse did not exceed local customary norms. Female Genital Mutilation\/Cutting (FGM\/C) : According to a UNICEF 2016 report, among women 15-49 years of age, 25 percent had undergone the practice. Mothers reported 17 percent of girls age 14 and younger had similarly undergone FGM\/C. The age at which women and girls underwent the practice varied from the first week of life until after a woman delivered her first child. Most victims underwent FGM\/C before their first birthday. In 2014 UNICEF reported the highest prevalence among women 15 to 49 years of age was in the Southwest (approximately 51 to 80 percent), followed by the Southeast and South (approximately 26 to 50 percent), and on a smaller scale in the North. The VAPP penalizes a person who performs female circumcision or genital mutilation with a maximum of four years in prison, a fine of 200,000 naira ($635), or both. It punishes anyone who aids or abets such a person with a maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment, a fine of 100,000 naira ($317), or both. For purposes of the act, female circumcision means cutting all or part of the external sex organs of a girl or woman other than on medical grounds. By law an offender is a person who performs FGM\/C; engages another to perform it; or incites, aids, abets, or counsels another person to perform FGM\/C. Federal law criminalizes female circumcision or genital mutilation, but the federal government took no legal action to curb the practice. While 12 states banned FGM\/C, once a state legislature criminalizes FGM\/C, NGOs found they had to convince local authorities that state laws apply in their districts. The Ministry of Health, women\u2019s groups, and many NGOs sponsored public awareness projects to educate communities about the health hazards of FGM\/C. Underfunding and logistical obstacles limited their contact with health-care workers. Other Harmful Traditional Practices : Under the VAPP, any person who subjects another to harmful traditional practices may be punished with up to four years in prison, a fine not exceeding 500,000 naira ($1,590), or both. Anyone subjecting a widow to harmful traditional practices is subject to two years\u2019 imprisonment, a fine not exceeding 500,000 naira ($1,590), or both. For purposes of the VAPP, a harmful traditional practice means all traditional behavior, attitudes, or practices that negatively affect the fundamental rights of women or girls, to include denial of inheritance or succession rights, FGM\/C or circumcision, forced marriage, and forced isolation from family and friends. Despite the federal law, purdah, the cultural practice of secluding women and pubescent girls from unrelated men, continued in parts of the North. In some parts of the country, widows experienced unfavorable conditions as a result of discriminatory traditional customs. \u201cConfinement,\u201d which occurred predominantly in the Northeast, remained the most common rite of deprivation for widows. Confined widows stayed under social restrictions for as long as one year and usually shaved their heads and dressed in black as part of a culturally mandated mourning period. In other areas communities viewed a widow as a part of her husband\u2019s property to be \u201cinherited\u201d by his family. In some traditional southern communities, widows fell under suspicion when their husbands died. To prove their innocence, they were forced to drink the water used to clean their deceased husbands\u2019 bodies. Sexual Harassment : Sexual harassment remained a common problem. No statutes prohibit sexual harassment, but authorities may prosecute violent harassment under assault statutes. The VAPP criminalizes stalking, with terms of imprisonment of up to two years, a maximum fine of 500,000 naira ($1,590), or both. It does not explicitly criminalize sexual harassment, which it legally defines as physical, verbal, or nonverbal conduct of a sexual nature, based on sex or gender, which is persistent or serious and demeans, humiliates, or creates a hostile or intimidating environment. The act criminalizes emotional, verbal, and psychological abuse and acts of intimidation. The practice of demanding sexual favors in exchange for employment or university grades remained common. Women suffered harassment for social and religious reasons in some regions. Women\u2019s rights groups reported the Abuja Environmental Protection Board took women into custody under the pretext of removing commercial sex workers from the streets of the capital. According to activists, the board then forced women to buy their freedom or confess to prostitution and undergo rehabilitation. With the support of several civil society organizations, four women filed a joint lawsuit against the board with the ECOWAS Court of Justice. As of November the case was pending. Reproductive Rights : Couples and individuals have the legal right to decide the number, spacing, and timing of children. Information on reproductive health and access to quality reproductive health services and emergency obstetric care was not widely available. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the maternal mortality rate was 814 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015 due to factors including lack of access to antenatal care, skilled birth attendants, emergency obstetric care, and other medical services. During the year WHO reported the percentage of births attended by skill health personnel between 2006 and 2014 was 35 percent. The UN Population Division estimated 16 percent of girls and women ages 15-49 used a modern method of contraception in 2015. The UN Population Fund reported as of 2010 that 28 percent of women ages 20-24 had given birth before the age of 18. Discrimination : Although the constitution provides the same legal status and rights for women as for men, women experienced considerable economic discrimination. The law does not mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value, nor does it mandate nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring. No laws bar women from particular fields of employment, but women reportedly faced challenges in obtaining employment in heavy manufacturing and construction. Women often experienced discrimination under traditional and religious practices. Women generally remained marginalized. No laws prohibit women from owning land, but customary land tenure systems allowed only men to own land, with women gaining access to land only via marriage or family. Many customary practices also did not recognize a woman\u2019s right to inherit her husband\u2019s property, and many widows became destitute when their in-laws took virtually all the deceased husband\u2019s property. In the 12 states that adopted sharia, sharia and social norms affected women to varying degrees. For example, in Zamfara State local governments enforced laws requiring the separation of Muslim men and women in transportation and health care. In 2013 the Kano State government issued a statement declaring men and women must remain separate while using public transportation. The testimony of women received less weight than that of men in many criminal courts. Women could arrange but not post bail at most police detention facilities. Children Birth Registration : Children derive their citizenship from their parents. The government does not require birth registration for either girls or boys, and the majority of births were unregistered. The 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), the most recent data available, found that only 30 percent of births of children under age five were registered. Lack of documents did not result in denial of education, health care, or other public services. Education : Public schools remained substandard, and limited facilities precluded access to education for many children. The law requires provision of tuition free, compulsory, and universal basic education for every child of primary and junior secondary school age. Under the constitution, women and girls are supposed to receive career and vocational guidance at all levels, as well as access to quality education, education advancement, and lifelong learning. Despite these provisions, extensive discrimination and impediments to female participation in education persist. Most educational funding comes from the federal government, with state governments required to pay a share. Public investment was insufficient to achieve universal basic education. Available estimates for public investment in education ranged from 1 percent to just over 7 percent of GDP. Of the approximately 30 million primary school-age children, an estimated one-third were not enrolled in formally recognized schools. The lowest attendance rates were in the North, where rates for boys and girls were approximately 45 percent and 35 percent, respectively. According to UNICEF, in the North, for every 10 girls in school, more than 22 boys attended. Approximately 25 percent of young persons between ages 17 and 25 had fewer than two years of education. In many parts of the country, social and economic factors resulted in discrimination against girls in access to education. In the face of economic hardship, many families favored boys over girls in deciding which children to enroll in elementary and secondary schools. According to the 2015 Nigeria Education Data Survey, attendance rates in primary schools increased to 68 percent nationwide, with school-age boys continuing to be somewhat more likely than girls to attend primary school. According to the survey, primary enrollment was 91 percent for boys and 78 percent for girls; secondary enrollment was 88 percent for boys and 77 percent for girls. The Northeast had the lowest primary school attendance rate, 45 percent for the entire northern region (43 percent for girls, 46 percent for boys). The most pronounced reason was the Boko Haram insurgency, which prevented thousands of children from continuing their education in the states of Borno and Yobe (due to destruction of schools, community displacement, and mass movement of families from those crisis states to safer areas). Child Abuse : Child abuse remained common throughout the country, but the government took no significant measures to combat it. Findings from the Nigeria Violence Against Children Survey released in 2015 revealed approximately six of every 10 children under age 18 experienced some form of physical, emotional, or sexual violence during childhood. One in two children experienced physical violence, one in four girls and one in 10 boys experienced sexual violence, and one in six girls and one in five boys experienced emotional violence. In 2010 the Ministerial Committee on Madrasah Education reported 9.5 million children worked as \u201calmajiri,\u201d poor children from rural homes sent to urban areas by their parents ostensibly to study and live with Islamic teachers. Instead of receiving an education, many \u201calmajiri\u201d were forced to work manual jobs or beg for alms that were turned over to their teacher. The religious leaders often did not provide these children with sufficient shelter or food, and many of the children effectively became homeless. In some states children accused of witchcraft were killed or suffered abuse, such as kidnapping and torture. So-called baby factories continued to operate, often disguised as orphanages, religious or rehabilitation centers, hospitals, or maternity homes. They offered for sale the newborns of pregnant women\u2013mostly unmarried girls\u2013often held against their will and raped. The persons running the factories sold the children for various purposes, including adoption, child labor, prostitution, or sacrificial rituals, with the boys\u2019 fetching higher prices. In August police in Aba, Abia State, rescued five pregnant women from a house, alleging its owners were engaged in child trafficking. In October police in Asaba, Delta State, rescued seven pregnant women ranging in age from 18 to 20 years, alleging the proprietor and his wife sold the children upon delivery. Early and Forced Marriage : The law sets a minimum age of 18 years for marriage for both boys and girls. According to UNICEF\u2019s State of the World\u2019s Children 2016 , 43 percent of girls were married before age 18, and 17 percent were married before age 15. The prevalence of child marriage varied widely between regions, with figures ranging from 76 percent in the Northwest to 10 percent in the Southeast. Only 24 state assemblies adopted the Child Rights Act of 2003, which sets the minimum marriage age, and most states, especially northern states, did not uphold the federal official minimum age for marriage. The government engaged religious leaders, emirs, and sultans on the problem, emphasizing the health hazards of early marriage. Certain states worked with NGO programs to establish school subsidies or fee waivers for children to help protect against early marriage. The government did not take legal steps to end sales of young girls into marriage. According to credible reports, poor families sold their daughters into marriage to supplement their incomes or for reasons pertaining to social and religious traditions. According to an NGO, education was a key indicator of whether a girl would marry as a child\u201382 percent of women with no education were married before 18, as opposed to 13 percent of women who had at least finished secondary school education. In the north, parents complained that the quality of education was so poor that schooling could not be considered a viable alternative to marriage for their daughters. Poor families sold their daughters into marriage to supplement their incomes. Families sometimes forced young girls into marriage as early as puberty, regardless of age, to prevent \u201cindecency\u201d associated with premarital sex or for other cultural and religious reasons. Boko Haram subjected abducted girls to forced marriage. Female Genital Mutilation\/Cutting (FGM\/C) : See information for girls under 18 in the Women\u2019s section above. Sexual Exploitation of Children : The 2003 Child Rights Act prohibits child prostitution and sexual intercourse with a child, providing penalties of up to seven years\u2019 and life imprisonment, respectively, for any adults involved. Two-thirds of the states adopted the act. While the majority of them retained the act\u2019s definition of a child as a person under 18, some lowered the minimum age to accommodate local betrothal and marriage practices. The VAPP criminalizes incest and provides prison sentences of up to 10 years. The Cybercrimes Act of 2015 criminalizes the production, procurement, distribution, and possession of child pornography with prison terms of 10 years, a fine of 20 million naira ($63,500), or both. Sexual exploitation of children remained a significant problem. Children were trafficked for sex, both within the country and to other countries. In late 2013 Project Alert on Violence against Women released a study showing that children under age 10 faced a 39 percent risk of being victims of sexual violence. Displaced Children : In December the IOM reported there were approximately 1.8 million persons displaced in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba, and Yobe. Children under 18 constituted 55 percent of the IDP population, with 48 percent of them under five years of age. Many children were homeless and lived on the streets, although the government had no reliable statistics. Major factors behind child homelessness were instability in the home, poverty, hunger, parental abuse, and displacement caused by clashes in the community. International Child Abductions : The country is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. See the Department of State\u2019s Annual Report on International Parental Child Abduction at travel.state.gov\/content\/childabduction\/en\/legal\/compliance.html . Anti-Semitism An estimated 700 to 900 members of the Jewish community, who were foreign employees of international firms, resided in Abuja. Although not recognized as Jews by mainstream Jewish communities, between 2,000 and 30,000 ethnic Igbos claimed Jewish descent and practiced some form of Judaism. There were no reports of anti-Semitic acts. Trafficking in Persons See the Department of State\u2019s Trafficking in Persons Report at www.state.gov\/j\/tip\/rls\/tiprpt . Persons with Disabilities No federal laws prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other state services. The law does, however, prohibit discrimination based on the \u201ccircumstances of one\u2019s birth.\u201d Plateau and Lagos States have laws that protect the rights of persons with disabilities, while Akwa-Ibom, Jigawa, Osun, and Oyo States took steps to develop such laws. The Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs and Social Development has responsibility for persons with disabilities. Some government agencies, such as the NHRC and the Ministry of Labor and Productivity, designated an employee to work on issues related to disabilities. Mental health-care services were almost nonexistent. Officials at a small number of prisons used private donations to provide separate mental health facilities for prisoners with mental disabilities. All prisoners with disabilities stayed with the general inmate population and received no specialized services or accommodations. Persons with disabilities faced social stigma, exploitation, and discrimination, and relatives often regarded them as a source of shame. Many families viewed children with disabilities who could not contribute to family income as liabilities and sometimes severely abused or neglected them. Many indigent persons with disabilities begged on the streets. Persons with intellectual disabilities were stigmatized, sometimes even within the community of persons with disabilities. The government operated vocational training centers in Abuja and Lagos to train indigent persons with disabilities. Individual states also provided facilities to help persons with physical disabilities become self-supporting. Persons with disabilities established self-help NGOs such as the Hope for the Blind Foundation in Zaria, Kano Polio Victims Trust Association, the Albino Foundation, and Comprehensive Empowerment of Nigerians with Disabilities. The Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities served as the umbrella organization for a range of disability groups. In 2008 the Ministry of Education estimated that, of 3.25 million school-age children with disabilities, only 90,000 were enrolled in primary school and 65,000 in secondary school. National\/Racial\/Ethnic Minorities The ethnically diverse population consisted of more than 250 groups. Many were concentrated geographically and spoke distinct primary languages. Three major groups\u2013the Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba\u2013together constituted approximately half the population. Members of all ethnic groups practiced ethnic discrimination, particularly in private-sector hiring patterns and the segregation of urban neighborhoods. A long history of tension existed between some ethnic groups. The government\u2019s efforts to address tensions between ethnic groups typically involved heavily concentrated security actions, incorporating police, military, and other security services, often in the form of a joint task force. The National Orientation Agency, the government body responsible for communicating official policy, occasionally organized conferences and issued public messages in support of tolerance and national unity. The law prohibits ethnic discrimination by the government, but most ethnic groups claimed to be marginalized in terms of government revenue allocation, political representation, or both. The constitution requires the government to have a \u201cfederal character,\u201d meaning that cabinet and other high-level positions must be distributed to persons representing each of the 36 states or each of the six geopolitical regions. President Buhari\u2019s cabinet appointments reflected this federal character. Traditional relationships were used to pressure government officials to favor particular ethnic groups in the distribution of important positions and other patronage. All citizens have the right to live in any part of the country, but state and local governments frequently discriminated against ethnic groups not indigenous to their areas, occasionally compelling individuals to return to a region where their ethnic group originated but where they no longer had ties. State and local governments sometimes compelled nonindigenous persons to move by threats, discrimination in hiring and employment, or destruction of their homes. Those who chose to stay sometimes experienced further discrimination, including denial of scholarships and exclusion from employment in the civil service, police, and military. For example, in Plateau State the predominantly Muslim and nonindigenous Hausa and Fulani faced significant discrimination from the local government in land ownership, jobs, access to education, scholarships, and government representation. Land disputes, ethnic differences, settler-indigene tensions, and religious affiliation contributed to clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers throughout the Middle Belt (the central part of the country). Determining the motives behind any single attack remained difficult. \u201cSilent killings,\u201d in which individuals disappeared and later were found dead, occurred throughout the year. Reprisal attacks at night in which assailants targeted and attacked individual homes or communities occurred frequently. Conflicts over land rights continued between members of the Tiv, Kwalla, Jukun, Fulani, and Azara ethnic groups living near the convergence of Nasarawa, Benue, and Taraba States. Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity The 2014 Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act (SSMPA) effectively renders illegal all forms of activity supporting or promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) rights. Under the SSMPA, anyone found to have entered into a same-sex marriage or civil union may be punished by up to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment. In addition anyone found guilty of aiding \u201cthe solemnization of a same-sex marriage or civil union, or supports the registration, operation, and sustenance of gay clubs, societies, organizations, processions, or meetings,\u201d or \u201cregisters, operates, or participates in gay clubs, societies, organizations, or directly or indirectly makes public show of same-sex amorous relationship\u201d commits an offense punishable by 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. There were no reports the government enforced these provisions during the year. Following passage of the SSMPA, LGBTI persons reported increased harassment and threats against them based on their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. News reports and LGBTI advocates reported numerous arrests, but detainees were in all cases released without formal charges after paying a bond, which was oftentimes nothing more than a bribe. In a report published in October, HRW found no evidence of any prosecutions under the SSMPA. According to HRW, however, the law had become a tool used by police and members of the public to legitimize human rights violations against LGBTI persons such as torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, extortion, and violations of due process rights. Other effects of the SSMPA reported by HRW included increased isolation of LGBTI persons and self-censoring behavior, which in some cases led LGBTI persons to marry opposite-sex partners and have children in an attempt to conform to socially acceptable gender norms. According to a study published in 2015, since passage of the SSMPA, gay and bisexual men were increasingly reluctant to access HIV health-care services due to fear of being \u201couted.\u201d The 707 gay and bisexual men surveyed were receiving HIV prevention and treatment services from a community-based clinic in 2013 and 2014. They made 756 visits to the clinic before the law passed but only 420 after its enactment. In the 12 northern states that adopted sharia, adults convicted of engaging in same-sex sexual activity may be subject to execution by stoning. Although sharia courts did not impose such sentences during the year, in previous years individuals convicted of same-sex sexual activity were sentenced to lashing. In August sharia police in Sokoto arrested two men, accusing them of attempting to celebrate a gay marriage. Authorities released both of them and later issued a statement acknowledging they mistakenly arrested them while the two men were taking part in a traditional ceremony featuring cross-dressers. Because of widespread societal taboos against same-sex sexual activity, very few LGBTI persons were open about their sexual orientation. Several NGOs provided LGBTI groups with legal advice and training in advocacy, media responsibility, and HIV\/AIDS awareness, as well as providing safe havens for LGBTI individuals. The government and its agents did not impede the work of these groups during the year. HIV and AIDS Social Stigma According to the 2013 NDHS, administered to a broad cross section of society throughout the 36 states and the FCT, 50 percent of women and 46 percent of men reported holding discriminatory attitudes toward those with HIV. The public considered the disease a result of immoral behavior and a punishment for same-sex sexual activity. Persons with HIV\/AIDS often lost their jobs or were denied health-care services. Authorities and NGOs sought to reduce the stigma and change perceptions through public education campaigns. Other Societal Violence or Discrimination Various reports indicated street mobs killed suspected criminals during the year. In most cases these mob actions resulted in no arrests. Ritualists who believed certain body parts confer mystical powers kidnapped and killed persons to harvest body parts for rituals and ceremonies. For example, in April police in Ogun State discovered a shrine containing the body of a man allegedly killed for ritual purposes. Persons born with albinism faced discrimination, were considered bad luck, and were sometimes abandoned at birth or killed for witchcraft purposes. Section 7. Worker Rights a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining The law provides all workers, except members of the armed forces and public employees in \u201cessential services,\u201d the right to form or belong to any trade union or other association, conduct legal strikes, and bargain collectively, but some statutory limitations substantially restricted these rights. Trade unions must meet various registration requirements to be legally established. By law a trade union may be registered if it has a minimum of 50 members and if there is no other union already registered in that trade or profession. A three-month notice period, starting from the date of publication of an application for registration in the Gazette , must elapse before a trade union may be registered. If the Ministry of Labor and Productivity does not receive objections to registration during the three-month notice period, it must register the union within three months of the expiration of the notice period. If an objection is raised, however, the ministry has an indefinite period to review and deliberate over the registration. The registrar may refuse registration because a proper objection has been raised or because a purpose of the trade union violates the Trade Union Act or other laws. Each federation must consist of 12 or more affiliated trade unions, and each trade union must be an exclusive member in a single federation. The law generally does not provide for a union\u2019s ability to conduct its activities without interference from the government. The law narrowly defines what union activities are legal. The minister of labor and productivity has broad authority to cancel the registration of worker and employer organizations. The registrar of trade unions has broad powers to review union accounts at any time. In addition the law requires government permission before a trade union can be legally affiliated with an international organization. The law stipulates that every collective agreement on wages be registered with the National Salaries, Income, and Wages Commission, which decides whether the agreement becomes binding. Workers and employers in export processing zones (EPZs) are subject to the provisions of labor law, the 1992 Nigeria Export Processing Zones Decree, and other laws. Workers in the EPZs may organize and engage in collective bargaining, but there are no explicit provisions providing them the right to organize their administration and activities without interference by the government. The law does not allow worker representatives free access to the EPZs to organize workers, and it prohibits workers from striking for 10 years following the commencement of operations by the employer within a zone. In addition the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority, which the federal government created to manage the EPZ program, has exclusive authority to handle the resolution of disputes between employers and employees, thereby limiting the autonomy of the bargaining partners. The law provides legal restrictions that limit the right to strike. The law requires a majority vote of all registered union members to call a strike. The law limits the right to strike to disputes over rights, including those arising from the negotiation, application, interpretation, or implementation of an employment contract or collective agreement, or those arising from a collective and fundamental breach of an employment contract or collective agreement, such as one related to wages and conditions of work. The law prohibits strikes in essential services, defined in an overly broad manner, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO). These include the Central Bank of Nigeria; the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company, Ltd.; any corporate body licensed to carry out banking under the Banking Act; postal service; sound broadcasting; telecommunications; maintenance of ports, harbors, docks, or airports; transportation of persons, goods, or livestock by road, rail, sea, or river; road cleaning; and refuse collection. Strike actions, including many in nonessential services, may be subject to a compulsory arbitration procedure leading to a final award, which is binding on the parties concerned. Strikes over national economic policy are prohibited. Penalties for participating in an illegal strike include fines and imprisonment for up to six months. Workers under collective bargaining agreements may not participate in strikes unless their unions comply with legal requirements, including provisions for mandatory mediation and referral of disputes to the government. Workers may submit labor grievances to the judicial system for review. Laws prohibit workers from forcing persons to join strikes, blocking airports, or obstructing public byways, institutions, or premises of any kind. Persons committing violations are subject to fines and possible prison sentences. The law further restricts the right to strike by making \u201ccheck-off\u201d payment of union dues conditional on the inclusion of a no-strike clause during the lifetime of a collective agreement. No laws prohibit retribution against strikers and strike leaders, but strikers who believe they are victims of unfair retribution may submit their cases to the Industrial Arbitration Panel with the approval of the Ministry of Labor and Productivity. The panel\u2019s decisions are binding on the parties but may be appealed to the National Industrial Court. The arbitration process was cumbersome, time consuming, and ineffective in deterring retribution against strikers. Individuals also have the right to petition the labor ministry and may request arbitration from the National Industrial Court. The law does not prohibit general antiunion discrimination; it only protects unskilled workers. The law does not provide for the reinstatement of workers fired for union activity. In 2013 the ILO ruled many provisions of the Trade Union Act and the Trade Disputes Act contravened ILO conventions 87 and 98 by limiting freedom of association. While workers exercised some of their rights, the government generally did not effectively enforce the applicable laws. Penalties were not adequate to deter violations. Inflation reduced the deterrence value of many fines established by older laws. For example, some fines could not exceed 100 naira ($0.32). The labor ministry registered approximately five unions per year. Officials reported union membership declined in recent years, and a majority of workers labored in the informal economy. In many cases workers\u2019 fears of negative repercussions inhibited their reporting of antiunion activities. According to labor representatives, police rarely gave permission for public demonstrations and routinely used force to disperse protesters. The government reported to the ILO that unionization in the EPZs had begun, citing the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service, and Technical and Recreational Services Employees organizing members within the EPZ. Collective bargaining occurred throughout the public sector and the organized private sector but remained restricted in some parts of the private sector, particularly in banking and telecommunications. According to the International Trade Union Confederation, the government and some private-sector employers occasionally failed to honor their collective agreements. For example, the government repeatedly failed to abide by a ruling of the National Industrial Court to implement a 2009 agreement between the government and the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU). In February health-care workers called off a three-month-old strike following government promises to enforce the agreement. In September JOHESU threatened to go on strike again, alleging noncompliance by the government on unpaid wages. Union members complained about the increased use of contracted labor and short-term labor contracts by employers seeking to avoid pension contributions and other obligations to their employees. This problem prompted the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers to stage a three-day warning strike in 2014. While the law does not provide for reinstatement of workers dismissed for their legitimate union activities, the Ministry of Labor and Productivity ordered the rehiring of union members fired for labor activism. Some foreign employers reportedly failed to comply with labor laws, especially in the construction and textile sectors. For example, in May and July, recently fired workers of a foreign-owned construction company protested its alleged failure to provide proper notice and severance pay and to make mandatory pension contributions. A local NGO reported employers required workers to sign, as a condition of employment, contracts that explicitly prohibited them from attempting to join a union. Some employers dismissed workers involved in organizing unions. b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor The law prohibits most forms of forced or compulsory labor, including by children, although some laws provide for a sentence that includes compulsory prison labor. The law provides for fines and imprisonment for individuals convicted of engaging in forced or compulsory labor. Enforcement of the law remained ineffective in many parts of the country. The government took steps to identify or eliminate forced labor, but insufficient resources and jurisdictional problems between state and federal governments hampered efforts. Forced labor remained widespread. Women and girls were subjected to forced labor in domestic service, while boys were subjected to forced labor in street vending, domestic service, mining, stone quarrying, agriculture, and begging. Also see the Department of State\u2019s Trafficking in Persons Report at www.state.gov\/j\/tip\/rls\/tiprpt\/ . c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment The law sets a general minimum age for employment of 12 years. Persons under the age of 14 may be employed only on a daily basis, must receive the day\u2019s wages at the end of each workday, and must be able to return each night to their parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s residence. By law these regulations do not apply to domestic service. The law also provides exceptions for light work in agriculture and horticulture if the employer is a family member. No person under age 16 may work underground, in machine work, or on a public holiday. No \u201cyoung person,\u201d defined as a person under 18 by the Labor Act, may be employed in any job that is injurious to health, dangerous, or immoral. For industrial work and work on vessels where a family member is not employed, the minimum work age is 15, consistent with the age for completing educational requirements. The law states children may not be employed in agricultural or domestic work for more than eight hours per day. Apprenticeship of youths above age 12 is allowed in skilled trades or as domestic servants. In 2013 the government approved a national action plan and a national strategy for the elimination of child labor. The Ministry of Labor and Productivity is responsible for enforcing labor laws. The federal government\u2019s Child Rights Act requires state-level ratification for full implementation. Twenty-three states and the FCT passed the act. The remaining states were primarily in the North, where sharia is in effect. The labor ministry dealt specifically with child labor problems and operated an inspections department to enforce legal provisions on conditions of work and protection of workers. In 2014 the ministry reported 1,684 inspections in all areas, resulting in five cases of violations. Labor inspections mostly occurred randomly but occasionally occurred when there was suspicion, rather than actual complaints, of illegal activity. The ministry mainly conducted inspections in the formal business sector, where the incidence of child labor reportedly was not significant. The National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons (NAPTIP) has some responsibility for enforcing child labor laws, although it primarily rehabilitates trafficking and child labor victims. Victims or their guardians rarely complained due to intimidation and fear of losing their jobs. There were no confirmed reports the ministry issued any citations or collected any fines from employers of child labor during the year. The government\u2019s child labor policy focused on intervention, advocacy, sensitization, legislation, withdrawal of children from potentially harmful labor situations, and rehabilitation and education of children following withdrawal. In an effort to withdraw children from the worst forms of child labor, it operated vocational training centers with NGOs around the country. Despite the policy and action plan, children remained inadequately protected due to weak or nonexistent enforcement of the law. Child labor was widespread; the Ministry of Labor and Productivity and NAPTIP estimated more than 15 million children participated in child labor, including 2.3 million employed in hazardous work. The worst forms of child labor identified in the country included commercial agriculture and hazardous farm work (cocoa, cassava); street hawking; exploitative cottage industries such as iron and other metal works; hazardous mechanical workshops; exploitative and hazardous domestic work; commercial fishing; exploitative and hazardous pastoral and herding activities; construction; transportation; mining and quarrying; prostitution and pornography; forced and compulsory labor and debt bondage; forced participation in violence, criminal activity, and ethnic, religious, and political conflicts; and involvement in drug peddling. Many children worked as beggars, street peddlers, bus conductors, and domestic servants in urban areas. Among child workers the government estimated as many as 9.5 million \u201calmajiri\u201d were engaged in street begging in the North (see section 6, Children). Children also worked in the agricultural sector and in mines. Boys worked as bonded laborers on farms, in restaurants, for small businesses, in granite mines, and as street peddlers and beggars. Girls worked involuntarily as domestic servants, street peddlers, and commercial sex workers. Near Lafia, in Nasawara State, children broke up large pieces of rocks, stacked them into piles, and carried them on their heads. Children also engaged in this work in Bauchi State and the FCT. In Zamfara State, children worked in industrial facilities used to process gold ore, where they were exposed to hazardous conditions. An international agency worked with state government officials to eliminate the employment of children under the age of 14 and acted as an ombudsman to advocate for 14- to 16-year-old workers. Also see the Department of Labor\u2019s Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor at www.dol.gov\/ilab\/reports\/child-labor\/findings\/ . d. Discrimination with Respect to Employment and Occupation The law does not prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation based on race, sex, religion, political opinion, gender, disability, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, HIV-positive status, or social status. The government in general did not effectively address discrimination in employment or occupation. Gender-based discrimination in employment and occupation occurred (see section 6, Women). No laws bar women from particular fields of employment, but women often experienced discrimination under traditional and religious practices. Police regulations provide for special recruitment requirements and conditions of service applying to women, particularly the criteria and provisions relating to pregnancy and marital status. NGOs expressed concern over continued discrimination against women in the private sector, particularly in access to employment, promotion to higher professional positions, and salary equity. According to credible reports, many businesses implemented a \u201cget pregnant, get fired\u201d policy. Women remained underrepresented in the formal sector but played active and vital roles in the informal economy, particularly in agriculture, processing of foodstuffs, and selling of goods at markets. The number of women employed in the business sector increased every year, but women did not receive equal pay for equal work and often encountered difficulty in acquiring commercial credit or obtaining tax deductions or rebates as heads of households. Unmarried women in particular endured many forms of discrimination. Several states had laws mandating equal opportunity for women. e. Acceptable Conditions of Work The legal national monthly minimum wage was 18,000 naira ($57). Employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from this minimum, and the large majority of workers were not covered. There is no official estimate for the poverty income level. Implementation of the minimum wage, particularly by state governments, remained sporadic despite workers\u2019 protests and warning strikes. The law mandates a 40-hour workweek, two to four weeks of annual leave, and overtime and holiday pay, except for agricultural and domestic workers. The law does not define premium pay or overtime. The law prohibits excessive compulsory overtime for civilian government employees. The law establishes general health and safety provisions, some aimed specifically at young or female workers. The law requires employers to compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of workers killed in industrial accidents. The law provides for the protection of factory employees in hazardous situations. The law does not provide other, nonfactory workers with similar protections. The law applies to legal foreign workers, but not all companies respected these laws. The Ministry of Labor and Productivity is responsible for enforcing these standards. By law workers can remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, but authorities did not effectively protect employees in these situations. The labor ministry employs factory inspectors and labor officers, but its Inspectorate Department declared it did not have sufficient staff to properly monitor and enforce health and safety conditions. The department is tasked to inspect factories\u2019 compliance with health and safety standards, but it was underfunded, lacked basic resources and training, and consequently did not sufficiently enforce safety regulations at most enterprises, particularly construction sites and other nonfactory work locations. In addition the government did not enforce the law strictly. Authorities did not enforce standards in the informal sector. The labor ministry reported that during 2014 there were 25 deaths related to occupational health and safety and one major industrial accident. Multiple sources indicated unsafe conditions were common at worksites across the country. In 2014, aside from the more than 1,684 labor inspections, there were no reports of wider government action to prevent violations and improve working conditions, particularly for hazardous sectors or vulnerable groups.

AFP A group of 27 herders were killed Wednesday and several others injured in what police called a bomb explosion in central Nigeria, a region known for ethnic and religious tensions. The herders and their cattle were in Rukubi, a village on the border between Nasarawa and Benue states when a bomb exploded in their midst. \"We have established 27 people were killed in the bomb explosion along with several cattle,\" said Maiyaki Muhammed Baba, Nasarawa's police commissioner. \"Many other people were injured and the death toll could mount as searches are still going on,\" Baba said, adding that police bomb experts were investigating the origin of the explosion. ADVERTISEMENT But an umbrella group representing herders said the explosion resulted from a military airstrike. \"It was an airstrike. It killed 27 of our people,\" said Lawal Dano of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria. \"We all know it is only the military that possess jets to carry out aerial strikes, and we call for a thorough investigation and necessary sanction on whoever is behind this,\" Dano said. Nigeria's air force spokesman did not respond to AFP requests for comment. ADVERTISEMENT There have been accidental airstrikes on civilians by the military in northeast and northwest Nigeria in the past, where troops are fighting jihadists and criminal gangs. In Central Nigeria, herders and farmers have been clashing over grazing and water rights. The decades-long conflict has taken an ethnic and religious dimension in recent years, with most herders Muslims while farmers are largely Christians.

The explosion in Emuoha council area of the southern Rivers state occurred along a pipeline targeted by illegal refinery operators who were trying to steal oil, state police spokesperson Grace Iringe-Koko said. \u201cPreliminary investigation by the Police Command indicates that the victims were scooping crude products when the site caught fire,\u201d Iringe-Koko said. Five vehicles, four auto-rickshaws and a motorcycle \u201cwere all burned to ashes,\u201d she said, adding that authorities were working to determine how many people died. People in the area told The Associated Press that dozens may have died in the fire that raged for hours and that the victims were mostly young people who planned to siphon oil from a pipeline and to transport to an illegal refinery site in at least five vehicles. Fyneface Dumnamene, executive director of Youths and Environmental Advocacy Centre, said a spark from the exhaust pipe of a bus loaded with gallons of crude oil ignited the explosion as the driver attempted to depart.

The workers at such facilities rarely adhere to safety standards, leading to frequent fires, including one in Imo state last year in which more than 100 people were killed. Nigeria lost at least $3 billion worth of crude oil to theft between January 2021 and February 2022.

They say two of the victims of Tuesday's attack in the Anambra state were US consulate employees, while the other two were police officers. The attackers kidnapped three other people, and set their vehicle on fire. Washington says no US citizens were in the convoy, which was travelling in the state plagued by violence and a separatist insurgency. Nigerian police say the attack happened on the Atani-Osamale road in Ogbaru region. Police spokesperson DSP Ikenga Tochukwu says security forces were currently carrying out a rescue and recovery operation. In a statement to the BBC, the US confirmed that \"there was an incident on 16 May in Anambra state\", adding that Washington was working with Nigerian security services to investigate the attack. \"The security of our personnel is always paramount, and we take extensive precautions when organising trips to the field,\" the US state department said.

The assailants stormed the Zangon Kataf Local Government Area in Kaduna state and opened fire Saturday after a confrontation with police at a checkpoint, Yabo Ephraim, a spokesperson for the local government told The Associated Press. Authorities imposed a curfew in the area after the attack. The attackers were ethnic Fulani, a group of mostly nomadic pastoralists who have been embroiled in a long conflict with farmers over limited access to water and land, Ephraim said. Before the shootings, a fight had broken out between some villagers and a small group of Fulani men. The latter left the scene and later returned in larger numbers with guns and machetes, the government spokesperson said. \u201cThey were strategically stationed at certain places and began to open fire in the community. They chased them even right into their homes. Wherever you are hiding, they will shoot you,\u201d Ephraim added. Such attacks are not rare in Nigeria, especially in the country\u2019s hard-hit north.

Residents told local media the victims were members of local vigilante groups and civilians defending themselves from armed gangs notorious for kidnapping people for ransom. The strikes targeted militant gangs in Zurmi and Maradun areas and the state governor, Dauda Lawal, offered his condolences to the community. The military has acknowledged conducting air strikes, which it said had dealt \"a decisive blow to bandits terrorising villages in the area\". The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) said it was investigating \"reports of vigilante losses\". \"While the operation successfully eliminated several bandits and led to the recovery of some kidnap victims, the NAF views with grave concern reports of the loss of civilian lives in the course of the operation,\" it said in a statement.

Such reckless use of deadly force is unlawful, outrageous and lays bare the Nigerian military's shocking disregard for the lives of those it supposedly exists to protect,\" it said in a statement. In recent years, Nigeria's security forces have been fighting powerful criminal gangs, known as bandits, who have been terrorising north-west and central states. The bandits raid villages, burn homes and kill and abduct residents for ransom. Several accidental air strikes have occurred in recent months including a Christmas Day attack that killed at least 10 civilians in neighbouring Sokoto state. In 2023, at least 85 civilians, mostly women and children, attending a Muslim religious gathering at a village in Kaduna state were killed after they were mistaken for bandits.

The rebels, riding on motorcycles and gun trucks, launched a surprise attack on the troops, who resisted and engaged them in a gun battle, Nigerian military spokesperson Edward Buba said in a statement. Borno has been the center of extremist violence in Nigeria since the Boko Haram extremist group launched an insurgency in 2009 to enforce their interpretation of Shariah law.

They will be returned at the request of the Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments. The artifacts include human and animal figures, plaques, royal regalia and a bell.

Lakurawa is a new militant group which carries out attacks, targeting local communities in north-western Nigeria and across the border with Niger. Nigerian officials say Lakurawa is affiliated with jihadist factions in Mali and Niger, and its militants have for years settled in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border, marrying local women and recruiting youths. This adds to Nigeria's security concerns, as it is already fighting against several armed groups, from Islamist militants Boko Haram to kidnapping gangs. The Nigerian government submitted a document to a High Court in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday, detailing the activities of the group. It said Lakurawa had been involved in acts of terrorism, including cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking and attacks on top government officials. The group was also accused of spreading harmful ideology within local communities and encouraging locals to disregard authorities, \"resulting in injuries, and loss of lives and property to innocent citizens of Nigeria\". Chibok girls feel let down 10 years after Nigeria kidnapping Nigeria's mass abductions: What lies behind the resurgence? A father's grief after daughter killed in accidental drone strike The group emerged few years ago in some villages in Sokoto and Kebbi states and people had notified authorities of its existence but nothing was done. At first, Lakurawa members promised to tackle banditry and help protect local people from cattle thieves. \"But things escalated when they started asking to check people\u2019s phones and would flog those that have music in them before deleting them,\" one Sokoto resident told the BBC last year. In the court papers, Nigeria's Attorney-General and Minister of Justice Lateef Fagbemi said the group's activities posed a serious threat to national security. Last year, military spokesperson Maj Gen Edward Buba said the emergence of Lakurawa was directly linked to political instability in neighbouring Mali and Niger. The military has seized power in both countries, partly because of the pressure of an Islamist insurgency. In a swift decision, Justice James Omotosho declared the group \"a terrorist organisation and extended the ban to similar groups across Nigeria, with a specific focus on the North West and North Central regions\". This move will give the Nigerian government sweeping powers to take strong actions against the group. Security agencies now have broad mandates to disrupt and dismantle the group's operations, including arrests, prosecution, asset freezes, and increased surveillance. It could also lead to public stigma and isolation for individuals associated with the designated group. Across the country, especially in northern Nigeria, people fear another scenario similar to when Boko Haram emerged in the late 2000s. Boko Haram means \"Western education is forbidden\", and it has repeatedly targeted secular schools as part of its attempts to establish its version of Islamic rule in the region. The group gained notoriety internationally when it kidnapped more than 200 school girls from the north-eastern town of Chibok in 2014.

The demonstration took place on International Quds Day, which is held on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in solidarity with Palestinians worldwide. It is common for the Islamic Movement of Nigeria to embark on demonstrations that often turn violent, leading to loss of life and property. Demonstrations by the group were intense in 2015 after the military cracked down on the group and had its leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, arrested.

The militants had disguised themselves as herders and traders in a nearby city and then infiltrated Wulgo to attack its surrounding military positions, said two intelligence sources. The sources were assisting troops in the long-running fight against the militants and requested anonymity to speak freely. \"The insurgents attacked the bases around 1:00 am and fighting continued for two hours before they subdued the troops and burnt the bases, after taking away heavy weapons,\" one of the sources said. \"Twenty Cameroonian troops were killed in the fighting and their bodies were transported across the border into Cameroon this morning,\" the source added. Neither the Nigerian military nor the Cameroonian side responded to an AFP request for comment. Soviet-made Shilka guns -- lightly armoured, radar-guided anti-aircraft weapons -- were among the cache seized by the Boko Haram fighters, said the second source, who offered the same death toll. On Monday, the fighters had blended among herders at the weekly market in the town of Gamboru, a commercial hub 15 kilometres (nine miles) away, the sources said. They then moved into Wulgo under the cover of night to launch a \"surprise attack\", said the second security source. - Military bases raided - Sounds of heavy guns and explosions were heard by people in Gamboru who had been awake to observe Ramadan vigils, local resident Muhammad Sani Umar told AFP. \"I saw three Cameroonian military trucks conveying 13 bodies across the border into Cameroon this morning,\" said Umar, who visited Wulgo on Tuesday. The attacked military bases were a mess, with the building torched and vehicles burnt, Umar said. Since 2009, jihadist violence in northeast Nigeria has killed 40,000 people and displaced 2.3 million, according to the UN, with the conflict spilling into neighbouring countries. The Lake Chad region in particular -- stretching across Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon -- has become a jihadist stronghold, disrupting fishing, farming and herding, on which the 40 million people who live there depend. Recently, however, officials have complained about a lack of coordination in the multi-country coalition fighting militants in the region, particularly as Nigeria and Niger have seen relations deteriorate after a coup toppled Niamey's civilian government in 2023. Since losing its Sambisa stronghold in Nigeria in 2021 to the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), a rival offshoot, Boko Haram has shifted its presence to areas around Lake Chad as well as Wulgo, Waza, Gwoza, Pulka the Mandara mountains on the border with Cameroon. Wulgo and Waza have been repeatedly targeted by Boko Haram, who have kidnapped and killed loggers, herders and scrap metal scavengers they accuse of spying on them for the military or local militias. Earlier this year, clashes with Boko Haram jihadists near the Lake Chad town of Baga left nine Nigerian soldiers dead. The attack came days after ISWAP militants killed scores of farmers in nearby in Tumbun Kanta and Kwatar Yobe, with accounts ranging between 40 and 100 dead.

Kyari was immediately replaced by Bayo Ojulari, a former managing director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), a subsidiary of the multinational oil giant. \"The board's restructuring is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency, restoring investor confidence, boosting local content, driving economic growth and advancing gas commercialisation and diversification,\" Tinubu's media adviser, Bayo Onanuga, said in a statement. The new leadership is tasked with reviewing strategic partnerships, increasing daily oil output to bridge a revenue shortfall, meeting growing local demand and curbing widespread oil theft. The NNPC has long struggled with allegations of corruption, political interference and mismanagement of the west African nation's fossil fuels. The country's oil production slowed to less than a million barrels per day in 2023. However, following a recent turnaround, the government is targeting two million barrels per day by 2027 and three million by 2030. Amid Nigeria's mix of state and private players, the NNPC is expected to contribute at least 10 percent to the country's daily output by 2027. A source in the presidency told AFP that Tinubu was concerned about the \"crisis of confidence\" in the oil industry, which is seen as a key cog in the country's ongoing economic reforms. But another insider insisted that the dismissals were not an indictment of the previous board. \"There are certain positive reforms that the president wants to achieve in the industry,\" the source told AFP, while also offering praise for Kyari's role in reviving the company's refineries. 'Long overdue' Kelvin Emmanuel, an economist and businessman who regularly comments in Nigerian media, told AFP that the sackings were \"long overdue\", insisting that the oil giant has \"grossly underperformed\" under the outgoing board. \"The failure of (NNPC) has direct bearing on the economic woes Nigeria has,\" Emmanuel said. Despite its massive fossil fuel reserves and decades of oil production, millions of Nigerians live in poverty. Successive governments have been accused of corruption in the oil sector while foreign fossil fuel giants have polluted large swathes of the country. Another expert, however, told AFP that Ojulari's appointment does not necessarily \"move the needle\" given the industry's systemic challenges and perceived political interference. \"The sudden move... might spook investors a little bit,\" said Ikemesit Effiong, a partner at the Lagos-based risk consultancy SBM Intelligence. \"If every time we have a board, there is a strategic review of NNPC portfolios, that's not a sustainable way to run a company as large as NNPC.\" - Political, ethnic divides - NNPC's new group chief executive officer Bayo Ojulari recently led a consortium involving Beninese-Gabonese businessman Samuel Dossou-Aworet's Petrolin and four Nigerian oil companies to acquire onshore assets from Shell in Nigeria. His appointment, however, may provoke a backlash from the opposition, who have accused Tinubu -- a Yoruba Muslim from the country's southwest -- of pursuing an ethnic agenda. Nigeria is roughly divided between a Christian-majority south and a Muslim-dominated north. Ojulari is from the north-central region of the country and is a Muslim, but like Tinubu is a member of the southern-dominant Yoruba ethnic group. Ojulari's appointment \"is going to provoke reactions, especially from northern politicians,\" Effiong told AFP. \"That is one of the first challenges the new board will have to navigate.\" \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

As of Friday morning, Bokkos local government official Farmasum Fuddang said 48 bodies had been recovered, sharply revising the earlier reported toll of 10. \"Yesterday alone we made a mass burial of more than 30 people,\" Fuddang said. A Red Cross official said that the toll \"surpassed 40, mostly women and children\". Though millions of Nigerians of different backgrounds live side by side, intercommunal violence often flares in Plateau state. Even urban centres, where Muslims and Christians live together, have seen violence sparked by smaller disputes devolve into massacres along community lines.

After they had gone, we came out to discover four people were killed,\" he told AFP. John Mathew, of nearby Daffo, said that \"the number of casualties would be more than 20\". Fuddang told reporters Thursday that the violence was the result of \"ethnic and religious cleansing\" by attackers \"speaking the Fulani dialect\". A local herder association slammed the remarks, saying that the Fulfulde language, as it is formally known, is widely spoken in the country, \"even (by) criminals\". In a statement, the Plateau chapter of the Gan Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria called the killings \"barbaric\", while also saying that herders \"should be the ones complaining about land grabbing\" by farming communities. The military said that troops, alongside local vigilante groups, had engaged with the attackers and \"efforts are ongoing to apprehend the fleeing criminals\". The police spokesman in the state did not respond to a request for comment. History of violence Researchers say that drivers of conflict in Plateau state are often complicated. As Africa's most populous country has continued to grow, so has the amount of land that farmers use, while grazing routes have come under stress from climate change. Land grabbing, political tensions and illegal mining further push people into conflict. Weak policing and governance leave a high rate of impunity.

Plateau state information commissioner Joyce Ramnap on Friday condemned the latest killings and called on religious and community leaders \"to reinforce the message of peace, unity, and lawful engagement\". Ramnap added in a statement that \"important arrests have been made\", without giving a figure. Tensions have soared in the state since about 200 people were killed at Christmas 2023 during a bloody attack on a majority Christian village.

President Bola Tinubu also said he has ordered an investigation over the late Sunday night attack on the Zike community, extending his condolences to the victims and their families. \u201cI have instructed security agencies to thoroughly investigate this crisis and identify those responsible for orchestrating these violent acts,\u201d Tinubu said in a statement late on Monday. Amnesty International said the victims, who included children and the elderly, were taken by surprise and could not flee from the gunmen. Such attacks have become common in this part of Africa\u2019s most populous country, where gunmen \u2014 typically herders from Fulani, a Muslim tribe \u2014 exploit security lapses to launch deadly raids on farmers in a fight over land resources. According to Andy Yakubu, a local resident, gunmen in Sunday night\u2019s attack also destroyed and looted homes in the Zike community, located in the Bassa area of Plateau state, RELATED COVERAGE In Nigeria\u2019s floating slum, \u2018The Herds\u2019 tour spotlights climate change where it\u2019s felt the most A roadside bomb kills 8 bus passengers in northeast Nigeria A song critical of Nigeria\u2019s president is barred from airwaves Yakubu said he saw bodies after the attack and that the number of dead could exceed 50. No one has been arrested so far, he added. The Fulani have been accused of carrying out mass killings across the northwest and central regions, where the decades-long conflict over access to land and water has further worsened the divisions between farmers and herders, Christians and Muslims. Amnesty says that between December 2023 and February 2024, 1,336 people were killed in Plateau state \u2014 an indication that the measures taken by Tinubu\u2019s administration to curb the violence are not working. Samuel Jugo, spokesperson of the Irigwe Development Association, an ethnic organization in the Bassa area, said in a statement on Monday that at least 75 people of the Irigwe, a Christian ethnic group, have been killed since December 2024. Jugo said that despite deployment of additional security forces to the area, violence still occurs and described the latest assault as \u201cvery provocative, vexing and undeserving.\u201d In May 2024, armed men attacked remote villages in Plateau, killing at least 40 people during a late-night raid.

Mr Kanu's page was removed for repeated violation of its community rules, the social networking site told the BBC. He had posted a video of a militia group attacking and killing cattle in a herders' settlement. He also used the live broadcast to accuse herders of destroying farmlands in eastern Nigeria. The conflict between herders and other groups is currently one of Nigeria's hottest political issues. Mr Kanu leads the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), which campaigns for independence for Nigeria's south-eastern region, where the ethnic Igbo people form the majority. The herders are mostly from the northern Fulani community. Africa Live: Update on this and other stories The man behind Nigeria's new separatist movement Should new calls for Biafra worry Nigerians? Mr Kanu, who also has British nationality, used his Facebook page as a key platform to communicate with his followers around the world. The account was blocked on Tuesday. 'Suppressing the truth' The militia carrying out the attack in the video he posted are suspected to be from the Eastern Security Network, which Mr Kanu set up. A Facebook spokesperson told BBC Igbo: \"In line with our rules, we removed Nnamdi Kanu's page for repeatedly posting content that break those Community Standards, including content that violated our rules on coordinating harm and hate speech.\" Nnamdi Kanu has a huge following in south-eastern Nigeria Ipob says it will appeal against the ban, describing the action of Facebook \"as not only baffling but too petty\". \"We wonder why a global social media giant like Facebook would allow itself to be used by agents of oppression in Nigeria to suppress the truth,\" head of media Emma Powerful said. Ipob is proscribed in Nigeria, which labelled it a terrorist organisation in 2017. Nnamdi Kanu came to fame in 2009 when he started Radio Biafra and broadcast to Nigeria from London, using the platform to call for Biafran independence and urging his followers to take up arms against the Nigerian state. Story continues Who are Ipob? Founded by Nnamdi Kanu in 2014 Proscribed as a terrorist group by Nigeria in 2017 The group wants states in south-east Nigeria, made up mainly of people from the Igbo ethnic group, to break away and form the independent nation of Biafra Mr Kanu was arrested in 2015 in Nigeria and spent more than a year-and-a-half in jail without trial on treason charges At least 150 Ipob members were killed by Nigerian security forces between August 2015 and August 2016, according to Amnesty International Mr Kanu, a British citizen, jumped bail and fled the country in 2017 How will this ban affect Nnamdi Kanu? By Chiagozie Nwonwu, BBC Igbo, Lagos Before the ban by Facebook, he created an app called Ipob Community Radio and asked his followers to get on it. With this app, Mr Kanu bypasses social media censorship. He's also asked his followers to move to Twitter but if he continues with the same rhetoric and controversial comments, he might not last long there. He however appears to be more measured on Twitter, where he is currently trying to get verified. At the moment he's likely to resort to using the Facebook accounts of Ipob and Radio Biafra and the hundreds of Ipob-affiliated pages, which are not affected, but it would be interesting to see if he changes his tone.

Nigerian police beat and arrested demonstrators on Saturday as a small group protested over the reopening of the site where activists denouncing police brutality were shot last year in the commercial capital, Lagos.

The military has denied shooting live rounds and police have denied involvement.

We\u2019re not going to step down,\u201d said one man, who did not provide his name and spoke to the Reuters news agency as he was being arrested. Police bundled about 13 protesters into a black truck at the toll gate where security forces had deployed since Friday evening, an AFP news agency reporter at the scene said.    \u201cLekki toll gate should be made a museum of resistance and not a monument for money-making,\u201d said Damilare Adebola, 24, who spoke from the police van where he was being held.

Gunmen in Nigeria have released 42 people, including 27 students, who were kidnapped from a boarding school last week in the north-central state of Niger, the state\u2019s governor said. Their release comes just a day after a separate raid on a school in Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state where gunmen seized more than 300 girls. Kidnappings for ransom by armed groups, many of whom carry guns and ride motorcycles, are common across many northern Nigerian states.

Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahmed Idris, reporting from Abuja, said their release followed days of tense negotiations between the government of Niger state and the government and federal forces. \u201cThey spent at least 9-10 days in captivity, and at some point a lot of people gave up that anything good will come out of these negotiations,\u201d he said. Idris said the government was not saying whether it had paid a ransom, after previously ruling out such a move. \u201cBut we understand that the bandits demanded the release of at least six of their members held in police custody. Banditry and kidnapping has become the biggest criminal enterprise now growing fast across Nigeria,\u201d Idris said. The recent attacks have raised concern about rising violence by armed gangs and groups and in Nigeria. Armed group Boko Haram carries out abductions in Nigeria\u2019s turbulent northeast, as does a branch of the ISIL (ISIS) group. The unrest has become a political problem for President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired general and former military ruler who has faced mounting criticism in recent months over high profile attacks by the gangs known locally as \u201cbandits\u201d.

Police say they believe the girls were taken to a forest after being abducted from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara state, on Friday morning. It is the latest mass kidnapping from schools in recent weeks. Armed gangs often seize schoolchildren for ransom. President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the latest kidnapping as \"inhumane and totally unacceptable\". \"This administration will not succumb to blackmail by bandits who target innocent school students in the expectations of huge ransom payments,\" he said in a statement. \"Our primary objective is to get the hostages safe, alive and unharmed.\" Mr Buhari said that although authorities could deploy \"massive force against the bandits\", there were fears that the schoolgirls could be used as human shields. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Is Boko Haram carrying out school kidnappings? The motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria The town that lost its girls At least 42 people, including 27 students, who were kidnapped last week in Kagara, in neighbouring Niger state, are yet to be released. The 2014 kidnap of 276 schoolgirls in the north-eastern town of Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria but the most recent attacks are suspected to be the work of criminal gangs. How did the attack happen? Friday's attack happened at 01:00 local time (midnight GMT) when a group of gunmen arrived at the Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe town with pick-up vehicles and motorcycles , a teacher told news site Punch. Some of the gunmen were dressed as government security forces, the report said, adding that they forced the schoolgirls in the vehicles. But other witnesses have told the BBC that the armed men arrived on foot at the school. Map The witness told BBC Hausa that more than 100 gunmen entered the school. Story continues \"They broke the school gate and shot at the security man. Then they moved into the hostels and woke up the girls, telling them it was time for prayers. After gathering all of them, the girls were crying and they took them away to the forest. They were also shooting in the air as they were marching to the forest,\" the witness said. Distraught parents later gathered outside the school and some have gone out into the bush to look for their daughters, witnesses say. A teacher told the BBC that of 421 students in the school at the time, only 55 had been accounted for. A police statement said its officers and a military contingent had been deployed to Jangebe to search for the girls. The UN children's agency Unicef said it was ''angered and saddened'' by yet another mass abduction of students in Nigeria describing it as ''brutal'' and a ''violation of children's rights.'' Who was behind the attack? No group has so far claimed responsibility. Armed groups operating in Zamfara often kidnap for ransom but when gunmen took more than 300 boys from Kankara in neighbouring Katsina state in December last year, some reports claimed that Boko Haram, which operates hundreds of miles away in the north-east, was behind the attack. The claims were later disputed and the boys released after negotiations. Why are schoolchildren being abducted? Analysis box by Mayeni Jones, Nigeria correspondent Every time children are taken from their schools by armed gunmen in northern Nigeria, the kidnapping of the Chibok girls is mentioned. Similar raids took place before that well-publicised abduction but they received little publicity and they never involved girls. But global attention generated by the #BringBackOurGirls campaign showed armed groups that the mass abduction of children was a sure way of applying pressure on authorities, including asking for ransom, although the authorities always deny paying. The government does not appear to have a strategy for stopping these incidents from happening. But two weeks ago, lawmakers from Zamfara state suggested offering amnesty to repentant kidnappers in exchange for sustainable economic opportunities. It's a controversial strategy but one that yielded some positive results in the Niger Delta, which saw a reduction in crime after a similar amnesty programme in 2009. The government so far says it will not negotiate with criminals. In the meantime, schools in rural northern Nigeria are more vulnerable than they've ever been. What has been done to secure schools? A \"Safe School Initiative\" was launched after the Chibok girls were abducted to bolster security in schools in Nigeria's north-eastern region by building fences around them. At least $20m ($14m) was pledged for the three-year project which was supported by the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister. Many container schools were built as temporary learning spaces as part of the scheme, but it is not known if any fences were built in communities affected. Though most of the recent kidnappings have happened in the north-west, which were not covered by the Safe Schools Initiative, the 2018 abduction of 110 schoolgirls from Government Science School, Dapchi in north-eastern Yobe state raised questions about the success of the initiative.","question":"How many schoolgirls were kidnapped in the Zamfara abduction in February 2021?","answer":"At least 317 schoolgirls were kidnapped.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"Answer: 279","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The expected answer states that at least 317 schoolgirls were kidnapped in the Zamfara abduction in February 2021.

According to him, the activities of the present-day secessionists are likely headed toward war; hence, it was proactive to stop them beforehand with force. \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d he said. Twitter chose to delete the tweet after violating its abusive behaviour policy and several calls by Nigerians to take it down. Twitter also suspended the president\u2019s account, leaving it in a \u201cread-only mode\u201d for 12 hours. Following its decision, Mr Mohammed called out the social media giant by saying its decision was biased and said the president had a right to express his thoughts on events that affect the country. He also raised suspicion about the platform\u2019s intention in the country. \u201cTwitter may have its own rules; it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr President anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views\u2026 The mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect,\u201d he said. In a retaliation act, Nigeria has proceeded to suspend the platform\u2019s operations in the country. While Twitter doesn\u2019t have any offices in the country, this announcement can still play out. And although there hasn\u2019t been any social media ban yet, Nigeria\u2019s current administration is no stranger to making ploys to restrict access to the internet, certain websites or social media. It was one of the tactics used during the EndSARS protests that rocked the country in October 2020. Given past events in other African countries where the internet has been restricted or banned in one form or another, this is an obvious ploy by the Nigerian government to double down on these tactics and use telecoms operators to repress free speech. In an email to TechCrunch, Twitter, which recently opened its first African office in Ghana, said, \u201cthe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d Subsequently, the microblogging platform via its public policy account tweeted: We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and #OpenInternet is an essential human right in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. #KeepitOn \u2014 Global Government Affairs (@GlobalAffairs) June 5, 2021 Back in April, Twitter opted for Ghana to be its African headquarters when many thought the social media company would\u2019ve chosen Nigeria.

Other protests were held in Ibadan, Osogbo, Abeokuta, Akure, and elsewhere.","text":"Nationwide protests were called over bad governance, insecurity and recent Twitter ban,\u00a0among other issues. Nigerian police have fired tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters in Lagos and the capital, Abuja, with reports of arrests and injuries. Activists had called for nationwide protests on Saturday on Democracy Day, which marks Nigeria\u2019s move to civilian rule more than 20 years ago, over what they criticise as bad governance and insecurity, as well as the recent Twitter ban by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. There were also pockets of protests in Ibadan, Osogbo, Abeokuta and Akure, all in southwestern Nigeria. The protests were the first to take place simultaneously in several cities since the #EndSARS movement against police brutality in October grew into the largest anti-government rallies in Nigeria\u2019s modern history. Hundreds of protesters gatheredin Lagos, a sprawling megalopolis of more than 20 million people, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protesters carried banners and placards saying \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d, calling for reforms. Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahmed Idris, reporting from Lagos, said the protest march in Lagos \u201cstarted peacefully and in an organised fashion, with demonstrators chanting pro-democracy songs\u201d. \u201cThe police were deployed in large numbers here in Lagos and in other parts of Nigeria in anticipation of trouble on this day,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen the demonstrators breached the first line of defence of the police, the second and the third, the police started firing tear gas at them and journalists at the scene. Later, there were live rounds fired in the air.\u201d In Abuja, a similar scenario played out as the protesters gathered as early as 7am (06:00 GMT). A detachment of police and army broke up the crowd using tear gas, AFP news agency reporters at the scene said, adding that some journalists were harassed by the security forces. Police had said the protests were unauthorised and AFP reporters said they saw several people being detained. \u201cWe cannot continue like this \u2026 all the bad governance must stop,\u201d said protester Samson Okafor in Lagos, where tear gas canisters smouldered in the street as police shouted at demonstrators to leave the scene. Officers were also seen smashing mobile phones confiscated from protesters, some of whom criticised the government\u2019s decision to suspend access to Twitter after the social media platform removed a post by Buhari. Buhari, a former general first elected as president in 2015, has been under pressure over growing insecurity in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, home to more than 200 million people. Security forces are battling an armed uprising in the northeast, a surge in mass kidnappings and attacks by criminal gangs in the northwest, and a rise in separatist tensions in the southeast. The government also triggered an outcry a week ago when it indefinitely suspended Twitter in the country, saying the platform was used for activities aiming to destabilise Nigeria. Saturday\u2019s demonstrations were called to coincide with \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d, marking the anniversary of Moshood Kashimawo Abiola\u2019s election as Nigerian president in 1993. Abiola\u2019s victory was annulled by the then military government, plunging Nigeria into months of civil unrest. Nigeria returned to civilian rule in May 1999, but Buhari chose June 12 as Democracy Day after becoming president to honour Abiola and other heroes of the struggle.

{"year":"2021","month":"10","event_desc":"17 October - Sokoto massacre","text":" President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in parts of the country, saying their days are numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 40 people by bandits at Goronyo market, in Sokoto State, sent a tough warning to the criminals and declared, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d Buhari had earlier taken a critical look at the security situation in the country before news of the massacre in Sokoto State filtered in. He had boasted that the military and other security agencies were recording greater successes in the bid to rid the country of insecurity. The president, however, counselled the Nigerian media on the need for accurate reportage of security and safety issues by replacing the usage of phrases, like \u201crising insecurity\u201d, with \u201cdeclining insecurity\u201d. But in Kaduna State, security forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area. Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, reacting to the killing in his state, called on the Nigeria Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to help stamp out banditry in the region. In a similar vein, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concerns about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in schools across the country. United States reiterated its readiness to lend support to Nigeria in its bid to contain insecurity. Buhari, in a release by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, declared, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\u201d He said, \u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before.\u201d Buhari added, \u201cThe bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces. \u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d The president appealed to Nigerians not to despair, because his administration was determined, more than ever before, to protect Nigerians from murderous criminal gangs with no respect for the sanctity of human of life. He extended his sympathy to the families of the victims of the Goronyo attack and called on the people to remain patient, as the military strategised on how to crush the bandits. In yet another presidential message by Shehu, to felicitate with the Muslim Ummah, Nigerians of all faiths and the followers of Islam all over the world on the occasion of Maulud-Un-Nabiyy, Buhari gave a snapshot of the increased activities of the armed forces, the police, and intelligence agencies to effectively respond to the security challenges in the country. He said the increased cooperation from the citizenry, coupled with reinvigorated, dynamic, and energised police, security and military leadership was helping the administration score more victories against terror, criminality, and economic sabotage. He argued that the reality of declining insecurity should replace the inaccurate narrative of rising insecurity in the country. \u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform, who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more,\u201d Buhari said. \u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard,\u201d he added. He said the government expected and intended for those trends to continue, and called on the media to address the tone, content, and standards of reporting on security and safety measures. He said the time had come for the media to revise the prefixes \u201crising insecurity\u201d with \u201cdeclining insecurity.\u201d In his felicitation with the Muslim Ummah to mark the Eid-Ul-Maulud on Tuesday, which has been declared a public holiday throughout the federation, Buhari said, \u201cI am delighted to send greetings of peace, unity and goodwill to the Muslim Ummah, fellow citizens, and Muslims all over the world as they observe and celebrate Eid-ul- Maulud.\u201d He urged Muslims to strive for \u201cforgiveness and closeness to the noble life and teachings of the Prophet (SAW), whose birthday is being marked on this blessed day. On this auspicious occasion, I wish you all the blessings of today.\u201d Security Forces Kill 10 Bandits in Kaduna Security forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State. However, one person was killed while three others were abducted by bandits in Oil Village, a community located near Kaduna Refinery in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The bandits were said to have invaded Oil Village on Saturday night, unleashing terror on the residents. Sources in the community said one Mr. Auta was killed by the bandits while attempting to alert the community about the presence of the criminals. One source said, \u201cMr. Auta noticed the presence of the bandits and he sneaked out of his house to alert the community since telephone services had been cut off. \u201cUnfortunately, as he was manoeuvring his way out to alert the community, the bandits sighted him and shot him dead. The bandits were many and were well armed, we couldn\u2019t alert security agencies, because telecom services had been cut off in our area.\u201d He added that three other people, including a medical doctor and his son, where abducted. The doctor was said to have withdrawn his son from one of the schools for fear of kidnappers, only to be abducted at home. Another resident of the area, who shared the information on a WhatsApp platform of \u201cCommunity News Update\u201d, said the bandits invaded the community about 11pm on Saturday, killing one of his neighbours while another neighbour and his son were abducted. Lamenting the situation, he solicited for prayers from members of the platform. Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, disclosed that 10 bandits were killed by security forces in Kwanan Bataru, on the outskirts of Fatika in Giwa Local Government Area. In a statement on Monday, Aruwan said the bandits were neutralised in a gun duel with security forces, adding that several others escaped with gun shot injuries. Aruwan stated, \u201cOne Alhaji Abubakar Usman, who is likely to have been kidnapped in a neighbouring state and was being held by bandits in the area, was rescued by the troops, and is being debriefed at the moment. \u201cThe bandits, who managed to escape, left behind several motorcycles, one revolver, mobile phones, torchlights and some charms. One of the sheds used by the bandits to hold hostages was burnt.\u201d Bandits Attack Sokoto Sunday Market, Kill 40 No fewer than 40 people were killed as suspected bandits attacked a market in Goronyo Local Government Area of Sokoto State. The armed men attacked the market on Sunday, which happened to be the market day. Sources in the village said the marauders attacked the market in large numbers and started shooting sporadically, leading to the death of over 40 persons. A source, which spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the casualty figure was over 40, as the area was still unsafe for residents to access. The attack was the third in the area in two weeks. Last Thursday, suspected members of the outlawed volunteer vigilante group, also known as Yan Sakai, attacked and killed nine Fulanis at Manmade market in Gwadabawa Local Government Area of the state. Suspected bandits also killed 20 persons at Ungwan Lalle market, in Sabon Birni Local government Area of Sokoto State. The Sokoto State government had earlier ordered the closure of markets in the Eastern Senatorial District of the state as a measure to fight the rising insecurity in the state. Tambuwal Calls for Coordinated Operations in Sokoto Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal called on the Nigerian Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to stamp out banditry in the region. Tambuwal made the call on Monday, when the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Sokoto, the state capital. The governor disclosed that the operations of the army in Zamfara State were having a negative effect on Sokoto State, especially, the Eastern part of the state, hence the need to carry out the operations simultaneously. \u201cBetween yesterday and today, we have lost many people in Goronyo Local Government Area of the state,\u201d he said, adding that before now, the situation in the state was not as bad. He appealed to the Nigerian Army to review its operations in the state. The governor also asked the Chief of Army staff to deploy more troops, resources, and intelligence to the state to end the banditry. He promised that his administration would do everything in its powers to support the security agencies to end insecurity in the state. Earlier, Yahaya commended Tambuwal for his support to security agencies in the state. The army chief, who was in Sokoto, his home state, on his first visit since his assumption of office as Chief of Army Staff, said he was in the state as part of a familiarisation tour to divisions across the country. The purpose, he said, was to interact with troops and encourage them on their duties as well as hold security meetings with governors and relevant stakeholders. He said the perpetrators of criminal activities across the country were also human, and said there was need to work with everyone to track down the criminals among the people. In a related development, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, prayed for the continuous success of the security agencies against criminal elements in the country. While receiving Yahaya in his palace, the Sultan said he was always happy to receiving army personnel, having being one of them before ascending the throne. He disclosed that Sultan\u2019s Palace remained home to everyone, not only the army chief, but every Nigerian, irrespective of where they came from or their religious background. The Sultan said his council would continue to pray for the army chief and his people, saying the task before them is more than the civil war era Ortom Worries over Insecurity in Nigerian Schools Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concern about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in the country. Ortom spoke on Monday at his country house, Gbajimba, in Guma Local Government Area, during the virtual handing over and commissioning of a Government Science Secondary School built by some oil companies in the country, including Chevron, Famfa, Prime, and Equinor. He said education remained the bedrock of growth and development of any nation, wondering why schools should be the target of criminals. The governor lauded the oil companies for investing heavily in the education sector as part of their social responsibility policy. He pledged, on behalf of his government, that everything in its powers would be done to protect the facility and announced immediate perimeter fencing of the school. The governor also decried the high number of internally displaced persons in the area and urged the federal government to do everything to ensure that the people returned to their homes. He said, \u201cI will not keep quiet and allow some group of people chase my people away from their homes and continue to make them IDPs. Gbajimba has over 500,000 IDPs. I appeal to the federal government to stop these herdsmen and declare them a terrorist group. \u201cThey should stop the killing and destruction of our property. I will not engage any militia group but seek justice of my people. \u201cSecurity is a mandatory responsibility of every government. I want to appreciate the recent effort made by government in nipping insecurity in the bud, especially, in the state but it should be sustained. \u201cI also appreciate the effort of security agencies, who are sacrificing their lives to ensure peace in our state. The federal government should do massive recruitment and adequate funding of security agencies so that they can put in their best in securing the lives of Nigerians.\u201d US Ready to Support Nigeria to Fight Insecurity The United States government declared its readiness to lend support to Nigeria towards the fight against insecurity. The assurance was given during a meeting between a visiting US Deputy Security Adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, where security issues were discussed. The US official said his country was willing to support Nigeria. Speaking to journalists after a closed-door meeting, Finer said, \u201cGoing forward, the security issues are very pretty whether it\u2019s terrorism or piracy, the US can support. \u201cYou mentioned democracy. The president is very much looking forward to convening the summit for democracy in December. The pillar of this summit is going to be issues relating to election, corruption. \u201cNigeria is not just a partner of the US but also a friend, which is much appreciated. The time that we spent and the conversations we had are very constructive and the partnership over all. \u201cI will not repeat all of the minister\u2019s briefing but it does speak the enormous agenda that the two countries share. We talked about the pandemic and the delivery of vaccines and the next phase of this which is actually making sure that those vaccines are administered and get into peoples arms, which is something we want to support.\u201d On climate change, Finer said the US \u201cwelcomes Nigeria\u2019s commitment to increase its ambition, when it comes to climate change and we hope that it continues. There are no significant issues on our mutual agenda that can be addressed without working together. So, we are committed to continue doing that.\u201d Onyeama said the discussion was on a broad range of issues. He said, \u201cWe talked about the security situation of the country: banditry, Boko Haram, secessionist groups and other acts and challenges to insecurity, including that of Guinea and how we can cooperate with the US in addressing all the issues. \u201cWhile acknowledging the tremendous support from the US in the area of security, the recent delivery of A29 fighters and supporting other areas, we assessed the situation in the Sahel beyond Nigeria, right up to Libya, and how we can work closely together to address the terrorist challenges and the security situation in Nigeria.\u201d On twitter ban, the minister said, \u201cWe talked about the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and how that is progressing,\u201d adding that the issue of COVID-19 also came up at the meeting. He stated, \u201cWe talked about the COVID-19 context and the US has been very generous. Just very recently, last week, they provided, again, vaccines to Nigeria, five million, and then another vaccine of 3.5 million that were delivered to the Nigerian government. We are grateful to the US government for this generosity.\u201d Buhari, Obasanjo, Jonathan, Akinyemi Mourn Powell, Commiserate with US Govt FG scraps DPR, PPPRA, PEF, sacks CEOs, inaugurates new agencies Your email address will not be published.

Boko Haram , a group seeking a separate state in northeast Nigeria adhering to a strict interpretation of Islamic laws, began the unrest. \"I am deeply relieved that some civilians, including three aid workers, who were abducted by non-state armed groups along the Monguno - Maiduguri road on 22 December 2019 have been released yesterday and are now safe,\" Edward Kallon, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, said in a statement on Thursday. https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/12\/isil-claims-execution-11-christians-nigeria-191227141817907.html Kallon said he was concerned about the \"increasingly insecure environment that humanitarians are working in\".

More:\u00c2 Armed group frees kidnapped hostages in Nigeria Nigerians mark 50 years of end of bloody civil war START HERE | Nigerian Oil and the Disappearing Money A national emergency operations centre had been activated to coordinate the response \"to the increasing number of Lassa fever cases\" across the country. What is Lassa fever? Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever. It belongs to the same family as the Ebola and Marburg viruses but is much less deadly. The disease is endemic to the West African country and i ts name comes from the town of Lassa in northern Nigeria where it was first identified in 1969. Previously, cases of the disease have been reported in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Togo and Benin - where it killed at least 9 people in 2016. How is it spread? The virus is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent faeces or urine. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. The virus, which has an incubation period of between six to 21 days, can also be transmitted through contact with an infected person via bodily fluids and excretions: blood, urine, saliva, sperm, vomit, faeces. Symptoms and treatment Lassa fever is asymptomatic in 80 percent of cases but for some, it can cause fever, physical fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, abdominal pains or sore throat. Swelling of the neck or face can sometimes be observed. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the antiviral drug ribavirin appears to be an effective treatment for Lassa fever \"if given early on in the course of the clinical illness\". Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with some 200 million people, has five laboratories with the capability to diagnose Lassa fever. Previous outbreaks The number of Lassa fever infections across West Africa every year is between 100,000 to 300,000, with about 5,000 deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Last year, the disease claimed more than 160 lives in Nigeria.\u00c2 In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 10 to 16 percent of the people admitted to hospitals annually have Lassa fever, according to the US CDC, demonstrating the serious impact the disease has on the region. The number of cases usually climbs in January due to weather conditions during the dry season.

Several commuters trekked more than a kilometre to get to their nearest bus stop and joined other people on long, winding queues waiting for the next available bus. \"I have trekked from my bus stop down to where I got a vehicle, I spent an hour trekking because the distance is far to the nearest bus stop where I usually take bike (Okada),\" said a digital marketer at Ikeja who identified herself simply as Miss Oyinlola. \"On Mondays, I get to my office 9 a.m., but today I am still on my way by 10 a.m. We need other alternatives, not a ban policy. I work at GRA Ikeja, the route is not trekkable from Ikeja underbridge.\" Hard-hitting law Last week, the Lagos government announced the restriction of the operation of commercial motorcycles and tricycles in 15 local governments and local council development areas across the state. The enforcement began on Saturday, February 1. But the weight of the ban became evident two days later, on the first working day of the week. \"The masses were not considered, people who do not have cars are really suffering from this situation,\" Ms Oyinlola said. Basit Olanrewaju, a student of Lagos State Polytechnic in Oshodi-Isolo, said he found it difficult to get to school. \"I have a class for 8 a.m., I am still on my way. The situation is bad, a lot of people are trekking there are no bike and tricycle at bus stop. The walking distance is stressful, the government should lift the ban this is becoming more difficult for the citizens.\" A commuter, who identified himself simply as Mr Paul, lamented about his difficulty in getting to his place of business early. \"I have been trekking for the past 20 minutes because there is no bike, if there is bike this will ease up the traffic,\" said Mr Paul, a trader at Oshodi. \"If government is concerned about the citizens, the okada riders should be cautioned on how they drive for the benefit of the masses and not for them to be left unemployed.\" Endurance Philip, a salesperson, was among those stranded at a bus stop in Oshodi. She said the government ought to have provided more buses to cushion the effect of the ban \"Places you are supposed to be at a particular time you are not there because you are stranded,\" she said. \"The government is not considerate at all, the ban has cost many people their jobs. We need more buses not a total ban and this make the economy more difficult on people.\" Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Nigeria Business Transport Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .

Some of the commuters, however, lauded the government's decision, saying it would help bring sanity to the roads Adeyemi Seun, a clergyman,described the ban as \"a good policy.\" \"Movement of the people is not dependent on bikes. We cannot continue to risk lives because there is no alternative to vehicles on highways,\" he said. \"The means of transportation that have been banned are unsafe.\" At Ikeja, commercial tricycle operators pleaded with the government to rescind its decision. An operator at the Computer Village, who identified himself as Dupetie, said he would find it difficult to feed his family. \"I convey people from Ojota to Ikeja but we have been asked to stop working,\" Mr Dupetie said. \"It is difficult to feed our families, a lot of motorcycles and tricycle drivers have been arrested. What are we supposed to do? A lot of poor masses ride motorcycles to provide for their families because we cannot steal, we are all frustrated by this new ban policy in the state.\" Mr Samuel, another tricycle driver, said he had been driving for 16 years. \"I sent my children to the university with the money I make from the business, many people have been arrested among us and lots of money have been collected from them to get back their tricycle. \"Government never had a discussion or provide an alternative for us before it was banned. We are not happy, so are the commuters. A lot of them are stranded trying to get to their office and many are still on their way at 10 a.m. on Monday morning.

The move was slammed by immigrant advocates and critics who say the policy discriminates against Muslims and others.\u00c2 The US will suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said during a call with reporters.\u00c2 More: Trump confirms plans to expand controversial travel ban Muslim Americans testify on effects of Trump's travel ban US Democrats introduce bill to repeal Trump's travel ban Nonimmigrant visas were not affected for the additional countries, Wolf said. Those visas are given to people travelling to the US for a temporary stay, including tourists, those doing business or people seeking medical treatment. During December 2019, for example, about 650,760 nonimmigrant visas were granted by the US in total. The US government will also stop issuing \"diversity visas\" to nationals of Sudan and Tanzania, Those visas - which Trump has criticised in the past - are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US. Wolf said the six countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards, which necessitated the new restrictions. The problems Wolf cited ranged from subpar passport technology to a failure to sufficiently exchange information on \"terrorism\" suspects and criminals. \"These countries, for the most part, want to be helpful,\" Wolf said, \"but for a variety of different reasons simply failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out.\" The presidential proclamation will take effect on February 21.\u00c2 The original travel ban - issued during Trump's first week in office in January 2017 - barred nearly all immigrants and travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations. It caused widespread outrage and chaos at airports across the US. The policy was revised amid court challenges, but the US Supreme Court ultimately upheld it in June 2018. The existing version of the ban applies to the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela also face visa restrictions, but those measures affect relatively few travellers. Those restrictions will remain in place, Wolf said. Disproportionately targets Muslims Trump has made his immigration crackdown a focus of his 2020 re-election campaign and is expected to press the issue in the months ahead. Critics contend the ban disproportionately targets Muslim-majority nations. In 2015, during Trump's campaign for president, he called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\". Three of the nations included in the updated ban - Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria and Sudan - have majority Muslim populations. Eritrea and Tanzania have sizable Muslim minorities. Representative Ilhan Omar stands in front of 'NO BAN ACT' posters during a news conference by members of the US Congress [File: Jim Bourg\/Reuters] Earlier in January, a coalition of leading civil rights organisations urged House leaders to take up the No Ban Act legislation to end Trump's travel ban and prevent a new one. On Thursday, Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar said she introduced legislation that would repeal a 1798 law that allows the US president to target groups of foreign nationals.\u00c2 \"It's past time to take this xenophobic law off the books,\" Omar tweeted, announcing the Neighbors Not Enemies Act.\u00c2 The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the ban should be \"ended, not expanded\".\u00c2 \"President Trump is doubling down on his signature anti-Muslim policy - and using the ban as a way to put even more of his prejudices into practice by excluding more communities of colour,\"\u00c2\u00a0Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement. \"Families, universities, and businesses in the United States are paying an ever-higher price for President Trump's ignorance and racism.\" Of the new countries hit with visa restrictions, Nigeria sends the most immigrants to the US. The US Department of State issued approximately 7,900 immigrant visas to Nigerians in the fiscal year 2018, which began on October 1, 2017. Congressman Joe Neguse, a Democrat from Colorado and son of Eritrean refugees, told reporters on Friday that the updated ban unfairly singled out allied African nations.

The money was laundered through the US under the presidency of Sani Abacha in the 1990s, before being transferred to the Channel Island, according to Jersey's Civil Asset Recovery Fund. The sum was recovered from a Jersey bank account belonging to shell company Doraville in June 2019. The governments of Nigeria, the US and Jersey signed the agreement this week. US courts ruled in 2014 Mr Abacha had stolen the money from Nigeria while he was in power from 1993 until his death in 1998. The Doraville bank account was subsequently frozen by Jersey's Royal Court in 2014, prompting a five-year legal battle. The returned money will be administered by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and will be independently audited, according to a joint statement from all three governments. Mark Temple QC, Solicitor General and Attorney General designate of Jersey, said: \"The agreement establishes a framework based on fruitful co-operation, trust and respect so that the forfeited funds can be repatriated to benefit the people of Nigeria, from whom they had been taken.\" Abubakar Malami, signing on behalf of Nigeria, described it as a \"major victory\" for the country.

The Grammy-winning rapper visited both countries last month on her African tour. Her announcement in a tweet on Friday criticized the U.S. airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani and sent Middle East tensions soaring. \u201cIts sad this man is putting Americans live in danger. Dumbest move Trump did till date ... I\u2019m filing for my Nigerian citizenship,\u201d she tweeted. Many in West Africa saw her tweet as proof that she preferred Nigeria Ghanaians were quick to point out the pitfalls of living in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, where traffic jams and power cuts are more visible than opulent nightclubs and luxury hotels. \u201cHope you have a generator to power your house (because) they don\u2019t have light but we do,\u201d one user tweeted, adding an emoticon of a Ghana flag. Some fans in Ghana expressed concern for her safety, warning about the Nigeria-based Islamic extremist group Boko Haram. But most Nigerian fans were quick to offer up a passport exchange, underscoring the mix of pride and confusion that the 27-year-old star would prefer Nigeria to America. This week she asked fans to weigh in on whether her Nigerian name should be CHIOMA B or Cadijat. Cardi B, who was born Belcalis Almanzar, is of Afro-Caribbean descent, tracing her roots to Trinidad and the Dominican Republic.

This approval was sequel to an adoption of the presentation by the committee on Customs, Excise and Tariff and subsequent consideration at plenary. DAILY POST also learnt that Senate President, Ahmad Lawan has warned MDAs to submit their audited accounts or risk punitive measures. Senator Francis Alimikhena, who is chairman of the committee, said out of the total expenditure for the year 2020, N98.61 billion representing 41.41 percent is for Personnel cost; N15.95 billion representing 6.70 percent is for Overhead Cost; and N123.59 billion representing 51.89 percent is for Capital Cost. Alimikhena also said the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has a revenue framework of N1.5 trillion to be remitted to the Federation account; and N178.7 billion to Non-Federation account for the 2020 fiscal year.

But Senate President, Lawan in his remarks hailed the Customs Service for accomplishing its revenue target in 2019.

Most people died from disease and starvation during the 30-month Biafra civil war [File: Getty Images] By Fidelis Mbah Published On 15 Jan 2020 15 Jan 2020 Abuja, Nigeria \u2013 Fifty years ago, a devastating civil war that killed more than one million people in Nigeria came to an end. Most of those who lost their lives in what became known as the Biafran war died from fighting, disease and starvation during the two-and-a-half-year conflict. In 1967, Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, the military governor of Nigeria\u2019s then-Eastern Region inhabited mainly by Igbo people, accused the federal government of marginalising and killing thousands of ethnic Igbos living in the north. On May 30 of that year, Odumegwu-Ojukwu declared the former Eastern Region a sovereign and independent republic under the name of Biafra \u2013 a unilateral move rejected by the federal authorities. A bloody civil war ensued, with federal troops deployed to stop the secessionist movement. The Nigerian forces cut off aid and access to the area throughout the war, which ended with the surrender of Biafra in January 1970. The Republic of Biafra ceased to exist and General Yakubu Gowon, the leader of the federal government, famously declared that there was \u201cno victor, no vanquished\u201d in the war. A supporter of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) holds a Biafra flag during a rally [File: Reuters\/Afolabi Sotunde] Fifty years on, the scars are yet to heal for many, including former fighters who suffered injuries and others who lost their loved ones and suffered huge economic losses. Advertisement On Monday, at a \u201cNever Again\u201d conference held in Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital of Lagos, Igbo leaders from the southeast urged the government to step up development efforts in the region and called for increased political inclusion and economic support to end fresh calls for a breakaway Biafra state. In 2017, a regional court ordered the Nigerian government to pay\u00a050 billion nairas ($138m, today\u2019s prices) in damages to civil war victims. The Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice also ruled that 38 billion nairas ($105m, today\u2019s prices) should be put towards evacuating abandoned lethal weapons which deprived southeast communities of farmland since the civil war ended. But for Canada-based Igbo leader Benjamin Allison, financial reparation is not enough. \u201cYou cannot compensate anyone for past injuries without an acknowledgement that a damage or harm had been done to them. Nonetheless, the only true compensation the Igbos seek from Nigeria at this point is a government based on fairness, equity and justice,\u201d Allison said. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2017 approved the payment of pensions of former police officers who served in Biafra during the civil war. The officers were granted a presidential pardon in 2000 by former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The Nigerian government has repeatedly said it is committed to developing the region and recently undertook a series of road projects. IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu is not backing down from his call for a breakaway Republic of Biafra [Chika Oduah\/Al Jazeera] But Vincent Nnanna, who was barely 10 years old when the civil war broke out and was recruited to assist the Biafran soldiers with clerical work in Abia state, is not convinced by the government\u2019s efforts so far. Advertisement \u201cThe clamour for equity and respect for fundamental human rights by the Igbos in particular and the southeast at large\u00a0has continued to fall on deaf ears,\u201d he said. \u2018Continued agitation\u2019 Separatist sentiment has not been wished away, and in recent years the pro-Biafra movement has seen some resurgence. The red, black and green flag of Biafra with a rising golden sun still dots the frontage of some commercial buildings and houses in the southeast region. Rights group Amnesty International accused the country\u2019s security forces of killing at least 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful rallies between August 2015 and August 2016 and detaining hundreds demonstrating in support of a breakaway state. The military and police denied the allegations. Nnamdi Kanu, a leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group, is the most visible face of the movement. He was held for nearly two years for treasonable felony charges before being granted bail on health grounds in April 2017. Kanu fled Nigeria under controversial circumstances in 2018 but still coordinates the group\u2019s activities from his base in the United Kingdom. In 2017, following a number of IPOB-organised protests across Nigeria over a period of years, the government banned the group and declared it a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d. \u201cThey masquerade as a separatist movement, yet they endanger the very people they claim to represent,\u201d Information Minister Lai Mohammed said in a 2017 statement about the government\u2019s move to outlaw the group. Advertisement \u201cIn reality, IPOB cares about IPOB and nothing more.\u201d The government\u2019s pronouncement, however, has not stopped the group\u2019s activities \u2013 especially overseas where it enjoys the support of millions of\u00a0Igbos in the diaspora. \u201cContinued agitation for Biafra is impelled and spurred by state-sponsored or supported injustice which left most Igbo youth with a sense of hopelessness and lack of outlets to express their \u2026 talents, potentials and ambitions,\u201d Allison said. He alleged that no real effort has been made to develop the region, support business, create jobs and ensure adequate security. Nnanna, however, said he is not happy with the approach of those leading the calls for a\u00a0new Biafra. \u201cThe regrets I have over Biafra is that since after the death of the forebears, some mercenaries have emerged on the scene purporting to have the spiritual mandate to champion the Biafran cause to a positive conclusion \u2013 only for them to herd the \u2026 crowd onto a blind alley, leaving the agitators confused and almost disillusioned,\u201d Nnanna said. Meanwhile, Mohammed Sarki, a public affairs analyst, called for more efforts towards reconciliation. \u201cThe continued discussions about the Biafra war won\u2019t help the country to move forward. Our leaders already declared that no side won the war. We need to forget the past and focus on how to fix Nigeria,\u201d Sarki said. \u201cThe civil war was not a pleasant experience for many people, not just Igbos.

There, Diego Prieto , director of Mexico\u2019s National Anthropology and History Institute (INAH) said the process was made with a verdict by Raffaela Cedraschi from the National Museum of the World\u2019s Cultures . The verdict, to which EL UNIVERSAL had access, consists of 27 pages and is divided into five sections: General Matters, Particular Matters, Authenticity Matters, Conclusion, and Bibliography. The Government of Mexico returns a bronze sculpture to Nigeria. Mexico strongly opposes illicit trafficking in cultural property.

We consider it necessary, hence, to consider it as a cultural heritage of relevance for Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba people.\u201d Recommended: Once again, French auction house to sell Mexico's cultural heritage The researcher complements her text with three recommendations with which it can be confirmed that the sculpture is authentic . The first consists of the sculpture to be kept under the safeguard of the National Museum of the World\u2019s Culture while there are still doubts on its origin so as to also conserve it as best as possible. \u201cFor the sculpture to be evaluated by an Ife art expert like Henry John Drewal (University of Wisconsin) or Suzanne Preston Blier (University of Harvard), or any other expert recommended by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) , notifying, in addition, the seizure of the piece at issue,\u201d writes Cedraschi. In the last point, she considers it necessary for the piece to be put under \u201ca more specific analysis about its structural composition, such as metallography and metal dating known as particle voltammetry .\u201d Before undergoing these considerations, Raffaela Cedraschi made an analysis of the piece from a comparative study with pictures from different books and websites, with which she obtained the characteristics the sculpture shares with others from the region found in different moments. Recommended: T he hidden splendor of Mayan city X'batu\u00fan The bronze sculpture represents a sitting human being with an accessory in the waist, necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and \u201ca central headdress.\u201d \u201cSo far, we have not been able to identify, among the sources, the object held like a scepter in the hands of the piece: It could be a hand closed in a fist with the thumb extended or the representation of a five-finger paw of the mythical rooster that spread the earth over the water and created the world; nevertheless, this piece seemingly has the marks of six fingers. Something similar happens in several Ife sculptures that have it in one hand while on the other, they have a horn with protection medicines,\u201d reads the document. Regarding the date of the piece, the expert recognizes \u201cit\u2019s very hard to date Ife culture pieces because most objects were found in very different places from their place of origin,\u201d Moreover, she adds that the sculpture is made with \u201cthe so-called copper alloy .\u201d The piece sought to enter Mexico via mail from the Pan African Market Shop (Capetown, South Africa) , \u201ca market similar to Mexico City\u2019s Ciudadela where, in different shops, all kinds of crafts from Africa are sold. According to the pictures found on the Internet, the place doesn\u2019t seem to offer any kind of authentic or ancient ethnographic pieces,\u201d explains Cedraschi. Almost by the end of the verdict, the INAH researcher points out that, after analyzing publications and news online \u201cwe ignore if the analyzed piece could have been found in an archeological site in Nigeria and then reproduced with the technique of lost wax and perhaps buried to make it have the patina it now has.\u201d Recommended: Mexico returns archeological artifacts to Peru Despite the recommendations by Raffaela Cedraschi , the repatriation took place as mentioned before. Among other things, Nigeria\u2019s Embassy in Mexico was asked whether they collaborated to verify if the piece was authentic and if the piece is in Mexico but there was no response.

The emir of Kano is by tradition the second most senior Islamic ruler in Africa's most populous nation, after the sultan of Sokoto. Lamido Sanusi, who ascended the throne in 2014, was accused of \"disrespect to lawful instructions\", the state government said in a statement. More: Gambia migrants: Survivors 'would risk journey again' Chad: 'More than a dozen killed in Boko Haram attack' Nigerians raise alarm over controversial Social Media Bill The government said his removal was also to safeguard the \"sanctity, culture, tradition, religion and prestige\" of the Kano state emirate established more than a millennium ago. Sources said the deposed ruler was taken into custody by police in his palace immediately after the announcement was made, and then escorted out of the city to neighbouring Nasawara state under tight security. The authorities said a replacement would be named soon. Sanusi, a former head of Nigeria's central bank, has been at loggerheads with state Governor Abdullahi Ganduje because of his outspokenness against the authorities and allegations he supported the opposition at last year's elections. Ganduje won re-election as governor and quickly ordered the creation of four new emirates in Kano in a bid to reduce Sanusi's control and influence. Emirs have no constitutional role in Nigeria, but they wield enormous king-like influence over their subjects. Their funds come from state government, and politicians rely on their support during elections. Face-to-face with Nigeria's MEND rebels (2:39) Not doing enough The traditional ruler has been investigated by state legislators for allegedly misappropriating funds meant for his office. The embattled emir denied the allegations. Last month, the outspoken ruler accused political and religious leaders in the north of not doing enough for the region, which he said widened the poverty gap between the mainly Muslim north and the majority-Christian south. The moves against him by the authorities have caused tempers to flare among his supporters. The regional parliament descended into violence on Monday as legislators exchanged blows over a new probe into the emir, which the opposition rejected. There have been no reports of protests or violence from Sanusi supporters following his removal, in contrast to previous cases. Riots broke out in Kano in 1963 when Sanusi's grandfather was dethroned by the then northern regional government for insubordination. Deadly violence erupted in the city in 1981 when the government queried Sanusi's predecessor Ado Bayero in an attempt to depose him. In his earlier role as central bank chief, Sanusi earned a reputation as a straight-talking moderniser, not afraid to speak out against corruption , although he faced - and denied - accusations of graft himself. He was sacked from that position in February 2014 after he accused the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation of not remitting some $20bn to state coffers.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said the explosion was triggered after a truck hit some gas cylinders stacked in a gas processing plant near the corporation's pipeline in Abule Ado area of Lagos state. The impact of the explosion led to the collapse of nearby houses, damaged NNPC's pipeline and caused the corporation to halt pumping operations on the Atlas Cove-Mosimi pipeline, the state-owned oil company said in a statement. Several people were injured and taken to hospital, according to Ibrahim Farinloye, zonal coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). Plumes of smoke billowed into the air as people watched, while firefighters tried to quench the flames, a Reuters witness said. Farinloye told Reuters that \"the explosion destroyed over 50 residential houses.\" Pipeline fires in Nigeria, Africa's biggest crude oil producer, are common and they are mostly caused by theft and sabotage. The methods used to steal oil often result in accidents that cause fires. \"The fire started with smoke,\" one eyewitness said. \"The smoke was coming up and later we heard a sound ... and some houses collapsed even the roofs.\" NNPC said that the temporary shutdown of the petroleum products pipeline would not affect the normal supply of products to the Lagos and surrounding towns.

Pedestrians walk through Guangzhou's African Village in Guangdong Province, China, on April 7. Alex Plaveski \/ EPA By Linda Givetash and Matteo Moschella Chinese officials are denying allegations that people of color are facing discrimination and even eviction under coronavirus mitigation efforts, as they report that Africans are among the country\u2019s newly confirmed cases. The Chinese state news agency, Xinhua, reported last week that 111 people from Africa living in the city of Guangzhou had tested positive for the coronavirus. This followed confirmation from U.S. and African officials \u2014 and at least one business \u2014 that people were being denied services, subjected to COVID-19 tests and forced into supervised quarantine. A group of African ambassadors in Beijing were the first to raise the issue, co-signing a letter saying Africans were being subjected to humiliation and harassment despite adhering to local policies designed to mitigate the spread of the virus. Africans from Togo, Nigeria and Benin had been evicted from hotels in the middle of the night, a group of African students was forced to take tests despite not having traveled recently, and others reported being threatened with having their visas and work permits revoked, said the letter, addressed to China\u2019s foreign ministry . The U.S. Consulate General then issued a warning on April 13 that people appearing to be of African origin or in contact with African nationals were being forced to take COVID-19 tests and undergo quarantine \u2014 under supervision and at their own expense in some cases \u2014 regardless of their recent travel history or whether they had already completed a required period of self-isolation. \u201cAfrican Americans have also reported that some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them,\u201d it said.

NBC News could not verify the video\u2019s authenticity. However, the Ugandan Embassy confirmed that some of their citizens in China had been evicted, but clarified that this was due in part to their legal status in the country. As a result of the greater scrutiny of residents and their travels under coronavirus mitigation measures, Ugandan workers who had overstayed their work permits were being caught, said Philip Kanyoonzi, Uganda's acting ambassador to China. \"Their landlords were quickly pushing them out of their homes in order not to be caught on the wrong side of the law by China\u2019s government,\" Kanyoonzi said. \"We have engaged China to say that, yes, we acknowledge that these people may be illegal migrants, and therefore on the wrong side of the law, but nevertheless they need to be treated humanely,\" he said. Kanyoonzi said Chinese officials had assured him the situation would be rectified but did not provide specifics. A temporary temperature checkpoint is set up in the once-bustling markets of Guangzhou's Sanyuanli area last week. David Kirton \/ Reuters Botswana's ambassador to China also met with government officials last week to address \"reported incidents of mistreatment of Africans\" and \"find an immediate remedial action,\" the Botswana government said in a statement .

China \"treats all foreign personnel in China as equals and opposes any differentiated practices targeting specific groups of people,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at an April 13 news conference. Zhao also accused the United States of trying to fuel a dispute between China and Africa, saying \u201cthe U.S. side is arrogant and provocative, which is neither moral nor responsible.\" In a tweet on Tuesday , Zhao said that China\u2019s \u201cfriendship with Africa is unbreakable,\u201d and that \u201csmearing or wedge-driving would never succeed.\u201d Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak .

As they prepare for a surge in cases, misleading information has been spreading throughout the continent. 1. Inhaling very hot steam is dangerous The false claim that inhaling steam is an effective treatment against coronavirus has surfaced once again, this time in Tanzania with an endorsement by its president. As part of an appeal to put more emphasis on traditional cures, President John Magufuli has said inhaling steam kills off viruses in the nose and the mouth. Mr Magufuli suggested that high temperatures would work against the virus during remarks about the best strategy to tackle the coronavirus crisis. But although high temperature steam treatment is used for industrial cleaning in places such as hospitals, inhaling it at these temperatures would be extremely dangerous to the human body, according to Keith Neal, a specialist in the spread of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham in the UK. Live tracker: The coronavirus in Africa He points out that if steam that hot got inside your body in attempt to kill the virus, your lungs would also be irreparably damaged. Also, water vapour rising from a boiling pan would be quickly cooled as it enters the body and not be hot enough to have an effect against the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against taking very hot baths to stop the virus, saying this could burn you. 2.Chinese-owned businesses in Nigeria were not attacked As reports about Africans facing discrimination in China have emerged , some people have started spreading fake videos, claiming they show people retaliating against the Chinese community in Africa. A case in point is a video said to show a Chinese-owned business on fire in Nigeria. The images actually show shops on fire at a popular market area in Ibadan in south-west Nigeria this month. The Punch newspaper in Nigeria reported on the fire and refers to Nigerian traders with no mention of Chinese businesses . The video which has been viewed more than a million times was later pulled by Twitter because they said \"it violated Twitter rules\". 3. Consuming alcohol does not protect against Covid-19 The governor of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, has been criticised for misleading remarks about alcohol and the coronavirus. Governor Mike Sonko was explaining why he is including bottles of Hennessy cognac in food supplies for vulnerable people in the city, saying it would serve as a \"throat sanitiser\". \"From the research which has been conducted by World Health Organization (WHO) and various health organisations it has been revealed that alcohol plays a very major role in killing the coronavirus, or any sort of virus,\" he said. He appears to have misinterpreted WHO health advice. It says drinking alcohol does not protect you against the coronavirus, but it does refer to the efficacy of alcohol-based gel to clean your hands. The WHO advice adds that alcohol consumption \"is likely to increase the health risks if a person becomes infected with the virus\". Hennessy, the manufacturers of Hennessy cognac, have also cautioned Kenyans against consuming alcohol with the belief that it will offer protection. 4. Blue facemasks are not contaminated Two posts on Facebook, which have been urging Africans not to wear blue face masks amid claims they are contaminated with toxins, have been widely shared. The first post claims to be quoting Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and a supposed scheme to distribute contaminated masks. \"Dear Africans, avoid wearing the blue masks that are made in America and Europe because these masks contain suicidal toxic [sic]\" the post reads. It doesn't explain what toxins they are supposed to contain. Amazon says the quotes have been fabricated. A post on another page - this time falsely quoting the head of the World Health Organization - also urges people not to wear blue masks. Mary Stephen, from the WHO regional office for Africa, told the BBC the organisation hasn't received any reports of contaminated masks. \"Countries are sourcing their masks from different sources, and we are not aware of any contamination,\" she says.

The governor of southern oil hub Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, on Friday said Exxon Mobil workers were arrested after entering the state from neighbouring Akwa Ibom State in violation of an executive order restricting movement into the state as part of measures imposed last month. He said 22 workers, whose coronavirus status was unknown, were quarantined in line with relevant health protocols and would be charged in court. But Wike's spokesman, Simeon Nwakaudu, on Sunday issued a statement that said the workers were all released without charge \"following interventions by well-meaning Nigerians\". The union said its statement referred to 21 Exxon Mobil workers who were union members, whereas Rivers State included the driver in its tally to total 22 people. Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the situation. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) said it had instructed its members to withdraw all forms of services relating to crude oil production, refining, distribution and supplies from Monday unless the Exxon Mobil workers were freed. \"Having achieved the primary demand in our ultimatum, we hereby suspend the planned industrial action,\" PENGASSAN said in a statement on Sunday. Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State, is the hub of the oil industry in Africa's biggest producer of crude. Sales of crude oil make up about 90% of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings. Rivers State has recorded two cases of coronavirus so far. Nigeria has 541 confirmed cases nationwide and 19 deaths. The most high profile victim was the president's chief of staff, Abba Kyari, who died on Friday. Nigeria's petroleum regulator has ordered oil and gas companies to reduce their offshore workforce and move to 28-day staff rotations, instead of the usual 14 days, to help to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. PENGASSAN, in its statement, called on the government to \"guarantee unfettered movement of oil and gas workers on essential services in all territories of the federation\" so they could continue to provide services.

President Muhammadu Buhari, in a statement, said he would not tolerate large scale killing of innocent people by criminal gangs. \"In line with my commitment to security of the people, these attacks will be met with decisive force,\" said Buhari, who is from Katsina.

Africa also has a \u201cvery, very limited\u201d and \u201cvery, very strained\u201d testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in his weekly briefing on Thursday. The surge in infections on the continent is almost certainly under-reported and even higher in reality, say medical experts. WHO\u2019s recent report painted a grim picture for Africa, one of the last continents to be hit by the pandemic. WHO warned the virus could kill more than 300,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty. Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, Nkengasong said, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical. \u201cIt all depends on what we are discussing here, which is, are you testing? Are you finding the cases? Are you isolating and tracking the contacts?\u201d Nkengasong said, adding that the WHO report \u201cis not a prediction that means it must happen.\u201d By Nkengasong\u2019s own criteria, Africa is struggling on the testing front. In the two months since the continent began mobilizing to fight the outbreak, less than 500,000 tests have been conducted on the population of more than 1 billion. That\u2019s just 325 people tested per 1 million people, Nkengasong said. By comparison, that\u2019s far lower than Italy, one of the world\u2019s worst-hit countries, he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t find. And if you don\u2019t test, you are blinded. If you don\u2019t test, you are not ahead of the curve,\u201d Nkengasong said. African governments reported a total of nearly 26,000 cases as of Thursday, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up from just over 16,000 a week ago. Around 1,200 people have died. Although those figures are still relatively small in the global picture, the sharp increase in cases is a cause for concern, said Nkengasong. The previous week saw an increase of 29%. The Africa Centers for Disease Control has a target of conducting 1 million more tests in Africa over the next four weeks and 10 million tests in the next four months. The overall effort is badly hampered, Nkengasong said, by a major obstacle: The existing fragility of the health services in many African countries. \u201cI\u2019d like to make sure I make this very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an uphill battle to build health systems while you need them. ... That is what we are actually doing now. We are playing catch-up and that is a very, very tough thing to do.\u201d It\u2019s not exclusively bad news for Africa. South Africa has nearly 4,000 reported cases, according to its health ministry, the highest in Africa. It also saw a big one-day jump of 318 new cases on Thursday and 75 people have now died. But Africa\u2019s most developed economy is being praised for an aggressive testing program. South Africa, aided by an existing infrastructure, has carried out more than 140,000 tests, according to its health minister. And \u201cthey are starting to see a bending of their curve.\u201d said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa. South Africa\u2019s early and tentative signs of success \u2014 helped, maybe, by a strict lockdown \u2014 are being set off by \u201cconcerning increases\u201d in virus cases in some countries in West Africa and East Africa, Moeti said. Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country with 200 million people and a high population density, is a stark example of the testing and health system shortcomings prevalent across the continent. The country has reported 873 cases of COVID-19 and 28 deaths but had conducted just 7,153 tests as of Wednesday, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control. Around 5,000 of those tests only came in the last week. \u201cThe truth is, we have to work with what we have. We definitely didn\u2019t start at the baseline where South Africa started,\u201d said Chikwe Ihekweazu, director general of the Nigerian center. \u201cMany lessons will be learned here and around the world.

President Muhammadu Buhari said a lockdown would be imposed in Kano for an additional two weeks, and that he was sending a government team to investigate. Nigeria's Health Minister Dr Osagie Ehanire says the situation is being \"monitored closely\". But following preliminary investigations the state authorities have dismissed a connection with coronavirus. Why some Nigerians are gloating about coronavirus Helping those struggling to eat amid the lockdowns Nigeria's mega churches adjust to empty auditoriums Hundreds of people are rumoured to have died in the community but no official death records are kept. Grave diggers initially raised concerns that they were burying a higher than usual number of bodies. Ali, a grave digger at the Abattoir Graveyard, told the BBC: \"We have never seen this, since the major cholera outbreak that our parents tell us about. That was about 60 years ago.\" Grave digger Ali says he is burying more bodies This week, the state governor issued a statement saying the \"mysterious deaths\" were unrelated to coronavirus. But after ordering a \"thorough investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the deaths\", announced that their preliminary findings \"indicated that the deaths are not connected to the Covid-19 pandemic\". The state government said \"reports from the state ministry of health has shown that most of the deaths were caused by complications arising from hypertension, diabetes, meningitis and acute malaria\". \"Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is earnestly waiting for the final report from the state ministry of health so as to take the necessary action.\" The commercial and industrial centre of the north, Kano has become the epicentre of coronavirus in northern Nigeria. Its highly dense population is still in lockdown in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Don't tests show the cause of death? State officials started testing for Covid-19 two weeks ago and one lab has had to close due to contamination. Samples are being sent to the capital, Abuja, which authorities say is causing a delay in announcing how many positive cases have been detected in the state. Dr Sani Aliyu, who is the national co-ordinator for the presidential task force on Covid-19, says a team of five medical experts were deployed to Kano to facilitate in reopening the testing centre this week after it was fumigated. Officials also plan to open a second lab, at Bayero University, for testing for Covid-19 from next week. How many people have died? It is unclear how many people have died, as the deaths causing concern are happening in the community. Deaths in many parts of Nigeria are not registered, and so for those who died outside of hospital, no records are kept. This makes it difficult to understand how many people have died in recent weeks. Sabitu Shaibu, the deputy head of the state task force on Covid-19, is hoping to release preliminary findings of the investigation by next week but believes that most of the rumoured 640 deaths are from natural causes and says the figure is below the average death rate for Kano. Getty Images Health workers prepared beds for a coronavirus isolation centre in Abuja at the beginning of April Hospital records which provide the only death register available are thought to provide lower numbers than the real picture across the state. Those on the investigating taskforce say they will conduct \"verbal autopsies\" with family members to help establish why people are dying. If not coronavirus, what else could be going on? Private hospitals which provide for a significant part of health provision in the region have been closed due to coronavirus fears. This could mean a lack of support for those with existing conditions who may have died as a result. Dr Nagoma Sadiq who works at the Aminu Kano Hospital, thinks this could be behind the additional deaths, but he is also not ruling out coronavirus. \"It's shocking to most of us that the count of the dead is alarming. But it's likely due to the reduction in the number of health institutions available in the state. \"Because there are a lot of hypertensive patients, diabetic patients, asthmatic patients, cancer patients, and they don't have much access to the hospitals. The lockdown is affecting everybody. \"Our poor majority don't even have a vehicle to take them to the hospitals.\" More funerals are happening Grave digger Ali agrees, adding \"some say the current situation is due to the epidemic, others say it's difficulties of life. People have so many problems in their lives and a lack of peace of mind.\" However Covid-19 is known to be more dangerous for those with underlying health conditions, so it could be that the deaths are related to coronavirus. The only way to know for sure is to test for coronavirus. Dr Sadiq also said that there was still a concern about an ongoing Lassa fever infection amongst communities. The state has had five confirmed cases and one death, according to the most recent report from the Nigerian Centre For Disease Control. Kano currently has 77 positive cases of coronavirus with three deaths. Authorities are urging the public not to panic. What else did the president announce? President Buhari announced a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions in Abuja, Lagos and neighbouring Ogun state from next Monday. But he also said that the government would impose a curfew across the country between 20:00 and 06:00, require everyone to wear face masks in public, and stop \"non-essential inter-state passenger travel\".

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said the number of recorded infections across Kano rose to 219, up from 77 at the start of the week. The number of fatalities in the state officially confirmed as due to coronavirus stands at three. The rise in cases comes after the authorities ratcheted up their focus on the region -- which includes north Nigeria's biggest city -- following a spike in what officials called \"mysterious deaths\". President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday imposed a two-week lockdown on Kano state and pledged \"all the necessary human, material and technical resources\" to tackle the issue. Health authorities have been conducting \"verbal autopsies\" -- asking relatives and doctors about the symptoms of those who died recently without exhuming the bodies for physical tests. State officials insisted most of the fatalities were due to other diseases rather than COVID-19. Nasiru Sani Gwarzo, head of the presidential COVID-19 taskforce sent to Kano, told AFP that Kano appeared to be \"at the threshold of the community transmission stage\". But he said the rise in deaths was also due to cuts to medical services for other ailments as a result of the crisis. \"We observe some sort of collateral damage from war where some sick people who could have been taken care of had there been no outbreak fall victim,\" he said. Medics in Kano have reported hospitals sending inpatients home due to the pandemic and the closure of pharmacies has made getting vital drugs tougher. Gwarzo said testing capacity for the state of over 13 million people was currently \"at least 88 tests daily\" after the reopening of its sole laboratory following a virus outbreak there. A second lab is slated to open next week that will boost capacity to 300 tests and officials hope to increase the number of sample collection sites, he said. While Nigeria has intensified focus on Kano, it is set to ease a lockdown on largest city Lagos and its capital Abuja from Monday. Shutdown measures present major social and economic challenges in Africa's most populous nation, where roughly half of the 200 million people live in dire poverty. Nigeria has confirmed 1,932 infections and 58 deaths nationwide from the novel coronavirus, with megacity Lagos the only region with more cases than Kano.

Tens of thousands of Koranic school children were recently crammed into open vans and sent back home from cities and towns across northern Nigeria in a controversial move by state governments to prevent the spread of coronavirus within their territories. There was a ban on travel, but the vans, with children sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, were allowed to criss-cross the country's highways to get the boys to their homes in villages, often thousands of miles away. All of Nigeria's 19 northern states had two-way movement - some children were leaving for home while others were returning home. It was probably one of the biggest ever state organised mass movements of minors in Africa's most-populous state, whose population of around 200 million is divided roughly equally between Muslims and Christians. AFP Large numbers of child beggars used to roam the streets of Kano No-one knows how many of the children - known in the local Hausa language as almajirai (singular almajiri), which is derived from the Arabic word al-Muhajirun, or emigrant - were sent home but Kaduna state alone said it had repatriated 30,000. What no-one knew was that hundreds of the children already had coronavirus, so officials had inadvertently contributed to spreading the virus rather than containing it. 'Time bomb warning ignored' As the children arrived in their home states, some of them were quarantined and tested. The results caused widespread consternation - of the 169 tested in Kaduna, 65 were positive, as were 91 of the 168 tested in Jigawa. Jigawa state government It is unclear how the children got infected In Gombe, eight of the 48 children tested had Covid-19. In Bauchi, the number was seven out of 38. Hundreds of test results are still being awaited, while many thousands more have not been tested - Nigeria has faced criticism for its low testing rate . The head of Nigeria's presidential task force on Covid-19, Boss Mustapha, had warned that the repatriations could cause a \"time bomb\", but northern state governors ignored him. They saw the pandemic as an opportunity to scrap the almajirai-based Koranic schools that have long been part of the Islamic education system in the mainly Muslim north. \"We've been looking for ways and means to end this system because it has not worked for the children. It has not worked for northern Nigeria and it has not worked for Nigeria. So, it has to end and this is the time,\" said Kaduna state governor Nasir el-Rufai. He added it was better to give the almajirai \"some kind of modern education than to allow them to waste their lives away, roaming about the streets begging for what to eat\". \"In Kaduna state, the almajiri system is dead,\" Mr el-Rufai said. The almajirai are mostly children from poor homes who go to live for five to 10 years in a boarding-house style setting to memorise the Koran under a teacher, known as a mallam. Getty Images Muslims believe those who memorise the Koran will go to heaven About 10.5 million Nigerian children aged between five and 14 years are not in school, according to the UN children's agency, Unicef. Unicef does not consider the almajirai as being in school so they make up a large part - if not the majority - of this number. Children sent to beg on streets The almajirai-based schools admit children as young as five, and they are expected to give their teachers the token sum of 100 naira ($0.30; \u00a30.25) every Wednesday, which is the end of the week for the pupils with Thursday and Friday - a religious day for Muslims - being their weekend. The mallams say the money is for the maintenance of the schools, and they do not pocket it. Most almajirai have no means of paying and resort to begging on the streets to get the money. Sometimes they carry out menial jobs for families, in exchange for food or clothes. They often live in squalid conditions with poor hygiene, and can go without a bath for weeks, despite the fact that Islam puts huge emphasis on cleanliness. The mallams themselves are mostly poor, untrained, and unregulated. They tend to teach, and do subsistence farming. Some children help out on the farms, without getting anything in return. Islamic teachings on hygiene: Cleanliness is half of faith Wash hands before and after eating Wash hands after going to the toilet Wash hands, face and feet before each of the five daily prayers Bathe before main weekly prayer on Fridays Wash a person after death; some clerics say it is fine if this cannot be done in current circumstances Coronavirus in Africa: How to save water so you can wash your hands The schools were shut when state governments announced the closure of places of learning in late March, but with nowhere to go, thousands of almajirai continued begging on the streets. It was at this point that state governors - fearing that the children could be infected, and could spread it to the hundreds of people they come in contact with daily - decided to send them home. Former almajiri Imrana Mohammed chose to become a businessman But it was too late. No-one knows how the children became infected with the virus but Imrana Mohammed, a former almajiri, said they most likely \"got it through meeting strangers while begging for alms\". Mr Mohammed, who now runs a small business selling petroleum products, said that as an almajiri 14 years ago, he did domestic work for about $6 a month, and also got food to eat.

Helping those struggling to eat amid the lockdowns Nigeria's mega churches adjust to empty auditoriums There have been discussions in the past about ending the system but in a region where religion is an extremely sensitive issue, defenders of the schools accused those who wanted them reformed of attempting to stop Islamic education. Hopes of a father Former President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian from Nigeria's south, invested billions of naira in building almajiri schools in the north that incorporated Islamic and secular education. But his successor, Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim who is popular in the region and has called for a ban of the almajiri system, handed over the schools to state governments and Islamic scholars for management. Most of the schools are now abandoned and the pupils back on the streets. Getty Images Most children use plastic bowls to beg for food Some parents, like Shafiu Yau, do not want the system scrapped \"because it is the way to heaven\". He told the BBC that his 15-year-old son is currently an almajiri in Kano state, seen as Nigeria's Islamic heartland. Not all the students have been sent home, especially in Kano. \"This is his second year as an amajiri and hopefully after five years he will come back with vast knowledge of the Koran and his religion,\" Mr Yau said. But that view is not shared by all. Sheikh Abdullahi Garangamawa, the chief imam of the Jafar Adam Mosque in northern Nigeria's main city Kano, told the BBC that the almajiri system was being abused. \"The almajiri system, as it is today, is nothing but slavery and governments should stop their dragging feet and act fast on it. \"These boys sent from the villages no longer seek Islamic knowledge - many of them become criminals and thugs for politicians,\" he said. This is a harsh view of an ancient system of Islamic education in northern Nigeria, and it is unlikely to end until the government tackles poverty and offers the children - and their parents - a better alternative.

(WCS Nigeria via AP) Read More By\u00a0\n            CARLEY PETESCH Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit DAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Conservationists have captured the first images of a group of rare Cross River gorillas with multiple babies in Nigeria\u2019s Mbe mountains, proof that the subspecies once feared to be extinct is reproducing amid protection efforts. Only around 300 Cross River gorillas were known to be alive at one point in the isolated mountainous region in Nigeria and Cameroon, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which captured the camera trap images in May. More color images were recovered last month. John Oates, professor emeritus at the City University of New York and a primatologist who helped establish conservation efforts for the gorillas more than two decades ago, was excited about the new images. \u201cIt was great to see ... evidence that these gorillas in these mountains are reproducing successfully because there have been so few images in the past,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cWe know very little about what is going on with reproduction with this subspecies, so to see many young animals is a positive sign.\u201d Experts don\u2019t know how many Cross River gorillas remain in the mountain cluster and have been trying to track the subspecies for some time. About 50 cameras were set up in 2012 and multiple images have been captured in Cameroon\u2019s Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary and in Nigeria\u2019s Mbe Mountains community forest and Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary. But Cross River gorillas are notoriously difficult to capture together on camera and no images had captured multiple infants. An alliance of nine local communities, the Conservation Association of the Mbe Mountains, has been working with the Wildlife Conservation Society since the mid-1990s to help protect the Cross River gorillas. Since that time, there have been no recorded deaths in Nigeria, the society said. The gorillas at one point had been thought to be extinct, according to the society\u2019s Nigeria country director, Andrew Dunn. \u201cIt\u2019s a big success story that shows communities can protect their wildlife,\u201d he told the AP. Cross River gorillas have been threatened for decades primarily by hunting but also by loss of habitat as residents cut down forests to make way for agriculture. The subspecies was \u201crediscovered\u201d in the late 1980s. About 100 Cross River gorillas have since been recorded in Nigeria\u2019s Cross River State and about 200 in Cameroon in a transborder region of about 12,000 square kilometers (4,633 square miles). The Mbe mountains forest is home to about a third of the Nigeria population. The gorillas are extremely shy of humans and their presence is detected mostly by their nests, dung and feeding trails, experts say. A team of about 16 eco-guards have been recruited from surrounding communities to patrol and protect the gorillas and other wildlife, Dunn said. Inaoyom Imong, director of WCS Nigeria\u2019s Cross River Landscape project, said that seeing a few young gorillas in a group is promising. The new photos were taken in a community forest without any formal protection status, Imong said, \u201can indication we can have strong community support in conservation.\u201d Hunting was always the main threat, he said, but \u201cwe do believe that hunting has reduced drastically.\u201d The conservation groups also are working to reduce illegal cutting of forests, he said. But other dangers remain. \u201cAlthough hunters no longer target gorillas, snares set for other game pose a threat to the gorillas as infants can be caught in them and potentially die from injuries,\u201d Imong said. Disease is also a potential threat, along with conflict and insecurity in Cameroon. \u201cRefugees from the ongoing insecurity in Cameroon are also moving into the area, and they will likely increase hunting pressure and the need for more farmland,\u201d Dunn said. For now, they must rely on the work of Nigerian communities. \u201cI feel honored to be part of the efforts that are producing these results,\u201d said Chief Damian Aria, the head of the village of Wula. He told the AP his community and others have worked hard to help preserve the natural habitat for the gorillas, and they are proud of their efforts. \u201cWe are so happy they are reproducing,\u201d he said. While the gorillas\u2019 livelihood is important for nature, Aria also hopes that mountain communities in due time will benefit from the tourism they might bring.","question":"When were rare Cross River gorillas with multiple babies first captured on camera in Nigeria's Mbe mountains?","answer":"The first images were captured in May 2020, with additional photos recovered in June 2020.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"To answer this question, we need to consider the context and available information about Cross River gorillas and their habitat in Nigeria, specifically the Mbe Mountains.\n\n1. **Understanding the Subject**: Cross River gorillas are a subspecies of gorillas that are critically endangered.

An upper Sharia court in the Hausawa Filin Hockey area of the state said Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, 22, was guilty of committing blasphemy for a song he circulated via WhatsApp in March. Mr Sharif-Aminu did not deny the charges. Judge Khadi Aliyu Muhammad Kani said he could appeal against the verdict. States across Muslim-majority northern Nigeria use both secular law and Sharia law. Although Sharia law is supposed to apply only to Muslims, in reality non-Muslims come under pressure to adhere to hisbah (Sharia police) rulings. Only one of the death sentences passed by Nigeria's Sharia courts has been carried out since they were reintroduced in 1999. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories What is Sharia? The singer who is currently in detention, had gone into hiding after he composed the song. Protesters had burnt down his family home and gathered outside the headquarters of the Islamic police, known as the Hisbah, demanding action against him. Idris Ibrahim The Islamic police had appealed for people not to take the law in to their own hands after the song was released Critics said the song was blasphemous as it praised an imam from the Tijaniya Muslim brotherhood to the extent it elevated him above the Prophet Muhammad. 'Judgement will serve as deterrent to others' The leader of the protesters that called for the musician's arrest in March, Idris Ibrahim, told the BBC that the judgement will serve as a warning to others \"contemplating toeing Yahaya's path\".\"When I heard about the judgment I was so happy because it showed our protest wasn't in vain. \"This [judgement] will serve as a deterrent to others who feel they could insult our religion or prophet and go scot-free,\" he said. Who is Yahaya Sharif-Aminu? Few people had heard of him before his arrest in March. An Islamic gospel musician, he is not well-known in northern Nigeria and his songs were not popular outside his Tjjaniya sect, who have many such musicians within their ranks. How common are death sentences in Sharia courts? Several sentences have been passed, including for women convicted of having extramarital sex - cases which have caused widespread condemnation. But only one has been carried out - a man convicted of killing a woman and her two children who was hanged in 2002. The last time a Nigerian Sharia court passed a death sentence was in 2016 when Abdulazeez Inyass, was sentenced to death for blaspheming against Islam during after a secret trial in Kano. He was alleged to have said that Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse, the Senegalese cleric credited with reviving the Tijaniya sect and spreading it across West Africa, \"was bigger than Prophet Muhammad\". The sentence has not been carried out as a death penalty in Nigeria requires the sign-off of the state governor. Mr Inyass is still in detention. How Nigeria's Sharia courts work By Mansur Abubakar, BBC News, Kano Twelve states in Nigeria's Muslim-dominated north operate the Sharia system of justice, but only Muslims can be tried in its courts. The Sharia system, which also has its own Court of Appeal, handles both civil and criminal matters involving Muslims and its judgements can also be challenged in Nigeria's secular Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court. The Sharia judges, known as alkalis, are learned in both Islamic and secular laws. If a case involves a Muslim and a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim has the option of choosing where they want the case to be tried. The Sharia court can only hear the case if the non-Muslim gives written consent. Sentences handed down by the courts include floggings, amputations and the death penalty. Clarification 3rd November 2022: This article has been amended to make clear that although Sharia law is supposed to apply only to Muslims, this is not the case in practice.

The Islamic State West Africa Province, which broke away from Boko Haram several years ago, warned in June that it would target Nigerians working for international aid agencies along with those who helped the military. Nigeria\u2019s president already had blamed the extremists for the slayings. The group issued its claim online in its digital weekly newspaper, al-Naba, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist groups. The aid workers were killed on Sunday, and a video of their deaths was later released on social media, SITE reported. The alarming development threatens to further complicate relief efforts in northeastern Nigeria, where nearly 2 million people have been displaced by the ongoing insurgency. The U.N. World Food Program says 3 million in the northeast are facing hunger, and now also threatened by COVID-19. The five were traveling by road to the state capital of Maiduguri when they were abducted last month by the militants.

The incident between Department of State Services (DSS) agents and members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) took place in southeastern Nigeria's Enugu state. DSS said two of its personnel were killed in what they called an unprovoked attack, while IPOB, in a statement, said 21 of their members were killed and more than 40 others arrested after security forces stormed one of their meetings. DSS did not immediately respond to queries on IPOB member deaths. IPOB described itself as a peaceful group and denied killing any DSS agents. IPOB leaders have called for secession in the region, where tensions have simmered since a Biafra separatist rebellion sparked a civil war in 1967-70 that killed an estimated one million people. In 2017, Nigeria's armed forces designated IPOB as a \"terrorist organisation\" after it stepped up calls for secession. Amnesty International in 2016 accused Nigeria's security forces of killing at least 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful rallies. The military and police denied the allegations.

Witnesses and the rights group Amnesty International said several people were killed and wounded when soldiers opened fire. The state governor said about 25 people had been wounded but only one person had died. An indefinite 24-hour curfew has been imposed on Lagos and other regions. Protests over a now-disbanded police unit - the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) - have been taking place for two weeks, with demonstrators using the social media hashtag #EndSars to rally crowds. As tensions continued to rise on Wednesday, police in different districts of Lagos fired shots in the air to disperse people defying the curfew, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo reports from the capital, Abuja.

A bus station was reported to be on fire in another district while a major TV station - linked to one of the governing party's top politicians - was reportedly set alight by people throwing petrol bombs. The headquarters of the Nigerian Ports Authority was also set on fire, local media said. What do we know about the shooting?

He initially said no-one had been killed but later said one person had died in hospital due to \"blunt force trauma to the head\". Contradicting the army, he told the BBC's Newshour programme that the military had been at the scene at the time of the shooting despite public assurances that soldiers would not be deployed until after the start of a curfew at 21:00. \"I think about seven o'clock or thereabouts there was a small unit of the military that went [to Lekki] and we heard that gunshots were fired,\" he said.

Nigeria reacts to harrowing scenes Analysis by Mayeni Jones, BBC Nigeria Correspondent It was a bleak night in Nigeria as social media footage from the shooting poured in, showing gunshots ringing out at the protest site long into the night. This is not the first time the Nigerian army has been accused of shooting unarmed protesters. There have been reports of violent crackdowns on EndSars protesters in other parts of the country. But seeing live rounds used at one of the protest sites that had been peaceful until last night has rattled many. Just last week I stood at the very site of the shooting. The protesters were peaceful, organised, hopeful for the future of their country. But this is no more. Harrowing social media videos showing protesters singing the national anthem as shots ring out in the background have caused outrage. Multiple online accounts say the CCTV and lights were taken out at the toll gate where the protest took place before troops started advancing, leading to total chaos. These details are galvanising a generation already disillusioned with the ruling class. The Nigerian government is running out of time to quell the growing dissatisfaction. How did the unrest begin? Protests began nearly two weeks ago with calls for the Sars police unit, which had been accused of illegal detentions, assaults and shootings, to be disbanded. President Buhari dissolved the unit on 11 October. But the demonstrators called for more changes in the security forces as well as reforms to the way the country is run.

REUTERS\/Nneka Chile Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian soldiers shot dead peaceful protesters at a demonstration in Lagos last month, trucking away the bodies, said written witness testimonies submitted to a judicial panel on Saturday but contradicted by an army general. \"The soldiers kept shooting at random, and I saw people falling to the ground, injured or lifeless,\" said Dabiraoluwa Ayuku in her testimony. Her account was one of three seen by Reuters, and submitted to the Lagos panel investigating allegations that the army and police opened fire on and killed people protesting at the city's Lekki Toll Gate against police brutality. The protests, the worst since the country's return to civilian rule in 1999, climaxed in that incident on Oct. 20, when rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police killed at least 12 protesters in two districts. Both the army and police have denied killing demonstrators. In testimony to the panel on Saturday, Brigadier General Ahmed Taiwo, who heads the army's 81st Division in Lagos, said soldiers fired blank rounds only, into the air, to disperse protesters. When shown a photo by Reuters which he used as testimony to prove the army fired only blanks, he said two bullets among the 11 shown were live rounds, one spent and one unspent. He said they were not the army's, but perhaps from the police. \"If we fired live rounds into that crowd, the casualties will have been too much,\" Taiwo said. \"So we made that judgement, and decided to use blank ammunition.\" Police did not respond to calls seeking comment. Two of the civilian panel witness said some troops fired into the air, but all three said other soldiers shot peaceful protesters, injuring or killing them. \"I remember a particular soldier that kept dancing while he shot,\" said Ayuku. Soldiers removed some protesters' corpses in vans, said two witnesses, one adding that the troops took away bullet casings.

At least 17 students kidnapped by the Boko Haram armed group from a school in northwestern Nigeria were rescued on Tuesday, said an official, adding that two students died in the operation, according to the Anadolu Agency. Katsina state\u2019s Governor Aminu Masari told a local radio station he had ordered an operation to be carried out after hundreds of students were kidnapped by the group from a boarding school in Kankara, a small town in Katsina, on Friday. On Tuesday, Boko Haram, which had kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls in the country\u2019s Chibok region in 2014, claimed responsibility. \u201cThe majority of the kidnapped students are in the Zamfara forest in the neighbouring province. Efforts are under way to save them,\u201d he said. Katsina state\u2019s police spokesman Gambo Isah said a security guard was injured during the operation and additional security forces would be dispatched to the area for search and rescue operations. Attackers on motorcycles stormed the all-boys Government Science Secondary School late on Friday and engaged security forces in a fierce gun battle, forcing hundreds of students to flee and hide in the surrounding forest. Defence Minister Bashir Salihi Magashi visited the area, promising the students would be rescued soon, as parents and residents continued to demonstrate for their release. The number of missing students also remains unclear \u2013 320 or 333, according to two accounts by officials, while residents in Kankara put it at more than 500, AFP news agency reported on Wednesday. Masari has ordered the closure of all boarding schools in the state in the wake of the attack. For Umar Ahmed, the nightmare began in confusion. Gunmen arrived late on Friday at his school just as he and his classmates were about to go to bed. Their first thought was that the men were vigilantes \u2013 civilians who take on a policing role \u2013 \u201cso, we were not scared,\u201d the 18-year-old told AFP. But then, he says heavy firing started. \u201cWe became terrified. Some of us ran to the perimeter fence trying to escape, while others hid inside. \u201cThey kept shouting we should come back, that they were in the school to rescue us. And most of us came back,\u201d he added. Lanky and soft-spoken, Ahmad explained how the students were rounded up under a tree, split into three groups and led through the forest. \u201cWe had no footwear,\u201d he said, his feet swathed in black socks after they became riddled with thorns. The teenager said the group trekked for hours, heading towards neighbouring Zamfara state. \u201cThey flogged us with tree branches and the flat side of their machetes,\u201d he said. But then came a stroke of luck. He and a friend were able to hide behind a bush. They waited for complete silence to prevail before they retraced their steps back home to safety. In a statement, President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the \u201ccowardly attack\u201d by Boko Haram \u201con innocent children\u201d, saying the security forces had launched an operation. The abduction took place hundreds of kilometres away from Boko Haram\u2019s stronghold in northeast Nigeria, sparking fears of a massive advance in the group\u2019s activities. Fears that Boko Haram was making inroads into the northwest have been simmering for some time. About 8,000 people have been killed in the region since 2011, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank. The kidnappings occurred in the home state of Buhari, who was visiting the area when the attack happened. Buhari has made the fight against Boko Haram a priority, but the security situation in northern Nigeria has deteriorated since his 2015 election. The government has not immediately reacted to Boko Haram\u2019s claim or confirmed its authenticity.

In an announcement on Nigerian state TV, NTA, Katsina State Gov. Aminu Bello Masari said the 344 boarding school students were turned over to security officials and were being brought to the state capital, where they will get physical examinations before being reunited with their families. \u201cI think we can say ... we have recovered most of the boys, if not all of them,\u201d Masari said. He did not disclose if the government paid any ransom. President Muhammadu Buhari welcomed their release, calling it \u201ca big relief to their families, the entire country and to the international community,\u201d according to a statement from his office. Amid an outcry in the West African nation over insecurity in the north, Buhari noted his administration\u2019s successful efforts to secure the release of previously abducted students. He added that the government \u201cis acutely aware of its responsibility to protect the life and property of the Nigerians.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of work to do, especially now that we have reopened the borders,\u201d Buhari said, acknowledging that the Northwest region \u201cpresents a problem\u201d the administration \u201cis determined to deal with.\u201d Boko Haram claimed responsibility for last Friday\u2019s abduction of the students from the all-boys Government Science Secondary School in the Katsina State village of Kankara. The jihadist group carried out the attack because it believes Western education is un-Islamic, factional leader Abubakar Shekau said in a video earlier this week. More than 800 students were in attendance at the time of the attack. Hundreds escaped, but it was believed that more than 330 were taken. For more than 10 years, Boko Haram has engaged in a bloody campaign to introduce strict Islamic rule in Nigeria\u2019s north. Thousands have been killed and more than 1 million have been displaced by the violence. The group has been mainly active in northeast Nigeria, but with the abductions from the school in Kankara, there is worry the insurgency is expanding to the northwest. The government had said it was negotiating with the school attackers, originally described as bandits. Experts say the attack was likely carried out by local gangs, who have staged increasingly deadly assaults in northwest Nigeria this year, and could possibly have been collaborating with Boko Haram. Armed bandits have killed more than 1,100 people since the beginning of the year in the region, according to Amnesty International. Parents of the missing students have been gathering daily at the school in Kankara. News of the students\u2019 release came shortly after the release of a video Thursday by Boko Haram that purportedly showed the abducted boys. In the more than six-minute video seen by Associated Press journalists, the apparent captors tell one boy to repeat their demands that the government call off its search for them by troops and aircraft. The video circulated widely on WhatsApp and first appeared on a Nigerian news site, HumAngle, that often reports on Boko Haram. Usama Aminu, a 17-year-old kidnapped student who was eventually able to escape, told the AP that his captors wore military uniforms. He said he also saw gun-toting teens, some younger than him, aiding the attackers. He said the kidnapped boys tried to help each other as bandits flogged them from behind to get them to move faster and forced them to lie down under large trees when helicopters were heard above. Aminu escaped at night. He was able to return home after being found by a resident in a mosque who gave him a change of clothes and money. Government officials said earlier this week that police, the air force and the army tracked the kidnappers to a hideout in the Zango\/Paula forest. Katsina state shut down all its boarding schools to prevent other abductions. The nearby states of Zamfara, Jigiwa and Kano also have closed schools as a precaution. Masari said the government will work with the police to increase private security at the Kankara school \u201cto make sure that we don\u2019t experience what we have experienced in the last six days.\u201d Only one policeman was working at the school when it was attacked. Friday\u2019s abduction was a chilling reminder of Boko Haram\u2019s previous attacks on schools. In February 2014, 59 boys were killed when the jihadists attacked the Federal Government College Buni Yadi in Yobe state. In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped more than 270 schoolgirls from a government boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Borno state. About 100 of those girls are still missing. In 2018, Boko Haram Islamic extremists brought back nearly all of the 110 girls they had kidnapped from a boarding school in Dapchi and warned: \u201cDon\u2019t ever put your daughters in school again.\u201d ___ Petesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.

It is not clear how many students were abducted, and how many ran away during the attack and have not yet been found. About 800 pupils were enrolled at the all-boys school and about half remain unaccounted for. The attackers are thought to be seeking ransom, an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has said. The government has blamed the attack on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area. Amnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in northern Nigeria in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice. The motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones says there is growing concern about insecurity across Nigeria. The north-west was affected by kidnappings for ransom, the north-east by an insurgency by militant Islamists, and the south by attacks on oil facilities by groups demanding a greater share of oil revenue for the region, she adds. Reuters Parents are anxiously waiting at the school for news about about their children Parents have gathered at the school in the Kankara area, pleading with the authorities to help find their children, Reuters news agency reported. Abubakar Lawal was quoted as saying that two of his three sons at the school, known as the Government Science Secondary School, were missing. More than 300 children are reportedly still missing, according to an official from the state. Osama Aminu Maale, a student who escaped the abductors and returned to his parents, told the AFP news agency that hundreds of students had been taken. \"After they took us away we stopped inside the bus where they made the older students take a headcount. We counted 520,\" the 18-year-old student said. The hostages were then split into groups before Mr Maale and four others escaped. \"One of the gunmen hit me repeatedly when I failed to keep up with the rest of the group due to my failing health before he let me trail behind, giving me the chance to escape,\" he said. 'Bandits will be crushed' On Saturday, the military said it had located the gunmen's hideout in a forest and had exchanged gunfire with them. In a BBC interview, Garba Shehu, the president's spokesman, said there was a \"massive deployment\" of troops to rescue the abducted children. \"Military commanders on the ground have the coordinates of where they believe the bandits are, and whoever they are holding. They have surrounded all of that area,\" he added. Reuters Security at the school has been strengthened following the attack President Buhari comes from the state, and is currently there on a private visit. He was being briefed hourly on efforts to rescue the children, Mr Shehu said. \"The criminal elements, bandits, will be crushed. They will be eliminated,\" he added. School authorities are speaking to parents to establish how many students have returned home and how many others could still be scattered across a large area after fleeing the attack. Gail Kankara The school is in a remote area in north-western Nigeria Residents living near the school told the BBC they heard gunfire at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and that the attack lasted for more than an hour. Security personnel at the school managed to repel some of the attackers before police reinforcements arrived, officials said. Police said that during an exchange of fire, some of the gunmen were forced to retreat. Students were able to scale the fence of the school and run to safety, they said. Who are the bandits? Nduka Orjinmo, BBC News, Lagos In Nigeria's north-west, \"bandits\" is a catch-all phrase covering Fulani herdsmen, armed vigilante groups and even Islamist insurgents fleeing the insurgency in the north-east. Some of the leaders of these bandit groups, who engage in kidnapping and attacking farming communities, have openly met governors and other state authorities during failed negotiations for truce. But this is the first time bandits have abducted hundreds of students from a school - a tactic that has been used in the past by groups like Boko Haram and Iswap, raising fears that these criminal groups in Nigeria's north-west are copying the Islamist militants. Most of the kidnappings by \"bandits\" are done for ransom so many are hoping that this will be resolved soon - if security operatives fail to rescue the students, with money changing hands, unlike the case of the Chibok girls where some are still being held in captivity. Many Nigerians have criticised President Muhammadu Buhari, who was in his home town of Daura less than 200km (125 miles) away, for not going to the scene of the incident. That the bandits could dare to stage, and successfully carry out, such an operation with the president and his vast security paraphernalia in the area has shocked many. Several local residents joined the police in searching for the students, while many parents said they had withdrawn their children from the school. \"The school is deserted, all the students have vacated,\" one witness, Nura Abdullahi, told AFP news agency. The governor of Katsina, Aminu Bello Massari, ordered the immediate closure of all boarding schools in the state.

More than 600 people have died in the worst flooding the West African nation has seen in a decade. Some 1.3 million people have been displaced, and more than 200,000 homes have been destroyed. Flooding is expected to continue until the end of November. Nigeria is used to seasonal flooding, but this year has been significantly worse than usual. The government has said unusually heavy rains and climate change are to blame. The emergency release of excess water from dams both in Nigeria and in neighbouring Cameroon was another key factor causing devastating flooding. Experts also say poor planning and infrastructure have exacerbated the damage. Canoes and caring neighbours brave Nigeria floods Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent All the latest Nigeria news from the BBC Since the flooding began in early summer, large swathes of farmland have been destroyed. There are concerns about increased spread of disease, and food and fuel supplies have also been disrupted. In a press conference on Sunday, Nigeria's minister for humanitarian affairs and disaster management, Sadiya Umar Farouk, called on local authorities to evacuate people living in the most high-risk areas. Authorities are already providing food and other support to those affected, she said. She added that despite ''concerted efforts'' and early warnings, many state governments \"did not prepare\" for the flooding. The disaster has affected 27 of Nigeria's 36 states. Part of the problem is that people return to their homes on flood plains each year after the water levels subside. Many do not have the means to relocate. Nigeria's economy has been battered in the past year, with inflation at an all-time high and many communities struggling to cope. The World Food Programme and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation said last month that Nigeria was among six countries facing a high risk of catastrophic levels of hunger. Nigeria's meteorological agency has warned that the flooding could continue until the end of November in some states in the south of the country, including Anambra, Delta, Rivers, Cross River and Bayelsa.

People queue at an ATM in Abuja, Nigeria [File: Afolabi Sotunde\/Reuters] Published On 7 Dec 2022 7 Dec 2022 Nigeria\u2019s central bank has imposed restrictions on weekly cash withdrawals to limit the use of cash in an apparent bid to curb counterfeiting and discourage ransom payments to kidnappers. Under a new policy announced late on Tuesday, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said that weekly cash withdrawals for individuals had been slashed to 100,000 Nigerian naira ($225) from 2.5 million naira ($5,638). A majority of Nigerians have no bank accounts and use informal markets where cash is preferred. This move aims to bring more people into the banking system, and will take effect on January 9, the CBN said. \u201cThe maximum cash withdrawal per week via automated teller machine shall be 100,000 naira subject to a maximum of 20,000 naira ($45) cash withdrawal per day,\u201d it said. Only denominations of 200 naira and less will be loaded into ATMs, it said. For businesses, the weekly limit has been cut to 500,000 naira ($1,128) from the current daily limit of three million naira ($6,766). \u201cWithdrawals above these limits shall attract processing fees of five percent and 10 percent, respectively,\u201d the CBN said. Advertisement But in compelling circumstances individuals and businesses could withdraw a maximum of five million naira ($11,277) and 10 million naira ($22,553) respectively once a month, it added. The central bank warned commercial lenders against violating the new cash limits, which it said were in line with its policy to promote cashless transactions. The bank has expressed concerns in the past over currency counterfeiting, the volume of money outside the banking system and huge ransom payments to kidnappers and bandits. Last month, Nigeria launched newly designed currency notes, another move the central bank said would help curb inflation and money laundering. More than 80 percent of the 3.2 trillion naira ($7.2bn) in circulation in Nigeria are outside the vaults of commercial banks and in private hands, CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele said when he unveiled the new notes. \u201cThe currency redesign will also assist in the fight against corruption as the exercise will rein in the higher denomination used for corruption and the movement of such funds from the banking system could be tracked easily,\u201d he explained at the time.

Eyewitnesses said that a speeding driver lost control of the car. Pictures shared online in the immediate aftermath of the incident show bodies strewn across the street. The month-long annual carnival, which features several events, has become a big draw since it was launched in 2004.

Tuesday's incident took place during the popular bikers' parade on one of the major carnival routes which had been closed to vehicle traffic. The event features riders including celebrities from across the country, some adorned in colourful costumes, performing stunts. The police said a drunk driver - who has been arrested - had lost control of their car and ploughed into the crowd. A father of a 15-year-old boy who was injured in the incident told the BBC that the car was being driven \"recklessly\". \"The driver had been swerving from left to right and then when he got to where the crowd stood, he started spraying money on the road.

By Helene Caux 9 January 2015 Also available in: Fran\u00e7ais Nigerian refugees wait to be registered by UNHCR in Ngouboua, western Chad. \u00a9 Chadian Red Cross\/H.Abdoulaye DAKAR, Senegal, January 9 (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency on Friday reported that some 7,300 Nigerian refugees have arrived in western Chad in the past 10 days, fleeing attacks by insurgents on Baga town and surrounding villages in north-east Nigeria. A spokesperson said UNHCR teams in Chad were at the border and seeking more information on the new arrivals and their needs. The attack this week on Baga left hundreds of people dead, according to media reports, and forced most of its surviving inhabitants to flee. The newly arrived refugees in Chad are staying with local communities in villages around 450 kilometres north-west of the capital, N'Djamena. The Chadian government has requested the assistance of aid agencies to help the refugees - distribution of relief items has started. UNHCR is assessing the protection situation and coordinating aid delivery. \"We're already providing plastic sheets, jerry cans, mats, blankets and kitchen tools. Other humanitarian organizations are distributing aid too,\" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards noted in Geneva. Chadian authorities visited the area on Thursday and asked UNHCR to help with the relocation of more than 1,000 refugees who are stranded on the island of Kangala on Lake Chad. The group arrived there recently after fleeing the general insecurity in north-east Nigeria. Chad is now hosting more than 10,000 refugees from Nigeria. Meanwhile in Niger, UNHCR has started to relocate refugees from the border area of Gagamari to Sayam Forage camp, deeper inside Niger's Diffa region. A total 336 refugees have been moved in three convoys since December 30. More convoys are planned in the next days. The refugees are among the thousands of people who fled to the Gagamari area in the past weeks following November's attack on the Nigerian town of Damassak. A second camp is scheduled to open in the next days in Kablewa, in the Lake Chad area of Niger, where thousands of people have found refuge in the past months. On arrival in Sayam Forage camp, refugees are being registered by UNHCR and the National Eligibility Commission of Niger. They receive identity documents and basic relief items. Drinking water is being delivered by trucks and emergency latrines have been built. Not all refugees are choosing to be relocated away from the border. Despite the proximity of the conflict in Nigeria, many are hoping to return to their home villages when the situation calms down. In December, the first results of a continuing government census, organized with UNHCR technical support, revealed that at least 90,000 people, including Niger nationals previously living in Nigeria, have found refuge in Niger's Diffa region since May 2013. In all, the conflict in north-east Nigeria has led to the exodus of 135,000 people - around 35,000 Nigerians to Cameroon and 10,000 to Chad - and the displacement of at least 850,000 people within Nigeria's Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.

The Boko Haram group attacked Baga town on Wednesday, after over-running a military base there on Saturday, they said. Almost the entire town had been torched and the militants were now raiding nearby areas, they added. Boko Haram launched a military campaign in 2009 to create an Islamic state. It has taken control of many towns and villages in north-eastern Nigeria in the last year. The conflict has displaced at least 1.5 million people, while more than 2,000 were killed last year. 'Rotting corpses' Nigerian lawmaker Maina Maaji Lawan said Boko Haram controlled 70% of Borno state, which is worst-affected by the insurgency. Musa Alhaji Bukar, a senior government official in the area, said that fleeing residents told him that Baga, which had a population of about 10,000, was now \"virtually non-existent\". \"It has been burnt down,\" he told the BBC Hausa service. Image source, AFP Image caption, Government troops were overpowered during Saturday's raid on Baga Image source, AP Image caption, The group has torched many towns and villages in northern Nigeria Those who fled reported that they had been unable to bury the dead, and corpses littered the town's streets, he said. Boko Haram was now in control of Baga and 16 neighbouring towns after the military retreated, Mr Bukar said. While he raised fears that some 2,000 had been killed in the raids, other reports put the number in the hundreds. Mr Lawan, the senator for northern Borno, called on government troops to stop \"dilly-dallying\" and to fight back to protect residents. \"The indiscriminate killings went on and on and on,\" he told BBC Focus on Africa. Boko Haram's offensive continued on Thursday, with its fighters setting up checkpoints and killing people who were hiding in the bush, the senator said. Fleeing residents spoke of the stench of rotting corpses on the streets and surrounding bushes, he said. Boko Haram at a glance Image source, AFP Founded in 2002 Initially focused on opposing Western education - Boko Haram means \"Western education is forbidden\" in the Hausa language Launched military operations in 2009 to create Islamic state Thousands killed, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria - also attacked police and UN headquarters in capital, Abuja Some three million people affected Declared terrorist group by US in 2013 Who are Boko Haram? Profile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau Why Nigeria has not defeated Boko Haram Some 10,0000 people had fled to Chad since Saturday to escape the violence, raising fears of a humanitarian crisis, Mr Lawan said. A large number reportedly drowned as they crossed Lake Chad. Others are fleeing to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno, in buses provided by the government, the senator said. BBC Nigeria correspondent Will Ross says the crisis in north-eastern Nigeria is clearly deepening. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Jonathan is under pressure over the insurgency While President Goodluck Jonathan, who is seeking re-election next month, has condemned the attack on a French satirical magazine in Paris as dastardly, he has not commented on the violence at home, our reporter says. Government troops abandoned the military base in Baga on Saturday. It hosts the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF), made up of troops from Nigeria, Chad and Niger, although only Nigerian soldiers were there at the time of the attack. Set up in 1998 to fight trans-border crime in the Lake Chad region, the force more recently promised to take on Boko Haram. Mr Jonathan declared a state of emergency in Borno and two neighbouring states in 2013, vowing to defeat the militants. However, Boko Haram has stepped up attacks since then and there are fears that many people in the north-east will not be able to vote in the general election because of the conflict.

Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group, had been waging an insurgency in the region since 2009, seeking to establish an Islamic state.\n\nIn early January 2015, Boko Haram launched a major attack on Baga, capturing the town and the military base.

Police say more than 30 others were wounded in the city of Damaturu, capital of Yobe State. No group has said it carried out the bombing but the jihadist group Boko Haram has previously launched attacks in the city. On Saturday, Boko Haram fighters tried to take over the regional capital of neighbouring Gombe state. They were repelled by Nigerian troops backed by a fighter jet. Marcos Danladi, police commissioner of Yobe State, said Sunday's attack took place at the Damaturu Central Motor Park. According to reports, the female suicide bomber arrived in a vehicle and walked into a crowd outside a grocery store at the end of the terminal where she detonated her explosives. Witness Adamu Muhammad said the bus station \"descended into panic\". A shop owner told AFP news agency that an angry mob stopped emergency workers from retrieving the remains of the bomber and instead set them on fire. Thousands of people have been killed and more than three million displaced by Boko Haram's insurgency. The Islamist militants, who are fighting to create an Islamic state in north-eastern Nigeria, have become a regional threat. In response, Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon have agreed to form a regional military force to combat the group.

It has not commented on the blast. Explosions have also ripped through court buildings in three towns in oil-rich southern Nigeria in what police described as co-ordinated attacks. Dynamite was suspected to have been used in the attacks in Port Harcourt city and the towns of Isiokpo and Degema in oil-rich Rivers State, regional police spokesman Ahmad Muhammed said. There were no casualties, but the court building in Degema was \"razed down and documents burnt\", he is quoted by Nigeria's privately owned Daily Trust newspaper as saying , external . Boko Haram is not known to be active in the oil-producing region, where militants demanding a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth have carried out attacks in the past.

Mr Jonathan addressed a rally in the north-eastern city a day after it was hit by two blasts that killed at least five people. A local journalist told AFP the latest blast had led to unrest in Gombe, with angry youths attacking supporters of Mr Jonathan's People's Democratic Party (PDP). \"They were shouting and denouncing the president's visit which they blamed for the attack,\" he added. A report in the Nigerian paper The Vanguard says the president and Mr Buhari have cancelled scheduled election rallies in Damaturu in Yobe state and Maiduguri in Borno state respectively. Analysis by Will Ross, BBC News, Nigeria It may not have been as large as other bombings in Nigeria but the timing of the latest attack will have shocked the security forces.  The violence is escalating in the run-up to elections due in less than two weeks. The attacks are blamed on Boko Haram which is against democracy and says it wants to set up a caliphate. As well as the bombings the military is facing a huge challenge as the Boko Haram fighters try to capture more territory in the north-east. On Sunday, the military and local vigilantes prevented the jihadists from penetrating Maiduguri city in Borno state for the second time in a week. Military aircraft from Chad have meanwhile continued their attacks on Boko Haram positions in north-east Nigeria for a third day. Eyewitnesses said Chadian jets and helicopters hit targets in the town of Gamboru, just across the border from Cameroon. Chad sent forces into northern Cameroon in January, driving Boko Haram out of the area but stopping short of advancing on the militants' strongholds deeper inside Nigeria. Chadian forces are reported to have been massing in the Cameroonian border town of Fotokol since Sunday. The election is expected to be the most tightly contested since military rule ended in 1999 but there are growing fears that voters in areas controlled by Boko Haram will not be able to vote. Last week, the African Union (AU) backed plans for the deployment of a 7,500-strong regional force to fight Boko Haram. Mr Jonathan declared a state of emergency in Nigeria's north-eastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in May 2013, but it has not stopped the Boko Haram offensive.

The campaign is said to be targeting militants in Borno state. It came as Nigerian officials dismissed Boko Haram's pledge of allegiance to Islamic State as a reaction to military pressure from Nigeria and its allies. The pledge was posted online on Saturday in an audio message by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau. He called on Muslims everywhere to swear loyalty to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Boko Haram has been fighting an insurgency to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria since 2009, and in recent months the violence has increasingly spilled over into neighbouring states. 'Drowning man' Chad, Cameroon and Niger have already been helping Nigeria in its battle against Boko Haram. On Friday, the African Union endorsed the creation of a regional force of more than 8,000 troops to combat the group. However, the force's remit will be limited to securing the Nigerian side of Lake Chad, rather than pushing further into Nigeria. As the latest offensive began early on Sunday, a resident and an aid worker told AFP news agency there had been heavy arms fire close to Niger's border with Nigeria. A local radio station said that a convoy of more than 200 vehicles was moving towards the area, and that air strikes had been carried out on Saturday and early on Sunday. The Nigerian military and troops from neighbouring states have recently claimed some success in their campaign against Boko Haram, and Nigerian officials said the pledge of allegiance to IS was a sign of weakness Army spokesman Col Sami Usman Kukasheka said the Boko Haram leader was like a \"drowning man\".

Can regional force beat Islamists? IS shaping Boko Haram media A spokesman for the Nigerian government, Mike Omeri, said Boko Haram needed help \"as a result of the heavy casualties and bombardment and degrading of their capacity\". However, militants have continued to launch deadly attacks. On Saturday Boko Haram was blamed for a series of attacks in its former stronghold of Maiduguri, including suicide bombings, that left more than 50 people dead. Nigeria postponed national elections by six weeks until 28 March in order to have more time to try to improve security in the north. Col Kukasheka called on Nigerians \"to be more security conscious because given the onslaught on Boko Haram definitely they are bound to spring surprises\".

( Reuters: Emmanuel Braun ) abc.net.au\/news\/nigerian-army-officers-face-court-martial-over-alleged-sabotage\/6029874 Link copied Share Share article A man purporting to be Islamist  Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has claimed responsibility for an attack on the northeastern town of Baga in which scores of civilians were killed when the insurgents seized a multinational military base. The insurgents, who invaded Baga at the start of the year, razed many buildings and homes in the week that followed, shooting civilians as they tried to flee, witnesses said. Some local officials put the death toll as high as 2,000, although the military said it was 150. The video was in the trademark Boko Haram style, with the bearded man claiming to be Shekau in combat fatigues talking in the northern Nigerian Hausa language surrounded by masked gunmen. The military said it killed the real Shekau. \"We are the ones that carried out the attack and it is just the tip of the iceberg,\" the man said. \"There are more coming.\" Commenting on weapons seized from Baga, he said they were \"enough to annihilate Nigeria.\" Soldiers fled the area after the nearby army base, which is the headquarters of a multinational force comprising troops from Chad, Niger and Cameroon, by Lake Chad was overrun. Chad and Cameroon are being drawn into the fight against Boko Haram, but mistrust has hampered cooperation. The man claiming to be Shekau taunted the leaders of Cameroon, Niger and Chad: Paul Biya, Mahamadou Issoufou and Idris Deby. He also made it clear he did not care for either Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, a southern Christian, or his main opposition contender in February 14 presidential elections, Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim. \"Jonathan you are in trouble,\" he said. \"And Buhari, do you think he is a true Muslim? He's an infidel.\" Nigerian army officers face court martial over alleged sabotage Meanwhile, Nigeria has ordered a brigadier general and 21 other army officers to face a court martial over alleged sabotage in the war against Islamist militant group Boko Haram, two military sources said. The charges were not specified but sources confirmed it was the first time senior army officers had been put on trial for offences relating to Boko Haram. The case opened on Monday at the Ikeja Military Cantonment in Lagos and was expected to last over a week. Elements of the Nigerian military had long been suspected of colluding with Boko Haram, which killed an estimated 10,000 people last year in its battle to revive a medieval caliphate in Nigeria, Africa's biggest energy producer. Meanwhile, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Fatou Bensouda, said she was investigating alleged mass killings by Boko Haram, and promised to charge those responsible for any atrocities. Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said last May the Sunni jihadist group had \"infiltrated... the armed forces and police\". Besides the brigadier general, 14 colonels, a major, a second lieutenant and five captains were arraigned. \"The officers are being prosecuted for offences they committed during the ongoing war against Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast of the country,\" a military source said. In December last year, 54 soldiers were sentenced to death following a secret trial for conspiracy to commit mutiny. The army said the soldiers disobeyed a direct order while facing insurgents in the northeast. Twelve soldiers were also sentenced to death for mutiny in September last year after the military said they attempted to kill their commanding officer. Morale was extremely low among foot soldiers in Nigeria's northeast, where poorly equipped and underpaid troops faced a determined foe currently controlling an area the size of Belgium. After a blood-soaked 2014, killings had continued apace this year, with a string of suicide attacks, including some carried out by young children.

Meanwhile, Cameroon says its army has killed more than 80 Boko Haram soldiers and arrested 1,000 of their supporters. Niger also claimed on Monday to have arrested 160 people with links to Boko Haram since 6 February. Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger recently formed a military coalition against the Islamist militants. Representatives from the four countries are currently in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde with other African leaders to discuss how best to tackle Boko Haram. In recent months, Boko Haram had seized control of much of Nigeria's north-east, amid widespread criticism of the Nigerian army. But backed by its neighbours, especially Chad, some territory has been recaptured in recent weeks. However, the coalition has had setbacks too. A spokesperson for Cameroon's defence ministry said five soldiers were killed in the recent clashes with Boko Haram. US support Meanwhile, an official from the US Africa Command told the BBC that they would provide Nigeria with training and equipment to combat Boko Haram. Lt-Gen Steven Hummer said Africa Command was \"ready to assist in whatever way [Nigeria] see as being practical\". However, he did not clarify how much support Nigeria could expect to receive. The US has previously voiced concerns over helping the country because of its human rights record. A senior US official told the BBC that there were also worries over the lack of political will to defeat Boko Haram. Assaults by Boko Haram have intensified recently, prompting the Nigerian government to delay elections scheduled for 14 February by six weeks.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Kano: With anger swelling over corruption, inequality and a devastating Islamist insurgency in the nation's north, Nigerians by a wide margin chose an austere former general who once ruled with an iron hand to be their next president. The election was the most competitive presidential race ever in Nigeria, one of the largest democracies in the world. Now, if power is handed over peacefully, it will be a major shift for the nation; the first transfer between civilians of different parties in a country that has spent much of its post-colonial history shaken by military coups. With results from all of Nigeria's 36 states counted, the former military ruler, Muhammadu Buhari, delivered a crushing defeat to President Goodluck Jonathan, getting nearly 55 per cent of the vote to Mr Jonathan's 45 per cent. Since the end of military rule in 1999, Nigeria has been governed by a single, dominant party: Mr Jonathan's Peoples Democratic Party. Muhammadu Buhari's supporters celebrate in Kano, Nigeria, on Tuesday. Credit: AP However, on Tuesday, Mr Buhari's campaign said the President had called the challenger to acknowledge defeat; an act many Nigerians considered a big step forward after previous elections marred by fraud and incumbents clinging to office. Analysts said that the election could mean the beginning of a competitive two-party system in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and most populous nation with about 180 million people. \"[It is] a giant leap for democracy in Nigeria and Africa, particularly at a time when many incumbents are trying to change their constitution to extend their legal term in office,\" said Pierre Englebert, an African politics specialist. On Tuesday evening, jubilant crowds lined overpasses, bridges and streets in Kano, the major city in Mr Buhari's stronghold in the north.

The passengers were being conveyed from Niger state's Borgu district to a market in the neighbouring Kebbi state on Monday afternoon when the boat overturned in the Niger River, according to Niger State Emergency Management Agency spokesman Ibrahim Audu. \"The boat was overloaded so the strong wind affected them,\" Audu said. He said the boat's capacity is 100 passengers but it was estimated to be carrying a much higher number, in addition to bags of grain, making it difficult to control when it began to sink. Villagers were helping local divers and emergency officials to search for the missing passengers, many of whom were women, Audu said. He could not say how many people had survived. Boat disasters have become rampant in remote communities across Nigeria, where locals desperate to get their farm products to market end up overcrowded in locally made boats in the absence of good and accessible roads. There is no record of the total death toll in these accidents, though there have been at least five involving at least 100 passengers each in the past seven months.

Kaduna state governor Uba Sani said they had been rescued thanks to the courage of the security forces. The school authorities had said more than 280 children were taken, but the army said 137 hostages had been freed. It said the operation took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, days before a ransom deadline. Officials have not yet commented on the discrepancy in numbers. In previous cases, hostages have been able to flee from their captors as they trek for days to forest hideouts. A top government official, who asked not to be named, has told BBC Hausa that one of the teachers taken from Kuriga died in captivity. The group was held for 17 days in total. Kidnap gangs, known as bandits, have seized thousands of people in recent years, especially in the north-west. Six mass abductions this month have rocked parts of northern Nigeria, despite an overall fall in the number of such attacks over the past year. Those kidnapped are usually freed after a ransom is paid. Schoolboy recounts daring escape from Nigerian kidnap gang Inside story of a Nigerian ransom negotiator Why mass abductions have returned to haunt Nigeria The kidnappers had demanded $690,000 (\u00a3548,000) for the release of the Kuriga children aged between eight and 15. The government had said it would not pay any ransom. \"This is indeed a day of joy,\" Governor Sani said in a statement in which he praised Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu for ensuring that the abducted schoolchildren had been \"released unharmed\". The president, who welcomed the news in a tweet , said it showed the importance of the government and state authorities collaborating \"especially on matters of security\". Military spokesman Maj Gen Edward Buba said 76 girls and 61 boys had been rescued from Zamfara state, which borders Kaduna to the north-west. The military has also released photos of some of the children, showing them sitting in buses looking dusty and exhausted. Nigerian army The kidnappers had demanded $690,000 for the release of the Kuriga children, pictured here on Sunday morning A security source told Reuters news agency the students had been freed in a forest and were being taken to Kaduna for medical tests before being allowed to see their families. The mass abduction occurred on the morning of 7 March during assembly in a compound housing a junior and senior school. According to witnesses, the pupils were in the assembly ground around 08:30 (07:30 GMT) when dozens of gunmen on motorcycles rode in, eventually taking away 187 students from a secondary school and 125 from the local primary school. It is not clear how many teachers were abducted. Twenty-five students later returned. One pupil, believed to be 14-years-old, died after being shot by the gunmen. Most of the kidnaps in north-west Nigeria are believed to be the work of criminal gangs trying to make money from ransoms. In an attempt to curb Nigeria's spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry, a controversial law that made it a crime to make ransom payments was passed in 2022. It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years, however no-one has ever been arrested. Earlier this year, the family of a group of sisters kidnapped in the capital, Abuja, denied a police statement that the security forces had rescued the girls, saying that they had no choice but to pay the ransom . There was global outrage when Islamist militants from the Boko Haram group seized nearly 300 girls in Nigeria's north-eastern town of Chibok in 2014. Most of the victims have either been freed or escaped since then, but dozens remain unaccounted for. On Saturday, the army said it had rescued 17 students and a woman kidnapped just days after the Kuriga attack from a school in Sokoto, also in the north-west.

Residents in the southwestern state of Oyo\u2019s densely populated Ibadan city heard a loud blast at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, causing panic as many fled their homes. By Wednesday morning, security forces cordoned off the area while medical personnel and ambulances were on standby as rescue efforts intensified. Preliminary investigations showed the blast was caused by explosives stored for use in illegal mining operations, Oyo Gov. Seyi Makinde told reporters after visiting the site in the Bodija area of Ibadan. \u201cWe have already deployed first responders and all relevant agencies within Oyo state to carry out comprehensive search and rescue operations,\u201d Makinde said, describing the damage as \u201cdevastating.\u201d Rescue workers combing through the collapsed structures recovered an additional body on Wednesday morning, increasing the death toll to three, Saheed Akiode, coordinator of Nigeria\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency in the region, told The Associated Press.

The statement was accompanied by a picture of Simon and her children, who appear to be aged between 2 and 4. She is yet to be reunited with her family. Simon was among 276 girls seized from their school in Nigeria's Chibok village in April 2014 at the height of the extremist violence in the region. About 82 of them are still in captivity.

An hours-long downpour late Wednesday destroyed the perimeter fence of the medium-security prison in the town of Suleja, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Abuja, resulting in the escape of 119 inmates, prisons spokesman Adamu Duza said. The prison service and other agencies recaptured 10 of the escaped inmates and were searching for the rest, Duza said. The one-story Suleja prison, with cracked and defaced walls, had 499 inmates, about twice its capacity of 250, according to Nigeria\u2019s Interior Minister Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, who led a government delegation to the facility after the breakout. \u201cThis shows that we need to relocate a lot of our correctional centers ... to create better space, better security and better infrastructure,\u201d the minister said.

{"year":"2024","month":"01","event_desc":"8 January  A two-year BBC investigation accuses the Synagogue Church of All Nations founder T. B. Joshua of rape and torture.","text":"TB Joshua: Megachurch leader raped and tortured worshippers, BBC finds 8 January 2024 Share Save Charlie Northcott and Helen Spooner BBC News, Africa Eye Share Save Getty Images TB Joshua founded the hugely popular Synagogue Church of all Nations Evidence of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches has been uncovered by the BBC. Dozens of ex-Synagogue Church of all Nations members - five British - allege atrocities, including rape and forced abortions, by Nigeria's late TB Joshua. The allegations of abuse in a secretive Lagos compound span almost 20 years. The Synagogue Church of All Nations did not respond to the allegations but said previous claims have been unfounded. TB Joshua, who died in 2021, was a charismatic and hugely successful preacher and televangelist who had an immense global following. The BBC's findings over a two-year investigation include: Dozens of eyewitness accounts of physical violence or torture carried out by Joshua, including instances of child abuse and people being whipped and chained Numerous women who say they were sexually assaulted by Joshua, with a number claiming they were repeatedly raped for years inside the compound Multiple allegations of forced abortions inside the church following the alleged rapes by Joshua, including one woman who says she had five terminations Multiple first-hand accounts detailing how Joshua faked his \"miracle healings\", which were broadcast to millions of people around the world One of the victims, a British woman, called Rae, was 21 years old when she abandoned her degree at Brighton University in 2002 and was recruited into the church. She spent the next 12 years as one of Joshua's so-called \"disciples\" inside his maze-like concrete compound in Lagos. Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside UK) World of Secrets - The Disciples A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse Listen now on BBC Sounds. If you are outside of the UK, listen to World of Secrets wherever you get your podcasts. \"We all thought we were in heaven, but we were in hell, and in hell terrible things happen,\" she told the BBC. Rae says she was sexually assaulted by Joshua and subjected to a form of solitary confinement for two years. The abuse was so severe, she says she attempted suicide multiple times inside the compound. The Synagogue Church of All Nations [Scoan] has a global following, operating a Christian TV channel called Emmanuel TV and social media networks with millions of viewers. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, tens of thousands of pilgrims from Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Africa travelled to the church in Nigeria to witness Joshua performing \"healing miracles\". At least 150 visitors lived with him as disciples inside his compound in Lagos, sometimes for decades. Rae spent 12 years in Joshua's compound More than 25 former \"disciples\" spoke to the BBC - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - giving powerful corroborating testimony about their experiences within the church, with the most recent experiences in 2019. Many victims were in their teens when they first joined. In some of the British cases, their transport to Lagos was paid for by Joshua, in co-ordination with other UK churches. Rae and multiple other interviewees compared their experiences to being in a cult. Jessica Kaimu, from Namibia, says her ordeal lasted more than five years. She says she was 17 when Joshua first raped her, and that subsequent instances of rape by TB Joshua led to her having five forced abortions while there. \"These were backdoor type\u2026 medical treatments that we were going through\u2026 it could have killed us,\" she told the BBC. Other interviewees say they were stripped and beaten with electrical cables and horse whips, and routinely denied sleep. On his death in June 2021, TB Joshua was hailed as one of the most influential pastors in African history. Rising from poverty, he built an evangelical empire that counted dozens of political leaders, celebrities and international footballers among his associates. He did, however, attract some controversy during his lifetime when a guesthouse for church pilgrims collapsed in 2014, killing at least 116 people. More on TB Joshua and allegations Long read: 'Terrible things happened' - inside TB Joshua's church of horrors Profile: Nigeria's disgraced televangelist The BBC's investigation, which was carried out with international media platform openDemocracy, is the first time multiple former church insiders have come forward to speak on the record. They say they've spent years trying to raise the alarm, but have effectively been silenced. A number of our witnesses in Nigeria claim they were physically attacked, and in one case shot at, after previously speaking out against the abuse and posting videos containing allegations on YouTube. A BBC crew that attempted to record footage of the church's Lagos compound from a public street in March 2022 was also fired at by the church's security, and was detained for a number of hours. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. \"Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence\u2026 None of the allegations was ever substantiated,\" it wrote. Four of the British citizens who spoke to the BBC say they reported the abuse to the UK authorities after escaping the church. They say no further action was taken. Anneka says she believes there are many victims yet to speak out In addition, a British man and his wife emailed eyewitness accounts of their ordeal and video evidence - including recordings of being held at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police who are also members of Scoan - to the British High Commission in Nigeria in March 2010 after fleeing the church. In his email, the man said his wife had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped by Joshua. He warned the commission that other British nationals were still inside the compound facing atrocities. He also says no action was taken. The UK Foreign Office did not respond to these claims, but told the BBC that it takes all reports of crime, including sexual assault and violence against British nationals overseas, very seriously. Scoan continues to thrive today, under the leadership of Joshua's widow, Evelyn. In July 2023, she led a tour of Spain. Anneka, who left Derby in the UK to join Scoan at the age of 17, told the BBC she believes there are many other victims who have yet to speak out. She hopes further steps will be taken to uncover Joshua's actions. \"I believe the Synagogue Church of All Nations needs a thorough investigation into why this man was able to function for so long the way he did,\" she said.

The newly re-adopted anthem, which begins \"Nigeria, We Hail Thee,\" was written by Lillian Jean Williams in 1959 and composed by Frances Berda. Speaking on his first anniversary in office, President Tinubu said the anthem symbolised Nigeria's diversity. But many have questioned his priorities amid the cost-of-living crisis. Reacting online, some Nigerians said the country had more pressing problems such as insecurity, rising inflation and a foreign exchange crisis.

Onanuga said the president had announced the decision at a meeting with union leaders in Abuja. Since coming to office a year ago, Tinubu has ended a costly fuel subsidy and complex currency controls, leading to a tripling of petrol prices and a spike in living costs as the naira has slid against the dollar. Africa's most populous nation has seen a series of labour strikes in recent months as unions pushed for an increase in the wage. During the protests union workers shut down the national grid, stalled domestic flights and closed federal offices, ports, petrol stations and courts. At the time of the nationwide strike last month, unions had been demanding a minimum monthly wage of 494,000 naira. Record inflation Joe Ajaero, the leader of Nigeria's main labour union the NLC, told journalists on Thursday he had mixed feelings because of the economy. \"We have to move ahead despite the situation, and the negotiation can't linger... coming from 62,000 naira to 70,000,\" he added, welcoming the chance to review the wage. Workers in the capital Abuja told AFP the increase was not enough. \"It's unrealistic -- they should look at the cost of things,\" said Charles, a 53-year-old government administration worker. \"I'm worried I won't be able to feed my family,\" he said. \"One bag of rice won't last more than four weeks and it costs me 86,000 naira. It's horrible.\" Tinubu has repeatedly called for patience to allow the reforms to take effect, saying they will help attract foreign investment and better the economy. But the measures have hit Nigerians hard and the country is battling its worst cost of living crisis in a generation. Inflation hit record levels at 34.19 percent in June, with food inflation more than 40.87 percent, according to the national bureau of statistics. Many poor Nigerians have had to skip meals and give up products such as meat, eggs and milk, while in the north the economic crisis has forced people to eat poor-grade rice usually used as fish food. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

Dozens of villagers gathered near the school, some weeping and others offering to help, as excavators combed through the debris from the part of the building that had caved in. One woman was seen wailing and attempting to go closer to the rubble as others held her back.

Despite fielding continental champions like 100m hurdles record holder Tobi Amusan, Africa's most populous nation did not live up to Olympic expectations. A day after the Olympics closed, former and current Olympians lashed out at the country's sporting federations calling for a shakeup in organisations they say failed their athletes. \"I must apologise to our compatriots and reflect on what went wrong,\" Sports Minister John Owan Enoh said on social media after Paris. He said when he assumed the ministry less than a year before the Games, he learned that Nigeria's Olympics preparations had not even started. \"As a country, we deserve more,\" he said. \"Let's turn the disastrous outcome of the 2024 Olympics to a huge positive for Nigerian sports.\" Nigeria's best haul in the Olympics was in Atlanta in 1996 when the team won two golds, one silver and three bronzes. Beijing brought five medals in 2008, but there were zero in London four years later. Atlanta Olympics gold medal winner in the long jump, Chioma Ajunwa, said Nigeria's sporting federations needed a shakeup to bring in sports people who knew what they were doing. \"They should stop recycling the old administrative officers that never know what they are doing,\" she told Arise News channel. \"It is quite disheartening that every year, Nigeria will be telling this kind of story.\" Repeated mistakes Olympic sprinter Favour Ofili accused officials at the Athletics Federation of Nigeria of leaving her out of the Paris 100 metres race due to administrative failures even after she qualified. Similar accusations dogged Nigeria during the Tokyo Olympics when a group of Nigerian athletes were unable to compete because they said sporting federations did not release funds to carry out the right pre-Games tests. \"I have worked for four years to earn this opportunity. For what?\" Ofili wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"This is not the first time you guys are doing this so don't think this is over because it's not.\" Officials from the athletics federation did not respond to calls. But a senior source from Nigeria's sporting administration told AFP officials withdrew Ofili to let her focus on the 200 metre race. \"The decision to withdraw her from 100m was by AFN, but apparently this was not communicated to the athlete,\" the source said. Sports Minister Enoh said he was questioning officials about why Ofili was left out of the 100 metres race. Ofili came sixth in the 200 metres final in her Olympic debut in Paris. Hurdler Tobi Amusan came third in her heat and did not qualify for the final. Hameed Adio, former 100 metres sprinter and Olympic team captain, said the country needed more preparation and better organisation. \"Until we consider sports as big business and treat it as such and not just a pastime and also see that those running our sports are technically sound, experienced and patriotic, the results will remain as we had at Paris 2024,\" he said. \"We have to do away with the 'fire brigade' approach to our preparations to the Olympics.\" One bright spot for Nigeria was women's basketball under the guidance of Rena Wakama who was recognised as Best Female Basketball Coach at the Games for the team's \"incredible run\", according to the International Basketball Federation.

Kashim Shetim visited the hospital treating the wounded in Borno State capital Maiduguri on Monday and said there were 42 people injured, according to AFP. The horror of Saturday's brutal co-ordinated attacks that targeted a wedding, the victims' subsequent funeral and a hospital in the town of Gwoza, close to the border of Cameroon, has left the community reeling. President Bola Tinubu condemned the attacks calling them \"desperate acts of terror\". He vowed stern action against those responsible for the killings in the town of Gwoza and insisted that the incident had not undermined recent gains made against jihadists. \"The president declares that the purveyors of wanton violence shall have a certain encounter with justice, and that these cowardly attacks are only but an isolated episode as his government will not allow the nation to slither into an era of fear, tears, sorrow, and blood,\"  a statement issued by his spokesperson on Facebook said. No-one has admitted carrying out the attacks, but the Nigeria-centred Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) insurgents have previously claimed deadly bombings in Borno. The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures to skull and limb fractures. A curfew has been imposed by the military. AFP Victims of the wave of blasts in Gwoza are being treated for injuries at a hospital in Maiduguri Amnesty International Nigeria called for an end to assaults on civilians in Borno. \"These deplorable attacks that took place at a time people were mourning demonstrate complete disregard for human life,\" it said. The US Mission in Nigeria also described the attack as \"horrific\". \u201cThese reprehensible acts of violence show a cruel and heartless disregard for human life\u2026these abhorrent attacks are a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by terrorism in the region.\" In the last four months, attackers have twice targeted people through suicide and improvised explosive devices in Borno state. Borno state has been at the centre of a 15-year insurgency by Boko Haram Islamist militants, which has displaced more than two million people and killed more than 40,000. Boko Haram gained international notoriety in April 2014 when it kidnapped more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, also in Borno state. Shortly after the kidnapping, the group carried out an attack in June and used their first female suicide bomber. This was only three years after it deployed its first male suicide bomber. Since then, there have been speculations that some of the female suicide bombers may be the missing Chibok school girls. A study found that Boko Haram has utilised more women as suicide bombers than any other group in history. Recent numbers suggest that over half of all suicide bombers used by Boko Haram are female. Many suggest that their mode of dressing (usually in hijab \u2013 a covering from the head to the feet) offers adequate means for hiding explosives. Gwoza was seized by Boko Haram in 2014, and taken back by the Nigerian forces in 2015 - but the group has since continued to carry out attacks and kidnappings near the town. The Gwoza suicide attacks has reignited suspicions that jihadist groups may be trying to reinvent themselves and show that they still have the capacity to do damage. Last November, 20 people were killed by Boko Haram insurgents while returning from a funeral service in neighbouring Yobe state. The attack happened a day after militants killed 17 people in a raid on Gurokayeya village, after villagers refused to pay a so-called harvest tax, police said.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but analysts and some local officials suspected the Islamic militant group Boko Haram , which has since 2009 waged an insurgency in Nigeria and neighboring countries in the Lake Chad region. \u201cThis latest bomb explosion targeting civilians is a stark reminder of the continued threat posed by Boko Haram, especially as it is coming after a triple suicide attack\u201d in Gwoza in the southern part of the state, said Malik Samuel, a researcher on the Lake Chad conflict at the Institute for Security Studies. Local police said the bomb used in Kawori was an improvised explosive device that was planted in the cafe, not a suicide attack. The police said 16 people were killed but did not give a definitive number of other victims who they said were \u201ccritically injured\u201d and undergoing treatment in hospitals around the state. The state emergency management agency said about 24 people were seriously injured.

The life of doctors should matter to Nigerians,\" adding that if nothing changes, they would declare an indefinite strike. Her colleague Dr Ibrahim Mohammed Okpanaki said doctors were \"demoralised and terrified. In a country where medical workers are leaving, those that have chosen to stay should be protected.\" Should ransom payments be banned? Inside story of a Nigerian ransom negotiator Nigeria cost-of-living crisis sparks exodus of doctors Dr Poopola started working at the National Eye Centre hospital about six years ago, Dr Okpanaki said. He described her as a very dedicated professional and responsible family woman. At the time she was kidnapped, she was still breast-feeding her youngest child. The hospital in Kaduna, north-west Nigeria, is one of the biggest eye hospitals in the country. Experts say the hospital's location on the outskirts of Kaduna city makes it an easy target for kidnappers. Her home was within the vicinity of the hospital. In 2021, dozens of students were taken from the nearby college of forestry. Dr Poopola's kidnappers are asking for 40m naira (\u00a319,000; $25,000) for their freedom. Although a controversial law criminalising ransom payments came into effect in 2022, they are still often paid by relatives desperate to free their loved ones. The law carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years for anyone who pays a ransom, although no-one has yet been convicted. The government is yet to comment on the strike or the doctor\u2019s situation. Dr Popoola's husband has declined requests to talk to the media. Dr Abdullahi told the BBC that \u201cthe family was exploring a diplomatic route initially, but they have now given us the permission to explore other options\". In recent years, kidnapping has become rife in Nigeria, with hundreds of people abducted, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. It has been particularly bad in the north-west of the country. More about Nigeria's kidnap crisis from the BBC: What lies behind the resurgence of mass abductions?

More than 50 extremists on motorcycles rode into the Tarmuwa council area of Yobe state on Sunday evening and began firing before setting buildings ablaze, according to Yobe police spokesperson Dungus Abdulkarim. The police blamed the attack on Boko Haram , which since 2009 has launched an insurgency to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, in the region. Boko Haram has since splintered into different factions, together accounting for the direct deaths of at least 35,000 people and the displacement of more than 2 million, as well as a humanitarian crisis with millions of people in dire need of foreign aid . At least 1,500 people have so far been killed in the region this year in attacks by armed groups, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED. Yobe Deputy Gov. Idi Barde Gubana gave a much lower death toll of 34 from Sunday\u2019s attack. Contradictory statistics are a common trend in the security crisis, with the death toll from survivors\u2019 count often higher than the official figure. The 34 dead cited by the deputy governor were the ones buried in a single village, said Zanna Umar, a community leader, who said they have so far confirmed 102 villagers killed in the attack. Most of the others were either buried before officials arrived, or their bodies were taken to other places for burial. \u201cWe are still working to search for more because many people are still missing,\u201d said Umar. Sunday\u2019s attack is one of the deadliest in the last year in Yobe. The state is less frequently attacked than neighboring Borno, the epicenter of the war with Boko Haram. Local media reported that the extremists claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in reprisal for villagers informing security operatives about their activities. A number of Boko Haram members were killed as a result of the information passed on by villagers, the militants were quoted as saying. Reprisals are rampant in the northeast and villagers sometimes \u201cpay the price\u201d after military operations, said Confidence MacHarry with SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based security firm. \u201cThis is the first time our community has faced such a devastating attack,\u201d said Buba Adamu, a local chief, his voice mixed with grief and fear. \u201cWe never imagined something like this could happen here.\u201d \u201cThere are some places (in the region) totally out of the control of the Nigerian army and villagers often live in fear of reprisals,\u201d MacHarry said. In such places, he added, Nigerian security forces only go there for operations but do not have enough manpower to remain on the ground. Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who was elected last year on a pledge to end the conflict with Boko Haram, condemned the attack in a statement that tried to assure villagers of justice but was silent about security measures. Security analysts have faulted Tinubu\u2019s security policies, saying he has not taken any bold steps so far to resolve the killings and that the problems he inherited, such as inadequate resources and manpower, remain. \u2014- Associated Press writer Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria contributed.","question":"Which Nigerian state, less frequently attacked than Borno, experienced one of the deadliest Boko Haram attacks in September 2024?","answer":"Yobe State was the location of the attack.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"To accurately answer this question, we need to consider the context of Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria and identify a state that, while not as frequently attacked as Borno, experienced a significant attack in September 2024.\n\n1. **Understanding Boko Haram**: Boko Haram is a militant Islamist group based in northeastern Nigeria, also active in Chad, Niger, and Cameroon.

At least 1,400 students have been taken from Nigerian schools since the 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants in the village of Chibok in Borno state shocked the world. Boko Haram , Nigeria\u2019s homegrown jihadi rebels, launched its insurgency in 2009 to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country. At least 35,000 people have been killed and 2.1 million people displaced as a result of the extremist violence, according to U.N. agencies in Nigeria.","question":"How many hostages did the Nigerian Army rescue in Kaduna State in September 2024?","answer":"The Nigerian Army rescued 13 hostages in Kaduna State in September 2024.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"Since the event in question is supposed to occur in September 2024, which is in the future as of my last update in August 2024, I don't have any information or records about such an event.\n\nAnswer: Unknown","correct":false,"refusal":true,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer acknowledges that the event is set in the future relative to their last update, and thus they cannot provide information about it.

The petrol started flowing out of the tanker, and passersby and residents rushed over with bottles to collect what had spilled on the ground and through nearby drains. The driver, who escaped the crash, tried to warn the crowd to leave the area for safety, witnesses said, but most did not listen. Then at about midnight, there was a big explosion, followed by a fire that ripped through the surrounding area.

Uzairu Musa Mainama, a local butcher who went out to help after the initial accident, sustained serious burns but survived. \u201cI was at home when I heard people screaming and calling for help,\u201d he recounted. At first, he stayed home, but said he then thought the injured may need help. \u201c[I thought] that there will be people involved which may need to be rescued. But after reaching the place, in less than three minutes, the fire started.\u201d Though he could not recall all the details, he remembered being \u201cpushed away from the fire\u201d. \u201cI quickly got up and removed my burning shirt, I took myself to the clinic and there we were, more than 100 that were injured.\u201d Some 70 people are still in intensive care in hospitals, police spokesman Lawan Shiisu Adam said on Friday.

Advertisement Residents said almost every family in Majia and adjoining communities has been affected by the tragedy \u2013 directly or indirectly. On Friday, Adam said the death toll had increased to 170 \u2013 up from about 150 on Thursday. Rescue personnel and survivors said the casualty figure could rise, considering that some of the victims sustained third-degree burns with vital organs affected. In Majia, residents told Al Jazeera 120 people had been buried at a mass gravesite we visited on the outskirts of town, while 50 others were buried elsewhere. Malam Hamza was among those grieving the loss of several family members. He said his son Hassan went to the scene of the explosion while people were scooping up petrol, to try and usher them home for their safety. But instead, he was consumed by the fire and ended up losing his life. \u201cHassan was indeed a very nice boy. I have never seen him fighting with anyone,\u201d Hamza said. His son had just obtained a diploma in pharmacy and was working with a clinic in Majia, Hamza added. Hamza\u2019s three other sons, Yusuf, Saidu and Mustapha, also died in the fire. Hamza\u2019s younger brother, Ilyasu Ibrahim, also lost his son, Yahya, while another of his sons, Abbas Ilyasu, was rushed to hospital with severe burns. A few metres away from Hamza and Ibrahim\u2019s homes, Muhammad Sabitu Haruna was also mourning the death of his son, Sani Sabitu, who ran a business centre in Majia. Sani left behind two wives and eight children, his father said. Like Hassan Hamza, Sani went to the scene to usher away his younger siblings who were scooping up the fuel. \u201cHe was here after Maghrib [sunset] prayer and when the truck fell, his mother asked him to go and chase his younger ones from the scene,\u201d Haruna said. \u201cBut as fate would have it, he died while some of his siblings sustained severe fire burns.\u201d Most of the victims of the explosion were young people \u2013 16 to 25 year olds \u2013 witnesses in the community said, explaining that they were the ones who rushed to the site to gather the spilled fuel. Advertisement Malam Ibrahim Lawan Majia, a Quranic school teacher, said five of his pupils died in the incident. \u201cIt is a terrible lesson for people not only here in Majia,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen something like this happens, people should refrain from scooping fuel. It is very dangerous,\u201d he said. Another resident, Abdullahi Salisu, said he lost his uncle, Tsoho Umar, while two brothers, Habun Salisu and Murtala Ado, sustained burns in the fire. Community members grieve at a mass grave site for victims who died in a fire in Majia, Nigeria [Ali Rabiu Ali\/Al Jazeera] Poverty and desperation Speaking to Al Jazeera, Adamu Lawan said he and three other people were sitting by the roadside near the gate of the Adams Science Tahfizul Quran Academy, just 15 metres from the site of the accident, when they saw the truck swerve and overturn on Tuesday night. \u201cThe fuel was emptied into the drainage and people came out en masse to fetch it,\u201d he said, after which the explosion and fire occurred. Lawan said increased economic hardship was \u201cpartially\u201d responsible for people taking risks to gather the spilled fuel. That was not how the town\u2019s people would react to previous fuel truck accidents, he said. \u201cBut now people are facing hardship and are finding any possible means of getting relief,\u201d he said. The tragedy comes at a time of economic crisis in Nigeria, when petrol has become a precious and expensive commodity for many. The price of gasoline has shot up since President Bola Ahmed Tinubu took office last May and withdrew a fuel subsidy, rising from about 175 naira ($0.1) a litre to more than 1,000 naira ($0.6). Advertisement At the same time, inflation has stayed above 30 percent for months, reaching an almost three-decade high of 34.19 percent in June before falling slightly to 32.7 percent in September. According to the World Bank, 56 percent of Nigerians live below the poverty line. Suleiman Sarki, a lecturer at the Federal University Dutse\u2019s criminology and sociology department, said that poverty exposed many Nigerians to crime and other dangerous acts \u2013 like illegal mining, pipeline vandalisation and exploring hazardous materials. \u201cThis act of desperation to get the fuel running on the way can be attributed to the hardship caused by abject poverty,\u201d Sarki said, calling for urgent action to fight high levels of poverty in the country. Following the incident, President Tinubu said he was committed to a \u201cswift and comprehensive\u201d review of fuel transportation safety protocols across the country, according to a statement on Wednesday. The Nigerian Federal Road Safety Corps also issued a nationwide order for minimum safety standards for fuel tankers before they are allowed on the road, according to spokesman Olusegun Ogungbemide. Jabir Abdullahi, who works as a watchman at the Adams Science Tahfizul Quran Academy and saw the accident, said he did not think economic hardship played a part in people rushing towards the tanker. Instead, he blamed the scramble among locals to get the petrol that had spilled over on ignorance of the danger involved. But in Majia, people no longer need any reminder of the perils of going too close to overturned tankers. Advertisement \u201cWe will never forget this day,\u201d said Lawan. \u201cIt will remain in our memories. Even for those that are too young to understand the situation, the story will be passed to them in future.\u201d Jabir Abdullahi feels similarly. \u201cAll over the town there\u2019s not any household and has not lost a person \u2013 either a house member or a relative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will remain in our memory forever and all that witnessed it will be cautioned against going to an accident scene involving a fuel tanker.\u201d Source : Al Jazeera","question":"What caused the explosion in Majia, Nigeria, in October 2024?","answer":"A fuel tanker overturned while trying to avoid an oncoming vehicle, and the spilled fuel ignited after residents gathered to collect it.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"Answer: There is no information available about an explosion in Majia, Nigeria, in October 2024, as it is a future event and the information is not yet available.

The villagers were killed on Christmas Day when the air force targeted a logistics base of the Lakurawa insurgent group in the Silame area of Sokoto state, Edward Buba, Nigerian defense spokesperson, told journalists at a press conference. On Thursday, the Sokoto state government said the air force mistakenly shelled the villagers in the early hours of Wednesday in an attempt to dislodge the insurgents from the area. However, on Friday, Buba said only that the Lakurawa insurgents were directly hit by munitions and that the civilians died from \u201csecondary explosions.\u201d The Lakurawa insurgent group began infiltrating Africa\u2019s most populous country following a wave of coups that disrupted Nigeria\u2019s relations with neighboring Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, hurting their ability to cooperate on transnational threats. Initially gaining local support by helping communities defend themselves against armed cattle rustlers, the group later sought to impose strict Islamic laws across border communities of the French-speaking countries.

Since 2017, some 400 civilians have been killed by such accidental strikes by the military, according to the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence security firm. Before the Lakurawa insurgents, Nigeria had been battling Boko Haram in the northeastern part of the country. Boko Haram launched an insurgency in 2009 to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, in the region. The group has since splintered into different factions, together accounting for the deaths of at least 35,000 people and the displacement of more than 2 million, as well as a humanitarian crisis with millions of people in dire need of foreign aid.","question":"How many civilians were killed in the Nigerian military's airstrike in Silame, Sokoto State, on Christmas Day 2024?","answer":"At least 10 civilians were killed in the airstrike.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"To provide an accurate response, let's break down the task:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question is asking for the number of civilians killed in a specific incident involving a Nigerian military airstrike in Silame, Sokoto State, on Christmas Day (December 25) in the year 2024.\n\n2. **Assessing the Feasibility of the Event**: The incident in question is supposed to have occurred in 2024.

The two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa\u2019s most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Ten people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church. There was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said, pointing out that some had been waiting since the previous night. \u201cThe way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,\u201d Loveth Inyang, a witness.

There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said. Viral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said. The church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises. As the church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures. Nigeria\u2019s President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy with the victims\u2019 families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures. The recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday this week when a local foundation organized a well-attended funfair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state. After the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that prior permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized. The current economic hardship under Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who promised \u201crenewed hope\u201d when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation that is at a 28-year high and the government\u2019s economic policies that have pushed the local currency to record low against the dollar . Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.","question":"How many people died in the stampede at the charity event in Okija, Anambra State in December 2024?","answer":"Three people died in the stampede at the charity event in Okija, Anambra State.","region":"Nigeria","model_answer":"Answer: There is no information or credible source indicating a stampede at a charity event in Okija, Anambra State in December 2024.
