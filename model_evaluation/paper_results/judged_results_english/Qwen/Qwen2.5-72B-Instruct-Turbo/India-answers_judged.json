In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot in Punjab, leading to a fierce gunbattle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers. The terrorists, who struck just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unscheduled visit to Lahore, could not, however, penetrate the defence cordon at the Air base which is located close to the border with Pakistan as they met with effective response from the security forces, police and security officials said. The attack by terrorists, suspected to belong to JeM outfit, took place at around 3.30 am and three security personnel, including a Garud commando of the IAF, were killed in it, defence sources said, adding four terrorists were also killed by the security forces within five hours. But, more terrorists were suspected to be still on the loose as gunshots were heard during the subsequent combing up operation, defence sources said.\u00a0IAF was using its two attack helicopters to assist the joint team of ground troops to neutralise the remaining terrorists, the sources said. Authorities said helicopters and other equipment at the Air base are safe. The technical area of the Air Force station is safe, police said.\u00a0The terrorists, with huge quantity of RDX in their possession, made their way to the base from the back side where there is a jungle, they said. But they could not go beyond the 'langar' (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, the sources said, about the operation which was supervised directly by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. Anticipating an attack after some armed men abducted an SP of Punjab Police on Thursday night, a team of NSG commandos had been rushed here last night itself after the NSA held a series of meetings with the Army Chief and top IB officials yesterday. An army detachment was also positioned at the Air base, the sources said.

On the fateful day of March 21, 2016, Baliga was on his morning walk when he was killed. The Mangaluru city police arrested six in the case, and city-based entrepreneur Naresh Shenoy was named as the main accused. They submitted a 770-page charge sheet at the third JMFC court on 23 June, 2016 and on 17 December, 2016 investigation officer Uday Naik filed supplementary charge sheet. Motive behind murder In supplementary charge sheet, the police cited that Vinayak Baliga had written a letter to the trustees of Sudha Seva Pratishthana. He had accused Naresh Shenoy and his family members of theft in the Vittoba Temple. He had also blamed Naresh Shenoy of helping Nandakumar, an accused in a murder at the Venkataramana Temple in 2013, get bail and prompt Manjunath Shenoy (accused no 7 in the Vinayak Baliga murder case) to turn hostile. Vinayak Baliga The supplementary charge-sheet notes that Vinayak Baliga had obtained information under the Right to Information Act, regarding financial misappropriations in the Venkataramana Temple and had filed two original suits. He had also filed an original suit against trustees of Venkataramana Temple, questioning the sale of land of the temple. Naresh Shenoy influenced the affairs of the Venkataramana Temple, the charge-sheet said. All these reasons, the investigation officer says, prompted Naresh Shenoy to conspire with his employee, Srikant (accused no 2) and Shaliesh (accused no 6), to murder Vinayak Baliga. Naresh Shenoy reportedly gave his vehicle and money to Shivaprasad, Vineet Poojary and Nishit Devadiga, who murdered Baliga. Accused no 7 Manjunath Shenoy alias Manju Neereshwalya has been accused of helping Naresh Shenoy to stay away from the police from the day of the incident till his arrest on 26 June, 2016. Naresh Shenoy Being an entrepreneur, Naresh Shenoy is a known face in the socio cultural circles of the city. He is the founder of Mangaluru unit of Namo Brigdae, later renamed as Yuva Brigade. In GSB community, he maintains a strong hold because of his financial and political influence. It is believed that the statements against him about temple theft and other temple related issues by Vinayak Baliga humiliated him. It is said that the suits filed by Vinayak Baliga, dented his public image. Naresh Shenoy So immediately after the murder of Vinayak Baliga, the police suspected Naresh Shenoy\u2019s role and he also remained elusive for three months and surrendered before the police after the High Court dismissed his application for anticipatory bail in the case. While absconding, Shenoy was hiding in Jammu and Kashmir, Gorakhpur, Lucknow and places bordering Nepal. Finally on 26 June 2016, police arrested Naresh from Udupi and he remained in jail up to 15 September 2017, the day he was awarded bail from High Court. The role of society According to FIRA President Narendra Nayak, Baliga was respected as he always raised voice against the injustice and irregularities in the affairs of local government bodies and religious circles, especially in his own community. Baliga was an electrical contractor by profession, and with RTI had unearthed controversial information related to electricity theft and unauthorized constructions in Mangaluru city. Nayak says that though initially there was uproar in the city, after his murder, people became mum when powerful names were associated with is assasination. Today, the fight for justice is limited to only few. Nayak says that Congress used Vinayk Baliga incident to defend BJP\u2019s anti-Hindu allegations but were nowhere in picture when it came to giving justice to Vinayak or supporting his family. Nayak blames a temple \u2018mafia\u2019 which has a strong political backing, and has spread fear in the GSB community. Many prefer to remain mum than voice out against them, he adds. Vinayak Baliga\u2019s sisters continue his battle The fight for justice has come down to Anuradha Baliga and Harsha Baliga, sisters of Vinayak Baliga, who are toiling relentlessly to bring justice to their brother. They have already submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy through the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner seeking constitution of a Special Investigation Team to probe Vinayak Baliga\u2019s murder and expose the full plot behind the murder. Vinayak Baliga\u2019s sisters Same time, they decided to continue their brothers fight against the injustice and temple mafia. Vinayak Baliga had questioned the misuse of funds, lack of accountability, inflation of bills and other issues which happened in Venkatarama Temple. He had got hold of an audit statement and he had raised questions, which caused discomfort to the chartered accountant who had signed the previous balance sheet. Now, Anuradha Baliga, has filed a complaint with the Muzrai department which has now ordered an enquiry into the alleged misdeeds of the temple management. The order to that effect has been passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada. Nayak highlights that the investigations into the murder case of Baliga had come to a halt after the arrest of the first accused Naresh Shenoy, who managed to get bail after some months. He has been violating the conditions of the bail, which has been brought to the attention of the court by Anuradha Baliga. She has been filing applications in various courts and continuing her battle for the constitution of a special investigation team, so that the hidden facts in the case are revealed.

At least three militants barged into the building soon after attacking a convoy of security forces, leaving three CRPF jawans dead and eight injured. One civilian, Abdul Gani Mir. died after sustaining a bullet injury later. Security agencies ruled out a hostage situation. But the operation may take time as storming the building at night is a difficult proposition. Around 4 p.m., the heavily armed militants surfaced on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway and opened indiscriminate fire at the convoy near Sempora. A bus carrying CRPF jawans, at the end of the convoy, bore the brunt of the attack. Constables Bola Singh and D.K. Rana, who was driving the bus, of the 79 Battalion were among the three killed. Several jawans are in hospital in a critical state. Later, the militants were spotted on the premises of the Entrepreneurship Development Institute (EDI), housing three complexes with nearly 95 people in them, with many staying in the hostel. \u201cI was in the main EDI building.

In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot in Punjab, leading to a fierce gunbattle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers. The terrorists, who struck just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unscheduled visit to Lahore, could not, however, penetrate the defence cordon at the Air base which is located close to the border with Pakistan as they met with effective response from the security forces, police and security officials said. The attack by terrorists, suspected to belong to JeM outfit, took place at around 3.30 am and three security personnel, including a Garud commando of the IAF, were killed in it, defence sources said, adding four terrorists were also killed by the security forces within five hours. But, more terrorists were suspected to be still on the loose as gunshots were heard during the subsequent combing up operation, defence sources said.\u00a0IAF was using its two attack helicopters to assist the joint team of ground troops to neutralise the remaining terrorists, the sources said. Authorities said helicopters and other equipment at the Air base are safe. The technical area of the Air Force station is safe, police said.\u00a0The terrorists, with huge quantity of RDX in their possession, made their way to the base from the back side where there is a jungle, they said. But they could not go beyond the 'langar' (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, the sources said, about the operation which was supervised directly by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. Anticipating an attack after some armed men abducted an SP of Punjab Police on Thursday night, a team of NSG commandos had been rushed here last night itself after the NSA held a series of meetings with the Army Chief and top IB officials yesterday. An army detachment was also positioned at the Air base, the sources said.

Here\u2019s how it all went wrong By Rahul Bhatia Thu 12 May 2016 06.00 BST Last modified on Wed 2 Dec 2020 12.00 GMT Share U ntil Mark Zuckerberg arrived in a bright orange helicopter in October 2014, Chandauli had never seen a celebrity visitor. One of 44,795 villages in the state of Rajasthan, Chandauli is only three or four hours\u2019 drive from Delhi, but it exists alone and forgotten, tucked away, a kilometre off a quiet highway. Last year, when a local boy used the internet to buy a used motorcycle, astonished villagers called him an online shopping hero. Zuckerberg had come to see an experiment at work. Earlier that year, with its sights set on the forthcoming elections, the government had asked a foundation to help give Chandauli\u2019s mostly Muslim villagers a digital education. And so, with uncommon haste, a small administrative building was turned into a community centre, where locals could learn how to access email and find information online. Soon, almost every household in the village had one person who knew how to use a computer. The digital transformation of Chandauli was an ideal story for Zuckerberg \u2013 a little parable for his grand mission for India. He wanted to bring the internet to millions of people who had never used it before. Specifically, he wanted to bring them a version of the internet that had Facebook at its core. From the archive: The inside story of Facebook\u2019s biggest setback \u2013 podcast Read more After Zuckerberg landed, he was quickly guided by his advisers towards the community centre. He saw wheat fields and power lines, and a classroom with children sitting on a dirt floor. The heat warped the horizon. A crowd trailed behind him, talking excitedly about the man they called \u201cJuckerberg\u201d. But once he stepped inside the centre, the door was closed and latched. Zuckerberg took a seat on a plastic stool, and awkwardly asked the village children about how they used the centre\u2019s computers. His stiff manner, combined with the presence of a reporter from Time magazine, and a Facebook photographer documenting the encounter, added to the sensation that the locals were playing parts in a performance directed by the company. But not everything went according to plan. The electricity had gone out shortly after Zuckerberg arrived, taking with it the wireless network that provided the village\u2019s main connection to the internet. Instead, one of the boys showed Zuckerberg his mobile phone, and tried to bring up his Facebook profile page. This roused the CEO. \u201cHe genuinely wanted to know what they did on their phones, and how they spent time on the internet,\u201d said Osama Manzar, the co-founder of the Digital Empowerment Foundation that had set up Chandauli\u2019s digital literacy centre. Under Zuckerberg\u2019s gaze, the boy\u2019s profile page slowly emerged on a 2G connection. \u201cBandwidth issues,\u201d Zuckerberg said to himself. He assured the children inside, and the villagers outside, that their connectivity problems would be fixed before his next visit. Later that day, Zuckerberg returned to New Delhi, where he posted a picture of himself speaking with a child at the resource centre. \u201cSeeing first-hand how people here are using the internet was an incredible experience,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne day, if we can connect every village, we can transform many more lives and improve the world for all of us. Chandauli is just the start.\u201d From Zuckerberg\u2019s vantage point, high above the connected world he had helped create, India was a largely blank map. Many of its citizens \u2013 hundreds of millions of people \u2013 were clueless about the internet\u2019s powers. If only they could see how easily they could form a community, how quickly they could turn into buyers and sellers of anything, how effortlessly they could find anything they needed \u2013 and so much more that they didn\u2019t. Zuckerberg was convinced that Facebook could win them over, and even more convinced that this would change their lives for the better. He would bring India\u2019s rural poor online quickly, and in great numbers, with an irresistible proposition: users would pay nothing at all to access a version of the internet curated by Facebook. But where Zuckerberg saw the endless promise of a digital future, Indians came to see something more sinister. Seventeen months later, Facebook\u2019s grand plans to bring India online had been halted by overwhelming local opposition \u2013 the biggest stumbling block the company had hit in its 12-year-history. In the end, it seemed, Facebook had acted as if it was giving India a gift. But it was not a gift Indians wanted. View image in fullscreen Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announces an Internet.org initiative in New Delhi in 2014 Photograph: Chandan Khanna\/AFP\/Getty Images I n the charged days before Facebook went public in May 2012, its official filings contained a faint warning about the company\u2019s future growth. In Europe and America, the company had gained users at an astonishing rate \u2013 but, as it ran out of new people to add, its expansion was slowing. On both continents, almost four out of five people had internet access, and more than half of them were already on Facebook. In the rest of the world, Facebook\u2019s business was booming, but it had the opposite problem: less than half the population was connected to the internet. For the social network to continue its astronomical growth, it needed those people to get online. No country except China held the kind of potential that India did \u2013 and Facebook was banned in China. Without much effort, there were already around 100 million Facebook users in India by 2014, and the company judged its potential market to be several hundred million more. \u201cIf you look at the literate population, which is a good proxy for how many people can be online, it\u2019s about 700-800 million,\u201d a Facebook employee who worked on the company\u2019s plans for India told me. \u201cThat\u2019s really the opportunity. If you rank countries based on opportunity, India comes out on top, and comes out on top by a big margin.\u201d According to a Facebook executive, the company\u2019s internal analysis projected that more than 30% of the new customers it hoped to add worldwide by 2020 would come from India. But Facebook was not about to sit around waiting for them to get online on their own. Since 2010, the company had been experimenting with ways to bring more people online, and thus to Facebook. One of these experiments, the Facebook employee said, was a project referred to as Apollo. Under Apollo, Facebook\u2019s growth and partnership teams persuaded mobile phone companies in the Philippines, Latin America, Africa and India to give mobile phone users who had not paid for data plans free access to Facebook. The initial financial sacrifice, Facebook told the phone companies, was an investment \u2013 giving customers a small taste of the internet would convince them to start paying to access everything the web had to offer. The best proof of this proposition came in the Philippines, where Facebook partnered with Globe \u2013 the smaller of the country\u2019s two dominant mobile companies \u2013 which trailed its rival\u2019s market share by 20 percentage points. Globe\u2019s user numbers surged, and within 15 months, it had overtaken its rival, thanks to the enormous lure of free access to Facebook. \u201cIt all started with the free Facebook promo,\u201d one Filipino stock analyst told a local business newspaper. Angry about Facebook censorship? Wait until you hear about the news feed Read more The success of such experiments fed into a much bigger plan Facebook had been developing: an ambitious effort to bring hundreds of millions of people around the world online. In February 2014, while the results of the Philippines experiment were trickling in, Zuckerberg stood on a stage at a mobile industry conference in Barcelona and pitched the phone companies its big plan: Internet.org , which would provide free basic internet services to entice the whole world online. The phone companies would foot the bill, but Zuckerberg laid out the economic benefits of helping the world\u2019s poor to join the digital age: \u201cThere was this Deloitte study that came out the other day,\u201d he told his audience, \u201cthat said if you could connect everyone in emerging markets, you could create more than 100 million jobs and bring a lot of people out of poverty.\u201d The Deloitte study, which did indeed say this, was commissioned by Facebook, based on data provided by Facebook, and was about Facebook. In July 2014, Zambia became the first country where Internet.org was rolled out. But Facebook was already preparing for India. A few months before Zuckerberg\u2019s helicopter landed in Chandauli, Facebook contacted Osama Manzar of the Digital Empowerment Foundation to ask for his advice on tailoring Internet.org to a local audience. Manzar is stocky, with a face that expresses delight instantly. In a room full of dark suits, he is the guy wearing the white kurta and the patterned turban. For months, Facebook employees working on Internet.org mined Manzar for information. \u201cJust about anybody from Facebook in the US would land up at our office,\u201d he told me. Facebook staff emailed and phoned him. \u201cThey had questions interns would have!\u201d Manzar likes to say he guided them like a paid adviser, but without the pay. \u201cIt was taking a lot out of me, and I had no idea what the future of this huge amount of content-gathering was,\u201d he told me. Manzar, who is 48, had spent much of his life working to help Indians get online, and now one of the biggest tech companies in the world had thrown its weight behind his cause. \u201cThe power of Facebook as a platform, how it has motivated people to come online, generate content, get even the non-literate to become literate ... I am a great fan,\u201d he said. But Manzar\u2019s optimism soured when he saw what Internet.org actually looked like: a threadbare platform that only allowed access to 36 bookmarked sites and Facebook, which was naturally the only social network available. There was one weather app, three sites for women\u2019s issues, and the search engine Bing. Facebook\u2019s stripped-down internet was reminiscent of old search engines that listed the early web on one page, when it was small enough to be categorised, like books in a library. Crucially, Facebook itself would decide which sites were included on the platform. The company had positioned Internet.org as a philanthropic endeavour \u2013 backed by Zuckerberg\u2019s lofty pronouncements that \u201cconnectivity is a human right\u201d \u2013 but retained total control of the platform. \u201cTheir pitch about access turned into mobilisation for their own product,\u201d Manzar said. Manzar had never seen anything like it. He realised that if Internet.org took hold in India, Facebook would be the gatekeeper to the web for hundreds of millions who had no idea what the internet was, or what it could do for them. View image in fullscreen Without much effort there were already around 100 million Facebook users in India by 2014. Photograph: Manjunath Kiran\/AFP\/Getty Images A s Zuckerberg travelled around the country in the autumn of 2014, he had every reason to be optimistic about Facebook\u2019s India strategy. He received an ecstatically warm welcome from Indian politicians, who were eager to advertise their tech-savviness by being seen with Facebook\u2019s founder. He was even granted an audience with India\u2019s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, who had built a sizeable online presence \u2013 with some help from Facebook \u2013 during the recent elections. The prime minister spoke with Zuckerberg about his \u201cClean India\u201d mission \u2013 which encouraged citizens to tidy up their streets and towns \u2013 and Zuckerberg said Facebook would create an app for the programme. (This promise was widely reported, but the app never materialised. When employees inquired about it later, a senior Facebook policy director said that making the app would violate Facebook\u2019s anti-corruption policies, according to documentation I was shown.) Zuckerberg also got an easy ride from the Indian media, which churned out puff pieces about Facebook\u2019s noble plans to get millions of Indians online. But the company remained vague about the detailed workings of Internet.org, and tech journalists began to voice their suspicions after an evasive press conference in New Delhi, where Zuckerberg only took questions from carefully selected reporters. One of the sceptics was Nikhil Pahwa , the founder and editor of Medianama, a news site about India\u2019s telecommunications industry, who left the press conference and began to outline his reservations about what Facebook was proposing. \u201cWhat Zuckerberg means by internet for all, is essentially Facebook for all, along with a few non-profit services thrown in to give it the appearance of philanthropy,\u201d he wrote the following day. But what would prove devastating to Zuckerberg\u2019s ambitions for India was something else that Pahwa noticed. Facebook had wandered into an arcane technical dispute \u2013 involving India\u2019s phone companies and the idea of net neutrality \u2013 which was about to come to a boil. What Zuckerberg means by internet for all, is essentially Facebook for all, with a few non-profit services thrown in Nikhil Pahwa Internet.org would allow some commercial services \u2013 such as the employment site Babajob \u2013 to be available on its free platform. But that would necessarily mean excluding those companies\u2019 competitors, and essentially subsidising the growth of a few chosen firms. Pahwa argued that this arrangement violated net neutrality \u2013 the principle that phone companies and internet providers should not be allowed to prioritise certain sites and services, since this could fundamentally alter the level playing field of the internet. The government had been debating the legality of services said to violate net neutrality. If it decided to issue a ruling on the subject, Facebook\u2019s plans could be dashed. Medianama, Pahwa\u2019s website, was not widely read outside of the telecoms industry, but he was a respected voice in the field, and Facebook was sufficiently concerned about his criticism that the company invited him for a meeting in January 2015. Two senior officials were in the office: Ankhi Das, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in India, and Kevin Martin, the former chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, who was working as a consultant for the company. Pahwa was unwilling to speak about the meeting (\u201cIt was off the record,\u201d he explained) but he said that \u201cthe sense I had was that Facebook was trying to understand how much I knew about Internet.org\u201d. I n February 2015, four months after Zuckerberg\u2019s visit, Internet.org went live in India, in partnership with Reliance Mobile, India\u2019s fourth-largest phone company. (Several other operators declined, the Facebook employee told me, because they were already worried about the issue of net neutrality.) Reliance\u2019s advertisements for the service showed college students crowding around a single phone, laughing at something on the screen. The tagline: \u201cIf the sun is free \u2026 If the air is free \u2026 Then why shouldn\u2019t the internet be free?\u201d For a brief moment, it felt like a routine product launch \u2013 except for continued complaints from a small number of critics. Facebook responded to criticism by claiming that 40% of users were purchasing full data plans within a month \u2013 joining the full internet, in other words \u2013 but the critics fired back that as Facebook refused to provide further details these numbers could not be verified. The debate between the company and its critics about the virtues of Internet.org would most likely have carried on quietly, without ever disturbing the attention of ordinary Indians. But at the end of March 2015, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) announced that it was considering a ruling on net neutrality, and asked for public comment on the issue. Any ruling would affect the fate of Internet.org. For Pahwa, this was a worrying development. Even the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d was forbidding: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, technical sounding phrase,\u201d he said. The TRAI already seemed to have a tendency to come down on the side of the phone companies, and Pahwa believed his only chance of winning was to somehow gather huge public support. The regulator could ignore policy papers by telecom nerds. \u201cWhat they can\u2019t ignore is people,\u201d Pahwa emailed a friend. Luckily, at least in the public eye, his adversary was one of the world\u2019s largest and most famous technology companies \u2013 and the playing field was a country whose citizens reacted with fierce antipathy to anything that looked like a foreign power dictating terms to grateful supplicants. View image in fullscreen A young man at a market in Mumbai, wearing a Facebook T-shirt. Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee\/AFP\/Getty Images Pahwa fired off emails to several acquaintances, explaining that he felt the future of India\u2019s internet was at stake. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what\u2019s going on until it has happened,\u201d he said. A group of volunteers \u2013 coders, lawyers, policy wonks \u2013 began to coalesce around Pahwa. Dubbing their movement Save the Internet, they built a website that would allow anyone to make a submission to the regulator in favour of net neutrality. On 11 April, the website launched, featuring a video by a wildly popular group of young comedians, All India Bakchod \u2013 who produced a nine-minute net neutrality explainer that would eventually rack up 3.5 million views. Within two weeks, more than a million people had used the site to send emails to the government \u2013 and soon enough, politicians were debating net neutrality in parliament. All of a sudden, a shockingly large number of Indians had been drawn into a loud and raucous public argument about the intricacies of the country\u2019s telecoms policy. On one side, there was the unlikely sight of a popular online rebellion, among young and old alike, in favour of net neutrality \u2013 a concept almost nobody had heard of a few months earlier. On the other side were the phone companies and Facebook, which was convinced that its plans would benefit the economy, lure a massive invisible population online, and help realise India\u2019s ambitions to become a digital powerhouse. This side was not without its own impassioned supporters, and soon India\u2019s fractious social media was tangled in thousands of bitter fights about whether Facebook was asking too much for the kind of progress it promised to provide. On Twitter, supporters of net neutrality began to protest against companies that had partnered with Facebook. Before long, four websites withdrew their participation, and tweeted support for net neutrality on their way out. All the while, from his office at Facebook HQ in Silicon Valley, Chris Daniels, the vice-president of Internet.org, watched with alarm as the opposition mounted in India. In particular, I was told by a person close to Daniels, the popularity of All India Bakchod\u2019s video worried Facebook\u2019s top brass. The company\u2019s most senior leaders in India scrambled to assemble a response: according to a Facebook employee, their only idea was to \u201caddress myths\u201d about Internet.org and \u201ceducate\u201d policymakers about the platform. \u201cJust answering their questions was the strategy,\u201d the employee recalled. To most onlookers, Facebook\u2019s initial reaction suggested that the company was not taking the opposition seriously. Its efforts appeared clumsy and ineffective, especially for a company that rarely stumbles so visibly. Employees wondered what Facebook\u2019s gameplan was. \u201cTo do things right, you need someone in policy who is a strategist and a skilful tactician,\u201d the Facebook employee said. \u201cGlobally, yes, we have people like that. In India I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d I n private, Facebook\u2019s efforts began to intensify. Zuckerberg began to make personal calls to Indian internet entrepreneurs to rebuild support for Internet.org. One person he contacted was a former senior executive of NASSCOM, India\u2019s software industry lobby. The senior executive told Zuckerberg that he would support Internet.org \u2013 but only if Facebook opened up the platform to any company that wanted to participate. Zuckerberg promised him Facebook would make this change in the future. \u201cCan we have your support now?\u201d the executive recalled Zuckerberg asking. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it a feature in Internet.org 2.0.\u201d Over the course of 2015, Facebook executives repeatedly met with lawmakers and the government\u2019s regulators, who gave no indication when they would issue any decision on net neutrality. (In response to my questions, a Facebook spokesperson said the company had met with the chairman of India\u2019s telecoms regulator to discuss \u201ca range of connectivity issues\u201d.) Daniels, the Internet.org vice-president, made about six trips to India in 2015 to meet with policymakers, the Facebook employee recalled: \u201cThose meetings were like a rollercoaster. Sometimes it would feel like lawmakers and regulators understood what Facebook was trying to do with Internet.org, and in some meetings somebody would make it sound like we would get shut down tomorrow.\u201d Facebook held its cards close, and tried to avoid public confrontation. At one parliamentary committee hearing, the company took the unusual step of asking if it could put its case to lawmakers in private, and had everyone else cleared out of the room. Ankhi Das, the company\u2019s head of public policy \u2013 its top lobbyist, in other words \u2013 had uncommonly good access in Delhi\u2019s corridors of power. Her presence seemed to open any door, a Facebook executive told me. \u201cWe used to joke that it was like she was Modi\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d How Facebook plans to take over the world Read more Modi had swept into office after a massive election victory in May 2014, thanks in part to a huge, well-organised online following. The person who ran Modi\u2019s social media operation told me that Facebook was extraordinarily responsive to requests from the campaign, and recalled that Das \u201cnever said no\u201d to any information the campaign wanted. However, a Facebook spokesperson insisted that the company had never provided special information or extra details to Modi\u2019s campaign. In the months after the election, Facebook\u2019s interest in India was evident. Sheryl Sandberg met Modi soon after. A few months later, Zuckerberg paid him a visit. And in the midst of the net neutrality debate, Modi returned the favour by making an appearance before a large crowd at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters in September 2015, with Zuckerberg and Sandberg at his side. The moment \u2013 a picture of solidarity \u2013 was broadcast live online, and did not go unnoticed back in India, where it was covered live on television. Pahwa, who had been invited into a TV studio to give his reaction, recalled that he feared Modi would announce his opposition to net neutrality on the spot. Instead, Zuckerberg told Modi a cute story. \u201cI haven\u2019t told this publicly,\u201d he began, anxiously. \u201cBefore things were going well, when people wanted to buy Facebook, I met my mentor, Steve Jobs.\u201d The Apple CEO apparently urged Zuckerberg to visit a temple in India that he had gone to years earlier. \u201cSo I travelled for almost a month, seeing how people connected,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cHaving the opportunity to feel how much better the world could be if everyone had a stronger ability to connect reinforced for me the importance of what we were doing. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always remembered while we built Facebook.\u201d Modi clapped and grinned. View image in fullscreen Indian prime minister Narendra Modi with Mark Zuckerberg at Menlo Park in 2015. Photograph: Bloomberg\/Bloomberg via Getty Images A month after Modi\u2019s visit to Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg returned to Delhi once again. At the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, Zuckerberg sauntered on to a stage and gave woolly answers to the softest of pre-selected questions. But when the talk ended, Zuckerberg was ushered to a nearby room, where many of India\u2019s most prominent online entrepreneurs had been assembled for a closed-door meeting with him. By now Internet.org had been rechristened Free Basics. The meeting was about how Facebook could help everyone there, one of the attendees recalled. However, the entrepreneurs wanted to talk about Free Basics. \u201cEverybody started saying, \u2018Well, why are you controlling who gets on this?\u2019\u201d recalled Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the proprietor of the popular mobile payments firm Paytm. Zuckerberg assured them that Facebook would no longer retain the power to choose which sites were included. \u201cHe said he will not decide who will be on Free Basics. Some \u2018eminent people\u2019 of India will decide,\u201d Sharma said. The entrepreneurs wanted Free Basics changed in many ways, and Sharma recalled Zuckerberg\u2019s response as being, \u201cI\u2019ve heard your inputs, and we\u2019ll try changing it.\u201d When it was Sharma\u2019s turn to speak, he did not hide his feelings. \u201cI said, \u2018Zuck, what are you talking about?\u2019 In my view, it\u2019s like the British coming in and saying, \u2018While everything\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll come in and help you with your tax collection \u2013 and this is the percentage we\u2019ll take.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d Several people involved in the debate over net neutrality shared Sharma\u2019s disbelief. They told me that Facebook\u2019s insistence on pushing through Free Basics without a transparent discussion was doing lasting damage to the company. \u201cThere was tone-deafness in the people who carried out the campaign,\u201d Nitin Pai, the co-founder of an influential policy thinktank named the Takshashila Institution, told me. \u201cYou know that foreigners talking down to Indians and telling them what is good for them is going to backfire.\u201d Zuckerberg had tried to gain Sharma\u2019s support. An endorsement by the boss of Paytm \u2013 one of India\u2019s entrepreneurship success stories \u2013 would have been a signal to other companies to sign on, said the former NASSCOM executive. But Sharma had been consistent in his opposition to platforms like Free Basics. You know that foreigners talking down to Indians and telling them what is good for them is going to backfire Nitin Pai \u201cWhat is my perception of Facebook\u2019s purpose? Thumbs up,\u201d Sharma said when we met earlier this year at his office. \u201cWhat is my judgment of their actions? It\u2019s not correct. The purpose is nice. I want everybody in this country to be connected as much as Zuck wants. Who doesn\u2019t want that? But are they doing it correctly?\u201d He could not stop laughing as he imagined Facebook\u2019s plans to serve India. \u201cSomeone isn\u2019t advising them well. Let them provide the complete internet for free at night. We\u2019ll partner with them,\u201d he said, thumping his chest. W ithin Facebook, the executive said, there existed a strong belief that the crises would pass; the regulator would eventually be pressed to give services such as Free Basics legal sanction and that would end the debate. After months of foot-dragging, the telecoms regulator \u2013 under the influence of a new chairman \u2013 decided in November 2015 to hurry up and reach a decision on net neutrality. For the second time in a year, it asked the public to comment, on three specific questions relating to net neutrality and expanding internet access, with a deadline of 30 December. There was no mention of Facebook or Free Basics. \u201cFacebook did not figure much in the discussions,\u201d a person involved in the telecoms regulator\u2019s deliberations said. Instead, the regulator turned the debate\u2019s glare away from Facebook, and on to the larger subject of net neutrality. By resolving the larger issue, they thought, the Free Basics question would sort itself out. View image in fullscreen A billboard advert for Facebook\u2019s Free Basics initiative in Mumbai. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui \/ Reuters But Facebook panicked. The company saw the regulator\u2019s public questions as an existential threat, and within a week, Facebook\u2019s marketing and policy teams launched a scorched-earth campaign to rally support. Every user in India who logged into Facebook was greeted with a special message from Facebook, which said: \u201cFree Basics is a first step to connecting 1 billion Indians to the opportunities online. But without your support, it could be banned in a matter of weeks.\u201d Below the message, a large purple button invited users to click and \u201csend email\u201d to the regulator. If this was not intrusive enough, many users complained that even if they declined to send the message, merely lingering on the page caused Facebook to send all their friends a notification indicating they had written to the regulator. Online, outrage at the heavy-handed tactics erupted. \u201cFB just listed an uncle\u2019s account as having signed up to support Free Basics,\u201d one user tweeted. \u201cHe passed away two years ago.\u201d Facebook had succeeded, overwhelmingly, in making the larger ruling on net neutrality about itself. As Pahwa told me: \u201cFacebook came and shoved its ass in our faces.\u201d Commuters on India\u2019s roads and highways found themselves called upon to support Free Basics from what seemed like thousands of billboards. One pictured a farmer and his family and asked them to support \u201ca better future\u201d for unconnected Indians such as \u201cGanesh\u201d, who used Free Basics and learned \u201cnew farming techniques that doubled his crop yield\u201d. Patriotic Facebook advertisements filled entire pages in Indian newspapers every day. By the end of the year, the Indian business daily Mint reported that Facebook had spent more than \u00a330m on advertising. \u201cIt felt like a tidal wave,\u201d Pahwa recalled. Two days before the deadline set by the regulator, an editorial by Zuckerberg was published in the Times of India, the country\u2019s largest newspaper. \u201cCritics of free basic internet services should remember that everything we\u2019re doing is about serving people like Ganesh,\u201d he wrote, in reference to the farmer who had featured in Facebook\u2019s ad campaign. Pahwa responded with an op-ed of his own in the same paper. Behind the scenes, Zuckerberg made one final offer to India\u2019s software industry. NASSCOM, the software lobby, had come out for net neutrality earlier in the year. But now, days before the deadline, its members were abuzz about the deal Zuckerberg had proposed \u2013 the lobby group itself would hold the power to decide which sites were on Facebook\u2019s platform. \u201cThat suddenly made them say, \u2018Man, that would put us in a very powerful position,\u2019\u201d the former NASSCOM executive told me. The software lobby quietly changed its tune: it told the regulator it supported net neutrality, with an exception for \u201cshort-term business promotions\u201d \u2013 like Free Basics. A ccording to Facebook, 16 million users in India sent messages to the regulator to support Free Basics before the deadline. Swamped with feedback, the regulator used custom-built programs to sift out the original replies. A pattern emerged immediately; the comments in support of Free Basics that Facebook had submitted did not address the questions the regulators had asked. The regulator worried that Free Basics\u2019 supporters were not \u201cmaking informed decisions\u201d and chastised Facebook for reducing the consultation to a popularity contest. The regulator spent the month of January 2016 preparing its ruling. The meetings ran on for hours every day. But the discussions were about the details of a stance that had already been decided: net neutrality would be upheld. \u201cWe could have kept going on discussing it, but someone has got to stop,\u201d a person closely involved in the process said. \u201cSo we just stopped on 8 February.\u201d Services such as Free Basics were effectively declared illegal. Many of Facebook\u2019s supporters \u2013 in India and abroad \u2013 were aghast: why would a poor country reject the assistance of one of the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful tech companies? Marc Andreessen, the powerful venture capitalist who sits on Facebook\u2019s board, contemptuously suggested a misguided resentment of the west was to blame. \u201cAnti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades,\u201d he told his 500,000 Twitter followers. \u201cWhy stop now?\u201d View image in fullscreen Protesters in Bangalore. Photograph: Manjunath Kiran\/AFP\/Getty Images When I mentioned this quote to the Facebook executive, he raised his voice in frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s no respect, and you can see that from Marc Andreessen. They wouldn\u2019t dare to say that about China. In India they\u2019re fine because we\u2019ve been bending over backwards to accommodate them. I\u2019m a supporter of prime minister Modi, but I don\u2019t know why he has let this go on.\u201d He bet me that Andreessen would apologise by the end of the next day. As we spoke, Andreessen tweeted an apology. Senior people at Facebook, the executive said, had convinced themselves they had special pull with the prime minister. \u201cThey believed Modi would do it for them,\u201d he said, recalling meetings where people discussed the similarities in \u201cmanaging\u201d India and Africa: \u201cIt worked in Burundi, so it should work in India.\u201d \u201cI think the mistake that people make is that they think, \u2018India is this developing country and there are these back-channel ways of getting things done,\u2019\u201d the Facebook employee told me. \u201cIn essence, the mistake of thinking that a third-world country is a banana republic. So institutions, the public, the press \u2013 they can be bypassed.\u201d He recalled a whiff of disrespect that lingered in meeting rooms and on conference calls. \u201cYou can sense it in the way that some of these things have been approached. It\u2019s like, \u2018If we show support for Free Basics from six million users, the government can\u2019t shut it down\u2019.\u201d \u201cWe are not a Tanzania,\u201d Pai, the thinktank founder, said. \u201cWe are producing apps, and it is an economic pillar to our success. So we shouldn\u2019t give over our keys to anyone. We should be careful of putting market power in the hands of one or two companies.\u201d Several people who had been lobbied by Facebook \u2013 and a few insiders at the company \u2013 remarked with distaste that the company had \u201cno skin in the game\u201d, as one put it. \u201cThe pipes belong to the phone companies, and they pay the marketing costs of bringing new users online,\u201d the former NASSCOM executive said. \u201cSo what exactly did Facebook bring here?\u201d When I asked the Facebook executive why the company had failed to heed the growing protests and carried on fighting so hard for Free Basics, he pointed to Zuckerberg\u2019s intense belief in Facebook\u2019s mission. \u201cThis happens every time Facebook pushes out a new change,\u201d he said. \u201cNew privacy settings? People protest, Facebook changes it just a little, and people get used to it. The same thing probably happened here. Mark would have thought people would get used to it.\u201d In the months after the ruling, Facebook went quiet in India. The company\u2019s managing director there was transferred, and there were murmurs within Facebook that a new person was being hired to head up Free Basics in India. But the bustle and combativeness of the previous year was gone. The company seemed to be turning its attention to China. In March, Zuckerberg was photographed on a jog in Beijing, where he was mocked online for declining to wear a face mask in deference to his hosts, despite the smog. The next day, Zuckerberg \u2013 who has been brushing up on his Mandarin \u2013 had a meeting with China\u2019s propaganda chief, Liu Yunshan. According to official reports in the local media, the Facebook founder vowed he would work with Chinese peers to \u201cbuild a better world in cyberspace\u201d.

Advertisement On this day in 2016, the 26-year-old research scholar at the Hyderabad Central University (HCU) took his own life.

Vemula\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fellowship of Rs 25,000 was suspended for raising \u00e2\u0080\u009cissues under the banner of the Ambedkar Students Association\u00e2\u0080\u009d (ASA). The ABVP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaints against the ASA was taken up by Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya who forwarded them to the then HRD minister Smriti Irani who asked the university administration to look into them.

The demand was made by members of the JAC for Social Justice. The purpose behind this legislation would be to ensure legislative protection for students from marginalised communities in higher educational institutions. Politics over his death Advertisement Vemula\u2019s death shocked not only academia but also galvanised the Opposition against the Narendra Modi government. A number of Opposition leaders, particularly from the Congress, made a beeline to the University of Hyderabad campus to show solidarity and claim that Vemula\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was symptomatic of the discrimination that Dalits were facing under the Modi government. Advertisement The issue quickly devolved into a war of words between political parties, with the BJP accusing the Congress and other parties of misusing a family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grief while Rahul Gandhi alleged that \u00e2\u0080\u0098our universities are being encroached upon.

PTI Updated on : 02 May 2016, 2:36 pm 2 min read Copied Follow Us KOTA: Moved by the tragic case of a 17-year- old IIT aspirant who committed suicide a day after clearing her exam, the Kota district collector has written an emotional letter to parents of over 1.50 lakh students in coaching institutes here, asking them not to force their expectations on the children. The five-page letter by Collector Ravi Kumar Surpur has been dispatched to the coaching institutes in the city and will be forwarded to the parents after translation into Hindi and other regional languages. Referring to suicides by young students, the district collector wrote that for all of them death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through the dilemma of artificially doing what their parents wanted them to do. \"Your solacing words of comfort, asking them to give their best and forget the results could have been the blade of grass\" that would have saved precious lives, he wrote, adding, instead, what they got were threats to perform even better. \"Should parents go the children's immature way? Not necessarily.\" Surpur has made an emotional appeal in the letter, asking parents \"not to force their expectations and dreams on their children\" and \"let them do what they want and are able to do\". Besides, the district administration has also decided to seek feedback on stress level of students in various institutes to check for signs of anxiety among them. The initiative came after the recent suicide by IIT-JEE aspirant Kriti who took the extreme step on April 28 despite having cleared IIT-JEE mains in the result declared a day before her suicide. At least 19 aspirants ended their lives in 2015 while five students have taken the extreme step in 2016. Surpur also mentioned a recent suicide letter by a young girl, written in perfect grammar and in beautiful running handwriting, where she thanked her mother for giving up her career for raising the children. In another suicide note, a girl requested her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes. The district collector also asked the parents and children to look beyond engineering and medicine for their career. Surpur had also written a letter to students and parents in January this year telling them that life is beautiful and clearing an exam is not everything. Meanwhile, the district administration held a meeting with the officials of coaching institutes and hostel owners on Saturday regarding the implementation of its guidelines issued a few months ago for checking stress among the coaching students.

She would die several days later. It would take her daughters eight years to get justice for her murder.","text":"Bulandshahr: India girls who wrote letter with blood get justice Published 29 July 2022 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Sanjay Sharma Image caption, Lawyer Sanjay Sharma said Latika (right) and her sister pursued the case against their own father and finally got justice By Geeta Pandey BBC News, Delhi Six years after an Indian teen wrote a letter with her own blood seeking justice for her mother who was burnt alive, the murderer has been punished. Based on the eyewitness accounts of Latika Bansal - now 21 - and her younger sister, a court sent their father Manoj Bansal to jail for life. The girls told the court that their father used to beat up their mother for \"not giving birth to a son\". Bansal denied the accusations and said his wife had died by suicide. In the order pronounced on Wednesday, the court in Bulandshahr city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh agreed that Bansal was guilty of killing his wife for \"not giving birth to a son\". India's preference for sons is rooted in a widely-held cultural belief that a male child would carry forward the family legacy and look after the parents in their old age, while daughters would cost them dowries and leave them for their matrimonial homes. This belief, campaigners say, is behind the neglect and poor treatment of the girl child and India's dramatically skewed sex ratio - caused by elimination of tens of millions of female foetuses through sex-selective abortions, known as female foeticide. During the trial, the Bansal sisters recounted in court how they had grown up seeing their father and his family often taunt and assault their mother Anu Bansal for giving birth only to daughters. The court also heard that Anu had been forced to undergo six abortions after illegal sex determination tests showed that she was pregnant with a girl child. Does India really have more women than men? The sister said their life changed on the morning of 14 June 2016 when their father - allegedly supported by his family members who deny the charges against them - doused their mother with kerosene and set her on fire. \"At 6:30am, we were woken up by the cries of our mother. We couldn't help her because the door of our room was locked from the outside. We watched her burn,\" the girls said in their testimony in the trial court. Latika said after their calls to the local police and ambulance services were ignored, they called their maternal uncle and grandmother who quickly arrived and took their mother to the hospital. According to doctors who treated her, Anu Bansal had received 80% burns. She died a few days later in hospital. Image source, Sanjay Sharma Image caption, Anu Bansal was murdered by her husband for not giving birth to a son Their case came into the limelight only after the girls - then 15 and 11 - wrote a letter with their own blood to then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, accusing the local police official of changing the murder case to that of suicide. The local police investigator was then suspended for not doing proper investigation and Mr Yadav ordered senior police and administration officials to supervise the case. \"It's taken us six years, one month and 13 days to finally get justice,\" Sanjay Sharma, the lawyer who represented the sisters in court, told the BBC. The girl killed for wearing a pair of jeans \"This is a rare instance of daughters pursuing a case against their own father and finally getting justice,\" he said, adding that over the past six years, the girls appeared in court \"more than 100 times\" and \"never missed a single date\". Mr Sharma added that he did not charge any money from the family as they were financially weak and also because he wanted to bring attention to a social issue. \"This is not just a murder of a woman. This is a crime against society,\" he told me. \"It's not in a woman's hands to decide a child's gender so why should she be tortured and punished?

The death of 24 people in a stampede in Varanasi on Saturday once again highlights the cult-like status enjoyed by self-styled \u2018godmen\u2019 and their hold over their followers even after death. Baba Jai Gurudev supporters crossing the crowded Rajghat Bridge for a meeting in Varanasi on Saturday.(PTI Photo) Those who died in the holy city were followers of Jai Gurudev, a charismatic but controversial religious leader who contested elections, went to jail during the Emergency and even dug for mythical gold in a protected archaeological site near Mathura. That was before he died in 2012 at an unconfirmed age of 116. Since then, his legacy has passed on to the organisation he floated, the Jai Gurudev Dharm Pracharak Adhyatm Sanstha which has been preaching his ideals. Typically clad in white robes and turban, the seer had espoused vegetarianism and morality and claimed \u201cto liberate the soul from the rotation of birth and death\u201d, according to a bio on his website. He is said to have left behind a vast empire worth over Rs 10,000 crore, apart from 250 luxury cars \u2013 all supposedly gifted by his devotees. He also left behind a palatial ashram in Mathura and properties in several cities in northern India. One of his most prominent followers, Ram Vriksh Yadav and a large group had broken away to form a radical organisation and encroached upon a large plot of government land in Mathura. Yadav and more than twenty others were killed in June during clashes with police attempting to evict the group members. Also known as Tulsidas Maharaj, Jai Gurudev was imprisoned for 20 months during a period of political unrest in 1975 and led the Doordarshi political party in the 1980s and 1990s, unsuccessfully campaigning for election to Parliament. The sect is now led by his spiritual heir Pankaj Maharaj, who was scheduled to address the gathering on Saturday at Domari village on the banks of the Ganga. And even as the tragedy unfolded on the Rajghat bridge, people drenched in devotion moved on, chanting \u2018Go vegetarian for the cause of nature\u2019. \u201cI am going to attend the satsang (religious gathering). I have no idea about any incident here,\u201d said Shivpujan Chauhan from Ballia, as he joined a long trail of followers making their way to hear \u2018guruji\u2019 speak.

State GST draft law needs to be approved by state legislatures while the CGST draft law needs to be approved by Parliament. Basic draft of Compensation law was also approved. Compensation law has to be approved by Parliament. The GST Compensation Bill will provide a legal backing to the Centre's accord to compensate the states to the full extent of 100% if their revenue growth rate falls below 14% in the first five years of GST roll out. The base year for calculating revenue of a state has been decided as 2015-16. But the council is yet to produce a solution to the tangled issues of dual control and cross empowerment. GST Council will next meet on Jan 3-4 to discuss dual control which are related to the approval of the integrated GST law needed to fix indirect taxation for inter-state trade. Finance Minister also said that the government is trying its best to implement GST from the 1st of April and that he'll also hold budget consultations with state finance ministers in the January 3-4 meeting. The GST Council has already decided on a 4-tier GST tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cents. Luxury items and demerit goods would be taxed at the highest rate and would also attract a cess to create a Rs 50,000 crore corpus for compensating states for loss of revenue. Indirect tax structure in India is highly complex with hidden costs for trade and industry. The introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 3 August 2016, and the amended bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 8 August 2016.

The identity of two other deceased was not known. With these deaths, the Sunday derailment of the train 19321 has become the deadliest rail accident since August 2, 1999 when 290 persons were killed after two trains carrying a total of 2,500 people collided at Gaisal in Assam.

Kolkata: Industrialist Pawan Ruia has been arrested by the West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) this morning from his residence in the national capital. He is being brought to Kolkata for questioning. Mr Ruia, 57, who is the Chairman of the Ruia Group, had been summoned by the CID in connection with a case registered at the Dum Dum Police station in Kolkata. The complaint was registered by the Indian Railways which had alleging theft stated that goods worth Rs 50 crore belonging to them were kept at the Jessop factory. An FIR had been registered under sections 420, 406 and 409 of the Indian Penal Code. The CID says Mr Ruia is not cooperating with investigators. Jessop & Co operates from a 63 acre premises at Jessore Road in Kolkata. A team from the railways had visited the Jessop premises in Dum Dum earlier this year. Indian Railways is a client of Jessop. The West Bengal Police has also registered an FIR under sections 435, 436 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code after a fire recurring fires at the Jessop premises. In 2003, the Ruia Group led by Pawan Kumar Ruia had acquired Jessop & Co which manufactured railway wagons. In 2014, the factory had shut down indefinitely and in February this year Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that the West Bengal government would take over Ruia Group's Dunlop India and Jessop & Co. Seeking relief for Mr Ruia, the Ruia Group had told the Calcutta High Court that he has nothing to with Jessop and that he is neither the Chairman of Jessop, nor a shareholder. Mr Ruia is often referred to as the 'turnaround tycoon'. But his efforts seem to have failed with Jessop, though the company claims that the Ruia Group did manage to successfully run Jessop from 2003 till 2012, when problems erupted.

{"year":"2019","month":"04","event_desc":"17 April  A major airlines, Jet Airways ceased operations with its last flight from Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport.","text":"Jet Airways temporarily suspends all flights 18 April 2019 Share Save Share Save Taking the last flight of India's stricken Jet Airways Troubled Indian airline Jet Airways has temporarily suspended all its domestic and international flights after failing to find fresh funding. The airline said its last flight would operate on Wednesday as it was not able to pay for fuel and other critical services. Jet Airways said it had no choice but to suspend the flights, but hopes to start flying again. It has $1.2bn (\u00a3900m) debt and has been in talks with lenders for weeks. Jet Airways, which has 123 planes, was once India's biggest private airline, but reports say that just five planes have been in use. In a statement the airline said it had been forced to ground all its flights because \"prolonged and sustained efforts with lenders and authorities did not yield the desired results\". The Indian government had asked state-run banks to step in with a bailout plan for the airline - which employs 23,000 people and was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago. He stepped down as chairman last month. India's aviation boom runs into turbulence Jet Airways fails to secure emergency funding The riches to rags story of India's oldest private airline Pilots, engineers, and ground staff have not been paid for months, and passengers have been left stranded around the world as a result of cancellations. \"Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding,\" the airline said. \"Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going. Consequently, with immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights. The last flight will operate today,\" it added. Community and concern on Jet's last flight Ravinder Singh Robin, BBC Punjabi Jet's last flight before the suspension departed from Amritsar and as the flight took off the brightness of the iconic Golden Temple was visible through the night sky. It was an emotional last journey for the crew and even for the ground staff. \"The sun will rise again,\" the pilot told me before he took charge. He had worked for the airline for 17 years and was hopeful of reprieve. Many people didn't even bother turning up for the flight, mistakenly believing this would be cancelled too but for those who did make it on board there was a palpable sense of community and concern for the staff of Jet Airways. Ground staff prepare for Jet Airways last flight, departing from Amritsar to Mumbai and Delhi. Passengers asked cabin crew what was to happen to their jobs, where they would go from here. There have been no clear answers for Jet staff - and many felt a deal would come through, but worry was nevertheless etched on their faces. Many were asking questions about their onward journeys and felt frustration at the state of India's airline industry, remembering the fate of Kingfisher Airlines. Yet others booked tickets on this particular flight just to make history. Before the flight touched down, the pilot spoke a few optimistic words to the passengers telling them this may be the last flight for now, but he very much hoped they would fly Jet once again. The banks have been seeking a bidder for the airline, which said it would continue to support them in their efforts. Etihad Airways already owns 24% of Jet Airways and is reported to have expressed an interest in taking more control. \"Jet Airways is hopeful that it will be able to bring the joy of flying back to its guests as soon as possible,\" the airline said. Getty Images Naresh Goyal founded Jet more than 25 years ago The carrier operated 600 domestic and 380 international routes, including out of London, Amsterdam and Paris, and had grown rapidly before it started to lose market share after the entry of low-cost airlines like IndiGo & SpiceJet. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted advice to customers, outlining different approaches for seeking refunds depending on how the flight was booked. Allow Twitter content?

The constitution amendment bill will be introduced in parliament tomorrow, the last day of the Winter Session. The central government has cleared a 10 per cent quota in jobs and educational institutions for economically weaker sections, sources told Hindustan Times after a Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The decision comes months before the government\u2019s tenure is to end and the country heads into election mode. Modi government has cleared 10 per cent reservation for economically weaker upper castes(Photo | Hindustan Times) Main opposition party the Congress has called it an \u201celection gimmick\u201d; Dalit leader Ramdas Athawale described the decision \u201ca masterstroke\u201d. The centre is ready with a Constitution amendment bill which will be introduced in parliament tomorrow, the last day of the Winter Session. The bill seeks to amend two constitutional provisions, Articles 15 and 16, which prohibit discrimination on any grounds in jobs and admissions to educational institutions. People who have an annual income less than 8 lakh, own less than 5 acre farm land, have house smaller than 1,000 sq feet in a town or a 100 sq yard house in notified municipal area would qualify for the proposed quotas. The move, a BJP leader hinted, would come in handy to deal with reservation demands from communities that had been demanding that they be counted as other backward classes, or OBCs that have 27 per cent quota for government jobs and admission to educational institutions. It would also help the national coalition led by the BJP to consolidate its the upper caste vote, considered one of the three crucial pillars of the BJP\u2019s support base. The other backward classes (OBC), and the new Dalit sub-castes who shifted loyalties, are considered the other two pillars. The BJP, which had gone to great lengths to neutralise the dilution of the SC\/ST atrocities law last year, had ended up antagonising the upper castes far beyond what it had anticipated. In the recent assembly elections where it lost three states to the Congress, there had been anecdotal evidence that the upper castes had, in some cases, shifted. The Congress saw the Cabinet decision as posturing ahead of the general elections. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the government did not think about this for four years and eight months and brought this just months before the model code of conduct coming into effect. He also asked whether the government has the majority to bring about a Constitution amendment in Parliament. \u201cWhy did you not think of this for four years and eight months? So obviously thought of as election gimmick three months before the model code. You know that you cannot exceed 50 per cent maxima so it is done only to posture that you tried,\u201d he said in a tweet.

Can proposed `Population Regulation Bill, 2019\u2019 solve India\u2019s population growth crisis? The bill suggests that government employees should give an undertaking that they will not procreate more than two children Estimates and statistics of population in India have been showing a slightly positive picture though the country\u2019s population remains a concern Neetu Chandra Sharma Published 15 Jul 2019, 07:17 PM IST ( Photo: Mint ) The proposed `Population Regulation Bill, 2019\u2019, introduced in Rajya Sabha last week that calls for punitive action against people with more than two living children and making them devoid of all government services, may impact the poor in various ways, public health experts have said. The private members bill introduced by the Member of Parliament Rakesh Sinha proposed disqualification from being an elected representative, denial of financial benefits and reduction in benefits under the Public Distribution System (PDS) for people having more than two children. The bill also suggests that government employees should give an undertaking that they will not procreate more than two children. \u201cDisincentives through denial of benefits under anti-poverty schemes such as subsidized food grains through the PDS will impact the poorest and most marginalized sections of the population and worsen their impoverishment,\u201d said Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director of the Population Foundation of India (PFI), calling the Bill \u201cmisguided\u201d and a misreading of India\u2019s demographic trajectory. The Economic Survey of 2018 points out that \u2018son meta preference\u2019 \u2013 the desire to have a male child \u2013 has resulted in 21 million \u201cunwanted girls\u201d in India. \u201cImposing a two child norm will add to the burden on women, by way of sex selective practices and forced sterilisations. This could result in a setback to population stabilisation efforts, as it happened during the emergency period in mid-1970s. The policy makers, MPs and the government should reaffirm India\u2019s commitment towards a rights based approach to family planning. The government should raise budgetary allocations in order to ensure expanded contraceptive choices for delaying and spacing births and better access and quality of health care for young people,\u201d said Muttreja. \u201cThis will not only lead to improved health, but will also visibly improve educational outcomes, raise productivity and workforce participation, and in turn result in increased household incomes and economic growth for the country,\u201d she said. Estimates and statistics of population in India have been showing a slightly positive picture though the country\u2019s population remains a concern for social and economic reasons. While India\u2019s population is projected to overtake China\u2019s in less than a decade as per the UN `World Population Prospects 2019\u2019 report released in June this year, the new projections for India are the lowest since the United Nations began these forecasts. The reason is the sharp decline in India\u2019s population growth rates over 10 years from 2001 to 2011. According to Census 2011, the growth rate of population has declined from 21.5% during 1991-2001 to 17.7% during 2001-2011, across all religious groups. \u201cWe are on course to achieving population stabilisation with a national Total Fertility Rate (TFR \u2013 the total number of children born or likely to be born to a woman in her lifetime) of 2.2, close to the replacement level fertility of 2.1. In addition, the Desired Fertility Rate is 1.8, which indicates that women in India prefer to have no more than two children,\u201d said Muttreja. \u201c24 of the Indian states and union territories have already reached the replacement level TFR of 2.1 by empowering women and providing better education and health care facilities. This has been achieved through the government\u2019s actions based on the National Population Policy (NPP) of 2000, which sought to fulfill the unmet need for contraceptives and services by advocating a small family norm without adopting any coercive measures,\u201d she said. Some public health experts have seen the Bill as positive change that may help in curbing the population but the only section that will be at the receiving end will be the poor. ''In a country like India, population is growing at an ever-increasing rate. So far, we have seen that all the family planning regulations are for common man but nothing has been drafted for the politicians or law-makers,\u201d said Ajoy Khandheria, Founder, Gramin Healthcare, a primary healthcare provider in rural areas.

Published On 27 Oct 2019 27 Oct 2019 The Indian government revoked the special status accorded to Indian-administered Kashmir in its constitution, the most far-reaching political move on the disputed region in nearly 70 years. A presidential decree issued on August 5 revoked Article 370 of India\u2019s constitution that guaranteed special rights to the Muslim-majority state, including the right to its own constitution and autonomy to make laws on all matters except defence, communications and foreign affairs. In the lead-up to the move, India sent thousands of additional troops to the disputed region, imposed a crippling curfew, shut down telecommunications and internet, and arrested political leaders. The move has worsened the already-heightened tensions with neighbouring Pakistan , which downgraded its diplomatic relations with India. India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but rule it in part. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two of their three wars over the disputed territory. A rebellion in Indian-administered Kashmir has been ongoing for 30 years.

Last week, Dar and other JKLF leaders led a march of hundreds across the length of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, culminating in their desire to cross the LoC at Chakothi and march onwards to Srinagar. When Pakistani authorities placed road blocks to stop the protesters, negotiations ensued, with the demonstrators deciding to hold a sit-in until they were allowed to proceed.

At least 300 have been arrested under the Public Safety Act (PSA), which allows for detentions of up to two years without trial.

The transportations are often conducted without warning, and families say they are allowed little contact with detainees once they find them. Proving innocence is difficult even for those with resources given the communications situation in Kashmir and the number of cases.

A curfew has forced residents to mostly stay inside their homes, stepping out only to buy medicines or basic groceries. Officials have repeatedly said that the lockdown will be lifted in phases over the next few days but have not provided a definitive timeline, leaving the entire region in confusion.

Article 370 provided the state with semi-autonomy, which included a separate state constitution, its own flag and control over internal matters except for certain policy areas such as foreign affairs and defense. Shah\u2019s announcement was succeeded by the passage of a law reorganizing the state by downgrading it to a union territory. In the Indian system, state governments retain significant authority over local matters but New Delhi has more of a say in the affairs of a union territory. The remote mountainous region of Ladakh, currently part of Jammu and Kashmir, will also be separated and turned into a standalone union territory. Anger and confusion Claimed by India and Pakistan in its entirety, Kashmir is one of the world\u2019s most dangerous geopolitical flashpoints. In 1947, after India\u2019s independence from British colonial rule, the erstwhile ruler of Jammu and Kashmir was given an option to accede to either Pakistan or India and, in exchange for protection, chose the latter. But special provisions were added to the Indian constitution, under Article 370, to protect the rights of the territory\u2019s residents.

Demanding accountability from New Delhi, protestors have stormed the streets, pelting Indian soldiers and police personnel with stones. Activists who have recently visited the region say its residents are now angry both at what has happened with the scrapping of Article 370, and the way it was done. \u201cThe manner in which it was done means that the Indian government is not willing to make any kind of concession. It will just have its way no matter what and they are prepared to enforce it. That is a big defeat,\u201d said Jean Dreze, an economist who visited the region with a group of activists.

And tens of thousands of cheering Indian Americans chanted \u201cUSA!\u201d and snapped photos. President Donald Trump appeared at a cavernous football stadium on Sunday alongside Narendra Modi, the popular prime minister of India, who attracted a crowd of 50,000 from across the U.S. to what was touted as the largest event in the country for a leader of a foreign nation. \u201cYou have never had a better friend as president than President Donald Trump,\u201d Trump said as the crowd roared with approval. \u201cWe thank you. We love you. I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day.\u201d Trump is hoping to appeal to Indian American voters, a growing political force in the U.S., with his business-friendly agenda \u2014 especially the 2017 tax cuts \u2014 as well as his tough talk on terrorism and his decision to show up at the rally even though the ethnic group has generally backed Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s giving a message to the Indian community that Trump is a big friend of India,\u201d said Rupesh Srivastava, a Michigan businessman and founding member of the Republican Hindu Coalition. \u201cThat message will definitely motivate people.\u201d People look on as President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the \"Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures\" event with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at NRG Stadium, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, in Houston.

Republicans have been trying for years to make inroads with Indian Americans, one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the United States, who register and vote at high rates. The Republican National Committee is holding events for Asian Americans, including voter drives, has appointed a director of Asian Pacific American Engagement and stresses the record low Asian American unemployment rate of 2.1 percent. \u201cThese are your Indian American hotel owners, they\u2019re your Indian American doctors, maybe retired doctors, who frankly like some of the president\u2019s policies, right?\u201d said Ohio state Rep. Niraj Antani, an Indian American Republican. \u201cWe are the most highly educated, highest-earning ethnic group in the country, so when we are talking about pro-growth policies, Republican policies work for them.\u201d Still, more than 80 percent of Indian Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, over Trump in 2016, according to polling by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Trump\u2019s remarks Sunday were far more welcoming than those he gives regularly to other immigrants, primarily Hispanics who crossed the Mexican border illegally. The USA Loves India! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2019 Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is expected to forgo an official Asian American coalition in lieu of those for blacks, women, Hispanics and workers , according to people familiar with the plans \u2014 though a campaign official disputed it. \u201cWe have only officially launched two of what will be an unspecified number of coalitions, so it would be incorrect and premature to suggest we don\u2019t have a certain coalition at this point,\u201d the official said. Some Indian Americans, whose families came to the United States legally to study or work, don\u2019t mind Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration because it\u2019s primarily about illegal immigration, but others are turned off. Trump\u2019s job approval with Indian Americans was only 28 percent in 2018, according to the Asian American Voter Survey, a poll of registered Asian American voters. About 66 percent of respondents disapproved. \u201cIf Republicans believe Donald Trump\u2019s appearance with Prime Minister Modi will move our community towards the president, they\u2019re sadly mistaken,\u201d said North Carolina state Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, an Indian American Democrat. \u201cIn 2020, I believe the Indian American community will overwhelming reject Donald Trump because his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies run completely counter to our community\u2019s story in America.\u201d Trump delighted \u2014 and surprised \u2014 Indian Americans when the White House recently announced that he would join Modi at \u201c Howdy, Modi: Shared Dreams Bright Features \u201d at NRG Stadium, home to the National Football League\u2019s Houston Texans. Modi invited Trump to attend the rally \u2014 in the most diverse city in the nation \u2014 when the two leaders met at the G-7 summit in France in August. \u201cI\u2019m very close to the folks from India,\u201d the president told reporters on Sunday. \u201cI love India, and I have a lot of respect and a great friendship with the prime minister of India, and he said, \u2018Would it be possible to do it?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019ll make it possible.\u2019\u201d Trump may have agreed to attend to appease Modi after a tense few months between the two leaders, according to some observers of U.S.-India relations. Trump kicked India out of a trade preference program for developing countries in March, and then infuriated Indians again in July by insisting that Modi asked him to mediate in the longstanding dispute between India and Pakistan over the region of Kashmir. But the two leaders now hope to finalize a limited trade deal later this week when they meet for a second time, on Tuesday during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Trump may also be fascinated by the popularity of Modi, who \u2014 like the president \u2014 rode to office on a wave of populist fury and launched a \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign. Trump previously commented on the number of Modi\u2019s Twitter followers, and insinuated last week that the number of the Houston rally\u2019s attendees grew because of him. \u201cHe\u2019s got a big crowd coming, and I guess the crowd just got a lot bigger because \u2026 he asked, would I go, and I will go,\u201d he told reporters last week. Houston\u2019s Indian American community, consisting of roughly 150,000 people, lobbied Modi to visit after he announced that he would visit the U.S. All 50,000 tickets for the event were claimed in three weeks \u2014 before Trump announced he would attend, according to event organizers. Another 5,000 remained on a waiting list. It took place in a state that long served as a Republican stronghold but where Democrats are making a play after their party saw significant gains in the 2018 midterm elections and following a series of GOP congressional retirements. The rally, which was Trump\u2019s largest yet and was broadcast to millions of people on U.S. and Indian TV, included a cultural program, in addition to the speeches by Trump and Modi. Thousands of watch parties were organized across the U.S. On the route to the stadium, protesters lined the streets with Kashmir flags and cutouts of Modi. Most were there to rally against the prime minister, whom they blame for ethnic violence and human rights abuses. Trump\u2019s speech touched on many of the same topics that he addresses at his traditional campaign rallies, including the economy and job creation, but on Sunday he tied it back to his different audience, calling Indian Americans \u201cthriving,\u201d \u201cprosperous\u201d and \u201chard-working.\u201d He received a standing ovation. \u201cYou enrich our culture. You uphold our values. You uplift our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are proud to be Americans and we are truly proud to have you as Americans.\u201d A special gesture by @POTUS , signifying the special friendship between India and USA! Delighted that President @realDonaldTrump will join the community programme in Houston on the 22nd. Looking forward to joining the Indian origin community in welcoming him at the programme. \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 16, 2019 After Trump and Modi spoke, the president unexpectedly joined the prime minister for a lap around the stadium with hands clasped together. The audience applauded while the crowd on the ground floor pushed into the barricades to snap photos. The first time he ran for office, Trump promised to work with Indian Americans. He spoke to 10,000 Hindus waving \u201cTrump for Hindu Americans\u201d signs at a Bollywood-themed event in Edison, N.J., home to a thriving Indian community . \u201cI am a big fan of Hindu, and I am a big fan of India,\u201d Trump said awkwardly.

In 2016, about 1.2 million Indian American were registered to vote, according to Asian American and Pacific Islanders Data . Estimates put Indian American voter registration at 1.4 million in 2020.

What happens to the clients? Updated - December 08, 2019 02:13 pm IST Ashish Rukhaiyar Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT The logo of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is pictured on the premises of its headquarters in Mumbai, India March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Shailesh Andrade - RTS10YF8 The story so far: On November 22, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) passed an ex parte ad interim order against Karvy Stock Broking, a Hyderabad-based firm, prohibiting it from taking new clients in respect of its stock broking activities. In view of the recent developments in the securities market, the National Stock Exchange issued an 11-point advisory to investors on how to keep stocks safe. How many customers does Karvy have? Karvy Stock Broking has more than a million retail broking customers and executes over two lakh transactions almost daily on behalf of its clients. The broking firm has been in the news for the last few weeks as some of its clients complained of delayed payouts. Typically, a person should get the money in his account on the third day of the transaction but some clients alleged that they did not receive the money after more than a week of executing the trades. Why was the payout delayed? The broking firm had initially said the delay in payouts was on account of technical issues, but according to a preliminary probe by SEBI and the NSE, the late transfer was on account of alleged misuse of client securities. According to the SEBI order issued on November 22, the broking firm credited funds generated by pledging client securities into its own account. SEBI has barred Karvy Stock Broking from signing new clients. Further, an amount of \u20b91,096 crore was transferred from the broking outfit to its group entity Karvy Realty between April 2016 and October 2019. Incidentally, appeals filed at the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) further reveal that the broking firm raised funds from entities such as  Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank by pledging client securities. For instance, Karvy Stock Broking owes more than \u20b9300 crore to Bajaj Finance. As per the lenders, Karvy Stock Broking had even given an undertaking that the securities that were being pledged were its own and not of the clients. What happens to the affected clients? Most of the  affected clients have got their shares. While it is estimated that a total of around 95,000 clients of Karvy Stock Broking have been affected, the depository has already transferred the securities of nearly 83,000 clients from the broking firm\u2019s account to the respective client accounts. The rest of the clients will have to wait since SAT has put a stay on any further transfer of securities from Karvy\u2019s account to client accounts. This directive was issued based on the appeals filed by the lender entities, Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, wherein the lenders argued that since these securities were pledged with them, they have a right on the shares. SAT has told SEBI to give the lenders an opportunity for a hearing and then pass an order by December 10. What is the current status? The Bombay Stock Exchange and the NSE have suspended the broking membership of Karvy. The NSE is conducting a forensic audit to ascertain further details regarding alleged misuse of client securities. Karvy Stock Broking filed an appeal at SAT to challenge its suspension, but the appeal was dismissed with Karvy being directed to file an appeal with the NSE. The coming week would see the regulator decide on the appeal filed by the lenders from whom Karvy Stock Broking raised funds by pledging client securities. The capital market watchdog will take further action against Karvy Stock Broking as well since the earlier order was only an ex parte interim order. What is the way out for investors? While clients of Karvy Stock Broking have obvious reasons to be worried, the SEBI order has clearly stated that the broking firm will not be able to further misuse clients\u2019 securities even if it has the power of attorney as the depositories have been given clear instructions in this regard. More importantly, most of the affected clients have already got their securities in their respective accounts. Clients of Karvy Stock Broking, however, should ensure that all their holdings are being reflected in their demat accounts, say market experts. This can be easily done by logging into the demat account and checking the portfolio. If an investor is yet to receive the payout for a trade executed more than 3-4 days back, it is better to approach the stock exchanges \u2014 the Bombay Stock Exchange  or NSE \u2014 as they have an in-house dedicated investor grievance redressal mechanism to deal with such cases. Also, since the broking licence of Karvy Stock Broking has been suspended, its clients will have to switch the account to another broking firm, which can be done easily.

The 21-year-old girl from Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar city has become the first Indian to win the Miss Deaf World 2019 crown. Helping this young woman achieve this feat was Paralympian Deepa Malik and her daughter, Devika, co-founders of the Wheeling Happiness Foundation.

The five supreme court judges based their unanimous and historic judgment on Hindus\u2019 claim that the site is the birthplace of the god Ram. They ruled that a mosque that had stood on the site since the 16th century, and was the basis of the Muslim claim to Ayodhya, was \u201cnot built on vacant land\u201d and that the Hindu belief could not be disputed. Ayodhya ruling: Hindus win case over site disputed by Muslims Read more The judges declared that a separate \u201cprominent\u201d five-acre piece of land would be allocated to the Muslim community to build a mosque near the contested site. The ruling, just six months after his landslide election win, is another huge victory for India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi , and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, which have made the restoration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya a focal point of their Hindu nationalist agenda. The supreme court judges said plans for the temple would be drawn up within the next three months. \u201cIt is a historic judgment,\u201d said Varun Kumar Sinha, a lawyer for Hindu Mahasabha, a rightwing party that advocated for the rebuilding of the Ram temple at Ayodhya. \u201cWith this judgment, the supreme court has given the message of unity in diversity.\u201d The head of the Hindu nationalist RSS organisation, Mohan Bhagwat, echoed Sinha\u2019s comments and said his group welcomed the decision. \u201cThis case was going on for decades and it reached the right conclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should not be seen as a win or a loss.\u201d Zafaryab Jilani, the lawyer for the Muslim claimants, the Sunni Waqf Board, challenged the decision and said the board would meet later to decide whether to file an appeal. \u201cWe respect the supreme court, we respect the judgment, but we are not satisfied with this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of contradictions within the judgment. Five acres has no value.\u201d Conflict over Ayodhya has been raging between India\u2019s Muslims and Hindus for more than 150 years. Muslims say it is a historical place of worship, but Hindus say the mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Babur, was on the site of an older temple honouring Ram\u2019s birthplace. The country was put on high security alert following the verdict for fear of religious violence and rioting. Thousands of police and paramilitary troops were dispatched to the state of Uttar Pradesh and around 500 people arrested in the days before. Protests and parties were also banned in Ayodhya. View image in fullscreen A police officer checks identity papers at a security barricade in Ayodhya. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui\/Reuters The supreme court judges said their ruling was conditional on the \u201cmaintenance of peace and order and tranquility\u201d. The city was quiet in the immediate aftermath of the verdict. All non-residents were obliged to leave the city on Friday night and no one was allowed to leave their house without their identity card. A few firecrackers were set off, but the heavy police presence kept celebrations and protests muted. Rajatram Maurya, a tailor in the city who used to grow flowers on the temple land before it was claimed by the government, had mixed feelings to the ruling. \u201cThe verdict is good for all, but I lost my land in this and the compensation I got from the government was barely anything \u2026 But I am glad there is peace in Ayodhya.\u201d Modi said on Twitter that the judgement \u201chighlights that any dispute can be amicably solved in the spirit of due process of law. It reaffirms the independence, transparency and farsightedness of our judiciary. It clearly illustrates everybody is equal before the law.\u201d BJP members led a march to Ayodhya in December 1992, during which hundreds of thousands of people descended onto the Babri mosque and reduced it to rubble with hammers and axes. More than 2,000 people were killed in the rioting and violence that ensued, and some BJP members are still facing trial for their role in the violence. India: Hindus demand building of temple on disputed Ayodhya site Read more This destruction of the mosque has been cited as a pivotal moment in the failure of secularism and religious inclusivity in India, fracturing the country down religious lines that have been politically exploited ever since. The sensitive decision over whether to rebuild a place of Muslim or Hindu worship on the site was dragged out over 27 years. A 2010 court ruling divided the land between Muslims and Hindus, but was rejected by both sides. The case was taken to the supreme court in August. Since Modi and the BJP took power in 2014, the rebuilding of a Ram temple at Ayodhya has been at the forefront of their Hindutva agenda, which has pushed India away from its secular roots and toward a strongly Hindu identity. This has led to growing hostility and violence toward the country\u2019s Muslims, who number 200 million. Muslim history has been removed from school textbooks and there has been an increase in reports of vigilante Hindu mobs murdering Muslims suspected of killing cows, which are sacred in Hinduism . In June, a Hindu mob tied a Muslim man to a lamp and lynched him to cries of \u201chail Lord Ram\u201d. The Modi government\u2019s actions in Kashmir in August, stripping the state of its long-held semi-autonomy, was also seen as directly targeting its majority-Muslim community.

A three-day session of the Assembly has been convened from January 6 to 8 during which the MLAs-elect will be administered oath of office and the new Speaker will also be finalised. The Pathalgadi movement was a vociferous campaign by people who had asserted that no project or programme can be implemented without the consent of the gram sabha. Brutal police force The Raghubar Das government had crushed the movement of self-rule using brutal police power. The movement had then spread to four districts of Jharkhand in 2017. Huge stone plaques, known locally as Pathalgadi, were put up at the entrance of villages.

Similarly, the JMM had fought the Assembly elections protesting against controversial amendment to CNT and SPT Acts. Widespread protests Although the BJP government had subsequently withdrawn its move to amend the Acts under public pressure, widespread protests had taken place across Jharkhand. Changes in section 21 of the CNT Act and section 13 of the SPT Act would have enabled the government to allow use of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. Civil society groups and tribal organisations had vehemently opposed it.

The Taj Mahal is India\u2019s single most visited tourist attraction, with an estimated eight million people visiting the UNESCO World Heritage site annually. Located in Agra in northern India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, about 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of New Delhi, it is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World , alongside sights like Machu Picchu and the Great Wall of China. Two mobile air purifier vans have been stationed at the Taj Mahal by \u201ca private firm,\u201d according to authorities in Uttar Pradesh. Though the city has several of these vans at their disposal, officials had to choose where and how to utilize them. Officials were vague on exactly how the vans work and whether they were on short or long-term loan. \u201cThis is on a trial basis for 10 days but we are trying to get [the private firm] to continue it for some more time,\u201d Bhuvan Prakash Yadav, a representative from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) told CNN. Yadav did not identify the private firm who made the air purifier vans, but ads for the telecom company Vodafone appear on the sides of some of them. He also said that each van is able to purify 1.5 million cubic meters (53 million cubic feet) of air in eight hours. However, this cannot be verified as the vans lack sensors, so it\u2019s unclear if the vans have any effect beyond their cosmetic and PR purposes.

Even if you have the expertise, you are not utilizing it. Or perhaps you don\u2019t care,\u201d a judge reportedly said at the time. Much of the damage cited in the court case was the result of air pollution and contamination of the Yamuna River, which flows behind the Taj. To try and reduce both human and vehicle traffic, crowd control measures have been put in place at the Taj in recent years, including a visitor time limit and hiked ticket prices for both Indian and non-Indian guests. Air pollution forces New Delhi to divert flights Air pollution is an ongoing public health issue throughout India, and unlikely to alleviate any time soon. The country is home to 22 of the 30 most polluted cities on the planet, with India\u2019s capital ranking number one. This week, New Delhi\u2019s air pollution levels reached an all-time high of some 20% more than the World Health Organization\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d level. Smog was so bad on November 3 that some planes were unable to land at the city\u2019s international airport.

What happens to the clients? Updated - December 08, 2019 02:13 pm IST Ashish Rukhaiyar Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT The logo of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is pictured on the premises of its headquarters in Mumbai, India March 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Shailesh Andrade - RTS10YF8 The story so far: On November 22, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) passed an ex parte ad interim order against Karvy Stock Broking, a Hyderabad-based firm, prohibiting it from taking new clients in respect of its stock broking activities. In view of the recent developments in the securities market, the National Stock Exchange issued an 11-point advisory to investors on how to keep stocks safe. How many customers does Karvy have? Karvy Stock Broking has more than a million retail broking customers and executes over two lakh transactions almost daily on behalf of its clients. The broking firm has been in the news for the last few weeks as some of its clients complained of delayed payouts. Typically, a person should get the money in his account on the third day of the transaction but some clients alleged that they did not receive the money after more than a week of executing the trades. Why was the payout delayed? The broking firm had initially said the delay in payouts was on account of technical issues, but according to a preliminary probe by SEBI and the NSE, the late transfer was on account of alleged misuse of client securities. According to the SEBI order issued on November 22, the broking firm credited funds generated by pledging client securities into its own account. SEBI has barred Karvy Stock Broking from signing new clients. Further, an amount of \u20b91,096 crore was transferred from the broking outfit to its group entity Karvy Realty between April 2016 and October 2019. Incidentally, appeals filed at the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) further reveal that the broking firm raised funds from entities such as  Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank by pledging client securities. For instance, Karvy Stock Broking owes more than \u20b9300 crore to Bajaj Finance. As per the lenders, Karvy Stock Broking had even given an undertaking that the securities that were being pledged were its own and not of the clients. What happens to the affected clients? Most of the  affected clients have got their shares. While it is estimated that a total of around 95,000 clients of Karvy Stock Broking have been affected, the depository has already transferred the securities of nearly 83,000 clients from the broking firm\u2019s account to the respective client accounts. The rest of the clients will have to wait since SAT has put a stay on any further transfer of securities from Karvy\u2019s account to client accounts. This directive was issued based on the appeals filed by the lender entities, Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, wherein the lenders argued that since these securities were pledged with them, they have a right on the shares. SAT has told SEBI to give the lenders an opportunity for a hearing and then pass an order by December 10. What is the current status? The Bombay Stock Exchange and the NSE have suspended the broking membership of Karvy. The NSE is conducting a forensic audit to ascertain further details regarding alleged misuse of client securities. Karvy Stock Broking filed an appeal at SAT to challenge its suspension, but the appeal was dismissed with Karvy being directed to file an appeal with the NSE. The coming week would see the regulator decide on the appeal filed by the lenders from whom Karvy Stock Broking raised funds by pledging client securities. The capital market watchdog will take further action against Karvy Stock Broking as well since the earlier order was only an ex parte interim order. What is the way out for investors? While clients of Karvy Stock Broking have obvious reasons to be worried, the SEBI order has clearly stated that the broking firm will not be able to further misuse clients\u2019 securities even if it has the power of attorney as the depositories have been given clear instructions in this regard. More importantly, most of the affected clients have already got their securities in their respective accounts. Clients of Karvy Stock Broking, however, should ensure that all their holdings are being reflected in their demat accounts, say market experts. This can be easily done by logging into the demat account and checking the portfolio. If an investor is yet to receive the payout for a trade executed more than 3-4 days back, it is better to approach the stock exchanges \u2014 the Bombay Stock Exchange  or NSE \u2014 as they have an in-house dedicated investor grievance redressal mechanism to deal with such cases. Also, since the broking licence of Karvy Stock Broking has been suspended, its clients will have to switch the account to another broking firm, which can be done easily.

While the investigation continues, Anjali's relatives are struggling to come to terms with what has happened. The responsible daughter Anjali belonged to the Dalit (formerly untouchable) community, which is at the bottom of a harsh, unforgiving caste hierarchy in India. She lived in a small house, with one room and a kitchen, in north-west Delhi's Mangolpuri area. She was the second of six siblings and had dropped out of school as a teenager to support her family. Rekha, whose husband had died eight years ago, worked as a low-paid assistant in a school but lost her job during the Covid lockdown. That was around the time she developed chronic kidney disease which made it impossible for her to work. \"Anjali then took on all the responsibility for the family,\" her mother says. Getty Images Anjali lived in a small house in north-west Delhi She learnt how to do make-up at a local beauty parlour and soon began helping neighbours who wanted to dress up for weddings and other functions. She would also earn some money by working at weddings, where she was usually part of a group of women who welcomed guests. Two of her sisters, including a younger sibling, were married. But Anjali said she would settle down after her younger brothers, who are studying at a local government school, finished their education. \"She said she would only marry if her partner agreed to stay with us so she could continue taking care of us,\" Rekha says. Though life was hard, Anjali remained cheerful and optimistic. \"She was always smiling. She loved making Reels and videos, and dressing up,\" her mother says. Anjali was also well-known in her neighbourhood - Rekha says her daughter's complaints to local politicians had ensured that the potholes on their street were fixed. Around the time of her death, she had been trying to get a proper drain built in the area. \"Our neighbours even asked her to contest municipal elections, and she promised them she would do so in the future,\" Rekha says. Five years ago, Anjali took out a loan and bought a scooter to help her travel around. She was close to paying it off when she died - while riding the same scooter.

The results show that voters in these northeastern States largely rejected calls for a change. The polls in each of the three States were seen as a litmus test for the BJP with the 2024 Lok Sabha election just a year away. The BJP and its regional ally, the Indigenous People\u2019s Front of Tripura, won 33 seats \u2014 11 fewer than in 2018 but two more than the majority mark. The TIPRA Motha, which banked primarily on the \u2018Tiprasa\u2019 (tribal) people who dominate 20 of the 60 Assembly seats, lived up to the expectations by winning 13 of the 42 seats it contested. The outcome was a setback for the Left Front, which saw its seat count dip to 11 from 16 five years ago. But the Congress gained from a seat-sharing agreement with the Left Front, winning three of the 13 seats it contested. The grand old party drew a blank in 2018.

{"year":"2023","month":"04","event_desc":"1 April  A new income tax law comes into effect. It is a significant change on the old 1961 statute, and contains a controversial \"angel tax\" provision seeking to capture some of the income entering the country from foreign investors funding India's start-ups.","text":"Aditya Singh Chandel and Suhail Bansal of AZB & Partners look at the proposal to extend the applicability of the Indian angel tax to nonresident investors and consider what repercussions this may have for Indian startups and foreign investment. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cangel tax\u00e2\u0080\u009d provided for under Section 56(2) (viib) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, has, right from its introduction in 2013, evoked a mixed response and been the subject of much debate in recent years. The provision was introduced with an objective of preventing tax evasion and was one of the specific anti-avoidance rules made effective before a statutory general anti-avoidance rule came into effect from April 1, 2017. However, it has since been criticized for introducing uncertainty and impacting funding of Indian startups, as it is essentially seen as an undesirable tax on capital. The provision requires Indian private companies to pay tax on the consideration received for issue of shares which is in excess of the fair market value of such shares. Until now, Indian private companies had to pay tax under Section 56(2)(viib) only where shares were issued at a premium to Indian resident investors. In accordance with the relevant provisions, fair market value for equity shares at the option of the taxpayer can be decided by prescribed valuation methods\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on net asset value, or by the discounted cash flow method. The Finance Bill, 2023, introduced by the Indian finance minister, has now proposed an amendment to Section 56(2)(viib) whereby Indian private companies will have to pay tax in cases of shares issued at a premium even to nonresident investors. This means that investments made by nonresident investors can be subject to the angel tax if they are undertaken at a value above the fair market value. This amendment is proposed to be effective from April 1. While certain exemptions from angel tax were provided\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, to registered Indian startups subject to certain conditions, and to funds raised by Indian alternative investment funds\u00e2\u0080\u0094the proposed applicability of angel tax to both domestic and foreign investment is likely to have a significant impact on Indian private companies looking to raise funds for market growth and expansion. Given that foreign investment is an important source of funding for Indian startups, the applicability of angel tax may have a negative impact. Key Concerns Tax Planning Heightened tax regulation and differing tax treatment of investment routes and instruments has an impact on taxpayers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior and can encourage aggressive tax planning if there exists an arbitrage. The applicability of angel tax to foreign investment may encourage such behavior, which from a policy perspective may not be desirable. As investments made by Indian alternative investment funds aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subject to angel tax, many nonresident investors may seek to invest through such Indian funds, or may favor instruments other than equity shares to which this provision doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply, or even if it applies, which provide more flexibility in terms of valuation methodology. Further, this also could make debt instruments attractive for a nonresident investor, which from an overall tax base erosion perspective may not be aligned with tax policy. Externalization The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cexternalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Indian context generally means transfer of ownership of an Indian company to an offshore holding company based in a foreign jurisdiction which may be considered as business- or tax-friendly. The proposed applicability of angel tax to foreign investments could lead to an increased number of Indian private companies and startups flipping their ownership to holding companies established in more favorable jurisdictions that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impose tax on capital receipts. Transfer Pricing The transfer pricing regulations in India (and globally) require that international transactions between related entities\/associated entities should be undertaken at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length, in order to prevent profit shifting and base erosion of income and taxes. Transfer pricing regulations shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be applicable to capital account transactions or fund raises: However, in cases where the angel tax as contemplated under Section 56(2)(viib) becomes applicable in case of an offshore entity subscribing to shares of its Indian associated entity at a premium, this would mean that the amount of premium received by the Indian company would be taxable as \u00e2\u0080\u009cincome from other sources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d leading to an inference that such related party transaction would also be subject to the Indian transfer pricing regulations. If the proposed amendment to Section 56(2)(viib) is implemented, it may result in additional transfer pricing compliance requirements for Indian private companies raising capital from their offshore associated enterprises, and an increased risk of disputes with the tax authorities due to a lack of clarity as to what would constitute an arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length price in such a scenario. Increased Scrutiny It is likely that all fund raises would be subject to more scrutiny by the Indian tax authorities, especially startups with high valuations. As valuation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an exact science, the risk of having a difference of opinion with regard to valuation of a business can never be ruled out. In the past there have been instances where the Indian tax authorities have challenged tax valuations. These provisions would also give a tax officer the ability to step into the shoes of an investor and question commercial decisions. Availability of GAAR In the Indian context, a statutory general anti-avoidance rule\u00e2\u0080\u0094GAAR\u00e2\u0080\u0094came into effect from April 1, 2017. The GAAR may be invoked by the tax department (subject to certain rules and guidelines) if they hold an arrangement to be an impermissible avoidance arrangement, which means an arrangement whose main purpose is to obtain a tax benefit. In a case where a GAAR is invoked, the tax officer has the discretion to determine the appropriate consequences. This may include re-characterization of a transaction. A GAAR provides the tax officers with the power to scrutinize transactions which may include fund raises by Indian private companies at high premiums. As the GAAR has inbuilt safeguards for a taxpayer, the relevance of having a parallel specific anti-avoidance rule like angel tax with lower safeguards, may need to be re-evaluated. In Conclusion The proposal to include nonresident investors within the ambit of angel tax is likely to cause a re-think by various stakeholders around ways to raise capital. There is a genuine concern among startups and foreign investors around this proposal, since in certain circumstances it seems to limit their flexibility to value a business other than through the prescribed valuation methods. This proposal effectively fixes a ceiling price for issuance of equity shares to nonresident investors, when there could be other valuation methods or commercial considerations that the parties may want to use to value a business. In case of non-equity shares it may heighten the risk of scrutiny. Any proposal that aims to be prescriptive about the price in effect interferes with commercial decision making. It is expected that the Indian government will consider some of these concerns to ensure that the provision is applied fairly and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unduly burden genuine investments in startups made by nonresident investors. Given that there have been significant developments since this provision was introduced in 2013, with the GAAR being operationalized along with better information collection and sharing, and availability of technology including AI for selecting high risk transactions for scrutiny, there are good arguments to abolish the entire angel tax regime. As an interim measure, the government may introduce relaxations from angel tax for specific investment into startups and other Indian private companies by nonresident investors.

Rahul Gandhi disqualified by Parliament after conviction in \u2019Modi surname\u2019 case Parliament disqualifies Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi after Conviction Livemint Updated 24 Mar 2023, 03:54 PM IST New Delhi: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi arrives at Parliament House complex during Budget Session, in New Delhi, Friday, March 24, 2023. (PTI Photo\/Kamal Singh)(PTI03_24_2023_000042A) ( PTI ) Parliament has disqualified Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi as a lawmaker after a lower court found him guilty of defamation and sentenced him to two years in prison, as per a parliament notice that was released on Friday. Gandhi \"stands disqualified from the membership of Lok Sabha\", parliament said, referring to the lower house of parliament. His disqualification as Wayanad MP is effective from March 23, the day of his conviction, the secretariat said in its notification. Congress to fight the disqualification Putting out the notice, Shashi Tharoor tweeted, I\u2019m stunned by this action and by its rapidity, within 24 hours of the court verdict and while an appeal was known to be in process. This is politics with the gloves off and it bodes ill for our democracy. Meanwhile, Congress president said, they (BJP) tried all ways to disqualify him. They don't want to keep those who are speaking the truth but we will continue to speak the truth. We'll continue to demand JPC, If needed we'll go to jail to save democracy Reacting to the disqualification, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, We will fight this battle both legally and politically. We are not going to be afraid or silent. Instead of the JPC, Rahul Gandhi has been disqualified in the Adani scam related to the Prime Minister. Indian Democracy Om Shanti. Gandhi, 52, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, was convicted on Thursday for a 2019 speech in which he referred to thieves as having the surname Modi. He had commented, \"how come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname\" during an election rally in Karnataka. A court in Surat sentenced Rahul Gandhi to two years in jail in a defamation case on Thursday. However, he was granted bail immediately and the sentence was suspended for a month. Congress members held protests in some parts of the country on Friday against Gandhi's conviction and two-year-old jail sentence. They have described the judgment as politically motivated and blamed the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). What experts had said? Earlier, several experts had cited that Gandhi will not be disqualified as a member of parliament if the appellate court suspends the conviction and two-year jail term awarded to him by a Surat court. They had cited Lily Thomas and the Lok Prahari case while justifying Rahul Gandhi's defence. Constitutional law expert Rakesh Dwivedi said the suspension of sentence and stay of conviction were necessary to escape disqualification as a lawmaker under the Representation of the People (RP) Act. \"The appellate court can suspend the conviction and the sentence and grant him bail. In that case there will be no disqualification,\" he said, adding \"However the politicians must choose their words carefully to avoid getting entangled with law.\" Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

A \u201cfiring incident\u201d has killed four army personnel at a military station in the Indian border state of Punjab, the army said, adding that a search operation was continuing. An unknown number of shooters were still at large at the base in Bathinda city, a defence source told Reuters news agency on Wednesday, declining to be named, citing the sensitivity of the matter. Four soldiers died from gunshot injuries sustained during the shootings, which took place in the early hours of Wednesday morning, an army statement said. The statement did not mention the circumstances or other details about who was responsible. The incident was \u201cnot a terror attack\u201d, and took place in a canteen, a senior police official in Punjab, S P S Parmar, told Reuters. The base was sealed off and a joint investigation with the local police was under way, the army statement said, adding that no other injuries and damage to property were reported. \u201cAll aspects including the possible case of involvement of an (assault) rifle along with 28 rounds reported missing two days back are being ascertained,\u201d the army said.

The military station, located about 280km (175 miles) north of capital New Delhi, houses mostly families of soldiers and is a residential army base. Indian media reports quoted state police officers as saying that the incident in the army camp bordering Pakistan did not appear to be a \u201cterror\u201d attack. The shooting took place as the state was on a high security alert a day ahead of Baisakhi, a large Sikh and Hindu festival marking the start of the harvesting season. Punjab has also been on the edge since last month when authorities launched a manhunt for firebrand Sikh separatist preacher Amritpal Singh. Singh has in recent months rallied a huge following by demanding the creation of Khalistan, a separate Sikh homeland, the struggle for which caused deadly violence in Punjab in the 1980s and 1990s. He remains at large , despite a huge dragnet involving thousands of police officers and a statewide internet shutdown that lasted for several days.

He died in a road accident in February last year. Month-long manhunt for Amritpal On March 18, the Punjab Police launched a crackdown against Amritpal and members of his outfit. The Punjab Police had invoked the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against the Khalistan sympathizer. The action came almost over three weeks after Amritpal\u2019s supporters stormed Ajnala police station in Amritsar on February 23, demanding the release of one of his aides, Lovepreet Toofan .\u00a0The protesters carried a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, as a shield.

Sleeper cells keep Punjab awake Amritpal has been facing cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) regarding spreading disharmony among classes, attempt to murder, attack on police personnel and creating obstructions in the lawful discharge of duty by public servants. He had been on the run for over more than a month, after he gave the police the slip on March 18 when his cavalcade was intercepted in Jalandhar district. The 30-year-old is booked in at least a half dozen criminal cases.

REUTERS\/Mukesh Gupta\/File photo\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MUMBAI, May 19 (Reuters) - India will start withdrawing its highest value currency notes from circulation, the central bank said on Friday, in a move that economists said could boost bank deposits at a time of high credit growth. The withdrawal of 2,000-rupee ($24.5) notes - which the finance ministry's top official, T.V Somanathan, said would not cause disruption \"either in normal life or in the economy\" - also comes ahead of elections in four large states at the end of the year and a national ballot in spring 2024. Sign up here. Most of India's political parties are believed to hoard cash in high denomination bills to fund election campaign expenses to get around tough spending limits imposed by the Election Commission. Announcing the withdrawal, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said evidence showed the denomination was not being commonly used for transactions. The notes will remain legal tender, it added, but people will be asked to deposit and exchange them for smaller denominations by Sept. 30. \"The stock of banknotes in other denominations continues to be adequate to meet the currency requirement of the public,\" the RBI added in a statement. The 2,000 rupee note was introduced in 2016 after the Narendra Modi-led government abruptly withdrew 500 and 1000 rupee denominations in an effort to remove forgeries from circulation. There is little evidence that plan succeeded, but the move did create a systemic shortage of cash by taking away 86% of the economy's currency in circulation by value overnight. The government began issuing new 500 rupee notes days later, and added the 2,000 to replenish currency in circulation at a faster pace. However, since then, the central bank has focused on printing notes of 500 rupees and below and has printed no new 2,000-rupee notes in the last four years. Pronab Sen, economist and former chief statistician of India, called the withdrawal of the higher-value note \"a sensible form of demonetisation.\" Karthik Srinivasan, Senior Vice President Financial Sector Ratings at ICRA, said banks' deposit accretion rates \"could improve marginally in the near term\". \"This will ease the pressure on deposit rate hikes and could also result in moderation in short-term interest rates,\" he added. Indian banks have been reporting double-digit credit growth in recent months, notwithstanding 250 basis points of RBI rate since last May. Banks are raising deposits at a faster pace to meet the growing demand and tightening liquidity.

The accident took place at 1.35 a.m. in Pimpalkuta village. The driver, who lost control of the wheel, first hit an iron pole. The bus then grazed past the side wall of a bridge, hit a median, overturned and caught fire, Buldhana Superintendent of Police Sunil Kadasne told The Hindu . Bus involved in Maharashtra's Samruddhi Expressway accident was less than four years old: official A total of 33 passengers were in the bus operated by Vidharbha Travels, which was on its way from Nagpur to Pune.

A case has been registered against the driver and he was taken into custody.

India\u2019s federal police have arrested three railway employees in connection with a train disaster last month that killed 292 people. Two of those arrested are engineers while the third worked as a technician for the railways, a statement from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said on Friday. The CBI launched an investigation after registering a case of criminal negligence following the June 2 crash, which renewed questions about rail safety in India. The accident in the Balasore district in the eastern state of Odisha occurred when a passenger train hit a freight train loaded with iron ore. The passenger train derailed and struck another passenger train passing in the opposite direction. The two passenger trains were carrying more than 2,000 passengers. The rail disaster, one of the worst in India\u2019s history, also injured about 1,000 people. In a report seen by the Reuters news agency, investigators with the Commission of Railway Safety said the first collision occurred due to modifications made to the signalling circuit to fix frequent problems at a nearby rail-road barrier. Local railway staff did not have a standard circuit diagram, which led to a faulty connection in the signalling system when they tried to take the boom-barrier circuit offline for repair, it said. The malfunctioning system directed the passenger train into the path of the freight train, it said. Indian Railways, the world\u2019s fourth-largest rail network, runs 14,000 trains daily with 8,000 locomotives over a system of tracks about 64,000km (40,000 miles) long. The network carries more than 21 million passengers each day, according to official figures, and it is under enormous pressure in a country that has recently become the world\u2019s most populous with more than 1.4 billion people. In 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people. Most such accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signalling equipment.

The deaths happened in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and eastern Bihar where authorities warned residents over 60 and others suffering various maladies to stay indoors during the daytime. All the fatalities in Uttar Pradesh, totaling 54, were reported in Ballia district, some 300 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Lucknow, the state capital. Authorities found out most of those who passed away were over 60 years old and had preexisting health conditions, which may have been exacerbated by the intense heat. S. K. Yadav, a medical officer in Ballia, said in the past three days, some 300 patients were admitted to the district hospital for various ailments aggravated by heat. Due to the gravity of the situation, authorities canceled leave applications of medical personnel in Ballia and provided additional hospital beds in the emergency ward to accommodate the influx of patients. Officials said most of the admitted patients are aged 60 and above, exhibiting symptoms of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulties and heart-related issues.

Pathak, a resident of Ballia who lost his father on Saturday, said that he witnessed an increased flow of patients at the hospital\u2019s emergency ward while attending to his father. \u201cThis has never happened in Ballia. I have never seen people dying because of the heat in such large numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople fear venturing out. The roads and markets are largely deserted.\u201d Ballia, along with central and eastern Uttar Pradesh, is currently grappling with oppressive heat. On Sunday, the district experienced a maximum temperature of 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit), surpassing the normal range by five degrees. The relative humidity was recorded at 25%, intensifying the effect of the heat. Atul Kumar Singh, a scientist from the India Meteorological Department, or IMD, said temperatures across the state were presently above normal. He added, \u201cno relief is expected in the next 24 hours.\u201d The IMD issued an alert saying heat wave conditions would last until June 19 in parts of Uttar Pradesh. The state\u2019s health minister, Brijesh Pathak, said that they have opened an investigation into the cause of death of \u201cso many people\u201d in Ballia. In eastern Bihar, scorching heat has engulfed most of the state, leading to 42 deaths in the past two days. Among the fatalities, 35 occurred at two hospitals in the state capital of Patna where over 200 patients suffering from diarrhea and vomiting were being treated. Patna recorded a maximum temperature of 44.7 C Celsius (113 F) on Saturday. The main summer months \u2014 April, May and June \u2014 are generally the hottest in most of India, before monsoon rains bring in cooler temperatures. But temperatures have become more intense in the past decade. During heat waves, the country usually suffers severe water shortages, with tens of millions of its 1.4 billion people lacking running water. A study by World Weather Attribution, an academic group that examines the source of extreme heat, found that a searing heat wave in April that struck parts of South Asia was made at least 30 times more likely by climate change.

His Twitter bio now describes him as a member of the Indian National Congress and a Member of Parliament. Gandhi had to lose his membership, after he was awarded imprisonment by a court in a matter related with alleged remarks on a particular surname.

Senior Congress leaders and workers hailed Gandhi\u2019s reinstatement as an MP, with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge saying that the decision was a \u201cwelcome step\u201d and it brings relief to the people of India, and especially to Wayanad. \u201cWhatever time is left of their tenure, BJP and Modi government should utilise that by concentrating on actual governance rather than denigrating Democracy by targeting opposition leaders,\u201d Kharge said on Twitter. Several Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) leaders hailed Gandhi\u2019s return as an MP with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav saying he hoped that the Uttar Pradesh assembly membership of party leader Mohammad Azam Khan and his son Abdulla Azam too will be restored.

Monu Manesar had released a video and said he would participate in a religious procession. The procession was attacked in Nuh and violence spread to other parts of Haryana. Listen to Story Live TV Share Advertisement Monu Manesar, a Bajrang Dal member and a self-confessed cow vigilante, is accused in the killing of two men in Bhiwani earlier this year. India Today News Desk New Delhi , UPDATED: Aug 1, 2023 13:22 IST Monu Manesar, who was linked to the killing of two alleged cow smugglers in Bhiwani this February, is back in the news after the communal violence in Haryana's Nuh in which four people were killed. But who is Monu Manesar and what is his connection to the violence that has now spread to Gurugram. Four people, including two home guards, a civilian and an imam, were killed and several police personnel were injured in clashes that broke out on Monday during a religious procession taken out by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in Nuh, Haryana. advertisement A day before the clashes, Monu Manesar released a video on social media, saying he would participate in the 'shobha yatra' and asked people to join it in huge numbers. However, he was stopped by the police in Manesar and didn't attend the religious procession. The situation continues to remain tense in Nuh, Gurugram and Sohna districts, where prohibitory orders on mass movement of people have been issued. There is chatter on social media platforms that suggest Monu Manesar's likely participation was one of the reasons that sparked the attacks on the religious procession. But who is Monu Manesar and why is he so controversial? ALSO READ | Internet snapped in Haryana's Nuh for 3 days over communal tension WHO IS MONU MANESAR? Monu Manesar alias Mohit Yadav is a Bajrang Dal member and cow vigilante. He comes from Manesar near Gurugram. He became infamous for his role as the head of the Goraksha Dal, a cow protection task force unit of the Bajrang Dal in Haryana. advertisement Monu Manesar's rise to prominence is closely tied to his vigilantism against alleged cow smugglers. His modus operandi involves receiving tips from night shift workers about suspicious vehicles, which he then reports to the police. If the police are unable to respond, Monu Manesar and his accomplices take matters into their hands, apprehending the suspects and handing them over to law enforcement. However, Monu Manesar's actions have sparked controversy and criticism. He has been accused of involvement in the killing of two men from the minority community. Nasir and Junaid, both residents of Ghatmeeka village in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, were allegedly abducted by cow vigilantes on February 15, and their bodies were found in a charred car in Loharu, Haryana's Bhiwani, the next day.

Rajya Sabha passes Forest Conservation (Amendment) Bill Several state governments and civil societies have expressed reservations about the Bill, saying it contravenes the Supreme Court\u2019s 1996 judgment on preventing deforestation. Puja Das Updated 2 Aug 2023, 06:51 PM IST The Forest Conservation Bill requires entities to seek prior permission of the union government for de-reservation of forest land and for use of forest land for other purposes. New Delhi: The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill, which will exempt land within 100 km of the country's border, that is needed for national security projects, small roadside amenities, and public roads leading to habitation, from the purview of the forest conservation laws. It also exempts land up to 10 ha, proposed to be used for constructing security-related infrastructure, or the land proposed to be used for constructing defence-related projects, camps for paramilitary forces, or public utility projects as specified by the central government not exceeding five hectares in left-wing extremism affected area, from conservation laws. The Bill was passed by Lok Sabha on 26 July. The (Conservation) Amendment Bill, 2023, was passed after a brief debate in Rajya Sabha even as the Opposition had walked out protesting against the violence in Manipur. Introducing the Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha for consideration and passage, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav said almost 4.5 million ha of land was diverted in the country between 1950 and 1980 when the Congress-led government was in the country. The Bill requires entities to seek prior permission of the union government for de-reservation of forest land and for use of forest land for other purposes. The government\u2019s permission is also needed to lease forest land to private entities. Given the security situation in the area, the Bill sheds light on strategic and security-related projects to secure construction of essential infrastructure, particularly near international borders and in areas vulnerable to left-wing extremism. The government has argued that it was necessary to provide access to important arterial highways, other public utilities, and minor establishments and habitations along public roadways and railway lines. To prevent legal challenges, the bill also provides necessary provisions to protect biodiversity, expand forest cover, and offer some clarifications. However, several state governments and civil societies have expressed reservations about the Bill, saying it contravenes the Supreme Court\u2019s 1996 judgment on preventing deforestation. The Forest (Conservation) Act, of 1980, was a crucial central statute for the conservation of forests in the country. It provides de-reservation of reserved forests, use of forest land for non-forest purposes, assigning forest land by way of lease or otherwise to a private entity, and clearing of naturally grown trees for reafforestation requires prior permission of the central government.

On Thursday, the medical college aspirant died by suicide . Manjot left behind a note wishing his father a happy birthday. In a separate note, the teen wrote \"Sorry\", and in yet another he said that no one should be held responsible for his extreme step. \"I have done it of my own free will. So, please don't trouble my friends and parents,\" one of the notes read. \"Happy birthday Papa,\" another note, pasted on the wall, read. Friends told the police that Manjot was a brilliant student and had a fun-loving nature. He had scored 93 per cent marks in Class 12 exams and was also doing well in routine tests at the coaching institute, police official Dharmveer Singh told news agency PTI, quoting the student's friends. Kota student leaves suicide note at the hostel premises (Credits: India Today) Manjot Singh, who belonged to Uttar Pradesh's Rampur, was preparing for medical entrance exams. He came to Kota in April and enrolled himself with a coaching centre to prepare for NEET. According to a report in news agency PTI, the student had come to Kota along with three of his schoolmates, who lived in the same hostel in separate rooms. Manjot's body was found hanging from a fan in his hostel room on Thursday morning. His hands were tied at the back. Soon after, authorities at the hostel were informed and the police were called in. The official said they did not take the student's body to the mortuary and were waiting for his family members to arrive. The exact reason for the suicide was yet to be ascertained, the police official said. STUDENT SUICIDES IN KOTA Manjot was the 19th student to have died by suicide in Kota so far this year. Over two lakh students are currently taking coaching for entrance exams in various coaching institutes in the city. Last year, at least 15 cases of suicide by coaching students were registered in Kota. Meanwhile, the rising cases of student suicides in the city have prompted the hostel authorities to use springs, often known as \"anti-suicide devices\" on all fans at the premises. This would bring down the fan as soon as any weight is tied to it.

With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China. The Vikram lander from Chandrayaan-3 successfully touched down as planned at 18:04 local time (12:34 GMT). Celebrations have broken out across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying \"India is now on the Moon\". \"We have reached where no other country could. It's a joyous occasion,\" he added. Mr Modi was watching the event live from South Africa where he is attending the Brics summit. Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said the successful landing \"is not our work alone, this is the work of a generation of Isro scientists\". India's achievement comes just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon . The crash also put the spotlight on how difficult it is to land in the south pole region where the surface is \"very uneven\" and \"full of craters and boulders\". India's second lunar mission, which also attempted to soft-land there in 2019, was unsuccessful - its lander and rover were destroyed, though its orbiter survived. India's latest Moon mission sends first photos The race to unravel the mysteries of Moon's south pole On Wednesday, tense moments preceded the touchdown as the lander - called Vikram after Isro founder Vikram Sarabhai - began its precarious descent, carrying within its belly the 26kg rover named Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for wisdom). The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing on the lunar surface. In a few hours - scientists say once the dust has settled - the six-wheeled rover will crawl out of the lander's belly and roam around the rocks and craters on the Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent to Earth. Reuters The live simulation of the landing was show on big screens across India What next for India's Moon mission? One of the mission's major goals is to hunt for water-based ice which, scientists say, could support human habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations. Scientists say the surface area that remains in permanent shadow there is huge and could hold reserves of water ice. The lander and the rover are carrying five scientific instruments which will help discover the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface. The rover is carrying an Indian flag and its wheels also have Isro's logo and emblem embossed on them so that they leave imprints on the lunar soil during the Moon walk, an official told the BBC. Chandrayaan-3, India's third lunar mission, will work to build on the success of the earlier Moon missions and Isro officials say it will help make some \"very substantial\" scientific discovery. It comes 15 years after Chandrayaan-1, the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime. And despite failing the soft landing, Chandrayaan-2 was not a complete write-off - its orbiter continues to circle the Moon even today and will help the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis. India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon that's often described as a gateway to deep space. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Following the win of the trust test by the Modi government, Union Minister Prahalad Joshi proposed a motion seeking action against Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Lok Sabha suspended Congress MP Adhir Ranjan for 'unruly' conduct, and directed privileges committee to submit a report. The no-confidence motion was passed by the opposition bloc I.N.D.I.A, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who represents Kaliabor constituency in Assam as well as Bharat Rashtra Samithi last week against the Modi government over Manipur violence. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla had accepted the motion by the opposition last week after which Aug 8 to Aug 10 was set for the debate on the motion. Live Events The lower house has seen arguments from many leaders over the no confidence motion. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who was recently reinstated as a member of the Lok Sabha after Supreme Court had stayed conviction against the MP over his defameation case over Modi Surname said \u201cTheir politics has not killed Manipur but Hindustaan,\" said Rahul Gandhi on Manipur violence left the house in a frenzy. Along with Rahul Gandhi, Home mInister Amit Shah and Finance Minister also addressed the housing supporting the government; listing achievements of the modi government. This is the second time Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing a no-confidence motion. The first such motion against the Modi government was introduced in 2018 over granting a special category status to Andhra Pradesh which was later defeated. Notably, the NDA has a commendable majority with a number of 331 MPs out of which the BJP has 303 MPs while the combined strength of the Opposition bloc I.N.D.I.A is 144. The numbers of unaligned parties\u2019 MPs are 70 in the Lower House. Any Lok Sabha MP, who has the support of 50 colleagues, can, at any point of time, introduce a motion of no-confidence against the Council of Ministers. MPs who support the no trust motion highlight the government\u2019s shortcomings, and the Treasury Bench respond to the issues they raise. The opposition commented that the lack of statements from the PM has been one of the reasons behind their reason for passing the motion.

{"year":"2023","month":"08","event_desc":"31 August  The OCCRP releases a report alleging that Vinod Adani committed insider trading through offshore entities in the Adani Group and the Securities and Exchange Board of India committed perjury in investigation against the group.","text":"Home Business Economy Explained | Decoding the OCCRP\u2019s Adani report What were the terms of reference given by the Supreme Court in the Adani-Hindenburg investigation? What is Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957? What did the OCCRP investigation find? What are its implications? Updated - September 01, 2023 10:34 am IST Prasenjit Bose Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT The findings of the SEBI on stock price manipulation and insider trading in Adani stocks are difficult to take at face value.\n                                          | Photo Credit: AFP The story so far: In its order dated March 2, on the batch of petitions concerning the Adani-Hindenburg matter, the Supreme Court of India had directed the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conduct investigations in accordance with specific terms of reference. The first term was to probe whether there has been a violation of Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957. Two more terms were set by the apex court related to non-disclosure of related party transactions and the manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing laws. In addition, a separate Expert Committee was formed to inter alia examine whether there has been a regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws by the Adani group. Now, a media investigation has brought forth further allegations. What is Rule 19A? Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957, inserted through an amendment made with effect from June 4, 2010 under \u201cContinuous Listing Requirement\u201d, stipulates that every company listed in the Indian stock market has to maintain at least 25 percent public shareholding. \u201cPublic\u201d is defined in the said Rules as persons other than \u201cthe promoter and promoter group\u201d \u2014 defined as any spouse of that person, or any parent, brother, sister or child of the person or of the spouse, besides \u201csubsidiaries or associates of the company\u201d. This 25 per cent minimum threshold for public shareholding vitally ensures that adequate shares of a listed company is available for trading in the stock market to enable price discovery. Violations of this rule indicate likely stock price manipulation and insider trading, jeopardising the integrity of the equity market. What are the latest revelations? An investigation conducted by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), as reported in the Financial Times and The Guardian on August 31, has found that two Mauritius based funds, namely the Emerging India Focus Fund (EIFF) and the EM Resurgent Fund (EMRF) had invested and traded in large volume of shares of four Adani companies between 2013 and 2018. Two key foreign investors of these funds were Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli from the UAE and Chang Chung-Ling from Taiwan. The money was channelled through a Bermuda-based investment fund called the Global Opportunities Fund (GOF). The value of the investments of Nasser Ali and Chang Chung-Ling in Adani stocks was around $430 million in March 2017 (approximately \u20b92,795 crore at prevailing exchange rate). In January 2017, these two investors together held 3.4% of total shares in Adani Enterprises, 4% in Adani Power and 3.6% in Adani Transmission. The OCCRP investigation has further revealed that a UAE-based secretive firm named Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited owned by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani and member of Adani promoter group, had received over $1.4 million in \u201cadvisory\u201d fees from management companies of EIFF, EMRF and GOF between June 2012 and August 2014. The investigators have not only dug up invoices and transaction records, but also internal emails which suggest that EIFF, EMRF and GOF were investing funds into the Adani group stocks at the behest of Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited, that is, Vinod Adani. Therefore, there is now prima facie evidence that entities like EIFF, EMRF and GOF were\/are fronts through which Vinod Adani has invested massive funds into Adani group companies stocks. If one adds the shareholding of Vinod Adani in three Adani companies \u2014 through offshore individuals and entities like Nasser Ali and Chang Chung-Ling via EIFF, EMRF and GOF, with the disclosed promoter group shareholding of those companies \u2014 the promoter group shareholding of Adani Enterprises and Adani Transmission stood at over 78% in January 2017. This would be in clear breach of the 75% threshold contained in 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules. The OCCRP evidence is over and above the ones already provided by the Hindenburg report which alleged a vast global web of tax haven based shell companies run by Vinod Adani through individuals like Chang Chung-Ling and offshore funds such as EIFF, EMRF etc. If more shell companies and transactions are investigated, it could further reveal breaches and contraventions of rules and regulations by the Adani group via the Vinod Adani channel. The Adani conglomerate, however, has vehemently denied all the charges made by the OCCRP. SEBI and the DRI probe A significant revelation by the OCCRP relates to the correspondence between the director general of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the SEBI chief in January 2014 on \u201cthe dealings of the Adani Group of companies in the stock market\u201d. One of the letters was accompanied by a CD of evidence from a DRI probe into allegations of over-invoicing of capital equipment imports against Adani power projects, stating that \u201cthere are indications that a part of the siphoned-off money may have found its way to stock markets in India as investment and disinvestment in [the] Adani Group.\u201d SEBI has not disclosed the receipt of such a letter and evidence from the DRI till date before the Supreme Court. Rather, they have categorically stated before the Expert Committee that the investigation into possible contraventions of rules and regulations by the Adani group of companies started on October 23, 2020 after receipt of complaints in June-July 2020. The revelation of the DRI letter suggests that either SEBI has suppressed facts and provided false information which amounts to perjury; or that the then SEBI chairperson instead of acting on the DRI letter preferred to close the ongoing investigations into the Adani group. The matter deserves the attention of the apex court because the SEBI chairperson in January 2014 retired only in February 2017 and is currently serving as \u201cNon-Executive Independent Director-Chairperson\u201d of NDTV, which was acquired by the Adani group in 2022. In its latest affidavit before the Supreme Court on August 25, SEBI has stated that they have conducted 24 investigations into Adani-Hindenburg related matters since March 2023, of which 22 investigations have been completed while interim reports have been submitted for two investigations. It is noteworthy that the two incomplete investigations include the one on the violation of Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957. Mentioning the time period covered under this investigation as between April 1, 2016 to September 30, 2020, SEBI has submitted to the Supreme Court that they have been unable to establish the \u201ceconomic interest shareholder\u201d in 13 suspected overseas entities because of their tax haven jurisdictions and that efforts are still being made to gather more details. It is noteworthy that the names of EIFF and EMRF, which have been alleged to be fronts of Vinod Adani by the OCCRP investigation also figure in SEBI\u2019s list of 13 suspected Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). SEBI owes an explanation as to how a consortium of investigative journalists could collate evidence on such tax haven based entities while a national regulator has failed to unearth so far. The SEBI investigation and fallout OCCRP\u2019s expose adds to the already substantial body of evidence which suggests that SEBI\u2019s role in the Adani group matter goes beyond regulatory failure and possible regulatory capture. SEBI has already been indicted by the Expert Committee for amending the FPI and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirement (LODR) Regulations since 2018 which opened up regulatory loopholes facilitating concealment of \u201cultimate beneficiary ownership\u201d of FPIs and transactions with \u201crelated parties\u201d. It is now clear that those amendments were made after the alleged contraventions of the 75% rule of SCRR 1957 by at least two Adani group companies in 2017, as found by the OCCRP investigation. Therefore, the findings of the SEBI on stock price manipulation and insider trading in Adani stocks are difficult to take at face value. The Expert Committee has already reported that 849 alerts were generated vis-\u00e0-vis the Adani scrips through SEBI\u2019s automated surveillance systems, between April 2018 and December 2022. Out of this, 603 alerts related to price volume movements were closed by SEBI and 246 alerts on suspected insider trading were still work in progress. As per the Expert Committee findings, 13 FPIs suspected by SEBI sold around 8.6 crore shares of Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) between April 2021 and December 2022 when AEL\u2019s share price skyrocketed from around \u20b91,000 to over \u20b93,800. The Life Insurance Corporation of India bought 4.8 crore of these shares during the same period. Yet, SEBI gave a clean chit to the suspected FPIs citing their \u201cnet seller\u201d status during the period of price rise; whereas, it is obvious that the suspected FPIs were the major gainers of the abnormal price rise and a public sector financial company enabled those gains. It is only through a thorough forensic audit of all the listed Adani group companies and the 13 suspected FPIs by an independent auditor that the real nature and extent of the alleged economic crimes committed by the Adani group via the Vinod Adani channel can be revealed. While being very meticulous, the OCCRP investigation has only been able to expose the tip of the iceberg. Prasenjit Bose is an economist and activist based in Kolkata In its order dated March 2, on the batch of petitions concerning the Adani-Hindenburg matter, the Supreme Court of India had directed the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conduct investigations in accordance with specific terms of reference. The first term was to probe whether there has been a violation of Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957. An investigation conducted by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), as reported in the Financial Times and The Guardian on August 31, has found that two Mauritius based funds, namely the Emerging India Focus Fund (EIFF) and the EM Resurgent Fund (EMRF) had invested and traded in large volume of shares of four Adani companies between 2013 and 2018. As per the Expert Committee findings, 13 FPIs suspected by SEBI sold around 8.6 crore shares of Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) between April 2021 and December 2022 when AEL\u2019s share price skyrocketed from around \u20b91,000 to over \u20b93,800. The Life Insurance Corporation of India bought 4.8 crore of these shares during the same period.

CM Shinde orders inquiry, deputy CM Fadnavis says govt in talks with protesters. Purva Chitnis 02 September, 2023 02:54 pm IST Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin A screengrab of Friday's clash in Jalna district of Maharashtra | Special arrangement Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ Mumbai: Violence erupted between police and agitators demanding reservation for Marathas in Jalna, Maharashtra Friday evening, with the police resorting to a lathi charge and the use of tear gas, and registering an FIR against 250 people the following day. The protesters had allegedly thrown stones at the personnel and torched at least two buses. Even as Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has ordered an inquiry into the incident, the issue took a political turn with the Opposition slamming the government and condemning the lathi charge. The clash was reported from Antarwali Sarathi in Ambad taluka near Beed in Jalna district around 6.30 pm Friday, when the police tried to stop an agitation led by a local Maratha leader, Manoj Jarange. Jarange has been on a hunger strike since last Monday, seeking reservation for Marathas in admissions to educational institutions and government jobs. Police said as many as 123 villages around Antarwali Sarathi supported the protest.

His health was deteriorating so our intention was to save him. We tried to talk to him but he was not budging.\u201d \u201cWhen we went there on Friday to take him to the hospital, his supporters cornered us and started pelting stones,\u201d he added. Amid the chaos, Jarange\u2019s supporters took him away. Police said that around 40 police personnel and dozens of civilians were injured. The FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 307 (attempt to murder) , 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) and 143 (unlawful assembly), as well as charges of rioting and damage to public property, according to police. The FIR has not been shared with the press. Virendra Pawar, the coordinator of Maratha Morcha, the umbrella organisation coordinating the agitation, told reporters Saturday, \u201cThe Maratha community has been protesting peacefully over the years for their right to reservation. But the government resorted to a lathi charge and violence. The government will have to pay for this.\u201d Home minister Devendra Fadnavis told the media in Mumbai Friday that the government was in talks with the protesters and had urged them to end the hunger strike. He said that since the Maratha reservation issue was in the Supreme Court , it cannot be resolved in one day. \u201cBut it is the responsibility of the administration to admit a person on hunger strike if their health is deteriorating. And accordingly, the administration went to have talks with them. But unfortunately, the mob of protesters turned violent and started throwing stones at police,\u201d he said.

Reported by: Harsha Kumari Singh Edited by: Samiran Mishra India News Aug 28, 2023 11:57 am IST Published On Aug 28, 2023 11:57 am IST Last Updated On Aug 28, 2023 11:57 am IST Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Kota Student Suicide: In 2023, there have already been 23 suicides, compared to 15 in 2022. Kota: In Rajasthan's Kota -- India's coaching district for aspiring engineers and doctors -- two suicides within four hours on Sunday took the tally this year to 23, the highest ever recorded. Avishkar Shambaji Kasle, 17, from Maharashtra and Adarsh Raj, 18, from Bihar both died in two separate incidents in the city on Sunday. The former jumped from the sixth floor of his coaching institute's building while the latter hanged himself at his rented apartment. In 2023, there have already been 23 suicides, compared to 15 in 2022. December 2022 was the deadliest month, with three suicides in a single day. Data shows that the number of suicides has increased by 60% since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, that jump in deaths is due to the fact that the number of students in Kota declined in 2019 and 2020 during the Covid pandemic. In 2017, 10 students ended their lives in the city compared to 12 in 2018 and nine in 2021. Speaking to NDTV, Dr Bharat Singh Shekhawat, head of the psychiatry department at Kota Medical College, said that there needs to be a comprehensive change in the approach of both the coaching institutes and the parents to curb the alarming rate of student deaths. \"The number of suicides by students in Kota is the highest this year. We have been presenting suggestions to the Rajasthan government for 20 years, but no action has been taken,\" Dr Shekhawat told NDTV. \"During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no pressure on students as they had the support of their families and were at home. However, after the lockdown, the pressure has returned, and that umbrella support has gone. \"Students who are admitted to coaching institutes at the age of 15 or 16 are too young. They miss out on the benefits of school, such as extracurricular activities and friendships. They are also under a lot of stress due to the rigorous coaching schedule.\" Dr Shekhawat suggested a minimum age for admission at Kota's coaching institutes so that the students are not thrown into the rigours of academia before they have matured. \"Coaching institutes should also regulate the coaching industry and ensure that the institutes provide a healthy and supportive environment for students,\" he said. Every year, over 2 lakh students move to Kota to prepare for competitive exams such as the JEE and NEET. Following the recent surge in student suicides, authorities have asked coaching institutes to suspend routine tests for the next two months. In an effort to combat the increasing number of suicides, spring-loaded fans were installed in all hostels and paying guest (PG) accommodations in Kota. \"Anti-suicide nets\" are also being installed in balconies and lobbies of hostels so that students cannot jump to their deaths. Hostel owners have said that the exercise to install nets and spring-loaded fans is being carried out with the aim of making their premises \"suicide-proof\". \"We have installed huge nets in all lobbies and balconies to block students in case they jump from higher floors. These nets can hold weight up to 150 kg and also ensure that students do not get injured,\" said a hostel owner, as quoted by news agency PTI.

Authorities have imposed a curfew in the capital and some other places in India\u2019s restive state of Manipur after dozens of students were injured in violence following protests against the alleged abduction and murder of two students. Ethnic violence has plunged the northeastern state bordering Myanmar into what many security experts describe as an intense civil war fought over land, jobs and political clout between its two largest local groups. \u201cIndefinite curfew had to be implemented in Imphal and in some other districts,\u201d L Kailun, a senior police official posted in Imphal, said on Thursday. More than 80 students were injured in Wednesday\u2019s clashes, another police official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the situation was \u201cextremely tense\u201d after armed mobs vandalised an office of the governing party and hurled petrol bombs at the police parties. Mobile internet services have been suspended in the state for five days, officials said.    Since the violence first erupted on May 3 , more than 180 people have been killed and some 50,000 have fled their homes in Manipur. More than half the state\u2019s population of 3.2 million belongs to the mainly Hindu Meitei community, while the Kuki-Zo community, who make up about 40 percent, are predominantly Christian and live mostly in the hills. Protests reignited over the alleged kidnapping and killing of two students of the Meitei community who had gone missing in July after their bodies were found this week. The news went viral, reviving the ethnic tension . The state\u2019s chief minister, N Biren Singh, who is a leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), denounced the alleged murders and promised maximum punishment for the culprits. Members of the students\u2019 families and Meitei leaders have accused Kuki-Zo fighters of killing the duo and criticised authorities for failing to end the violence. A spokesperson for a Kuki-Zo civil society group said it did not have an immediate comment to offer over the latest killings.

The five-judge constitution bench was hearing petitions challenging the currency ban that rendered 86% of India\u2019s currency invalid without warning. They contended that the move was not a considered decision of the government and should be struck down by the court. Four judges on the five-member bench said the government made the decision after consulting with the Reserve Bank of India and stated there was no flaw in the decision-making process. Justice BV Nagarathna, however, gave a dissenting judgment, calling the decision \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201can exercise of power, contrary to law.\u201d She said the currency ban could have been carried out through an act of Parliament, not by the government. In November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise TV announcement that all 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes would be withdrawn immediately from circulation. The government defended the decision by saying it would root out illegally hoarded cash, fight corruption and crack down on money laundering and terrorist financing.

However, the sudden decision caused losses for small businesses and manufacturers, bringing on an economic slump and months of financial chaos for ordinary, cash-dependent Indians who lined up at banks and ATMs for days as cash ran dry.

Lhonak Lake in Sikkim state overflowed on Wednesday, causing major flooding that authorities said had impacted the lives of 22,000 people. It is the latest deadly weather event in South Asia's mountains being blamed on climate change. Sign up here. The weather department said Sikkim received 101 mm (4 inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels, unleashing floods worse than one in October 1968 in which an estimated 1,000 people were killed. The department has predicted heavy rain over the next three days in parts of Sikkim and neighbouring states. The latest flooding was exacerbated by water released from state-run NHPC's Teesta V dam, local officials said. Four of the dam's gates had been washed away and it was not clear why they had not been opened in time, a government source told Reuters. As of Thursday evening, 98 people were missing, 17 of whom were army personnel, state chief secretary V.B. Pathak told Reuters by phone. Fourteen bridges had been washed away, hampering rescue operations already affected by heavy rainfall. Pathak said 18 relief camps had been opened on Thursday where food and medical assistance was being provided. Authorities in neighbouring Bangladesh were on alert. A state-run water development board official warned that five districts in the northern part of the country could be inundated with a rise in the level of the Teesta river, which enters Bangladesh downstream of Sikkim. Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics TOURISTS STRANDED Prabhakar Rai, director of Sikkim's State Disaster Management Authority, said bad weather was hampering rescue operations and described the situation as \"slightly grim\". \"Due to bad weather conditions we cannot have air service towards the northern part of the state,\" Rai told Reuters. \"Roads have been damaged at various places so communication is a big problem. Telephone communication disruption is also a problem in the upper reaches,\" he said. Silt that had collected in houses along the river bed was also slowing rescue work.

An advisory from the state tourism department asked visitors planning trips to the scenic state to postpone travel and said those stuck in Mangan district would be evacuated from Friday subject to weather. \"All tourists stranded at Lachung and Lachen areas are safe and nothing adverse has so far been reported,\" the advisory said, referring to the two rivers that join to form the Teesta in Chungthang. Video footage from the ANI news agency, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed flood waters surging into built-up areas where several houses collapsed. Army bases and other facilities were damaged and vehicles submerged. Reuters photos showed earth movers and rescue workers shovelling silt and mud to dig out military vehicles buried by the riverside. Satellite imagery showed that nearly two-third of the lake seems to have been drained. FUEL SCARCE, FOOD AVAILABLE Sikkim, a small Buddhist state of about 650,000 people which is wedged in the mountains between Nepal, Bhutan and China, was cut off from Siliguri in the neighbouring state of West Bengal as the main highway had collapsed. State lawmaker G.T. Dhungel told Reuters that petrol and diesel had become scarce in the state capital Gangtok but food was readily available. A cloudburst on Wednesday dropped a huge amount of rain over a short period on Lhonak Lake, about 150 km (90 miles) north of Gangtok near the border with China, triggering flash floods down the Teesta valley. Runoff from melting glaciers often pools in shallow lakes, held back by rocks and debris. The risk comes when a lake overfills, bursting through its natural barrier and sending a torrent of water rushing down mountain valleys. A 2020 report by India's National Disaster Management Agency said glacial lakes are growing and pose a potentially large risk to downstream infrastructure and life as glaciers in the Himalayas are melting due to climate change. A study published in the journal Nature Communications in February assessed for the first time how many people globally are at risk from these floods, finding that more than half of the vulnerable global population of some 15 million people live in India, Pakistan, China, and Peru. The Indian Himalayas have witnessed torrential rains in the past few years that have set off deadly landslides and flash floods, killing more than 500 people this year alone and damaging critical infrastructure, with scientists increasingly blaming global warming as a key factor.

Aditya-L1 lifted off from the launch pad at Sriharikota on Saturday at 11:50 India time (06:20 GMT). It will travel 1.5 million km (932,000 miles) from the Earth - 1% of the Earth-Sun distance. India's space agency says it will take four months to travel that far. India's first space-based mission to study the Solar System's biggest object is named after Surya - the Hindu god of Sun who is also known as Aditya. And L1 stands for Lagrange point 1 - the exact place between the Sun and Earth where the Indian spacecraft is heading. According to the European Space Agency, a Lagrange point is a spot where the gravitational forces of two large objects - such as the Sun and the Earth - cancel each other out, allowing a spacecraft to \"hover\". Once Aditya-L1 reaches this \"parking spot\", it would be able to orbit the Sun at the same rate as the Earth. This means the satellite will require very little fuel to operate. India makes historic landing near Moon's south pole India's lunar rover takes a walk on the Moon What has India's rover been up to on the Moon? On Saturday morning, a few thousand people gathered in the viewing gallery set up by the Indian Space Research Agency (Isro) near the launch site to watch the blast off. It was also broadcast live on national TV where commentators described it as a \"magnificent\" launch. Isro scientists said the launch had been successful and its \"performance is normal\". After an hour and four minutes of flight-time, Isro declared it \"mission successful\". \"Now it will continue on its journey - it's a very long journey of 135 days, let's wish it [the] best of luck,\" Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said. Project director Nigar Shaji said once Aditya-L1 reached its destination, it would benefit not only India, but the global scientific community. Aditya-L1 will now travel several times around the Earth before being launched towards L1. From this vantage position, it will be able to watch the Sun constantly and carry out scientific studies. Isro has not said how much the mission would cost, but reports in the Indian press put it at 3.78bn rupees ($46m; \u00a336m). Isro says the orbiter carries seven scientific instruments that will observe and study the solar corona (the outermost layer); the photosphere (the Sun's surface or the part we see from the Earth) and the chromosphere (a thin layer of plasma that lies between the photosphere and the corona). The studies will help scientists understand solar activity, such as the solar wind and solar flares, and their effect on Earth and near-space weather in real time. Former Isro scientist Mylswamy Annadurai says the Sun constantly influences the Earth's weather through radiation, heat and flow of particles and magnetic fields. At the same time, he says, it also impacts the space weather. \"Space weather plays a role in how effectively satellites function. Solar winds or storms can affect the electronics on satellites, even knock down power grids. But there are gaps in our knowledge of space weather,\" Mr Annadurai told the BBC. India has more than 50 satellites in space and they provide many crucial services to the country, including communication links, data on weather, and help predict pest infestations, droughts and impending disasters. According to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), approximately 10,290 satellites remain in the Earth's orbit, with nearly 7,800 of them currently operational. Aditya will help us better understand, and even give us a forewarning, about the star on which our lives depend, Mr Annadurai says. \"Knowing the activities of the Sun such as solar wind or a solar eruption a couple of days ahead will help us move our satellites out of harm's way. This will help increase the longevity of our satellites in space.\" Getty Images The mission will help improve our scientific understanding of the Sun - the 4.5 billion-year-old star The mission, he adds, will above all help improve our scientific understanding of the Sun - the 4.5 billion-year-old star that holds our Solar System together. India's solar mission comes just days after the country successfully landed the world's first-ever probe near the lunar south pole. With that, India also became only the fourth country in the world to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China. Solar Orbiter: Sun mission blasts off Probe makes historic pass through Sun's atmosphere If Aditya-L1 is successful, India will join the select group of countries that are already studying the Sun. US space agency Nasa has been watching the Sun since the 1960s; Japan launched its first mission in 1981 to study solar flares and the European Space Agency (ESA) has been observing the Sun since the 1990s. In February 2020, Nasa and ESA jointly launched a Solar Orbiter that is studying the Sun from close quarters and gathering data that, scientists say, will help understand what drives its dynamic behaviour. And in 2021, Nasa's newest spacecraft Parker Solar Probe made history by becoming the first to fly through the corona , the outer atmosphere of the Sun. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Prakash Adhikari\/AP CNN \u2014 More than 100 people are missing in India\u2019s northeast after heavy rain caused a glacial lake to burst, leading to flash floods which ripped through the Himalayan state of Sikkim Wednesday, killing at least 19 and washing away roads and bridges, according to the state government. A \u201csudden cloudburst\u201d over Lhonak Lake, in the northern part of the state, sent fast-moving torrents of water surging down the Teesta River in Sikkim\u2019s Lachen valley, raising water levels 15-20 feet higher than normal, the Indian Army said in a statement. A cloudburst is a very sudden and destructive rainstorm. Chungthang Dam, also known as the Teesta 3 dam and part of a major hydropower project in the state, was \u201cwashed away,\u201d according to a statement issued by the National Disaster Management Authority on Wednesday night. Drinking water supplies and sewage treatment plants have been \u201ctotally damaged\u201d across affected districts, according to the state government. Video from the north of the state shows a muddy deluge rapidly overflowing the river, and flooded houses caked in dirt and debris, while images show search teams using excavators to uncover army vehicles buried deep in the mud. Rescue and restorations operations are underway with both state and national disaster personnel involved, the government said. Known as the rooftop of the world, the ecologically-sensitive Himalayan region is prone to flash floods and landslides, and flooding is not unusual in Sikkim. But scientists are clear that extreme weather is becoming more frequent and more intense as the human-caused climate crisis accelerates. High water levels in the Teesta river in Sikkim, India, on October 4. Government of Sikkim A vehicle that got washed away lies beneath a tree in Rangpo town in Sikkim, India. Prakash Adhikari\/AP As search efforts continued Wednesday, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) released dramatic images showing the volume of water which had been released from Lhonak Lake following the cloudburst. Lhonak Lake is a large glacial bullet-shaped water body that sits at the foot of a melting glacier. An analysis of the images shows more than 60% of the water held in the lake drained out after the extreme rainstorm triggered a glacial lake outburst . This phenomenon happens when a glacial lake rises too high or the surrounding land or ice gives way and the lake bursts, sending water and debris rushing down mountains. One satellite image shows the lake holding about 167.4 hectares of water on September 28, while another dated October 4 shows the lake reduced by more than half \u2013 holding approximately 60.3 hectares of water in it. \u201cIt is observed that lake is burst and about 105 hectares area has been drained out \u2026 which might have created a flash flood downstream (in the Teesta River),\u201d ISRO said in text accompanying the images. Temporal changes in Lhonak Lake area as of September 17; September 28; and October 4. ISRO Scientists have long studied Lhonak Lake, identifying it as one of the fastest swelling glacial lakes in the region with a high risk for a potential glacial outburst, according to multiple studies. In recent years, the state\u2019s Disaster Management Authority led several expeditions to the site, concluding that a glacial lake outburst would \u201ccause huge devastation downstream\u201d and that \u201closs of life and property\u201d were likely. Pipelines were installed at the lake to siphon off the water as a short-term solution. And last May, the state government held a consultation workshop on such a risk, with the director of Sikkim\u2019s Department of Science and Technology highlighting the \u201curgent need for an early warning system for these glacial lakes in Sikkim.\u201d Search efforts hampered by heavy rain The Sikkim city of Pakyong was the worst affected with seven people killed in the floods and 59 people missing, the Sikkim government said. Among those unaccounted for are dozens of members of the Indian Army. A \u201cmassive\u201d search and rescue operation to find the missing soldiers has been launched but efforts were hampered by \u201cincessant rains\u201d and flooding that had cut off roads and washed-out bridges, the army said. On Wednesday evening, one soldier was rescued and is in a stable condition but 22 others remain missing, according to the army. In an update Friday, the army said that \u201ccertain military equipment including firearms and explosives were carried away by the Teesta River\u201d and urged the public to be vigilant and \u201creport any unfamiliar objects, crates, packages, firearms, or any suspicious items.\u201d The missing military equipment could \u201cpose a potential risk of a dangerous explosion,\u201d it said. At least 11 bridges collapsed in the flooding, impeding rescue efforts and cutting off remote areas, the government said. In the state capital and largest city Gangtok, three deaths were reported and 22 people missing, it added. More than 2,000 people have been evacuated and relief camps have been set up across the state to help more than 22,000 people affected by the flash floods. Rescue work continues after flash floods in Sikkim's Rangpo town on October 5. Prakash Adhikari\/AP Buildings are inundated by flood waters in Rangpo town. Prakash Adhikari\/AP On Thursday, the state government said at least 3,000 tourists remain stranded in Sikkim\u2019s Lachung and Lachen and that helicopters are being deployed to help evacuate them. The Teesta-V Hydropower Station was reported to be \u201cunder shutdown presently and not generating electricity,\u201d the All India Radio (AIR) News reported, citing the country\u2019s Power Ministry. \u201cAll the bridges downstream to Teesta-V Hydropower Station up to Tarkhola and Pamphok have been submerged which has severely affected commutation and communication in these areas,\u201d it said. A \u201cdetailed assessment\u201d of damage to the hydropower projects would be made by the central government once the flood water recedes, AIR News reported. The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy rainfall to continue across the country\u2019s east and northeast, including Sikkim, for the next two days. Sikkim\u2019s chief minister Prem Singh Tamang said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that emergency services have been mobilized to the affected areas, and he has \u201cvisited Singtam to assess the damages and engage with the local community.\u201d Singtam is a town affected by the flooding about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Gangtok. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the situation an \u201cunfortunate natural calamity\u201d and offered \u201call possible support in addressing the challenge.\u201d \u201cI pray for the safety and well-being of all those affected,\u201d he wrote on X. Glacial outbursts will affect millions The Himalayan region is highly vulnerable to the climate crisis. Himalayan glaciers feed into rivers that provide freshwater to two billion people and many communities depend on the glacial waters to irrigate their crops. But a recent report warned the glaciers could lose up to 80% of their ice by 2100 as temperatures rise, heightening the likelihood of floods, landslides, avalanches and also drought. As glaciers around the world melt at an alarming rate, about 15 million people who live near glacial lakes are at risk from catastrophic glacial lake outbursts, with more than half concentrated in just four countries \u2013 India, Pakistan, Peru and China \u2013 according to a study earlier this year. These lake bursts have been compared to an \u201cinland tsunami\u201d and their impact akin to a sudden dam collapse, experts previously told CNN. A vehicle is seen partially submerged in flood water in Rangpo town. Prakash Adhikari\/AP The ensuing floods happen with little to no warning and previous glacial lake outbursts have killed thousands of people and destroyed property and critical infrastructure. A 2020 study of the Teesta River basin by scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, found a increase in rainfall and temperatures this century and that Sikkim\u2019s many glacial lakes are expanding due to glacier and snow melt as temperatures rise.

(AP Photo\/Rafiq Maqbool) Read More By KRUTIKA PATHI Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India\u2019s top court on Tuesday refused to legalize same-sex marriages, passing the responsibility back to Parliament in a ruling that disappointed campaigners for LGBTQ+ rights in the world\u2019s most populous country. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud also urged the government to uphold the rights of the queer community and end discrimination against them. Earlier this year, the five-judge bench heard 21 petitions that sought to legalize same-sex marriage. Chandrachud said there were degrees of agreement and disagreement among the justices \u201con how far we have to go\u201d on same-sex marriages, but the judges unanimously agreed that the court can\u2019t grant LGBTQ+ people the right to marry because that is a legislative function. More News 25 years after Matthew Shepard\u2019s death, LGBTQ+ activists say equal-rights progress is at risk Sex education classes often don\u2019t include LGBTQ+ students. New restrictions could make it worse Muslims in Kenya protest at Supreme Court over its endorsement of LGBTQ right to associate \u201cThis court can\u2019t make law. It can only interpret it and give effect to it,\u201d the chief justice said, reiterating that it was up to Parliament to decide whether it could expand marriage laws to include queer unions. One of the petitioners, Mario da Penha, said it was \u201ca day to be disappointed, but not to lose hope.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been tremendous work that has gone into these petitions, and many hopes and dreams of the queer community attached to them \u2014 to lead lives that most other Indians take for granted. The fact that the dream could not come to fruition today is a disappointment for all of us,\u201d he said. He added that it wasn\u2019t yet clear if the court had set a mandate or timeline for Parliament to act. \u201cWithout that mandate, there is no pressure on Parliament to enact any legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are queer couples today that are already families and in relationships, and are pillars of society. That they are not afforded the dignity and rights that they are due is deeply disappointing,\u201d said Karuna Nundy, one of the lawyers representing the petitioners. Legal rights for LGBTQ+ people in India have been expanding over the past decade, mostly as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention. In 2018, the top court struck down a colonial-era law that had made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison and expanded constitutional rights for the gay community. The decision was seen as a historic victory for LGBTQ+ rights, with one judge saying it would \u201cpave the way for a better future.\u201d Despite this progress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government resisted the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and rejected several petitions in favor. During the hearings, the government argued that a marriage is only between a biological male and a biological woman, adding that same-sex marriages went against religious values and that the petitions reflected only \u201curban elitist views.\u201d Religious groups too had opposed same-sex unions, saying they went against Indian culture. Adish Aggarwala, the president of the Supreme Court bar association, said the court had done the right thing by recognizing that this was a job for Parliament, an argument the government also made during the hearings. Lawyers for the petitioners argued that marriage is between two people, not just a man and woman. They said concepts of marriage have gradually changed with time and laws should acknowledge that. By not recognizing such unions, the government was depriving same-sex couples of their right to equality enshrined in the constitution and rights enjoyed by married heterosexual couples, from adoption and medical insurance to pensions and inheritance, they argued. \u201cThis court needs to push society to acknowledge same-sex marriage,\u201d one of the lawyers said. Petitioners were hopeful that the Supreme Court could challenge the government\u2019s position. Some of the justices urged the state to make sure queer couples don\u2019t face harassment or discrimination in accessing basic needs, like opening a joint bank account. They called for steps to raise awareness among the public about queer identity, establish hotlines and safe houses available for those in the queer community who are facing violence. The chief justice also rejected the government\u2019s assertion that being queer was an \u201curban\u201d concept, saying it\u2019s not just \u201can English-speaking man\u201d or a \u201cwhite-collar man\u201d who can claim to be queer, but equally, \u201ca woman working in an agricultural job in a village.\u201d But overall, all five judges stopped short of granting legal recognition to same-sex unions. Instead, the court accepted the government\u2019s offer to set up a special panel that will explore granting social and legal benefits to same-sex couples. Homosexuality has long carried a stigma in India\u2019s traditional society, even though there has been a shift in attitudes toward same-sex couples in recent years. India now has openly gay celebrities and some high-profile Bollywood films have dealt with gay issues. According to a Pew survey, acceptance of homosexuality in India increased by 22 percentage points to 37% between 2013 and 2019. But same-sex couples often face harassment in many Indian communities, whether Hindu, Muslim or Christian. India is estimated to have at least 2.5 million LGBTQ+ people, according to government figures from 2012. However, gay rights activists and global estimates believe they number at least 10% of the population, or more than 135 million. In May, Taiwan became the first jurisdiction in Asia to recognize same-sex marriages. In July, Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court issued an interim order enabling the registration of same-sex marriages for the first time. It\u2019s still not clear when the court would make its final decision on the case. KRUTIKA PATHI Pathi is the news director for the UK and Ireland for The Associated Press.

A crowd of local residents gathered around the tunnel erupted in joy and shouted slogans of \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\", or \"Long live mother India\", and set off firecrackers in celebration on Tuesday night (early Wednesday AEDT).

Gadkari said \"this was a well-coordinated effort by multiple agencies, marking one of the most significant rescue operations in recent years\". The workers were pulled out through a passageway made of welded pipes that rescuers previously pushed through dirt and rocks. They will each have an initial health checkup at a temporary medical camp set up inside the 13-metre-wide tunnel. One of the rescuers, Devender, who only gave his first name, told the New Delhi Television channel that \"the trapped workers were overjoyed when they spotted us in the tunnel.

(X) The massive rescue mission had many on edge. The workers got trapped on November 12, when a landslide caused a portion of the 4.5-kilometre tunnel they were building in Uttarakhand state to collapse about 200 metres from the entrance. They survived on food and oxygen supplied through narrow steel pipes. Kirti Panwar, a state government spokesperson, said about a dozen men had worked overnight to manually dig through rocks and debris, taking turns to drill using hand-held drilling tools and clearing out the muck in what he said was the final stretch of the rescue operation. Rescuers resorted to manual digging after the drilling machine broke down on Friday while drilling horizontally from the front because of the mountainous terrain of Uttarakhand.

By Tuesday, they had drilled through more than 58 metres. As dusk fell, families of those trapped underground gathered near the site of the accident, anxiously waiting to see their loved ones emerge from the tunnel. Among them was Jaimal Singh who said he was hopeful he would soon see his brother Gabbar Singh, who is trapped inside. \"Even nature looks cheerful today ... the weather is good. Let's hope this ends soon,\" he told the Press Trust of India news agency.

On Sunday, rescuers also began to create a vertical channel with a newly replaced drilling machine as a contingency plan. What began as a rescue mission expected to take a few days has turned into weeks, and officials have been hesitant to give a timeline for when it might be completed. \"I just feel good. The drilling on top of the mountain is coming along perfectly, in the tunnel, it's coming along very well. I have never said 'I feel good' before,\" Arnold Dix, an international tunnelling expert who is helping with the rescue, told reporters at the site earlier on Tuesday.

(AP) Most of the trapped workers are migrant labourers from across the country. Many of their families have travelled to the location, where they have camped out for days to get updates on the rescue effort and in hopes of seeing their relatives soon. As the operation unfolded, the trapped workers were supplied with hot meals through a 15-centimetre pipe after days of surviving only on dry food sent through a narrower pipe. They got oxygen through a separate pipe, and more than a dozen doctors, including psychiatrists, were at the site monitoring their health. The labourers have been trapped since November 12 when a landslide caused a portion of the 4.5-kilometre tunnel they were building to collapse about 200 metres from the entrance. (AP) The tunnel the workers were building was designed as part of the Chardham all-weather road, which will connect various Hindu pilgrimage sites. Some experts say the project, a flagship initiative of the federal government, will exacerbate fragile conditions in the upper Himalayas, where several towns are built atop landslide debris. Large numbers of pilgrims and tourists visit Uttarakhand's many Hindu temples, with the number increasing over the years because of the continued construction of buildings and roadways.

Locals said the Indian army detained at least eight civilians on Friday for questioning, the day after rebels fighting against Indian rule ambushed two army vehicles in the southern Poonch district, killing four soldiers and wounding three others. Poonch is close to the highly militarized line of control that divides the disputed Himalayan region between India and Pakistan. Locals accused army personnel of torturing the three of those detained to death in a nearby military camp. The bodies were later handed to the local police who in turn contacted the families. Residents said the bodies bore marks of severe torture. The five other detainees were taken to an army hospital after they were severely tortured, their families said. Mohammed Younis, a resident, said soldiers came to his Topa Peer village in Poonch district Friday morning and detained nine villagers, including his two brothers and a cousin. An elderly man was let go, he said, but the others were ruthlessly beaten and electrocuted. RELATED COVERAGE India suspends water treaty and downgrades ties with Pakistan after deadly Kashmir attack Disputed Kashmir witnesses deadliest attack on civilians in years, sparking fears of rising tensions Vance calls for greater ties with India, hails progress on trade talks \u201cMy two brothers and a cousin are badly hurt due to torture. They are being treated in an army hospital,\u201d Younis said after seeing one of his brothers. Videos reportedly showing the torture of detained civilians spread online hours after their incarceration, triggering widespread anger. Authorities cut off internet services on smart devices in Poonch and nearby Rajouri on Saturday morning, a common tactic to dispel possible protests and discourage dissemination of the videos. Lt. Col. Suneel Bartwal, an Indian army spokesman, said a search operation for the militants responsible for the ambush has been ongoing since Thursday evening, adding he had no \u201cinput\u201d about the circumstances surrounding the death of the three civilians. Late Saturday, the Indian military said in a statement that \u201creports have been received regarding three civilian deaths\u201d in Poonch. \u201cThe matter is under investigation. Indian army stands committed to extending full support and cooperation in the conduct of investigations,\u201d it said. The government\u2019s information department wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that after medical formalities, a legal action \u201chas been initiated by the appropriate authority\u201d into the killings, without further explanation. It said authorities also announced financial assistance to the victims\u2019 families. Senior police and civil officials visited the village and supervised the burials. Local officials said police would investigate the incident, in an attempt to pacify the villagers. Protests erupted in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, with at least three pro-India Kashmiri political parties staging demonstrations against the killings. Mehbooba Mufti, the region\u2019s former top elected official who was once an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling party, said the recent acquittal of an army officer in the killing of three civilians in a staged gunbattle three years ago had \u201cemboldened\u201d the army, \u201ccreating a false precedent among the forces that they can operate without restraint.\u201d In 2020, the Indian army killed three young men from Rajouri in a fake gunfight and portrayed them as Pakistani terrorists. But after an outcry and a police investigation, the Indian military in a rare admission acknowledged wrongdoing and that its soldiers exceeded their legal powers granted to them under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. The Indian army\u2019s internal court had sentenced an officer to life imprisonment for the killings. However, a military tribunal in November this year suspended his sentence. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act gives the Indian military in Kashmir sweeping powers to search, seize and even shoot suspects on sight without fear of prosecution. Under the act, local authorities need federal approval to prosecute erring army or paramilitary soldiers in civilian courts. India has long relied on military force to retain control over the portion of Kashmir it administers and has fought two wars over the territory with Pakistan, which also claims the mountain region as its own. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Most Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and most Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. But the territory has simmered in anger since 2019, when New Delhi ended the region\u2019s semi-autonomy and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms while intensifying counterinsurgency operations. While Kashmir Valley, the heart of anti-India rebellion, has witnessed many militants killed in counter-rebel operations, remote Rajouri and Poonch have seen deadly attacks against Indian troops in the past two years. At least three dozen soldiers have been killed in such attacks.

Sunday's accident occurred when the Visakhapatnam-Palasa train was switching from the main track to a side track. Simultaneously, the Visakhapatnam-Rayagada train, travelling on the main track, rear-ended the other train, leading to the derailment of the last three coaches upon impact and damaging two severely. Vizianagaram SP Deepika Patil confirmed that \"at least 10 persons were killed, and over 25 were seriously injured in the accident. Four coaches of the Rayagada passenger train were involved\". However, East Coast Railway's Waltair division manager Saurabh Prasad said: \"Three coaches were involved in the accident.\" As the coaches were \"unreserved\", the details of the deceased passengers remain unknown. Officials fear that the toll may increase as some passengers may still be trapped inside the mangled coaches. Locals from nearby Kantakapalle village quickly initiated relief and rescue operations. They pulled out the trapped passengers and shifted the injured to hospitals. However, the pitch-dark conditions hampered these efforts. Authorities deployed emergency lights to assist police, railway personnel and other officials in the rescue effort. NDRF and SDRF teams were mobilised and ambulances were dispatched from Anakapalli and Visakhapatnam to attend to the injured. Some of the passengers were shifted to government hospital in Kothavalasa and KG Hospital in Visakhapatnam. The authorities formed special medical teams to treat the injured. The Vizianagaram SP said the toll may increase as some of the passengers are in critical condition. PM Narendra Modi expressed condolences to the bereaved families and extended his prayers for the swift recovery of the injured. Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed officials to provide relief and ensure prompt medical attention to the injured. The AP government announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh each to the kin of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh each to the injured natives of the state, and a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to the kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 each to the injured passengers from other states. An inquiry into the accident has been ordered, as the exact cause remains unclear. According to preliminary information, the Visakhapatnam-Palasa train was moving slowly between Kantakapalle and Alamanda. The other train was also travelling on the same route. As the dust settled, survivors recounted their harrowing experiences. Simhadri, a 30-year-old passenger on the Palasa train, described the jolting impact and the chaotic aftermath. He and others on board immediately participated in relief efforts and witnessed the extent of injuries among their fellow passengers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was jolted out of my seat. Other passengers too fell down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he saw more than 50 people injured and crying in pain. The luggage was thrown all over. Several trains were cancelled following the tragedy. The accident served as a reminder of the need for rail safety and preventive measures.

The MPs were protesting against last week's security breach in parliament. On Monday, the opposition accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government of attacking democracy after a record 78 MPs were suspended in one day. Most of the lawmakers have been barred for the rest of the winter session, which ends on Friday. But around two dozen of them may have to stay away for longer, depending on the decision of the parliament's privileges committee. Most of the suspended MPs are part of the INDIA alliance, a coalition of opposition parties that hopes to take on Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in next year's general election. The alliance has 142 MPs in the 543-member Lok Sabha - the lower house of parliament - of which 95 have now been suspended. It has 101 MPs in the 250-member upper house or Rajya Sabha (a few seats are vacant) - of these, 46 have been suspended. \"Unfortunately, we have to start writing obituaries for parliamentary democracy in India,\" Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday after being suspended. The governing BJP has accused the opposition leaders of deliberately disrupting parliament proceedings. The developments are expected to worsen already frosty relations between the opposition and Mr Modi's government. Intruders spray coloured gas in India parliament Key suspect arrested in India parliament breach Many opposition MPs had been demanding a statement in parliament from either federal Home Minister Amit Shah or Mr Modi on last week's security breach - two people entered parliament and set off coloured gas and shouted slogans, while two others protested outside parliament. Six people have been arrested so far in the case, with police charging the four protesters under a stringent anti-terror law. Police have not officially disclosed a motive, but media reports and the families of the accused have said the protesters were unemployed and wanted to express their frustration with the government's policies. The breach occurred on the 22nd anniversary of a deadly militant attack on the parliament. Opposition MPs have also asked for a discussion in parliament on the security lapse. Though Mr Modi did not speak in parliament on the issue, he told a Hindi newspaper that \"what happened is very serious\". \"There is no need to debate this, there should be a detailed investigation into this,\" he told the Dainik Jagran newspaper. Mr Shah has also not spoken in parliament, but said at an event that a high-level enquiry had been ordered into the incident and accused the opposition of politicising the security breach. \"PM can give an interview to a newspaper, home minister can give interviews to TV channels,\" said Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition Congress party. \"But they have zero accountability left to parliament, which represents the people of India.\" Mr Kharge, a member of the Rajya Sabha, has not been suspended yet. Manoj Kumar Jha, an MP from the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal, called his suspension \"a badge of honour\". \"It's a recognition that they are trying to suppress the questions we [opposition] are raising,\" he told reporters on Monday. Some opposition MPs including Mr Kharge have alleged that the government has deliberately suspended many opposition leaders to pass important bills without debate. But federal minister Piyush Goyal, who on Monday moved a motion to suspend 34 MPs in the upper house, called the opposition's protest a \"pre-planned strategy\" to disrupt the functioning of parliament and block important bills. He also accused opposition MPs of disrespecting the parliament and insulting the Lok Sabha speaker and Rajya Sabha chairman by refusing to heed their requests to not bring protest signs to the well of the house.

{"year":"2021","month":"01","event_desc":"12 January - The Supreme Court issues a stay order thereby suspending the implementation of the three new farm laws in the wake of the ongoing farmer protests.","text":"Home News India Farmers\u2019 protest | Supreme Court stays implementation of 3 controversial farm laws Court forms expert panel to hear apprehensions raised by farmers against the laws Updated - November 28, 2021 02:09 pm IST - NEW DELHI Krishnadas Rajagopal Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Firm intent: Farmers arriving to participate in the ongoing protest against the farm laws in New Delhi. R.V. Moorthy The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of three controversial farm laws , calling its order \u201cextraordinary\u201d and a \u201cvictory for fair play\u201d. The laws are: The Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act. The stay on their implementation means the Centre cannot, for the time being, proceed with any executive actions to enforce the laws. The court formed a four-member committee of experts \u201cto listen to the grievances of the farmers on the farm laws and the views of the government and make recommendations\u201d. ALSO READ Farmers\u2019 protest | Farmer leaders reject Supreme Court panel as a \u2018government ploy\u2019 At one point in the 11-page order, a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde said the formation of an expert committee \u201cmay create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers\u201d. The stay, the court said, \u201cmay assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers\u201d and make them confident enough to scythe their way to the negotiating table in good faith. In a concluding paragraph of the order, the court said the farmers\u2019 bodies would \u201cperceive\u201d the \u201cextraordinary\u201d stay as an achievement of their peaceful protest \u201cat least for the present\u201d. It may convince these organisations to \u201cencourage\u201d their members to go home to their livelihoods, and thus, protect their lives and health and that of others too. The court said several rounds of negotiations between the Centre and farmers had produced no results, even as senior citizens, women and children among the protesters were exposed to serious health hazards posed by the cold and COVID-19. It noted that deaths, not due to violence, but either of illness or by way of suicide, had occurred already. The court lauded the peaceful nature of the protests and stated that it did not want to stifle it. However, it noted Attorney General K.K. Venugopal\u2019s \u201csupport\u201d of a \u201cspecific averment\u201d by the Indian Kisan Union that an organisation, Sikhs for Justice, banned for anti-India secessionist movement, is financing the agitation. Reports of \u2018Khalistanis\u2019 In his turn, Mr. Venugopal orally remarked in the hearing that there were reports that \u201cKhalistanis\u201d had infiltrated the protests. The hearing on Tuesday took place in the absence of four senior lawyers, including senior advocate Dushyant Dave and advocate Prashant Bhushan, who had said they represent a bulk of the protesting farmers\u2019 organisations. The four had on Monday sought time to consult their clients and get back the next day with their views on the court\u2019s proposal to form an expert committee. Late Monday night, certain farmers\u2019 bodies issued a statement declining to go before any such committee. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for a party supporting the farm laws, said the four lawyers did not log into the virtual hearing on Tuesday. Chief Justice Bobde was, however, unperturbed by either the lawyers\u2019 absence or statement by farmers on Monday night. \u201cThere are as many opinions here as there are farmers. Let the organisations talk to the committee. You can either resolve the problem or you can agitate indefinitely without any purpose,\u201d he said. The court order made it clear that farmers\u2019 bodies \u201cshall\u201d participate in the discussions of the committee. \u201cThe representatives of all the farmers\u2019 bodies, whether they are holding a protest or not and whether they support or oppose the laws shall participate in the deliberations of the committee and put forth their view points,\u201d it directed. Committee members The committee consists of Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Dr. Parmod Kumar Joshi, agricultural economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, President, Shetkari Sanghatana. The order explained that both the government and farmers should take the court\u2019s effort to form a committee in the \u201cright spirit\u201d and consider it an attempt to reach a \u201cfair, equitable and just solution to problems\u201d. \u201cThere is no power on earth which can prevent us from forming the independent committee. We want to solve the problem. We want to understand the ground situation. This is not politics. You have to cooperate,\u201d Chief Justice Bobde told the farmers\u2019 side during the hearing. He said the implementation of the laws have been stayed to facilitate negotiations with the committee. \u201cThis is not an empty suspension of the laws... All people who want to genuinely resolve the problem should go to the committee... We are willing to suspend the law, but not indefinitely and without any activity on the ground. We don't want inactivity. We want to hear you tell the committee which part of the law needs to be changed, etc. You can go one by one and tell the committee what your problems are,\u201d he stated. The committee has to start work in 10 days and submit a report to the court in two months. The government would take care of their expenses. ALSO READ After refusal to discuss farm laws, Cong., Akali MPs walk out of Standing Committee meeting The court directed that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system in existence before the enactment of the farm laws should be maintained until further orders. In addition, the farmers\u2019 landholdings should be protected. \u201cThat is, no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws,\u201d it ordered. The three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector to remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. The government projected the laws as an antidote to lowering demands caused by the pandemic. However, protesting farmers consider the laws as a key to an exploitative regime that would ultimately lead to the loss of their lands. \u2018Basic misapprehension\u2019 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said farmers have fallen prey to the \u201cbasic misapprehension\u201d that the laws would lead to loss of agricultural land. \u201cThe law is only for voluntary contract farming of crops. Agricultural land will remain immune,\u201d he submitted. Advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, for some farmers, retorted, \u201cBut all farmers have is their land to pay in case of any damages\u201d. Senior advocate P. Wilson, for a section of farmers from Tamil Nadu, welcomed the stay. But the court recorded the submissions made by several sections of farmers who, on the other hand, supported the laws. Some even said they were aggrieved by the stay. Senior advocate V. Chitambaresh, for the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, said they were happy with the farm laws. Advocate Sridhar Potaraju, for the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association, which represents 15 farmers\u2019 unions across 15 States, said they would be \u201cbadly affected\u201d by the stay as their produce would rot. Advocate A.P. Singh, for the Bhartiya Kisan Union [BHANU], agreed to \u201cdissuade\u201d senior citizens, women and children from leaving the protest sites. Advocate Ajay Choudhary, for Kisan Maha Panchayat, submitted that the farmers protesting at the Rajasthan border were willing to appear before the expert committee.

On January 1, India, Norway, Kenya, Ireland and Mexico will join non-permanent members Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam and the five permanent members China, France, Russia, U.K. and the U.S. India will be UNSC President in August 2021 and will preside over the council again for a month in 2022. The presidency of the council is held by each of the members in turn for one month, following the English alphabetical order of the member states\u2019 names. \u201cAs the largest democracy\u2026we will be promoting very fundamental values like democracy, human rights and development,\u201d India\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T.S. Tirumurti told PTI . \u2018Let diversity flourish\u2019 India\u2019s message will also be to ensure \u201chow do we let diversity flourish in a united framework, which is in many ways the United Nations itself. This is something which India as a country, as what it stands for, will take to the council.\u201d Mr. Tirumurti said India will \u201cdefinitely\u201d emphasise on a greater need for cooperation in the council, where \u201cbecause of paralysis of decision making, urgent requirements do not get properly focused\u201d. \u201cWe would like to have a more cooperative structure in which we genuinely look out and find solutions and go beyond the rhetoric,\u201d the envoy said. India will also underscore the importance of respect for rule of law and international law. \u201cThe current multilateralism is not factoring in multipolarity. When you have a structure, which is able to accommodate the multipolarity in a multilateral framework, then automatically (there is) a more responsive, more rule-bound and more inclusive process,\u201d he said, adding that this will lead to reform in the multilateral system. \u201cBroadly, these are some messages we will carry in various degrees\u2026We will be a country which will reinforce multilateralism. That would be the biggest strength of India in many ways when it gets into the Security Council,\u201d he said. Mr. Tirumurti has outlined counter-terrorism; peacekeeping; maritime security; reformed multilateralism; technology; women, youth and developmental issues, especially in the context of peace-building, as India\u2019s priorities for the UNSC tenure. \u201cI feel India\u2019\u2019s presence in the Security Council is needed at this juncture when there are deep fissures between P-5 themselves and also between other countries. The UN is losing coherence and we hope to bring this back by focusing on issues of priority to all member states,\u201d Mr. Tirumurti said. India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the council. On the long-delayed UNSC reforms, Mr. Tirumurti said hardly any progress was made in the last decade. \u201cNot a single thing has moved. Is this the type of process we want or can we collectively come to a slightly better process which will yield results,\u201d he asked. He underlined that it was time for a \u201cgenuine process\u201d wherein member states work with a single text for negotiations. Mr. Tirumurti also said that in the last few months, he had tried to define India\u2019s interests a \u201cbit more sharply\u201d, including on the question of terrorism. \u201cWe have asked for terrorism to be pursued with a single-minded determination and not make excuses,\u201d the Indian envoy said. \u2018Strong voice for developing world\u2019 Mr. Tirumurti emphasised that India would be a strong voice for the developing world in the UNSC. Citing the example of issues related to Africa, including peacekeeping mandates, he said, \u201cIndia has always maintained that Africa should have a say in decisions pertaining to it and not have other countries alone decide.\u201d Similarly, \u201cif Afghanistan wants a peace process, let Afghanistan have a say in it. We will be a country which will stand up for developing countries.\u201d Addressing the virtual high-level General Assembly session in September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that as a Security Council member, India will not hesitate to raise its voice against enemies of humanity, including terrorism, and will speak in support of peace, security and prosperity. Mr. Modi had asserted that reform in the responses, processes and in the very character of the United Nations was the \u201cneed of the hour\u201d as he questioned, \u201cfor how long will India, the world\u2019s largest democracy and home to 1.3 billion people, be kept out of the decision-making structures of the UN.\u201d India, the endorsed candidate from the Asia-Pacific States, won 184 votes out of the 192 ballots cast in the elections in June for the five non-permanent seats of the Security Council.

New Delhi: Two vaccines for coronavirus, Oxford University's Covishield, which is being developed by the Pune-based Serum Institute, and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, received emergency approval from the country's drug regulator on Sunday. \"We'll never approve anything if there is slightest of safety concern. The vaccines are 110 per cent safe,\" Drug Controller General of India VG Somani said, adding Covishield was found to be 70.42 per cent effective and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was \"safe and provides a robust immune response\". Hailing the scientific community and frontline Corona warriors, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \"It would make every Indian proud that the two vaccines that have been given emergency use approval are made in India\". There is no word yet on when the vaccination process will begin. Here are the top 10 points in this big story: \"We'll never approve anything if there is slightest of safety concern. The vaccines are 110 per cent safe. Some side effects like mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine,\" Drug Controller General of India VG Somani said. The approval from the Drug Controller comes days after a government-appointed experts' panel gave clearance to the vaccines. Both vaccines have to be administered in two doses and stored at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The government will give priority to 1 crore healthcare workers and 2 crore frontline workers when the vaccinations begin, Union Health Minister Dr Harshvardhan said as a countrywide dry run for the vaccination process was conducted on Saturday. \"It would make every Indian proud that the two vaccines that have been given emergency use approval are made in India! This shows the eagerness of our scientific community to fulfil the dream of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, at the root of which is care and compassion,\" PM Modi tweeted. Pune-based Serum Institute, the Drug Controller General said, conducted Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials on 1,600 participants in India. Recommendation was made for restricted use and the trials will continue, he added. The vaccine, developed by the Oxford University and pharma giant AstraZenca is already in use abroad. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is conducting trials in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. The Drug Controller said that its Phase I and Phase II trials were conducted in around 800 people and the results showed that it is \"safe and provides a robust immune response\".\u00a0 The Phase III trial in on and 22,500 of the 25,800 participants have been vaccinated. The health ministry said the government's expert committee has reviewed Bharat Biotech's data on \"safety and immunogenicity\" and gave permission for \"restricted use in emergency situation in public interest\". The idea was to have \"more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains,\" the ministry said, adding that the clinical trials will continue. \"Happy new year, everyone! All the risks @SerumInstIndia\u00a0 took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off. COVISHIELD, India's first COVID-19 vaccine is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll-out in the coming weeks,\" Serum Institute chief Adar Poonawalla tweeted. \"It has been learnt that the vaccines of Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute have received emergency approval. All preparations are underway for the Delhi government. First health workers and frontline workers will be given the vaccine, Then those above age 50 will be given the vaccine. Health workers and frontline workers will be vaccinated under First phase,\" Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said. The vaccines will be given free of cost in Delhi, the minister earlier said. Flagging concerns over Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted, \"The Covaxin has not yet had Phase 3 trials. Approval was premature and could be dangerous. @drharshvardhan\u00a0 should please clarify. Its use should be avoided till full trials are over.

{"year":"2021","month":"01","event_desc":"14 January - Former NDTV journalist Nidhi Razdan announced that she fell prey to a serious phishing attack in 2020 that came as a job offer for a teaching position at Harvard University.","text":"This Article is From Jan 16, 2021 I Am Nidhi Razdan, Not A Harvard Professor, But... Nidhi Razdan Blog Jan 16, 2021 17:58 pm IST Published On Jan 16, 2021 16:39 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 16, 2021 17:58 pm IST Read Time: 8 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Back in June 2020, I had announced on Twitter that I was moving on from NDTV after nearly 21 years to join Harvard University as an Associate Professor to teach journalism. I truly believed it was a terrific opportunity. But here I am, almost eight months later, devastated by the realisation that this entire process to \"hire\" me; my \"appointment\" to Harvard was all part of an elaborate and sophisticated phishing attack to access my bank account, personal data, my emails, my medical records, passport and my devices like my computer and phone. I wanted to write this piece to explain what happened to me and hope that it serves as a lesson to everyone else. So how did this happen? In November of 2019, I was invited to speak at an event organised by the Harvard Kennedy School in early 2020. One of the apparent organisers of this event contacted me separately to say there was a vacancy for a teaching position and would I be interested. I submitted my CV, thinking I had nothing to lose by trying. I never really expected anything to come of it. A few weeks later I was \"interviewed\" online for 90 minutes. It all seemed legitimate, the questions were thorough and professional. I did a basic google search and found a journalism degree programme being offered by the Harvard Extension School. Contrary to what many are tweeting, Harvard has a school called the Extension School offering a Journalism Degree Programme . The actual programme is called the Master of Liberal Arts, Journalism degree. The Extension School lists 500 faculty of whom 17 are categorised as journalism faculty. A number of these people are working journalists. I believed I fit this profile. In January 2020, I got an email from an alleged Harvard Human Resources person from what appeared to be an official Harvard email ID, with an offer letter and agreement. The offer letter and the agreement appeared to be on a genuine letterhead with the University insignia, and contained the \"signatures\" of all senior Harvard University officials who actually do hold those positions even today. The emails from this individual were all marked to what appeared to be an official group university ID. They also separately emailed my former employers at NDTV and others for recommendation letters and official-looking acknowledgments were sent back to them. They too did not think anything was amiss. Over the next few months, many emails were exchanged between me and these alleged Harvard email IDs where they sought my personal information for a \"work visa\". I was also sent an \"official\" invitation to attend a faculty orientation in March 2020 but that was called off due to the pandemic. I honestly didn't think anything of it since COVID had suddenly started disrupting all our lives and lockdowns were being announced the world over. In June 2020, I quit NDTV and announced my decision to move to Harvard. Based on all the communication thus far, I had no doubts about the genuineness of the exercise. I was sent class schedules; details of the subjects I would be teaching; a detailed break up of my class. The classes were supposed to start online in September 2020 but were put off first till October and then January \"due to COVID\". Again, I didn't think anything was amiss. I had been told a work visa had been issued in the US for me which would be sent to me only when travel was required. I would have also needed a visa from Delhi but it never reached that stage since no travel was on the cards immediately. However, I had started to get frustrated with the administrative processes and expressed the same repeatedly on email. I was also told my salary would be paid irrespective from September 2020 but no money ever came. It was all blamed on chaos due to COVID or IT failures. At one point they even sent me a bank transfer slip even though no money ever came. By now I realised something wasn't right. I still didn't imagine this was a massive fraud but thought it was lack of coordination between university departments. In December, I wrote to the head of HR at Harvard but didn't hear back. Then in January I wrote to the office of the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. It was only earlier this week that I heard back from them telling me there was no record of my appointment and that the people claiming to be their HR staff do not exist! I wrote back to Harvard expressing shock at this and urged them to take this matter seriously since there are people impersonating their senior staff and even forging their signatures on fake letterheads, including the Vice President of HR and their Chief Financial Officer. I also immediately wrote to those entities or organisations with whom I was associated and told them what had happened. My lawyer read all the emails and realised that this was a massive phishing exercise, in all likelihood aimed at stealing my money and taking my personal data to misuse it. I have filed a police complaint and handed over all the documents and communication. This was a gross criminal act. I am very shaken by this and keep kicking myself for being such an idiot. With the benefit of hindsight, could I have done more due diligence? Absolutely, yes. But these scams succeed because they look so real. What these scamsters put together was good enough for me to throw away a 21-year career in TV. In hindsight, I guess I never saw any cause for alarm because of the pandemic and the chaos and disruption it had caused the world over. Also, because no one ever asked me for money, this was a very sophisticated attack. And that there is a lesson for me and for us all - never trust anything online. I am angry, disappointed and upset but also relieved that I found out what was going on and alerted authorities including Harvard before any serious damage was done. If after all this the only thing I can be accused of is being stupid, then I'll take it on the chin, learn from it and move on. (Nidhi Razdan is former Executive Editor, NDTV.)

Swedish climate activist Thunberg tweeted her backing this month for the farmers, who have been demonstrating since December against agricultural reforms they say will harm their livelihood but benefit large corporations. She shared a document which she said was a toolkit to create and spread awareness about the farmers\u2019 complaints.

File Photo. It seeks to curb the \u2018emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion\u2019 The Gujarat Assembly on Thursday passed the Freedom of Religion Act, 2003 amendment Bill that seeks to penalise forcible or fraudulent religious conversion by marriage or \u201clove jihad\u201d, bringing in stringent provisions against forcible conversion through marriage or allurement. The Bill has provisions for 3-10 years in jail and a fine of up to \u20b95 lakh if the accused is found guilty. The Bill amends a 2003 Act, and seeks to curb the \u201cemerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion\u201d as per its \u201cstatement of object.\u201d The Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, deals with religious conversion \u201cthrough allurement, force or by misrepresentation or by any other fraudulent means\u201d. The Gujarat amendment Bill says it is necessary to prohibit \u201cforcible conversion by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married\u201d, and hence the amendment is being carried out in the law. \u201cHowever, there are episodes of religious conversion promising better lifestyle, divine blessings and impersonation. There is an emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion,\u201d the Bill says. The amendment also defines \u201callurement\u201d as promising \u201cbetter lifestyle, divine blessings, or otherwise\u201d. Piloting the amendment Bill in the house, Gujarat\u2019s Minister of State for Home Pradipsinh Jadeja said \u201cthe amendment was required to stop people from luring Hindu girls into marriage with the intention of religious conversion\u201d and added that \u201cthere is international finance being channelised to lure Hindu girls into marriage and then their conversion.\u201d During the marathon debate on the Bill, Congress legislator Imran Khedavala, while opposing the amendment, tore the copy of the Bill and subsequently apologised for it. Opposition party members opposed the amendment calling the BJP\u2019s plank communal plank while senior Congress legislator Gyasuddin Sheikh even produced over a dozen marriage certificates or affidavits of Hindu boys marrying Muslim girls. Gujarat\u2019s Deputy CM Nitin Patel contended that the amendment was not to target any specific community and if Hindu boys forced girls of other communities, they would also face the same law and rules. As per the provisions of the Bill, \u201cForcible conversion by marriage or by getting a person married\u201d shall invite imprisonment of 3-5 years and up to \u20b92 lakh fine. If the victim is a minor, a woman, a Dalit or tribal, then the offenders may be punished with a jail term of 4-7 years and a fine of not less than \u20b93 lakh. If any organisation is found violating the law, the person in-charge can be sentenced to between three years and 10 years in jail and a fine of up to \u20b95 lakh can be imposed. Additionally, marriages solemnised for the purpose of such conversion will be declared void and the burden of proof shall lie on the accused. Parents, siblings or any other person related by blood, marriage or adoption to the victim can lodge the complaint and the offences shall be non-bailable.

Adani Ports removed from S&P index due to links with Myanmar military It will be removed from the index prior to the open on Thursday, April 15, it said in a statement on Tuesday. Reuters Published 13 Apr 2021, 07:48 AM IST India\u2019s Adani Group said on March 31 it would consult authorities and stakeholders on its port project in Myanmar S&P Dow Jones Indices said it has removed India's Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd from its sustainability index due to the firm's business ties with Myanmar's military which is accused of human rights abuses after a coup this year. India's largest private multi-port operator is building a $290 million port in Yangon on land leased from the military-backed Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC). It will be removed from the index prior to the open on Thursday, April 15, it said in a statement on Tuesday. More than 700 people have been killed since a Feb.1 military coup that ousted an elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. The port developer did not immediately respond to a Reuters emailed request for comment outside of regular business hours. India's Adani Group said on March 31 it would consult authorities and stakeholders on its port project in Myanmar, after human rights groups reported its subsidiary had agreed to pay millions of dollars in rent to the military-controlled firm.

APSEZ is building a container terminal with an investment of $290 million along Myanmar\u2019s Yangon river on a 50-year deal. \u201cAPSEZ\u00a0 will be removed from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices following a media and stakeholder analysis triggered by recent news events pointing to heightened risks to the company regarding their commercial relationship with Myanmar\u2019s military, who are alleged to have committed serious human rights abuses under international law,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices said. APSEZ will be removed from the index prior to the market opening on Thursday, it added. Setback for the group The removal is a setback for the Adani Group that\u00a0 has been striving to raise its sustainability profile for securing access to new debt and equity capital with environmental, social and governance\u00a0 risk evaluation increasingly playing a prominent role in global financial markets, a port industry consultant said. The Yangon terminal will be built under the auspices of the Myanmar Port Authority and the Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communication. The project is helmed by Adani Yangon International Terminal Co Ltd, a unit of APSEZ. The Ahlone International Port Terminal 2 (AIPT 2) will be developed over 54 acres leased from the Myanmar Economic Corporation Ltd (MEC), which is currently operating AIPT 1. ITD Cementation India Ltd is undertaking the EPC work for the project.

Following a backlash, APSEZ said that \u201cthe land acquisition for the project was facilitated by the Myanmar Investments Commission led by U Thaung Tun, its Chairman and Minister of Investment and Foreign Economic Relations, under the guidance of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy government.\u201d \u201cMuch like our global peers, we are watching the situation in Myanmar carefully and will engage with the relevant authorities and stakeholders to seek their advice on the way forward.

Subramanium The Supreme Court on Friday warned State governments and police against clamping down on the spread of information or calls for help through social media from citizens affected by COVID-19. A Special Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat said any move by any State to punish citizens who take to the social media to seek help for oxygen cylinders, COVID-19 drugs, beds, hospitalisation, etc, amid a rampaging second wave would attract contempt of court action. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any clampdown of information. We will treat it as a contempt of court if such grievances is considered for action. Let a strong message go to all the States and DGPs of States. Clampdown of information is contrary to basic precepts,\u201d Justice Chandrachud made a categorical statement in court. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the litigation was non-adversarial. \u201cAs an officer of the court, I fully agree with what Your Lordships have said,\u201d Mr. Mehta agreed. 1970 famine Justice Chandrachud said free flow of information in the 1970 famine enabled the government to tackle problem effectively as compared to clampdown during the 1918 pandemic. Justice Rao reminded the States that this was a time of great crisis. The Bench said empathy and action should be the rule of the day. At one point, Justice Chandrachud questioned how the Centre intended to ensure registration for vaccines for illiterate people considering the fact that COWIN app registration was mandatory. Vaccine price The Bench also asked how the Centre expected a sense of equity from the vaccine manufacturers. Justice Bhat pointed out that manufacturers were charging \u20b9150 from the Centre while vaccines to the States were priced at \u20b9300. \u201cWhy should we as a nation pay this? The price difference becomes \u20b930 to 40,000 crore... AstraZeneca is providing vaccines at far lower price to the U.S. citizens then why should we be paying so much?\u201d Justice Bhat asked. The Bench asked why the Centre had not considered using powers under Section 92 of Patents Act for compulsory licensing of the COVID-19 vaccines. The court asked why the Centre had not procured 100% of the vaccines and equitably distributed them across the country, but was instead leaving it to manufacturers. The court said the Centre could not possible enforce equity in vaccine distribution when it was itself buying only 50% doses. Vaccine manufacturing was publicly funded and vaccines were public property, the court noted. \u201cWhy cannot the government buy the entire doses of vaccines,\u201d the court asked. The Bench asked whether, now, one State would get priority access over another in getting the vaccines. The court asked why the government could not follow a national immunisation programme policy with respect to vaccines. The court turned to the plight of medical workers, nurses and doctors. It said it was not enough to declare them \u2018COVID Warriors\u2019, what was being done for them on the ground. \u201cWhat is being done for shortage of medical staff? How are doctors being safeguarded and treated for COVID-19,\u201d Justice Chandrachud asked the government.

While initial news reports said that 20 critically ill patients died overnight, the hospital informed the Delhi high court that 25 people died because it did not have oxygen supply. Yesterday 25 people died because we didn\u2019t have oxygen supply : Jaipur Golden Hospital mentions the matter. We are literally gasping for breath : Senior Adv Sachin Dutta \u2014 Bar & Bench (@barandbench) April 24, 2021 Deep Baluja, the hospital\u2019s medical director, told Hindustan Times that the patients were in the critical care unit and required a high flow of oxygen. \u201cOur liquid medical oxygen was over by about 10 pm and then we switched over to the oxygen cylinders attached to the main gas pipeline. There was a drop in pressure and the patients could not survive,\u201d Baluja said. According to reports, the hospital was expected to receive its quota of oxygen at 5:30 pm on Friday, but only received it at midnight. The supply was also just 40% of its allocated quota, a sign of the crisis that hospitals in the national capital are facing. Several hospitals have moved the Delhi high court or have issued SOS appeals on social media to highlight the shortage of oxygen. At the Ganga Ram hospital, 25 patients died due to lack of oxygen on Friday. \u201cWe are again in a situation of crisis, 200 lives are on the line. Last night we were at least able to save most patients. We will not be able to do that today. We have exhausted our backup,\u201d Baluja told Hindustan Times . At 10:42 am, reports said that the hospital has probably another 30 minutes of supply left. \u201cNobody has promised anything. Everybody is saying we will do our best,\u201d the medical director told news agency PTI, when asked if the hospital received any help from the government. Dr Baluja said the hospital has over 200 patients and 80 per cent of them are on oxygen support. Around 35 patients are in the ICU, he said. On Friday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal once again flagged the severe shortage of oxygen in Delhi\u2019s hospitals. During a meeting hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers, Kejriwal said, \u201cWe fear a big tragedy may happen due to oxygen shortage and we will never be able to forgive ourselves.

Muraleedharan's convoy attacked at West Bengal.","text":"Litigation News [BREAKING] Supreme Court strikes down Maratha Reservation law for exceeding 50 percent cap; upholds Indra Sawhney, 102nd Constitutional Amendment \"Exceeding ceiling limit of 50 percent laid down by Indra Sawhney is violative of Articles 14 and 15,\" the Court held. Maratha reservation and supreme court Debayan Roy Published on : 05 May 2021, 5:10 am 6 min read Copied The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 which extends reservation to the Maratha community in public education and employment ( Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil v. Chief Minister ). The Court said that there were no extraordinary circumstances to grant reservation to Maratha community over and above the 50 percent ceiling on reservation prescribed by the Supreme Court in its 1992 judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. \" The 2018 Act as amended in 2019 granting reservation for Maratha community does not make out any exceptional circumstance to exceed the ceiling limit of 50 percent reservation,\" the Court held. The Act of 2018 violates the principles of equality and exceeding ceiling limit of 50 percent clearly violates Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution, the Court added. In the process the Court also ruled that the judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India need not be referred to larger Bench and the 50 percent ceiling on reservation laid down in Indra Sawhney is good law. \"We do not find any substance in the argument to refer the judgment in Indra Sawhney to a larger Bench. The said judgment has been repeatedly followed by this Court and has received approved by at least four Constitution Benches of this Court. We also follow and reiterate the proposition laid down in Indra Sawhney in paragraph 809 and 810,\" the Court made it clear. The Court further said that neither the Gaikwad Commission report nor the judgment of the Bombay High Court has made out an extraordinary situation in the case of Marathas so as to exceed the ceiling of 50 percent. \"Conclusions of the commission are unsustainable. There is no case of extraordinary situation for exceeding the ceiling limit of 50 percent for grant of reservation to Marathas over and above the 50 percent,\" the Court  emphasised. The judgment was delivered by a Constitution bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat . The judgments on the above aspects was unanimous. However, the Bench differed on the interpretation of Article 342A of the Constitution which was inserted by 102nd Constitutional Amendment. Article 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state. The question before the Court was whether the said Article deprived the States of the power to classify any community as SEBC. Justices Bhushan and Nazeer took the view that by Article 342A, the parliament did not intend to take away the power of States to identify backward classes. They upheld the 102nd Constitutional amendment which inserted Article 342A. However, Justice Rao, Bhat and Gupta held that under Article 342A, the President alone is empowered to identify SEBC and notify in the list. States can only make suggestions for inclusion of SEBC in that list. However, they too upheld the 102nd Amendment. The following is the operative part of the judgment: - Appeals challenging the Bombay High Court judgment are allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. - Section 2(j) of the Act insofar as it declares Maratha community as -Educationally and Socially Backward category is held to be ultra vires the Constitution and is struck down. - Section 4(1)(a) of the Act insofar as it grants reservation under Article 15(4) to the extent of 12 percent of the total seats in educational institutions including private institutions whether aided or unaided other than minority institutions is declared ultra vires the Constitution and is struck down. - Section 4(1)(b) of the Act granting reservation upto 13 percent for Maratha community in total appointment in direct recruitment with respect to public services and posts under the State is held to be ultra vires the Constitution and struck down. - Admissions to post graduate courses which were already held up till the interim order of the Supreme Court in September 9, 2020 will not to be affected by the judgment. Hence, those who have already been admitted in post graduate courses till then shall be allowed to continue. - All appointments made to public services in favour of Maratha community after the judgment of the High Court till interim order of the Supreme Court on September 9, 2020 are saved. - Challenge to 102 nd Constitutional Amendment dismissed. The Act The Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, which enacted providing for 16 percent reservation for the Maratha community in educational institutions and government employment. The Act came to be challenged before the Bombay High Court by the petitioners as being a fraud on the Constitution of India, as it proposed to hike the reservation in Maharashtra from 52 percent to 68 percent. This, it was contended, was in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. It was further contended that after the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act which came into force with effect from August 2018, the State legislature is denuded of its power to declare a particular class to be socially and educationally backward. Article 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state. Bombay High Court judgment The Bombay High Court upheld the validity of the law while ruling that Indra Sawhney does not impose any State\u2019s power to exceed reservation more than 50% in a deserving case. Extraordinary circumstance warrant exceeding of the 50 percent cap on reservation in the State, the Bench held. The Court also held that 102 nd Amendment by which Article 342A was inserted does not deprive State of its powers to specify the socially and educationally backward classes in the list prepared by the State. The High Court ruled that the restriction under Article 342A is applicable only to the list prepared by the Central government. \"The existence of central list of backward classes is distinct from the list of the State which is prepared by the State for translating the enabling power conferred on it and in any contingency, Article 342-A cannot be read to control the enabling power conferred on the State under Article 15 and 16,\u201d the High Court said. Appeal before Supreme Court Appeals were filed before the Supreme Court against the High Court verdict. In July 2019, the Supreme Court issued notice to State of Maharashtra in the appeals. In September 2020, a three-judge Bench referred the matter to a Constitution Bench taking into account the Constitutional issues involved in the matter. On March 8, 2021, the top court decided to hear all States in the matter, after Senior Counsel Mukul Rohtagi, Kapil Sibal and Dr. AM Singhvi contended that the case involves issue which impacts all States since any judgment in the matter could impact the powers of the State to extend reservation to socially and educationally backward classes. This was also supported by Attorney General KK Venugopal. Issues heard by the Supreme Court Final hearings in the matter had commenced on March 15, 2021 and the hearing last for ten days before the Court reserved its judgment on March 26. The following legal issues were heard by the Court: - Whether judgment in case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India [1992 Suppl. (3) SCC 217] needs to be referred to larger bench or require re-look by the larger bench in the light of subsequent Constitutional Amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics of the society etc? - Whether the SEBC Act of 2018 as amended in 2019 granting 12 percent and 13 percent reservation for Maratha community in addition to 50 percent social reservation is covered by exceptional circumstances as contemplated by Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney\u2019s case? - Whether the State Government on the strength of Maharashtra State Backward Commission Report chaired by M.C. Gaikwad has made out a case of existence of extraordinary situation and exceptional circumstances in the State to fall within the exception carved out in the judgment of Indra Sawhney? - Whether the Constitution 102nd Amendment deprives the State Legislature of its power to enact a legislation determining the socially and economically backward classes? - Whether States power to legislate in relation to \u201cany backward class\u201d under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) is anyway abridged by Article 342(A) read with Article 366(26c) of the Constitution of India? - Whether Article 342A of the Constitution abrogates States power to legislate or classify in respect of \u201cany backward class of citizens\u201d and thereby affects the federal policy \/ structure of the Constitution of India?

Article 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state. Bombay High Court judgment The Bombay High Court upheld the validity of the law while ruling that Indra Sawhney does not impose any State\u2019s power to exceed reservation more than 50% in a deserving case. Extraordinary circumstance warrant exceeding of the 50 percent cap on reservation in the State, the Bench held. The Court also held that 102 nd Amendment by which Article 342A was inserted does not deprive State of its powers to specify the socially and educationally backward classes in the list prepared by the State. The High Court ruled that the restriction under Article 342A is applicable only to the list prepared by the Central government. \"The existence of central list of backward classes is distinct from the list of the State which is prepared by the State for translating the enabling power conferred on it and in any contingency, Article 342-A cannot be read to control the enabling power conferred on the State under Article 15 and 16,\u201d the High Court said. Appeal before Supreme Court Appeals were filed before the Supreme Court against the High Court verdict. In July 2019, the Supreme Court issued notice to State of Maharashtra in the appeals. In September 2020, a three-judge Bench referred the matter to a Constitution Bench taking into account the Constitutional issues involved in the matter. On March 8, 2021, the top court decided to hear all States in the matter, after Senior Counsel Mukul Rohtagi, Kapil Sibal and Dr. AM Singhvi contended that the case involves issue which impacts all States since any judgment in the matter could impact the powers of the State to extend reservation to socially and educationally backward classes. This was also supported by Attorney General KK Venugopal. Issues heard by the Supreme Court Final hearings in the matter had commenced on March 15, 2021 and the hearing last for ten days before the Court reserved its judgment on March 26. The following legal issues were heard by the Court: - Whether judgment in case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India [1992 Suppl. (3) SCC 217] needs to be referred to larger bench or require re-look by the larger bench in the light of subsequent Constitutional Amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics of the society etc? - Whether the SEBC Act of 2018 as amended in 2019 granting 12 percent and 13 percent reservation for Maratha community in addition to 50 percent social reservation is covered by exceptional circumstances as contemplated by Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney\u2019s case? - Whether the State Government on the strength of Maharashtra State Backward Commission Report chaired by M.C. Gaikwad has made out a case of existence of extraordinary situation and exceptional circumstances in the State to fall within the exception carved out in the judgment of Indra Sawhney? - Whether the Constitution 102nd Amendment deprives the State Legislature of its power to enact a legislation determining the socially and economically backward classes? - Whether States power to legislate in relation to \u201cany backward class\u201d under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) is anyway abridged by Article 342(A) read with Article 366(26c) of the Constitution of India? - Whether Article 342A of the Constitution abrogates States power to legislate or classify in respect of \u201cany backward class of citizens\u201d and thereby affects the federal policy \/ structure of the Constitution of India?

Union of India verdict and One Hundred and Second Amendment of the Constitution of India.","text":"Litigation News [BREAKING] Supreme Court strikes down Maratha Reservation law for exceeding 50 percent cap; upholds Indra Sawhney, 102nd Constitutional Amendment \"Exceeding ceiling limit of 50 percent laid down by Indra Sawhney is violative of Articles 14 and 15,\" the Court held. Maratha reservation and supreme court Debayan Roy Published on : 05 May 2021, 5:10 am 6 min read Copied The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 which extends reservation to the Maratha community in public education and employment ( Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil v. Chief Minister ). The Court said that there were no extraordinary circumstances to grant reservation to Maratha community over and above the 50 percent ceiling on reservation prescribed by the Supreme Court in its 1992 judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. \" The 2018 Act as amended in 2019 granting reservation for Maratha community does not make out any exceptional circumstance to exceed the ceiling limit of 50 percent reservation,\" the Court held. The Act of 2018 violates the principles of equality and exceeding ceiling limit of 50 percent clearly violates Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution, the Court added. In the process the Court also ruled that the judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India need not be referred to larger Bench and the 50 percent ceiling on reservation laid down in Indra Sawhney is good law. \"We do not find any substance in the argument to refer the judgment in Indra Sawhney to a larger Bench. The said judgment has been repeatedly followed by this Court and has received approved by at least four Constitution Benches of this Court. We also follow and reiterate the proposition laid down in Indra Sawhney in paragraph 809 and 810,\" the Court made it clear. The Court further said that neither the Gaikwad Commission report nor the judgment of the Bombay High Court has made out an extraordinary situation in the case of Marathas so as to exceed the ceiling of 50 percent. \"Conclusions of the commission are unsustainable. There is no case of extraordinary situation for exceeding the ceiling limit of 50 percent for grant of reservation to Marathas over and above the 50 percent,\" the Court  emphasised. The judgment was delivered by a Constitution bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat . The judgments on the above aspects was unanimous. However, the Bench differed on the interpretation of Article 342A of the Constitution which was inserted by 102nd Constitutional Amendment. Article 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state. The question before the Court was whether the said Article deprived the States of the power to classify any community as SEBC. Justices Bhushan and Nazeer took the view that by Article 342A, the parliament did not intend to take away the power of States to identify backward classes. They upheld the 102nd Constitutional amendment which inserted Article 342A. However, Justice Rao, Bhat and Gupta held that under Article 342A, the President alone is empowered to identify SEBC and notify in the list. States can only make suggestions for inclusion of SEBC in that list. However, they too upheld the 102nd Amendment. The following is the operative part of the judgment: - Appeals challenging the Bombay High Court judgment are allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. - Section 2(j) of the Act insofar as it declares Maratha community as -Educationally and Socially Backward category is held to be ultra vires the Constitution and is struck down. - Section 4(1)(a) of the Act insofar as it grants reservation under Article 15(4) to the extent of 12 percent of the total seats in educational institutions including private institutions whether aided or unaided other than minority institutions is declared ultra vires the Constitution and is struck down. - Section 4(1)(b) of the Act granting reservation upto 13 percent for Maratha community in total appointment in direct recruitment with respect to public services and posts under the State is held to be ultra vires the Constitution and struck down. - Admissions to post graduate courses which were already held up till the interim order of the Supreme Court in September 9, 2020 will not to be affected by the judgment. Hence, those who have already been admitted in post graduate courses till then shall be allowed to continue. - All appointments made to public services in favour of Maratha community after the judgment of the High Court till interim order of the Supreme Court on September 9, 2020 are saved. - Challenge to 102 nd Constitutional Amendment dismissed. The Act The Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, which enacted providing for 16 percent reservation for the Maratha community in educational institutions and government employment. The Act came to be challenged before the Bombay High Court by the petitioners as being a fraud on the Constitution of India, as it proposed to hike the reservation in Maharashtra from 52 percent to 68 percent. This, it was contended, was in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. It was further contended that after the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act which came into force with effect from August 2018, the State legislature is denuded of its power to declare a particular class to be socially and educationally backward. Article 342A calls for the identification of communities in States as socially and educationally backward classes by the President, in consultation with the Governor of the state.

The Court also held that 102 nd Amendment by which Article 342A was inserted does not deprive State of its powers to specify the socially and educationally backward classes in the list prepared by the State. The High Court ruled that the restriction under Article 342A is applicable only to the list prepared by the Central government. \"The existence of central list of backward classes is distinct from the list of the State which is prepared by the State for translating the enabling power conferred on it and in any contingency, Article 342-A cannot be read to control the enabling power conferred on the State under Article 15 and 16,\u201d the High Court said. Appeal before Supreme Court Appeals were filed before the Supreme Court against the High Court verdict. In July 2019, the Supreme Court issued notice to State of Maharashtra in the appeals. In September 2020, a three-judge Bench referred the matter to a Constitution Bench taking into account the Constitutional issues involved in the matter.

The Court order said that Chawla abused the process of law. The court imposed a fine of \u20b9 20 lakhs, according to news agency ANI. In its order, the Delhi High Court said that \"it appears that the suit was for publicity\". It said Juhi Chawla circulated the link of the hearing on social media which created disruption thrice. \"Delhi Police shall identify the persons and take action against those who created disruption,\" the court added. In her plea, Juhi had sought a direction to the authorities to certify to the public at large that how 5G technology is safe to humans, animals and every type of living organism, flora and fauna. However, during the first hearing , the court termed as 'defective' the lawsuit and said it was filed for 'media publicity'. It also questioned Chawla for filing the suit without giving any representation to the government on her concerns related to the technology. The court said that Chawla and others were required to first approach the government for their rights instead of approaching it. The counsel, appearing for the Centre, said the 5G policy did not fall in the category of public nuisance and it was obviously not prohibited in law. The counsel representing private telecom companies said that launching of 5G technology is a policy of the government and as it is a policy, it cannot be a wrongful act. According to PTI, Chawla's counsel had argued that if the telecom industry\u2019s plans for 5G come to fruition, no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are 10x to 100x times greater than what exists today. \u201cThis suit will reveal a complete sell-out by the regulatory agencies who, statutorily, have been tasked to protect the health and life of the public, but whose actions reveal an utter derogation of their own statutory duty in order to advance private interests...,\u201d the plea alleged. \u201cSince \u2018prevention\u2019 is well-accepted to be far better than \u2018cure\u2019, immediate measures must be taken to protect humanity and the environment, in accordance with ethical imperatives as well as formal international agreements, before such harm is actually unleashed,\u201d it said. The plea also said that in April 2019, Brussels became the first major city in the world to halt any further steps in the 5G rollout on account of health hazards. \u201cIn fact, as recently as on May 5, 2021, the Parliament of Belgium, still not willing to allow 5G rollout in Brussels, invited 45 ordinary citizens drawn at random to address it on their concerns, assuring them that the 5G roll-out will not be permitted till they are heard by Parliament and their concerns are properly and fully addressed,\u201d the plea said.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court was informed on Thursday that a trial court has ordered 'immediate release' from jail of Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal who were granted bail on June 15 in the north-east Delhi riots case. \"That's wonderful,\" said a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani after noting the submissions. It said no further orders are called for and disposed of the pleas by the three students seeking forthwith release from jail on the ground that even after 36 hours of passing of the bail orders the accused have not yet been released. The high court was informed by the counsel for the accused that the trial court passed order earlier in the day allowing their interim release, subject to verification of documents and addresses and that the release warrants have been sent to the jail superintendent through electronic mode. The bench, convened at 3.30PM in pursuance to its order passed in the morning in which it asked the trial court to decide with \"promptitude\" and \"expedition\" the issue of release of the three accused from jail. It had asked the counsel to jointly mention the matter before the trial court at 12 PM, which thereafter, ordered forthwith release of the accused from the jail as per the orders of the Delhi High Court. The counsel for Tanha submitted an undertaking before the trial court that he will not leave Delhi. The high court said, \"Once the trial court has issued release orders to the jail superintendent, that is the end of the matter. Nothing more needs to be done. The first step we need to cross today is your release.\" During the hearing, senior advocate Siddharth Aggarwal, representing Tanha, submitted that the high court in its June 4 order, by which he was granted interim custody bail to appear in exams, had put a condition that at the end of the interim bail, the student shall deposit his laptop with the special cell for forensic audit. He said he was ready to submit his laptop but this condition shall not stall his release. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, representing Delhi Police , submitted that in view of the regular bail granted to the accused, the state does not wish to conduct forensic audit anymore. The high court also noted that since it has already clarified in its June 15 bail order that this order supersedes the June 4 interim custody bail order, no other clarification needs to be made. During the hearing earlier in the day, the high court said, \"The trial court is expected to proceed further with promptitude and expedition and decide the issue placed before it,\" and added \"our order has to be implemented there cannot be two views on that\". It said that its direction was to the effect of forthwith release of the accused and the \"trial court cannot be lax about it once the order is passed by this court\". The accused' counsel said the police was delaying the verification process and it was a delaying tactics. The counsel said the trial court Wednesday did not pass the order on their release saying it was already 6 PM and listed the matter for Thursday. \"The high court's orders are not being implemented in a manner by not passing an order,\" he contended. The prosecutor submitted that they were not obstructing the release of the accused but they do not have the magical powers to verify the addresses of the accused from Jharkhand and Assam and other places in a short span of time. The high court had on June 15 granted bail to Pinjra Tod activists Narwal and Kalita and Tanha, who were arrested in May last year under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with a case related to larger conspiracy in the north east Delhi riots in February last year. The three students were not being released from the jail on time citing lack of verification details of their addresses and sureties. As per the procedure, on being granted bail, the accused are required to furnish personal bond and surety before the trial court which issues their release warrants after verification of documents. Communal clashes had broken out in north east Delhi on February 24 last year after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and more than 200 injured.

All three accused had fled overseas. The agency said it recently transferred attached shares worth \u20b96,600 crore to a State Bank of India-led consortium as per an order of PMLA Special Court, Mumbai. On Wednesday, the Debt Recovery Tribunal, on behalf of the consortium, sold the shares of United Breweries Limited for \u20b95,824.50 crore. Further realisation of \u20b9800 crore by sale of shares is expected by June 25.

Worldview with Suhasini Haidar | The Mehul Choksi extradition case Based on the cases registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the ED had taken up money laundering probe that helped unearth a complex web of domestic and international transactions and stashing of assets abroad by the accused persons and their associates. They had used dummy entities controlled by them for rotation and siphoning of the funds provided by the banks. As part of the investigation, the ED took steps to attach or seize assets worth \u20b918,170.02 crore, which included properties worth \u20b9969 crore located in foreign countries. \u201cThe quantum of the attached and seized assets represents 80.45% of total bank loss of \u20b9 22,585.83 crore,\u201d said the agency. A substantial part of the assets in question was held in the name of dummy entities, trusts, third persons or relatives of these accused and these entities were their proxies for holding the properties. Prosecution complaints were filed against all the three accused after completion of the investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act . Extradition requests were sent for them to the United Kingdom (Mr. Mallya and Mr. Modi) and Antigua and Barbuda (Mr. Choksi). The extradition of Mr. Mallya has been ordered by the Westminster Magistrates Court and confirmed by the U.K. High Court. As he has been denied permission to file an appeal in the U.K. Supreme Court, his extradition to India has become final. However, the matter is pending with the U.K.'s Home Department for quite some time now. The Westminster Magistrates Court had also ordered the extradition of Mr. Modi to India . After his arrest in 2019, on a request from the Indian authorities, he has been in judicial custody in a London jail for the last over two years. Mr. Choksi, who was recently found in Dominica after he disappeared from Antigua under mysterious circumstances, is also facing extradition proceedings. He has alleged that he was abducted by some persons.

Economic Times ' reasoning for the drop was far more prosaic: the now frozen funds have an investment of Rs 43,500 crore in the Adani group of companies. The accounts were frozen on or before May 31, the report added, possibly due to \"insufficient disclosure of information regarding beneficial ownership\". Consequently, the shares of Adani Enterprises fell by 20 percent, its sharpest fall in 10 years, and Adani Ports by 19 percent, ET reported. On Twitter, though, the memes and jokes kept coming, connecting these seemingly unconnected events. Dalal, for those unfamiliar, is credited with unearthing the 1992 securities scam involving the late Harshad Mehta.

Interestingly amidst this spike, customer account deposits witnessed a dip while money deposited through bonds, securities and other financial instruments rose sharply.","text":"Indians' funds in Swiss banks climb to Rs 20,700 crore, highest in 13 years Funds held by Indians in Swiss banks rose to Rs 20,700 crore in 2020, data released by Switzerland's central bank has revealed. Listen to Story Live TV Share Advertisement File photo of the Swiss National Bank office building in Zurich (Picture Courtesy: www.snb.ch) Press Trust of India New Delhi,Zurich , UPDATED: Jun 17, 2021 20:59 IST In Short 'Other amounts due to customers' from India rose over six times Overall, customer deposits in all Swiss banks rose in 2020 to nearly CHF (Swiss franc) 2 trillion Swiss authorities maintain that assets held by Indians in Switzerland cannot be considered as 'black money' Funds parked by Indian individuals and firms in Swiss banks, including through India-based branches and other financial institutions, jumped to 2.55 billion Swiss francs (over Rs 20,700 crore) in 2020 on a sharp surge in holdings via securities and similar instruments, though customer deposits fell, annual data from Switzerland's central bank showed on Thursday. The increase in aggregate funds of Indian clients with Swiss banks, from 899 million Swiss francs (Rs 6,625 crore) at the end of 2019, reverses a two-year declining trend and has taken the figure to the highest level in 13 years. advertisement It stood at a record high of nearly 6.5 billion Swiss francs in 2006, after which it has been mostly on a downward path, except for a few years including in 2011, 2013 and 2017, as per the Swiss National Bank (SNB) data. The total amount of CHF 2,554.7 million (Rs 20,706 crore), described by the SNB as 'total liabilities' of Swiss banks or 'amounts due to' their Indian clients at the end of 2020, included CHF 503.9 million (over Rs 4,000 crore) in customer deposits, CHF 383 million (over Rs 3,100 crore) held via other banks, CHF 2 million (Rs 16.5 crore) through fiduciaries or trusts and the highest component of CHF 1,664.8 million (nearly Rs 13,500 crore) as 'other amounts due to customers' in form of bonds, securities and various other financial instruments. advertisement While the funds classified as 'customer account deposits' have actually declined from CHF 550 million at the end of 2019 and those through fiduciaries also more than halved from CHF 7.4 million, the money held via other banks rose sharply from CHF 88 million in this period. However, the biggest difference has been a surge in 'other amounts due to customers' from India, which rose over six times from CHF 253 million at 2019-end. All four components had declined during 2019. These are official figures reported by banks to the SNB and do not indicate the quantum of the much-debated alleged black money held by Indians in Switzerland . These figures also do not include the money that Indians, NRIs or others might have in Swiss banks in names of third-country entities. According to the SNB, its data for 'total liabilities' of Swiss banks towards Indian clients takes into account all types of funds of Indian customers at Swiss banks, including deposits from individuals, banks and enterprises. This includes data for branches of Swiss banks in India, as also non-deposit liabilities. On the other hand, the 'locational banking statistics' of the Bank for International Settlement (BIS), which have been described in the past by Indian and Swiss authorities as a more reliable measure for deposits by Indian individuals in Swiss banks, show an increase of nearly 39 per cent during 2020 in such funds to USD 125.9 million (Rs 932 crore). advertisement This figure takes into account deposits as well as loans of Indian non-bank clients of Swiss-domiciled banks and had shown an increase of 7 per cent in 2019, after declining by 11 per cent in 2018 and by 44 per cent in 2017. It peaked at over USD 2.3 billion (over Rs 9,000 crore) at the end of 2007. Swiss authorities have always maintained that assets held by Indian residents in Switzerland cannot be considered as 'black money' and they actively support India in its fight against tax fraud and evasion . An automatic exchange of information in tax matters between Switzerland and India has been in force since 2018. Under this framework, detailed financial information on all Indian residents having accounts with Swiss financial institutions since 2018 was provided for the first time to Indian tax authorities in September 2019 and this is to be followed every year. In addition to this, Switzerland has been actively sharing details about accounts of Indians suspected to have indulged in financial wrongdoings after submission of prima facie evidence. Such exchange of information has taken place in hundreds of cases so far. advertisement Overall, customer deposits in all Swiss banks rose in 2020 to nearly CHF 2 trillion, which included over CHF 600 billion of foreign customer deposits. While the UK topped the charts for foreign clients' money in Swiss banks at CHF 377 billion, it was followed by the US (CHF 152 billion) at the second spot -- the only two countries with 100-billion-plus client funds. Others in the top 10 were West Indies, France, Hong Kong, Germany, Singapore, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands and Bahamas. India was placed at 51st place, ahead of countries like New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, Mauritius, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Among BRICS nations, India stood below China and Russia, but above South Africa and Brazil. Others placed above India included Netherlands, UAE, Japan, Australia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Ireland, Turkey, Mexico, Austria, Greece, Egypt, Canada, Qatar, Belgium, Bermuda, Kuwait, South Korea, Portugal, Jordan, Thailand, Seychelles, Argentina, Indonesia, Malaysia and Gibraltar. The countries for which Swiss banks reported a decline in amounts due to clients included the US and UK, while the money parked by individuals and enterprises from Bangladesh also declined during 2020. advertisement However, the amount almost doubled in the case of Pakistan to over CHF 642 million. Just like India, the issue of alleged black money in Swiss banks has been a political hot potato in the two neighbouring countries as well. As per the SNB, there were 243 banks in Switzerland at the end of 2020.

Listen to Story Live TV Share Advertisement Significant messages from PM Modi\u2019s Kashmir meeting was the Centre\u2019s readiness for restoring the statehood and assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir. (Photo: India Today) Prabhash K Dutta New Delhi , UPDATED: Jun 25, 2021 16:13 IST It was the death anniversary of Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh founder who remains an emotively inspiring figure for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Thursday. It was on this day that Prime Minister Narendra Modi held his Kashmir meeting. Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir prison in 1953 agitating against its special status granted earlier under Article 370 and Presidential Orders under 35A. The Modi government fulfilled that demand on August 5, 2019. advertisement Thursday\u2019s was the first meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leaders from Jammu and Kashmir for deliberation on political progress in the Union Territory. Here are five major takeaways from PM Modi\u2019s Kashmir meeting: Centre conciliatory towards status quoists The central government had moved swiftly in August 2020 before stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status to put several leaders under house arrest in the Valley. Three former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were among those leaders. The Centre had apprehension that they might create trouble in fulfilling a long-standing poll promise of the BJP. Later, these leaders buried their political differences to demand restoration of status quo in Jammu and Kashmir. Some of them charged the Centre with furthering the BJP's Hindutva agenda in the Kashmir Valley. advertisement On the government\u2019s part, Union Home Minister Amit Shah vented out his frustration by labelling them as \u2018Gupkar Gang\u2019 after the leaders formed People\u2019s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) to demand undoing what was done on August 5, 2019. Months after their release, 14 political leaders held talks with PM Modi at his official residence in New Delhi. The leaders still reiterated their demand and PM Modi and HM Shah listened to them. The message was loud and clear that the Centre was in a conciliatory mood. Centre ready to restore statehood Though the Centre never closed this option but at the Kashmir meeting, PM Modi reportedly told the political leaders that Jammu and Kashmir would become a State again. However, the catch remains in the timing. PM Modi repeated it would happen \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d. But the meeting with the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir 22 months after the momentous decision indicates that the Centre is ready to move in that direction now. The buzz is that only Jammu and Kashmir could be converted from a Union Territory to a State while leaving Ladakh out from this decision at least for the time being. Domicile laws in jobs and education for Jammu and Kashmir residents are likely to be implemented like other states. This could be a 50-50-win situation for both the Modi government and the political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir. Centre ready for assembly election advertisement Another significant message from PM Modi\u2019s Kashmir meeting was the Centre\u2019s readiness for assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir. Delimitation was discussed at the meeting. Omar Abdullah later expressed his reservations over delimitation asking why Jammu and Kashmir was singled out. For the record, constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir did not undergo delimitation in 2008 like the rest of India. The last delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir was carried out in 1995-96. ALSO READ: Top priority to strengthen grassroots of democracy in J&K, says PM Modi after crucial meet Further, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act 2019 increased the number of assembly seats from 107 to 114 \u2014 calling for delimitation. The Election Commission too held a meeting with district election officials from Jammu and Kashmir a day before PM Modi\u2019s Kashmir meeting. Indication is clear that the Centre is moving towards holding assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir. Gupkar drops Article 370 as condition While the Centre sent out invitation for talks without setting out conditions, the Gupkar Alliance too climbed down from their demand of restoring Article 370 as a pre-condition for dialogue. advertisement Omar Abdullah later said it was \u201cpointless to ask the Narendra Modi government to restore Article 370\u201d as it was the architect of the new political structure in Jammu and Kashmir. The Article 370-battle would be settled in the Supreme Court. This suits the Modi government as well. Ladakh remains a UT As the Gupkar Alliance now appears more inclined towards getting into electoral politics with statehood restored to Jammu and Kashmir, a balance could be struck by keeping Ladakh out of the political boardroom for now. Creation of Ladakh as a Union Territory and placing most of the territories occupied by Pakistan and China within its boundaries signalled that the Modi government considered this decision more strategic than political. ALSO READ: Restoration of statehood for J&K, assembly election among 5 demands raised during meet with PM: Ghulam Nabi Azad Ladakh as a Union Territory also insulates large parts of Jammu and Kashmir from external or border security situations. China is still pushing at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Gilgit-Baltistan, under Pakistan\u2019s occupation, too became a territory of Ladakh leaving this an issue to be resolved by the central government and thus shielding Jammu and Kashmir from the worries of strategic matters. advertisement This means that the unification of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir may take a backseat for a long term. India's message to the world The Kashmir decision of 2019 evoked international reactions. Many say Chinese aggression in Ladakh in 2020 was its response to the Modi government\u2019s Kashmir decision. After the change in government in the US, the Joe Biden administration has expressed its interest in normalcy returning to Jammu and Kashmir. Withdrawal of Nato troops from Afghanistan is another factor that may have its bearing on Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s security and law and order situation. By moving forward to holding assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir, the Modi government would be sending a message to the international community \u2014 the message of democratic participation in a terror-hit province but under a very different and insulated set up.

Published :\n\t\t\t\t\tJun 23, 2021 16:33\n\t\t\t\t\tIST R. Krishnakumar COMMents SHARE Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER SEE ALL Remove The Kerala High Court building in Ernakulam. The Kerala High Court (which has jurisdiction over Lakshadweep) has issued an interim stay on the controversial orders issued by the Lakshadweep administration to exclude meat and chicken, part of the staple diet of the islanders, from the noon meal programme for school children and to close down the dairy farms run by its Animal Husbandry Department. \u201cPrima facie, we find no reason for the change of food items,\u201d the court said, ordering that \u201cfood, including meat, chicken, fish and egg, and other items, prepared and served to the school-going children of Lakshadweep, as done in the past, should be continued until further orders. To make it clear, the earlier system should continue,\u201d a Division Bench of Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly said on June 22. The Bench also ordered that the \u201cfunctioning of the dairy farms should be continued until further orders,\u201d while considering a public interest writ petition filed by Ajmal Ahmed R., a lawyer and executive member of the Lakshadweep Bar Association. The court said it will hear the case again on June 30, allowing the Union Territory\u2019s administration two weeks to file a counter petition along with supporting documents. A series of administrative and policy measures announced by Praful Khoda Patel, the Union Territory\u2019s new Administrator who is also a Gujarat politician and also the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, had led to discontent among the people of Lakshadweep in the past few months. Opposition leaders have been alleging that he has been acting like \u201ca political appointee\u201d of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government ever since he was given additional charge of the island territory (See separate story ). The public interest writ petition sought a court order preventing the island administration from implementing \u201cany reforms infringing the ethnic culture, heritage, food habit, and affecting the serene and calm atmosphere in the Lakshadweep Islands and also infringing the Constitutional rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 300A of the Constitution of India\u201d. It said that the Administrator had ordered the closure of all dairy farms run by the Animal Husbandry Department without assigning reasons and that a proposed public auction for the disposal of all animals, including bulls, calves, heifers, ducks and so on, did not take place only because there were no bidders. The petition also said that though the National Programme of Mid Day Meal in Schools Annual Work Plan and Budget 2020-21 has provided for meat and chicken in the menu for school children in the Union Territory, the administration took a \u201csudden decision\u201d not to provide such non-vegetarian food to the children. It also said that, all along, food for the children was prepared and distributed by stakeholders within the island, using the manpower of the islanders, which was also one of the sources of employment for them. The petition alleged that this was uncalled for and had been done so as to entrust the work relating to preparation of food to \u201cAkshayapatra\u201d, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in Bengaluru. The administration\u2019s preliminary arguments were that the decision to close down dairy farms were taken because they were found to be \u201cfinancially unviable\u201d; the decision to change the mid-day meal menu in schools was taken by an 18-member steering and monitoring committee and that the Administrator had no role in it; there was no proposal to allocate the work of preparation and distribution of food to the NGO Akshayapatra, but the decision was only to have informal talks with that NGO regarding the implementation of the mid-day meal scheme; that the decision to change the menu was taken because of the difficulty in procurement of \u201ccertain items\u201d during the second phase of the pandemic situation; and that the National Programme of Mid Day Meal in Schools Annual Work Plan and Budget 2020-21 had already been issued for the academic year 2020-2021, and, therefore, it had no relevance for the academic year 2021-22. The Division Bench, however, said in its interim order that \u201cprima facie, we are of the view that switching over to a different menu, with the exclusion of chicken and meat, would run contrary to the National Programme of Mid-Day Meal in Schools Annual Work Plan and Budget 2020-21, especially, when it is constituted with the avowed objective of ensuring the physical and mental health of the children.... We are unable to understand how there could be a change in the menu of food items given to the children, prepared taking into account, the vital aspect of health factor (and when a physician too had recommended for it in the committee), and how such a distinction can be drawn, merely, by saying that it was prepared, for a different academic year.\u201d \u201cPrima facie, we find no reason for the change of food items, with the exclusion of meat and chicken. Therefore, we are inclined to pass an interim order directing the respondents, to provide food, as done before, by including meat and chicken, to the children of the schools in Lakshadweep,\u201d the court said. It also said that the dairy farms should be allowed to continue, as, even though the administration\u2019s counsel had said that \u201ca policy decision\u201d was taken to close them down as they were not financially viable, the documents submitted to the court did not indicate any such decision. Aisha Sultana warned against violating quarantine norms Meanwhile, the film-maker Aisha Sultana, already facing sedition charges for some of the remarks she made against the Lakshadweep administration, was asked to appear at the Kavaratti police station for questioning a second time and found herself being served with a \u201ccaution notice\u201d for \u201cviolating the island\u2019s home quarantine norms\u201d. On June 16, the Kerala High Court had granted her interim anticipatory bail for a week in the sedition case and ordered that she should appear before the Kavaratti police for interrogation on June 20 as per the notice served on her under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the court had also ordered that, in the event of her arrest, she should be released on bail. The film-maker had approached the court seeking protection in the first information report (FIR) registered by Kavaratti police based on a complaint by a BJP activist against her remarks during a television debate that the Government of India had used \u201ca bio-weapon\u201d against the island inhabitants. Her lawyer submitted to the court that the remark was made while criticising the administration\u2019s decision to relax the COVID quarantine norms that had led to a sudden surge in infections in the island, which was until then then entirely free of COVID cases, and that the remark was made in the heat of the moment and was not meant to be taken in the literal sense. Her lawyer also said it was a \u201clapse\u201d, that she had clarified her remarks and had later issued an apology. The administration, however, described her statement as a \u201cpowerful, noxious\u201d assertion against the Government of India in the context of the protests in Lakshadweep that could cause disaffection among the people of the islands and sow seeds of separatism in their minds. The High Court had reserved final orders on her bail application. But the Lakshadeep administration has now said in the caution notice that after her arrival at Kavaratti for questioning by the police in the sedition case, she had moved out of her place of stay, visited public places and mingled with people, violating the quarantine norms in force in the islands from May 12, and has warned her of strict action if she did it again.

However, a report by The Hindu \u2019s Vijaita Singh and Suhasini Haider says that there is no consensus among the various investigation agencies in India to bring the women back. \u201cOne line of thought was to allow them to come back and become approvers in the cases here. However, their interview revealed that they are highly radicalised. The France model may be followed and the Afghanistan authorities can be requested to put them on trial there,\u201d The Hindu quoted an official as saying. As per reports on April 27 2021, Afghan national security directorate Ahmad Zia Saraj told the media that 408 members of the Islamic State from 13 countries are currently lodged in Afghanistan\u2019s prisons, and this includes four Indians. Earlier in March 2020, a 30-minute video titled Khorasan Files: The Journey Of Indian \u2018Islamic State\u2019 Widows was released by StratNewsGlobal, a New Delhi-based news website. The report featured the interrogation of three women \u2014 Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha, Nimisha alias Fathima, and Rafaela, by Indian officials. The three Malayali women had fled between 2016 and 2018 with their husbands to join ISIS. However, after their husbands were killed, they were among the several thousand fighters and their families who surrendered to the Afghanistan government in 2019. It was also learnt from reports that Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam, who hailed from Ernakulam was also with the three other women. Merrin had married Nimisha's husband Bexen's brother, Bestin. In the video report, the women were heard expressing their wish to come back to India. It was also reported that officers of the National Investigative Agency (NIA) visited them in Afghanistan, and questioned them. Following this, the government reportedly decided not to bring them back. In the video, Fathima (Nimisha) could be heard saying,\"I\u2019m confused (about returning back to India. Basically I can\u2019t depend on anyone. On my husband or my family and stay for a long time. I definitely need income. In Da\u2019esh, the widows and orphans will be taken care of and money will be provided for them every month, without getting remarried... of course, I can\u2019t say that I want to live in Afghanistan, this is not my place. India was my place, so if they will take me, if they won\u2019t put me in jail and I\u2019m not oppressed, then I would want to go back to India.\u201d Sonia had said that she had not been personally involved in the violence.\u00a0\u201cMy husband did what he wanted and I can\u2019t say I regret I came, I got three years more with him. Otherwise, he would have left me and gone. That was for sure. And once I reached there, I was not involved in anything. We were in the house, we weren\u2019t exposed to any brutalities, we were not involved. We were not aware of it. I don\u2019t know, in Sham, lots of things were affected. But in Horesan, we didn\u2019t hear of such things happening. We lived a very normal life. We were not exposed to anything,\u201d she says. The NIA had in 2017 filed a chargesheet after 21 men and women from Kerala left the country to join the ISKP. Sonia Sebastian, who converted to Islam and now goes by the name Ayisha, had married Abdul Rashid Abdulla in 2011. Kasargod-native Abdul Rashid has been named by the NIA as the mastermind behind this whole migration. Sonia and Abdul Rashid had fled in 2016 along with their daughter. Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam was married to Bestin Vincent alias Yahiya who hailed from Palakkad. Nimisha alias Fathima married Bestin's brother Bexon alias Iza. Both couples left the country in 2016. There, Nimisha gave birth to a girl, who is four years old now. Rafaela had married Ijas Kallukettiya Purayil, a doctor from Kasargod. All the four men \u2014 Rashid, Bestin, Bexon and Ijas \u2014 were killed in Afghanistan, after which their wives surrendered with children. Rafaela has a one-year-old baby. \u201cAfter Rashid\u2019s death, we have only been running. Right after he was killed, our place became unsafe. All the ladies were living in one house. After his death, life has become very difficult. He is also not there, I am my own, my child is there, and we are always running,\u201d Sonia was heard saying in the StartNewsGlobal video.

Mr Pawar felt that the forum should be broadened with the inclusion of other parties and personalities.\u201d The meeting sparked political speculation on Monday as it was announced soon after Pawar met election strategist Prashant Kishor. Kishor denied the two events were linked, but NCP\u2019s Nawab Malik declared that the meeting reflected how Pawar will be working to unite Opposition parties. \u201cYashwant ji said this meeting was taking place in a restrictive pandemic environment, that\u2019s why many leaders like Manish Tewari, who usually attend all meetings, didn\u2019t turn up,\u201d said Tiwari, also a founding member of Rashtra Manch.

Jaishankar. Indian officials made a \u201cquiet visit\u201d to Doha in order to speak to the Taliban\u2019s political leadership based there, said a senior Qatari official, in what appears to be the first official confirmation of recent reports that New Delhi has engaged the Taliban directly. \u201cI understand that there has been a quiet visit by Indian officials to speak to the Taliban,\u201d said Qatar\u2019s Special Envoy of the State of Qatar for Counterterrorism and Mediation of Conflict Resolution Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani, speaking at a web conference on Monday. The statement came just days after External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar stopped over in Doha to meet with the Qatari leadership twice in the last two weeks. The MEA declined to comment on Mr. Qahtani\u2019s statement, and did not respond to questions about what level, if any, contacts with the political leadership of the Taliban based in Doha would have been at. In response to a question from The Hindu during the discussion, Mr. Qahtani said the reasoning behind the meeting was that the Taliban will have a \u201ckey\u201d role in Afghanistan\u2019s future. \u201cNot that everybody thinks the Taliban is going to dominate and take over, but because it is a key component of the future of Afghanistan. So, I see this as the reason behind having a dialogue or talks and reaching out to all parties in Afghanistan,\u201d he added. Mr. Qahtani was speaking at a conference organised by the Arab Centre in Washington and Centre for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies in Doha, on \u201c Looking towards Peace in Afghanistan after the US-NATO Withdrawal \u201d. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, who is set to meet U.S. President Joseph Biden this Friday in Washington, to discuss the situation developing ahead of the US-NATO troops pull-out, will also address the 3-day conference. \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we are in a critical stage at this time, and if any meetings happen at this time, it should be to encourage the (Afghan-Taliban) parties to solve their differences by peaceful means. This is a golden opportunity for all them to get back [to talks]. Nobody including Qatar is going to recognise any group that is going to take a country by force,\u201d Mr. Qahtani went on to say, in a reference to concerns that the Taliban could attempt a violent takeover in Afghanistan after the U.S.-NATO troop pull-out in September this year. To a question about whether any talks between India and Pakistan are linked to the Afghan reconciliation process, Mr. Qahtani said, \u201cAfghanistan as a country should not become a place for a proxy [fight] for other countries.\u201d \u201cIt is in the Interest of Pakistan and India to have a stable Afghanistan. Pakistan is a neighbouring country. India is a country that we know has assisted a lot economically in Afghanistan and they want it to be peaceful and stable,\u201d he added. In response to previous media reports that had pointed to a new, direct reach out by the Modi government to the Taliban, after years of refusing to recognise the militant group accused of terror attacks in Afghanistan, the MEA spokesperson had said that New Delhi is \u201cin touch with various stakeholders in pursuance of its long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction in Afghanistan.\u201d External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had visited Doha during two brief stopovers on June 9 and June 15 during his travels to Kuwait and Kenya, where he had met with the Qatari Foreign Minister and the National Security Advisor, as well as U.S. Special Representative on Afghanistan reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad. \u201cAs Qatar is involved in the Afghanistan peace process, the issue of Afghanistan was also discussed during EAM\u2019s conversations. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad happened to be in Doha during this period of EAM\u2019s visit, and called on EAM to brief him on the recent developments regarding Afghanistan,\u201d the MEA spokesperson said on Thursday.

Two term MLA from Khatima in Uttarakhand, Pushkar Singh Dhami was sworn in as the 11th Chief Minister of the State along with an 11-member cabinet, on Sunday in Dehradun. Mr. Dhami, at 45 the youngest Chief Minister yet of Uttarakhand, retained the entire team of his predecessor, Tirath Singh Rawat. Mr. Rawat quit on Friday evening ostensibly on being unable to get elected to the Uttarakhand Assembly within the constitutionally stipulated deadline of six months from the date he took over. Mr Dhami, already an MLA will have no such problems going ahead. The only change that Mr. Dhami made to his Cabinet was to give all ministers a promotion to Cabinet rank. The ministers sworn were Satpal Maharaj, Harak Singh Rawat, Bansidhar Bhagat, Yashpal Arya, Bishan Singh Chufal, Subodh Uniyal, Arvind Pandey, Ganesh Joshi, Dhan Singh Rawat, Rekha Arya and Yatishwaranand. Ms Arya, Mr Dhan Singh Rawat and Mr. Yatishwaranand, who were ministers of state in Mr. Tirath Rawat's cabinet, have been elevated to cabinet rank. Earlier in the day, Mr. Dhami met with senior party leader and his Cabinet colleague Satpal Maharaj at his residence with a bouquet of flowers amid reports that the senior leader and a few other MLAs of the BJP were sulking since Saturday as they were not happy with his election as the new leader of the BJP legislature party in Uttarakhand. He also paid courtesy visits to his predecessors Tirath Singh Rawat, Trivendra Singh Rawat and B.C. Khanduri at their residences. He takes over the reins at a time when Uttarakhand has just a few months to go for the Assembly polls, due early next year. Mr. Dhami is not only the youngest chief minister of the state, but also an appointment from Kumaon to the top post. He had worked his way in the BJP hierarchy first in student politics with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in 1990. He was the officer on special duty (OSD) to his political mentor and former chief minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari when the latter held the post he is holding now. In Mr Dhami\u2019s elevation, clearly an attempt is being made to strike the right caste and regional balance in Uttarakhand, as State BJP chief Madan Kaushik is a Brahmin from the Garhwal region, having a Thakur leader from Kumaon as the chief minister is being seen as a good move.

Representational image. (Sanchit Khanna\/HT PHOTO) Questions about travel to Europe by Indians who have received the Covishield jab, which is the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Serum Institute of India, have arisen since the vaccine has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). So far, EU members Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Slovenia and Spain, and Iceland and Switzerland, which aren\u2019t in the bloc but are part of the Schengen visa regime, recognise Covishield for Covid-19 vaccination for travel purposes, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Thursday. However, travel between India and Europe remains tightly restricted. Of the 10 countries, India has an air bubble arrangement only with Germany, which has emerged as a key transit hub for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. Some of these countries, such as Switzerland, are accepting visa applications from fully vaccinated people who have been inoculated with doses approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) or EU or their national authority. Estonia has said in a statement that it recognises both Covishield and Covaxin for full vaccination of Indian travellers but officials have pointed out that travel between the two countries remains highly restricted. A statement issued by the Netherlands government listed Covishield among eight approved vaccines. However, Dutch authorities have listed India among countries and areas considered \u201cvery high risk areas where there is a virus variant of concern\u201d. Also Read | Can Indians now travel to European countries? All you need to know On Tuesday, German ambassador Walter Lindner tweeted his country recognises a double shot of Covishield as \u201cvalid proof of anti-Covid vaccination\u201d, but added that this does not \u201cmodify existing travel or visa restrictions for travellers from areas of concern\/virus variants areas\u201d. The Indian side has informed the 27 EU member states that it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the \u201cgreen pass\u201d from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc recognises vaccines being administered in India, such as Covishield and Covaxin. India also asked EU states to accept Covishield and Covaxin, as the vaccines have been authorised by WHO or the national authority, for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. Indian vaccination certificates can be authenticated by European authorities on the Co-WIN portal, the people said. The EU has said the EU Digital Covid Certificate or green pass is not a precondition to travel and individual member states have the option to accept vaccines approved by WHO such as Covishield. India also asked EU states to accept Covishield and Covaxin, as the vaccines have been authorised by WHO or the national authority.(Hindustan Times) Covaxin is yet to be given an emergency use listing by WHO, and its manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, hasn\u2019t approached EMA for regulatory approval. Apart from India, Covaxin has been approved by Guyana, Iran, Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Paraguay, the Philippines and Zimbabwe. The green pass framework, being implemented from July 1, is meant to facilitate free movement within the EU during the pandemic. Under this framework, persons vaccinated with four vaccines approved by the EMA will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU. These four vaccines are Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen, Spikevax or the Moderna dose, and Vaxzevria or the European version of the AstraZeneca jab. Serum Institute of India has approached EMA for approving Covishield. External affairs minister S Jaishankar took up the issue of approving the Covishield for travel to Europe during a meeting on Tuesday with Josep Borell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.

Father Stan Swamy, a priest and human rights activist who spent five decades fighting for the rights of the tribal community in the state of Jharkhand, was arrested in October 2020, charged under draconian terrorism laws and held in judicial custody. Despite Swamy\u2019s weak condition from advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, which worsened after he contracted Covid-19 in prison last month, the courts repeatedly denied him pre-trial bail. On court orders, Swamy was eventually moved to hospital and put on a ventilator, but he died of cardiac arrest on Monday afternoon after Covid-19-related complications, a doctor told Bombay high court. The court hearing had been scheduled to request emergency bail for the priest on health grounds, but had come too late. Jairam Ramesh, an MP for the opposition Congress party and a former cabinet minister, tweeted: Who in the apparatus of the Indian state will be held responsible for this tragedy? Make no mistake \u2014 it is the Indian state that killed Fr. Stan Swamy, who was such a passionate crusader for social justice. https:\/\/t.co\/gAbZL2Y8aI \u2014 Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) July 5, 2021 The author Sonia Faleiro said: \u201cFather Stan Swamy didn\u2019t die, he was killed. The regime killed him, he would be alive if it wasn\u2019t for them.\u201d Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer, was among those who said the Indian state \u201cowed his loved ones and all citizens accountability\u201d for the \u201ccruel and inhuman treatment at the hands of the state\u201d. Swamy\u2019s arrest was connected to an outbreak of deadly caste-based violence in 2018 in the state of Maharashtra. Now known as the Bhima Koregaon case, it is regularly cited as an example of the draconian crackdown on dissent and persecution of human rights activists under the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Alongside 15 others, including poets, lawyers, activists and writers, many of whom had been outspoken against the BJP, Swamy was accused of orchestrating the violence, having links to violent Maoist groups and plotting to assassinate Modi, charges he and others had vehemently denied. This year, a US digital analyst found that a hacker had used software to plant 22 forged \u201cincriminating\u201d files on the computer of one of the accused, which the police then used as evidence to arrest Swamy and others. However, despite questions over the evidence and Swamy\u2019s worsening health, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the federal body investigating Swamy, had opposed his bail requests, even as his condition had deteriorated and despite his pleas to be allowed to recover at home. The court had complied with the NIA\u2019s request to deny him bail. Swamy\u2019s lawyers accused prison staff of mistreating him in jail. In December they had to go to the courts to force the prisons to give him a sip cup, as his Parkinson\u2019s meant he was unable to hold a glass of water in his hands and he was given no assistance. The poet and author Meena Kandasamy said: \u201cLet us not talk about this as mere death. This is a judicial murder and everyone is complicit.\u201d The lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan said it was \u201cnothing less than murder by the state of one of the gentlest and kindest men I have known. Unfortunately our judicial system is also complicit in this.\u201d Harsh Mander, a prominent activist, described Swamy as \u201cdevoted to selfless defence of Adivasi [ indigenous ] rights, gentle, brave. Even from prison he grieved not for himself but injustice to poor prisoners.\u201d Mander added: \u201cA cruel state jailed him to silence his voice; the judiciary did nothing to secure his freedom.

Soon after taking charge, the government had created the Jal Shakti ministry. However, it was not altogether new like the Ministry of Cooperation. It was created by integrating two existing ministries dealing with water \u2014 Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, and Drinking Water & Sanitation ministry. This was in line with Modi\u2019s mantra of \u2018minimum government, maximum governance\u2019, a promise made in both the 2014 and 2019 BJP manifestos . Since 2014, there have been several recommendations from bureaucratic panels to merge ministries linked to the same sector. But not much has happened on that front till now. During its first term, the Modi government had merged two ministries \u2014 urban development, and housing and urban poverty alleviation \u2014 and created housing and urban affairs ministry in 2017. With the creation of the Ministry of Cooperation, there will now be a total of 41 central government ministries.

With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Textiles Minister Smriti Irani, Ministers of State Niranjan Jyoti and Renuka Singh Sarota, the Union Cabinet now has 11 women.

With the new entrants, the Union Cabinet now has seven PhDs, three MBAs, 13 lawyers, six doctors, five engineers, seven former civil servants and 68 graduates. Jyotiraditya Scindia, for instance, is an MBA from Stanford. But he owes his induction as a Cabinet Minister to the switch he made to the BJP last year with his loyalists that toppled the Congress Government in Madhya Pradesh. The \u201cyouthful\u201d look of the Cabinet with the elevation of former MoS Anurag Thakur was complemented by the administrative experience and stature of former IFS officer Hardeep Singh Puri who, too, was elevated to the Cabinet rank. The induction of Narayan Rane, former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, is entirely because of his insider knowledge of the Shiv Sena as he was a Sainik with Bal Thackeray before he quit the party to join the Congress then forming his own party and finally joining the BJP. Rane is the lone Maratha among the three Maharashtra inductees, who are from OBC and ST communities. Rane was effusive of another aspirant, Devendra Fadnavis. \u201cI owe my appointment to Devendra Fadnavis,\u201d he said after being sworn in. The other entrants from Maharashtra include Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad from Aurangabad, a doctor with roots in the RSS, who belongs to an OBC community; Kapil Patil from the Bhiwandi-Thane region, yet another OBC representative in the Cabinet; and Bharati Pravin Pawar from Dhindori, Jalgaon, who is a doctor and belongs to an ST community. Eye on Assembly polls Preparations for Assembly polls next year, especially in the politically critical Uttar Pradesh, were visible in the induction of as many as seven ministers from the Hindi heartland State. Of the new-comers, three \u2014 Pankaj Chowdhary, Anupriya Patel and B L Verma \u2014 are OBCs; and three, including Bhanu Pratap Verma, S P S Bhagel and Kaushal Kishor, SCs. There is a lone Brahmin, Ajay Mishra, to placate the community, which accounts for an influential 13 per cent of UP\u2019s population. The BJP combines its upper caste vote base with a strong outreach to OBCs, who used to traditionally vote for the Samajwadi Party, and Dalits, who had veered towards Mayawati\u2019s Bahujan Samaj Party. A similar focus was seen in West Bengal where the BJP continued its social engineering by inducting Shantanu Thakur, MP from Bangaon, who represents the powerful Matua community among the namashudras . Nisith Pramanik from the SC community was sworn in as an MoS for much the same reason. New portfolios Amit Shah will hold additional charge of the newly created Ministry of Cooperation. To avoid lack of coordination and overlap, several ministries to be merged. Going forward, 53 such ministries are to be managed by 30 ministers. Dharmendra Pradhan will be the new Education and Skill Development Minister; Aswini Vaishnav to be Railways Minister; Hardeep Puri will be Petroleum Minister and will continue to hold charge of Urban Development Ministry. Jyotiraditya Scindia gets Civil Aviation; Piyush Goyal to be Textiles and Consumer Affairs; Parshottam Rapala to get Dairy and Fisheries Ministry; and Anurag Thakur will be the new Information and Broadcasting and Youth & Sports Affairs Minister.

Raj Kundra was arrested on July 19, on charges of making pornographic content and publishing them through mobile applications. He was remanded to three days of police custody. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Raj Kundra was arrested and a timeline of his connection to the controversial adult content creation case. February 2019 Raj Kundra led Armsprime Media Private Limited was established with an authorised share capital is Rs 10 lakh. The firm was said to be involved in sporting and other recreational activities. The company developed a mobile application called Hotshot, which is at the centre of controversy about the alleged streaming of pornographic content. March 2019 Poonam Pandey collaborated with Armsprime Media for an app based on her. However a month later she claimed to have terminated the contract. December 2019 Poonam filed a criminal case against Raj Kundra and his associates in Bombay High Court, alleging that despite no contract, they continued to post her pictures and videos on the app and even leaked her personal mobile number. December 2019 Raj Kundra said that he sold \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hotshots\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for $25,000 in 2019 to UK-based company Kenrin Pvt Ltd , which is owned by his brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi.

February 2021 Mumbai police raided a bungalow in Madh Island and busted a live porn video filmmaking racket. According to PTI , an FIR was registered against Raj Kundra after a woman approached the police. As part of the probe, actress and model Gehana Vasisth was arrested by the property cell unit of Mumbai.

Screengrab\u00a0 | &nbspPhoto Credit:&nbspTimes Now Key Highlights \"Nobody can divide Tamil Nadu,\" said DMK MP Kanimozhi AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran has appealed to Chief Minister MK Stalin to clarify the matter CPI(M) leader G Balakrishnan claimed that the BJP is planning is to enter Tamil Nadu through the backdoor Chennai: An unconfirmed report in a Tamil daily about the Union government\u2019s plan to declare \u2018Kongu Nadu\u2019 as a Union territory has sparked a row in Tamil Nadu. This may be noted that \u2018Kongu Nadu\u2019 is a geographical region, not any place, in Tamil Nadu. While talking to the media, DMK MP Kanimozhi rebuffed such reports and said that nobody can divide Tamil Nadu. \u201cNobody can divide Tamil Nadu. No one needs to worry about such things, the state is now under a safe government,\u201d said Kanimozhi. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief KS Alagiri, meanwhile, described the demand for Kongu Nadu as a \u201cfigment of imagination\u201d. Later, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader G Balakrishnan claimed that the BJP\u2019s plan is to enter Tamil Nadu through the backdoor. \u201cThis is dangerous. The people of Tamil Nadu will not allow this. Such actions by the BJP to enter Tamil Nadu through the backdoor will only cause severe repercussions for the party,\u201d said Balakrishnan. Thomas Isaac, a member of the Central Committee of CPI(M), tweeted: \"BJP sowing wind to reap hurricane in Tamil Nadu. A proposal for bifurcation Tamil Nadu to form Kongu Nadu is making rounds \u00a0in social media and press .What kind of Union of States is India ,if the Union can make and unmake states using its brute majority in Parliament?\" Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam chief TTV Dhinakaran has appealed to Chief Minister MK Stalin to clarify the matter. Speculation of plans to carve\u00a0out Tamil Nadu's western belt arose after a screenshot of the list of new Union Cabinet ministers began circulating on social media.\u00a0In the list, it was mentioned that BJP leader L Murugan hailed from \u2018Kongu Nadu\u2019, instead of Namakkal in Tamil Nadu.\u00a0L Murugan took oath as the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairies. As soon as the list surfaced, it triggered a debate on social media. The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Congress alliance accused the BJP of attempting to divide the state.

While DMK leaders made public statements, an AIADMK spokesperson, when contacted, categorically said such ideas should be nipped in the bud. Even BJP leaders distanced themselves from the idea and said there was no such proposal. But they remained wishywashy by claiming that if people wish for a bifurcation, it is the duty of the Union government to execute it. They did not elaborate on why the issue was raised when there was no such popular demand from the people of the region. A report in a Tamil daily, which triggered the issue by its claim about the purported idea of the Union government, too did not cite any source for its information. It claimed the Modi government developed the plan because it was angered by DMK leaders\u2019 recent use of the term \u2018Ondriya Arasu\u2019 to refer to it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a news item that appeared in a daily,\u201d BJP treasurer SR Sekar told reporters at Tirupur, adding that the party has no such plans. However, he added that the BJP would discuss idea of Kongu Nadu in due course. BJP State legislature party floor leader Nainar Nagenthran, in Tirunelveli, gave an ambiguous reply to reporters. \u201cThere are so many \u2018nadus\u2019 in Tamil Nadu \u2014 Valla Nadu, Varusha Nadu, Vazha Nadu etc. Can all these be made separate States? But we have to keep in mind developments in the past. Andhra Pradesh was divided into two States. Uttar Pradesh was divided. If the people want the State to be bifurcated, it is the duty of the government.\u201d No one can divide Tamil Nadu: DMK DMK leader Kanimozhi had said, \u201cTamil Nadu is now under a safe government. So there is no need for the people to harbour such worries. No one can bifurcate the State.\u201d A DMK spokesperson did not mince words when asked for a comment. \u201cBJP\u2019s aim is to give away the resources of Tamil Nadu to the North Indians. In Kongu region, North Indians now have a strong economic base in various areas and the workforce in Tirupur area is also from North India. But this idea will never fructify,\u201d said Constantine Ravindran. He also said it was a move to divert the attention from the Centre\u2019s failures on issues such as the fuel price hike. AIADMK spokesperson Kovai Satyan said, \u201cAny thought process hinting at division or separation from Tamil Nadu is highly condemnable and wrong. There will be no second thought on this. Any party that advocates such an idea should be severely dealt with by the law. Even bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh ultimately affected the people of both States.\u201d AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran said the motive behind the idea was to \u201cdivide Tamil Nadu on caste lines\u201d and was just an adoption of the divide-and-rule policy of the colonial British. However, \u2018Best\u2019 Ramasamy, of Kongunadu Munnetra Kazhagam, a party which had of late not seen any political success, said, \u201cSince 2010, we have been demanding Kongu Nadu for industrial growth in the area, which has been extensively contributing to the State\u2019s economy.\u201d Meanwhile, BJP legislative party leader Nainar Nagendran in Tenkasi said that no one needs to fear about the bifurcation of Tamil Nadu.

Hunting for a Georgian queen in Goa A 17th century royal martyr, Portuguese friars, a ruined Augustine church and a search that stretched on for over 25 years Srinath Perur Updated 11 Apr 2016, 04:19 PM IST Ruins of Saint Augustine complex, Old Goa. Photo: Srinath Perur Once upon a time, in a land far away, lived a queen named Ketevan. And centuries later, two governments, priests, archaeologists, historians and genomics researchers would work together to try and find a part of her body lost in the ruins of a Goan church. The time, to be precise, was the early 17th century. The land, Kakheti in eastern Georgia, a hilly region known for its wine. Ketevan\u2019s husband had died after ruling briefly, and her son Teimuraz was king, but as a vassal of the Persian Shah Abbas I. Teimuraz was proving a less-than-ideal ruler of a dependent kingdom. He had flirted with the Ottomans and Russians, both rivals to the Persians. Abbas was threatening to invade Kakheti. In 1614, Ketevan offered herself as a hostage to Abbas in a failed attempt to prevent carnage. She was held in Shiraz until 1624, when Abbas offered Ketevan, a grandmother in her 60s and a devout follower of the Georgian orthodox church, the option of converting to Islam and joining his harem. She refused and was killed\u2014strangled, after her flesh had been picked apart by red hot tongs. In Shiraz at the time were two Portuguese friars of the order of St Augustine from whom Ketevan had taken some comfort. Since she was seen as having died for her religion, she was a martyr. The Augustinians hoped that with a little finessing about how close she had been to becoming a Catholic, Rome might make her a saint. This would be strategically convenient for spreading the faith in Eurasian lands, which had well-established churches of their own. For saints to be venerated, you ideally needed relics. So, the friars exhumed Ketevan\u2019s body. In 1628, they took some of her remains to her grateful son, who had them interred at Alaverdi cathedral\u2014and allowed the friars to open a mission in Georgia. Ketevan did end up a saint, but of the Georgian church. Her remains were being moved from Alaverdi to a safer location amid raids on the region when the horse carrying the remains lost its footing and fell into the river Aragvi. The relics were washed away. Fragments of her body were thought to be in other places, but this much was known from contemporary accounts: her right arm had been taken to Goa in 1627 by Portuguese friars to be interred in the St Augustine complex. The Augustinians left the complex in 1835, after which it collapsed in stages (to become what may be familiar to Hindi film viewers as the 1965 thriller Gumnaam\u2019s eerie overgrown-by-forest structure through which the cast bemusedly wanders as the song Gumnaam Hai Koi plays). There was no record of what happened to Ketevan\u2019s relic when the complex was abandoned. Today, the St Augustine complex is a spectacular ruin. A towering shard from what used to be a five-storey facade pierces the sky. Around it lies an expanse of laterite blocks, basalt slabs, masses of bricks, once-indoor tombstones bearing coats of arms. It\u2019s palpable\u2014the grandeur of what must have been, and indeed the futility of grandeur itself. But to walk around the complex with Sidh Mendiratta\u2014a researcher whose area of interest is at the junction of history, heritage and architecture\u2014is to have it all come alive again. He points out patches of faded red oxide work, sections of walls where the original azulejos tile-work has been restored. From weathered stone, he extrapolates to lives once lived here, to chambers in the convent where the monks ate, prayed and rested. In the early 2000s, Mendiratta was a Portuguese exchange student studying architecture in Goa, when he visited the ruins. \u201cIt was love at first sight with the site,\u201d he says with a laugh. (An enduring love too, for though he\u2019s now a postdoctoral researcher at Coimbra University, Portugal, he returns when he can.) Mendiratta ended up making the ruins part of his studies\u2014his final project was to build a computer model of the complex in its prime. That brought him in touch with the Goa circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Beginning in the late 1980s, the Soviet Union and then independent Georgia began efforts to locate the Goan relic of Ketevan. This seems to have been prompted by the publication of a book in 1985 by Armenian historian Roberto Gulbenkian that for the first time brought together fragmentary accounts to present the story of Queen Ketevan. Over the next 25 years, multiple Georgian delegations descended on Goa; the foreign minister of Georgia visited his counterpart Jaswant Singh and requested assistance in finding the relic; Georgian archaeologists conducted an unsuccessful excavation in the church complex; ASI teams looked for the bone without luck. In 2003, Nizamuddin Taher of the ASI took over as head of the Goa circle. \u201cIt was my first independent charge,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was not looking at any fresh excavations.\u201d His priority was to resolve certain administrative issues. For the St Augustine complex, his plans were limited to clearing some of the piled-up debris so that visitors could move about the complex. But the previous searches for the relic had got the locals excited. \u201cThere was a romantic hype,\u201d Taher says. \u201cThe story of Queen Ketevan was prevalent in Old Goa.\u201d Taher\u2019s colleagues were keen to work on the site, and then Mendiratta came along, asking to study the ground plan of the church. They started removing debris to make a transverse path in January 2004. Where the relic of Queen Ketevan was concerned, previous teams were working from a single clue (probably obtained from a huge 1958 collation by Silva Rego of historical documents relating to Portuguese missions in the East). It stated that a black box containing the bones of Ketevan was installed on the second window on the epistle side of a chapel. The Georgian team, sure that it had to be the main chapel, had taken apart the area with such enthusiasm that it needed to be reconstructed with cement. They found nothing. Taher and his team were not really looking for the queen\u2019s relic as they continued clearing debris in 2004. Then, they found a basalt tombstone at the floor level under two metres of rubble. It had the name Manuel de Siqueira engraved on it. Mendiratta was intrigued. There was something familiar about the name, but he could not quite place it. He went to the library. \u201cSidh did not sleep that night,\u201d Taher recalls. It finally came to him. Mendiratta says, \u201cThe tombstone with the coat of arms is mentioned in an old chronicle as being in a place called the Chapter chapel.\u201d It was in the 12th volume of Rego\u2019s collation and it mentioned all the tombs in the St Augustinian complex. It said the Chapter chapel with the tomb of Manuel de Siqueira also held the black box with the Ketevan relic. \u201cI am very dispassionate,\u201d Taher says. \u201cAs an archaeologist, bahut kahani sunte rehte hai... (we keep hearing stories...), but when this clue came in\u2014we all had gooseflesh.\u201d It took work to identify the second window of the chapel on the epistle side. But when they looked under it\u2014nothing. There was no trace of the sarcophagus. Mendiratta says, \u201cWe were both excited and disappointed. We were sure that we were in the right place, but the box was not there.\u201d They resumed work in 2005. Taher explains that excavation sites are covered in between seasons of work. When excavation resumes, \u201cyou remove the cover and you do brushing\u201d. They had started on the brushing, when, \u201cFirst thing\u2014we get a bone.\u201d It was just lying there, in two pieces. Taher\u2019s colleagues were excited, but he was wary. \u201cIt was out of context,\u201d he explains. It was found a couple of metres away from the second window, and there was no trace of the box. To add to the uncertainty, they found two more bone fragments. And the lid of the sarcophagus, fallen on the other side of the window, but no trace of the box itself. A Georgian delegation arrived in 2006, headed by father Giorgi Razmadze of Tbilisi\u2019s St Ketevan church. They requested the relics be handed over to them. Taher asks, \u201cHow could we give them the bone unless we were sure it belonged to the queen?\u201d He felt genetic analysis may establish the provenance of the bones. Several laboratories in the US and Europe had been successful in obtaining DNA from old, unpreserved samples. But, Taher says, \u201cIt is difficult to send an archaeological antiquity to another country.\u201d So, the analysis would have to be done in India. The trouble was\u2014no ancient DNA studies had ever come out of India. Taher got in touch with K. Thangaraj at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad. Thangaraj had just started the first ancient DNA facility in India. He agreed to try and extract DNA from Taher\u2019s samples. We are made of cells; almost all cells contain DNA; a person\u2019s DNA can be unique in the manner of a fingerprint. Hence, the use of DNA in placing people at a crime scene or establishing parentage. But how was DNA to prove useful with the old bones found at the St Augustine complex? For starters, even obtaining DNA from the bones could not be taken for granted. Ancient DNA\u2014that is, DNA from old, unpreserved specimens\u2014is notoriously hard to work with. Thangaraj says, \u201cThere is no single protocol that works with all samples. We have to keep modifying the procedure for different samples.\u201d And then, even if the bones yielded DNA, what could it be compared with? There was a small relic claimed to be from Ketevan at the church in Tbilisi, but the history around it was murky enough that its own provenance could not be taken for granted. Thangaraj and his colleagues decided to go at the problem by trying to extract from the bone samples a kind of DNA known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). There are more copies of mtDNA in a cell as compared to the other sort, so it\u2019s easier to work with when genetic material is not forthcoming. The other thing about mtDNA is that it is usually passed down unchanged from mother to child. But on the rare occasion it will undergo a random change, and this will mark all the woman\u2019s descendants from then on. The tag marking a new branch of descendants is called a haplogroup. Identifying haplogroups in a person\u2019s mtDNA can help geneticists place her geographically, which is what the researchers hoped would happen with the bone samples they had. \u201cAn archaeologist should never part with his samples,\u201d says Taher. So, he went to Hyderabad in November 2006, carrying with him the bones wrapped in cotton. A CCMB team took samples and worked on them for almost three years but could not successfully amplify DNA from the bones. Niraj Rai is a researcher at CCMB who worked on the bone samples from 2010 onwards. \u201cThe best source for ancient DNA,\u201d says Rai, \u201cis the tooth.\u201d Then, in order, the bone of the inner ear, ribs, finger-bones, the skull and finally, the long bones. \u201cUnfortunately, what I got was a long bone.\u201d And even then, keeping the significance of the relic in mind, he had to work using only a tiny amount of bone powder. Because it is so hard to obtain DNA from old specimens, and so easy to contaminate them with genetic material from people working in the lab, ancient DNA labs tend to be fortresses of a peculiar sort. Take the ancient DNA facility at CCMB. It is in a building that houses lab animals to keep it away from other labs with human DNA. The building itself has a retractable staircase\u2014Rai has to press a button so the flight of steps reaches the building. (This is apparently to keep snakes from snacking on lab animals.) Then, footwear must be changed at two points before getting to the lab and protective clothing worn. The air-circulating system is such that filtered air flows outwards from the lab and then the chamber beyond. Outside is a list of almost comically stern instructions, including one that says all pens and calculators that enter the lab must have been irradiated in UV light for at least two days. For their second attempt, the CCMB team had refined their technique and had access to better equipment. This time, they were successful in sequencing mtDNA from the bone samples. The first bone that had been recovered from the St Augustine complex had a haplogroup\u2014U1b\u2014they had never seen in contemporary Indian DNA samples. They wanted to compare the sequence with mtDNA from modern Georgians. The St Ketevan Church in Tbilisi swung into action and shipped over saliva samples from 30 east Georgians. (Perhaps never before has a religious establishment been such a willing partner in a scientific investigation.) Some of them had the U1b haplogroup, showing it was prevalent in the region. The other two bone samples had haplogroups typical of western India and likely came from locals. Additional tests confirmed that the U1b bone came from a woman. So, in 2013, it was established that the bone found in two pieces in 2005 was consistent with being from a Georgian woman. It was the first time an ancient DNA result was being reported from India. When Rai, Taher, Thangaraj and their colleagues tried to publish their findings in a scientific journal, they were asked to verify their work by repeating it in a different lab. Thangaraj points out that this is a fairly standard precaution with ancient DNA results. \u201cUnfortunately, there is no other lab in India,\u201d he says. The researchers argued that contamination was unlikely because the U1b haplogroup they were reporting had not been seen in India in the more than 20,000 samples they had in their database. The journal did not relent and the paper, titled Relic excavated in western India is probably of Georgian Queen Ketevan, was published in another journal\u2014Mitochondrion\u2014which agreed with their reasoning. As the \u201cprobably\u201d in the paper\u2019s title suggests, it still cannot definitively be said that the bone belonged to Queen Ketevan, but as Taher puts it, the combined weight of \u201chistory, literary documents, archaeological excavations and genetic analysis\u201d point to it being so. \u201cOur work is over,\u201d he says. But what is definitive, anyway? At the Archaeological Museum at old Goa is the image of a haloed, determined-looking woman wearing a small crown. And in front of her is a glass box with two brown tubules. A placard says they are the relics of Queen St Ketevan of Georgia. I\u2019m thrilled to think of the human drama they have been connected with. I ask the museum in-charge if they are original. He says, \u201cIf we keep the original there, I will have to hold a lathi and stand next to it day and night.\u201d He enjoys a laugh at my naivete, then continues. \u201cIf anything happens to the bone, first the excavators will get a heart attack. Then, I will get a heart attack.\u201d Asked where the relic is now, Taher says, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in India. We do not disclose the location.\u201d Relics are believed to possess an aura. Even independent of the religious dimension, Ketevan\u2019s certainly does. Perhaps it comes from the combined light of being many things to many people. It is an object of veneration to the Georgians, something that is no doubt redoubled by their having expended resources and emotion in its pursuit. To the archaeologists, it is the significant discovery that can come along only a few times in a career that involves such painstaking, meticulous work. To the Indian scientists, the relic is associated with their first result from a technique that is expected to make major contributions to what we know of our past. And it must mean something to the organizers of the Ketevan Music Festival that began this year\u2014with some of the concerts held in the St Augustine ruins. In 2010 a filmmaker and artist named Gayatri Kodikal went to the St Augustine complex to shoot the ruins. The ASI was at work and the site was closed. She got talking with some of the archaeologists and heard about Queen Ketevan and the relic. \u201cI was hooked on the story,\u201d she says. Since then, her obsession with the tale has taken her to Georgia and Portugal to visit archives and see places, people and artefacts related to the story. Currently, it is the inspiration for a board game she is creating. It\u2019s called The Travelling Hand. The queen\u2019s post-mortem travels may not be finished yet. Talks are on between the governments of India and Georgia, and who knows, it may not be long before Queen Ketevan\u2019s travelling hand finally reaches home, 400 years after she left for Shiraz.

The Supreme Court Friday sought response from the Centre on a plea challenging the Constitutional validity of sedition law. A bench Justice U U Lalit, Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice KM Joseph were hearing a plea challenging section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, which penalises the crime of sedition. The plea, filed by two journalists \u2013 Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla \u2013 working in Manipur and Chhattisgarh respectively, have urged the court to declare Section 124-A as unconstitutional. The petition claimed that section 124-A infringes the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression, guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. related stories The petitioners claimed that they have been raising questions against their respective state governments and central government, and have been charged with sedition under section124Aof IPC in various FIRs for comments and cartoons shared by them on the social networking website Facebook. There is frequent phenomenon of misuse, misapplication and abuse of Section 124-A since 1962, the petition said, adding that the abuse of a law, in itself, may not bear on the validity of the law but clearly points to the vagueness and uncertainty of the current law. The sections of sedition have been repealed in comparative post-colonial democratic jurisdictions around the world. While India calls itself a \u2019democracy\u2019, throughout the democratic world the offence of sedition has been condemned as undemocratic, undesirable and unnecessary, it said. The petition also argued that the vagueness of Section 124-A exerts an unacceptable chilling effect on the democratic freedoms of individuals who cannot enjoy there legitimate democratic rights and freedoms for fear of life imprisonment. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all While citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the validity of the law in 1962 in the case of Kedar Nath Singh v.

Who decides who will be unmuted? (PTI) New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre why does the sedition law, which was used by British colonial masters to suppress the freedom movement and freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, continues to exist 75 years after Independence as it expressed concern over its widespread misuse and lack of accountability of the government that invokes it. Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, heading a bench also comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna and Justice Hrishikesh Roy, said, \u201cIt's a colonial law. It was meant to suppress the freedom movement, the same law was used by British against Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak etc. Is this law still required to exist after 75 years of Independence?\u201d \u201cOur concern is misuse of the law and the lack of accountability. Why does it continue in the statute book after 75 years of our Independence,\u201d CJI Ramana reiterated. Chief Justice Ramana added that people are \u201cscared\u201d to speak their mind, especially against acts of authorities, because they fear that the sedition law will be invoked against them. Referring to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which continues to be invoked and thousands of cases are still being registered under it even after it was struck down by the top court way back in 2015, CJI Ramana said that they will look into the plea challenging the constitutional validity of Section 124A (sedition). The top court\u2019s concern over the widespread misuse of the sedition law found expression when it said, \u201cThe situation on the ground is grave... If one party does not like what the other is saying, Section 124A is used... It is a serious threat to the functioning of individuals and parties,\u201d CJI Ramana further said, \u201cThis is like if a police officer wants to fix anybody in a village for something, he can use Section 124A... People are scared.\u201d In an apparent reference to the Modi government\u2019s drive to unburden the statue book by repealing archaic and antiquated laws, CJI Ramana told attorney general K.K.Venugopal, \u201cYour government has repealed many stale laws, I do not know why is your government not looking into repealing Section 124A of the IPC?\u201d Mr Venugopal, who was present in the hearing as the court had sought his assistance in dealing with the challenge to the constitutionality of sedition law, suggested that instead of striking down the law, the court may frame guidelines so that section meets its legal purpose. The top court\u2019s concern and strongly-worded observations over the misuse of sedition law came in the course of the hearing of a petition by a retired  Major General S.G. Vombatkere who has challenged the constitutionality of Section 124A IPC (sedition law). Maj. Gen. Vombatkere has contended that the sedition law is based on a vague definition of \u201cdisaffection towards Government\u201d and is an \"unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to free expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and causes constitutionally impermissible \u2018Chilling Effect\u2019 on free speech.\u201d Issuing notice to the Centre and tagging the petition with an earlier matter that will come up for hearing on July 27, the court said that Maj. Gen. Vombatkere has sacrificed his entire life in the service of the country and we cannot say it is a motivated petition. A top court bench comprising Justice Uday U Lalit and Justice Ajay Rastogi had on July 12, 2021, sought response from the Centre and the attorney general on a similar petition by two journalists from Chhattisgarh and Manipur, challenging the constitutional validity of the offence of sedition. In the earlier matter in which notice was issued on July 12, the petitioners  petitioners \u2014 Kanhaiya Lal Shukla and Kisorechandra Wangkhemcha \u2014 had argued that the sedition law clearly infringes the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution that guarantees that \"all citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression\u201d. The sedition law was meant to suppress the freedom movement and was used by the Britishers to silence Mahatma Gandhi and others, the court noted. Some guidelines may be laid down to curb misuse of sedition law, Attorney General K K Venugopal said while defending the validity of the provision. The bench was hearing a fresh plea by former army officer Major-General S G Vombatkere (Retd) challenging the Constitutional validity of section 124 A (sedition) of the IPC on grounds that it causes a \"chilling effect\" on speech and is an unreasonable restriction on free expression, a fundamental right.

Mirabai Chanu wins silver medal in Weightlifting Women\u2019s 49Kg category in Tokyo Olympics Mirabai Chanu became the first first Indian weightlifter to win a silver medal in Olympics Livemint Updated 24 Jul 2021, 12:19 PM IST India\u2019s Mirabai Chanu reacts after a successful attempt at Snatch in the women\u2019s 49kg weightlifting event, in Tokyo ( PTI ) Indian weightlifter Mirabai Chanu today won the first medal for India in the ongoing Tokyo Olympics. She won a silver medal in the 49kg category of Women's weightlifting event. She became the first Indian weightlifter to win a silver medal in Olympics.With this, she ended India's 21-year wait for a weightlifting medal at the Olympics. Chanu lifted a total of 202 kg (87kg in snatch and 115kg in clean and jerk) during her four successful attempts across the competition. China's Zhihui Hou bagged gold with a total of 210kg and created a new Olympic Record while Indonesia's Windy Cantika Aisah grabbed bronze with a total of 194kg. Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Mirabai Chanu on winning the silver medal in Tokyo Olympics and tweeted,\"Could not have asked for a happier start to @Tokyo2020! India is elated by @mirabai_chanu\u2019s stupendous performance. Congratulations to her for winning the Silver medal in weightlifting. Her success motivates every Indian. With this monumental silver medal, Chanu has become the second Indian weightlifter to win an Olympic medal after Karnam Malleswari bagged bronze in the 69kg category at the 2000 Sydney Games when the weightlifting arena was opened to women for the first time. Mirabai got off to a flying start after she completed her lift of 84 kg in the first attempt in snatch. Manipur-born weightlifter then proceeded to complete the 87kg weightlift with ease but failed to complete the 89kg lift in her last attempt. In the clean jerk, Chanu, the world record holder in the section, lifted 110kg and 115kg in the first two attempts. The 26-year-old lifted a total of 202kg (87kg 115kg) to better Karnam Malleswari's bronze in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. With this, she exorcised the ghosts of the 2016 Games where she had failed to log a single legitimate lift. Catch all the Sports News and Updates on Live Mint.

Aditya Menon Updated : 27 Jul 2021, 9:03 AM IST Politics i A a A a Small A a Medium A a Large BJP's tallest leader in Karnataka, BS Yediyurappa, has resigned as chief minister on 26 July, the day he completed two years in office. He became the the third BJP chief minister in the country to be removed in the last six months, the other two being Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat, both in Uttarakhand. Another CM - Sarbananda Sonowal in Assam - was replaced after the BJP's victory in the state elections. A new chief minister of Karnataka is likely to be announced in the next few days and he or she will be faced with the challenge of steering the government for the next 21 months, until the 2023 Assembly elections. While Yediyurappa's removal was imminent as the 78-year-old was well past the BJP's 75-years' retirement age, it won't be without a political cost. It is believed that the manner in which Yediyurappa resigned, especially his tearful speech, could harm the BJP among Lingayats for whom he was the undisputed leader. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Historical precedents, too, aren't on the BJP's side and this is what the article will be focusing on. There are three questions to be examined here: Have changes of guard worked for the BJP in Karnataka or any other state? Has changing the CM worked for any party in Karnataka? What could lie ahead? HAS CHANGING CMs WORKED FOR THE BJP ANYWHERE? The most relevant example is the BJP's previous tenure in Karnataka, from 2008 to 2013. The party won the 2008 elections under Yediyurappa's leadership but he was made to resign three years and two months into his term, after the Lokayukta indicted him for allegedly profiteering from land deals in Bangalore and Shivamoga and also in connection with illegal mining in Bellary. In the remaining two years, the BJP had two chief ministers - DV Sadananda Gowda (2011-12) and Jagadish Shettar (2012-13). Meanwhile, Yediyurappa left the BJP and formed a new party - the Karnataka Janata Paksha. This proved to be disastrous for the BJP as it lost the 2013 Assembly elections to the Congress. However, the BJP's isn't an isolated case in Karnataka. But more on that in the next section. Outside Karnataka, the BJP has had mixed luck with changing CMs.  Other than Karnataka, there are three other examples of changing CMs not working out for the BJP. Delhi In Delhi, the BJP had three chief ministers between 1993 and 1998: Madan Lal Khurana (1993-1996), Sahib Singh Verma (1996-1998) and Sushma Swaraj for just 52 days in 1998. The party lost badly in the 1998 Assembly polls and has been out of power in Delhi ever since. Uttarakhand In Uttarakhand, the BJP has had a particularly bad experience. It had two chief ministers between 2000 and 2002: Nityanand Swamy (2000-2001) and Bhagat Singh Koshyari (2001-2002) and lost in the 2002 Assembly elections to the Congress. Again between 2007 and 2012, it changed CMs twice - BC Khanduri (2007-2009), Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank (2009-2011) and Khanduri again (2011-12). Not surprisingly, it lost the 2012 Assembly elections to the Congress. Now again it has changed three chief ministers in Uttarakhand: Trivendra Singh Rawat (2017-21), Tirath Singh Rawat (March to July 2021) and now Pushkar Dhami. If the 2002 and 2012 elections are any indication, BJP may find it difficult to get re-elected in Uttarakhand in 2022. Uttar Pradesh Then in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, the BJP had three chief ministers between 1997 and 2002: Kalyan Singh (1997-1999), Ram Prakash Gupta (1999-2000) and Rajnath Singh (2000-2002). It stood third in the 2002 elections, with its tally falling from 156 to 88. However, there are a few states where a change hasn't harmed the BJP. In fact, at least two new chief ministers ended up having highly successful tenures. Exception 1: Gujarat The most prominent example of this is the present Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He took over as Gujarat chief minister from Keshubhai Patel in 2001. At that time, he was perceived as an 'organisation man' and a 'political lightweight' compared to the Patidar chieftain. But he won three elections as CM (2002, 2007 and 2012) and marginalised Patel from state politics. Of course, it must be said that his success in 2002 was largely due to unprecedented communal consolidation following the anti-Muslim pogrom earlier that year. Exception 2: Madhya Pradesh Another example is present Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He took office in 2005 as the third CM in two years, after Uma Bharti (2003-2004) and Babulal Gaur (2004-2005). At that time, Chouhan was seen as a leader who couldn't match Bharti's charisma or Gaur's seniority. Yet after initial hiccups, he took control of the party and administration and won two more terms - 2008 and 2013. He became CM yet again in 2020 after the Congress lost its majority due to defections. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD HAS CHANGING CM WORKED FOR ANY PARTY IN KARNATAKA? Karnataka has had a history of political instability mainly due to its regional and caste diversity, existence of multiple political players and interference from the central leadership of parties. Only four out of 19 chief ministers have completed their terms so far - S Nijalingappa (1962-67), Devaraj Urs (1972-77), SM Krishna (1999-2004) and Siddaramaiah (2013-2018) - all from the Congress. In almost all occasions, the party that has replaced a chief minister in the middle of his term, for whatever reasons, has suffered in the next election. After a full term, Devaraj Urs became CM once again in 1978 but left Congress in 1979 but many of the MLAs loyal to him returned to Congress after it came back to power at the centre in 1980. The Congress made Gundu Rao the CM in 1980 but the Congress was defeated in the 1983 elections and Janata Party's Ramakrishna Hegde formed a non-Congress government. Elections were held again in 1985, in which Hegde won a majority. But he quit in 1988 following allegations of phone-tapping of opponents. SR Bommai became the CM till his government was dismissed by the Governor in 1989. The Janata Party's breakaway, Janata Dal, lost the election in 1989 and Bommai was defeated in his own constituency. But despite Congress winning a majority, the political instability didn't end as it had three chief ministers during its five year tenure - Veerendra Patil (1989-90), S Bangarappa (1990-92) and Veerappa Moily (1992-94). But the party paid a price for it in 1994, coming third in the elections which were won by the Janata Dal led by HD Deve Gowda. The BJP, led by Yediyurappa, came second. Deve Gowda moved to the Centre as Prime Minister in 1996 and was replaced by JH Patel. Not surprisingly, the Janata Dal lost power in 1999 to the Congress. The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) formed a coalition government from 2004 to 2007 with two CMs - Dharam Singh and HD Kumaraswamy. This period of instability led to the BJP coming to power in 2008. What happened during the BJP's term has already been discussed above. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD WHAT COULD LIE AHEAD? Of course, it's not as if CMs who completed terms fared much better at the hustings - the Congress' seats reduced significantly under both full-term CMs - SM Krishna in 2004 and Siddaramaiah in 2018. So given Karnataka's political history, the odds are stacked against any CM who replaces Yediyurappa. However, the BJP could draw solace from the examples of Modi in Gujarat and Shivraj Chouhan in MP. But does it have a leader in Karnataka who can do what these two leaders did in their respective states? It won't be easy for a number of reasons. Firstly, a great deal would depend on how entrenched the BJP and RSS have become in Karnataka's political and social landscape. The BJP's gained political power in MP and Gujarat over a decade before Karnataka. MP had a BJP government in 1990, Gujarat in 1995. In Karnataka, it happened only in 2008. The penetration of the RSS has also been much deeper in the other two states, compared to Karnataka. The other issue is that the Opposition is far stronger in Karnataka. With Yediuyurappa gone, Congress' Siddaramaiah is the most prominent leader with state wide appeal. The Congress also has a strong state president in DK Shivakumar. Then HD Kumaraswamy's JD(S) is also influential in its pockets in the Old Mysore region. Any successor to Yediyurappa would have to work under the shadows of both a towering predecessor as well as three powerful Opposition figures in Siddaramaiah, Kumaraswamy and Shivakumar. There are only three circumstances in which the BJP can hope to come back to power in Karnataka: a massive Hindutva surge, an implosion in the Congress or an alliance with the JD(S). The BJP's choice as CM could well be determined based on who is best placed to achieve either of these three purposes. (At The Quint, we question everything.

Aditya Menon Updated : 27 Jul 2021, 9:03 AM IST Politics i A a A a Small A a Medium A a Large BJP's tallest leader in Karnataka, BS Yediyurappa, has resigned as chief minister on 26 July, the day he completed two years in office. He became the the third BJP chief minister in the country to be removed in the last six months, the other two being Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat, both in Uttarakhand. Another CM - Sarbananda Sonowal in Assam - was replaced after the BJP's victory in the state elections. A new chief minister of Karnataka is likely to be announced in the next few days and he or she will be faced with the challenge of steering the government for the next 21 months, until the 2023 Assembly elections. While Yediyurappa's removal was imminent as the 78-year-old was well past the BJP's 75-years' retirement age, it won't be without a political cost. It is believed that the manner in which Yediyurappa resigned, especially his tearful speech, could harm the BJP among Lingayats for whom he was the undisputed leader. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Historical precedents, too, aren't on the BJP's side and this is what the article will be focusing on. There are three questions to be examined here: Have changes of guard worked for the BJP in Karnataka or any other state? Has changing the CM worked for any party in Karnataka? What could lie ahead? HAS CHANGING CMs WORKED FOR THE BJP ANYWHERE? The most relevant example is the BJP's previous tenure in Karnataka, from 2008 to 2013. The party won the 2008 elections under Yediyurappa's leadership but he was made to resign three years and two months into his term, after the Lokayukta indicted him for allegedly profiteering from land deals in Bangalore and Shivamoga and also in connection with illegal mining in Bellary. In the remaining two years, the BJP had two chief ministers - DV Sadananda Gowda (2011-12) and Jagadish Shettar (2012-13). Meanwhile, Yediyurappa left the BJP and formed a new party - the Karnataka Janata Paksha. This proved to be disastrous for the BJP as it lost the 2013 Assembly elections to the Congress. However, the BJP's isn't an isolated case in Karnataka. But more on that in the next section. Outside Karnataka, the BJP has had mixed luck with changing CMs.  Other than Karnataka, there are three other examples of changing CMs not working out for the BJP. Delhi In Delhi, the BJP had three chief ministers between 1993 and 1998: Madan Lal Khurana (1993-1996), Sahib Singh Verma (1996-1998) and Sushma Swaraj for just 52 days in 1998. The party lost badly in the 1998 Assembly polls and has been out of power in Delhi ever since. Uttarakhand In Uttarakhand, the BJP has had a particularly bad experience. It had two chief ministers between 2000 and 2002: Nityanand Swamy (2000-2001) and Bhagat Singh Koshyari (2001-2002) and lost in the 2002 Assembly elections to the Congress. Again between 2007 and 2012, it changed CMs twice - BC Khanduri (2007-2009), Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank (2009-2011) and Khanduri again (2011-12). Not surprisingly, it lost the 2012 Assembly elections to the Congress. Now again it has changed three chief ministers in Uttarakhand: Trivendra Singh Rawat (2017-21), Tirath Singh Rawat (March to July 2021) and now Pushkar Dhami. If the 2002 and 2012 elections are any indication, BJP may find it difficult to get re-elected in Uttarakhand in 2022. Uttar Pradesh Then in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, the BJP had three chief ministers between 1997 and 2002: Kalyan Singh (1997-1999), Ram Prakash Gupta (1999-2000) and Rajnath Singh (2000-2002). It stood third in the 2002 elections, with its tally falling from 156 to 88. However, there are a few states where a change hasn't harmed the BJP. In fact, at least two new chief ministers ended up having highly successful tenures. Exception 1: Gujarat The most prominent example of this is the present Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He took over as Gujarat chief minister from Keshubhai Patel in 2001. At that time, he was perceived as an 'organisation man' and a 'political lightweight' compared to the Patidar chieftain. But he won three elections as CM (2002, 2007 and 2012) and marginalised Patel from state politics. Of course, it must be said that his success in 2002 was largely due to unprecedented communal consolidation following the anti-Muslim pogrom earlier that year. Exception 2: Madhya Pradesh Another example is present Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He took office in 2005 as the third CM in two years, after Uma Bharti (2003-2004) and Babulal Gaur (2004-2005). At that time, Chouhan was seen as a leader who couldn't match Bharti's charisma or Gaur's seniority. Yet after initial hiccups, he took control of the party and administration and won two more terms - 2008 and 2013. He became CM yet again in 2020 after the Congress lost its majority due to defections. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD HAS CHANGING CM WORKED FOR ANY PARTY IN KARNATAKA? Karnataka has had a history of political instability mainly due to its regional and caste diversity, existence of multiple political players and interference from the central leadership of parties. Only four out of 19 chief ministers have completed their terms so far - S Nijalingappa (1962-67), Devaraj Urs (1972-77), SM Krishna (1999-2004) and Siddaramaiah (2013-2018) - all from the Congress. In almost all occasions, the party that has replaced a chief minister in the middle of his term, for whatever reasons, has suffered in the next election. After a full term, Devaraj Urs became CM once again in 1978 but left Congress in 1979 but many of the MLAs loyal to him returned to Congress after it came back to power at the centre in 1980. The Congress made Gundu Rao the CM in 1980 but the Congress was defeated in the 1983 elections and Janata Party's Ramakrishna Hegde formed a non-Congress government. Elections were held again in 1985, in which Hegde won a majority. But he quit in 1988 following allegations of phone-tapping of opponents. SR Bommai became the CM till his government was dismissed by the Governor in 1989. The Janata Party's breakaway, Janata Dal, lost the election in 1989 and Bommai was defeated in his own constituency. But despite Congress winning a majority, the political instability didn't end as it had three chief ministers during its five year tenure - Veerendra Patil (1989-90), S Bangarappa (1990-92) and Veerappa Moily (1992-94). But the party paid a price for it in 1994, coming third in the elections which were won by the Janata Dal led by HD Deve Gowda. The BJP, led by Yediyurappa, came second. Deve Gowda moved to the Centre as Prime Minister in 1996 and was replaced by JH Patel. Not surprisingly, the Janata Dal lost power in 1999 to the Congress. The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) formed a coalition government from 2004 to 2007 with two CMs - Dharam Singh and HD Kumaraswamy. This period of instability led to the BJP coming to power in 2008. What happened during the BJP's term has already been discussed above. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD WHAT COULD LIE AHEAD? Of course, it's not as if CMs who completed terms fared much better at the hustings - the Congress' seats reduced significantly under both full-term CMs - SM Krishna in 2004 and Siddaramaiah in 2018. So given Karnataka's political history, the odds are stacked against any CM who replaces Yediyurappa. However, the BJP could draw solace from the examples of Modi in Gujarat and Shivraj Chouhan in MP. But does it have a leader in Karnataka who can do what these two leaders did in their respective states? It won't be easy for a number of reasons. Firstly, a great deal would depend on how entrenched the BJP and RSS have become in Karnataka's political and social landscape. The BJP's gained political power in MP and Gujarat over a decade before Karnataka. MP had a BJP government in 1990, Gujarat in 1995. In Karnataka, it happened only in 2008. The penetration of the RSS has also been much deeper in the other two states, compared to Karnataka. The other issue is that the Opposition is far stronger in Karnataka. With Yediuyurappa gone, Congress' Siddaramaiah is the most prominent leader with state wide appeal. The Congress also has a strong state president in DK Shivakumar. Then HD Kumaraswamy's JD(S) is also influential in its pockets in the Old Mysore region. Any successor to Yediyurappa would have to work under the shadows of both a towering predecessor as well as three powerful Opposition figures in Siddaramaiah, Kumaraswamy and Shivakumar. There are only three circumstances in which the BJP can hope to come back to power in Karnataka: a massive Hindutva surge, an implosion in the Congress or an alliance with the JD(S). The BJP's choice as CM could well be determined based on who is best placed to achieve either of these three purposes. (At The Quint, we question everything.

SC allows photos of only President, Prime Minister or Chief Justice in govt ads Objective of a govt advertisement can be achieved even without a photograph accompanying it, says apex court Shreeja Sen Updated 14 May 2015, 08:43 AM IST A bench comprising justices Ranjan Gogoi and P.C. Ghose accepted a majority of the recommendations made by an expert committee established by a court order dated 23 April 2014. Photo: Pradeep Gaur\/Mint New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday laid down guidelines for publication of government advertisements to avoid the misuse of public funds for plugging the ruling party and glorifying politicians. One guideline suggests that the photographs of only three dignitaries should be allowed on government ads\u2014the President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India (CJI). The objective of a government advertisement can be achieved even without a photograph accompanying it, the apex court said, and left it to the better judgment of the three luminaries whether their pictures should be carried on ads paid for by public funds. Publication of government ads carrying photographs have the potential of promoting \u201ca personality cult and the image of one or a few individuals which is a direct antithesis of democratic functioning\u201d, the court said. A committee set up by the Supreme Court suggested that photographs of political leaders be avoided in general in government advertisements, but made an exception for the President\/Prime Minister or state governor\/chief minister for \u201ceffective Government messaging\u201d. But the apex court restricted government ads to using the photographs only of the President and the Prime Minister and included the CJI. The court spelt out the guidelines in response to public interest litigation filed by two non-profit organizations, Common Cause and the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, which sought court directions to restrain the central and state governments from using public funds on government advertising. Saying governments should avoid such unproductive expenditure of public funds, a bench comprising justices Ranjan Gogoi and P.C. Ghose accepted a majority of the recommendations made by an expert committee established by a court order on 23 April 2014. The apex court, in 2014, had constituted the committee comprising N.R. Madhava Menon , a former director of the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal; T.K. Viswanathan , former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, and lawyer Ranjit Kumar , the current solicitor general, to consider various issues surrounding government advertisements and submit a report. The committee submitted a report to the court entitled the Government Advertisements (Content Regulation) Guidelines 2014. The government has received a copy of ruling from the Supreme Court and is reviewing it, said Bimal Julka , the senior-most civil servant in the information and broadcasting ministry. \u201cAll guidelines put out by the Supreme Court will be respected and implemented,\u201d said Julka. On the recommendation over the use of photographs, he said, \u201cIt is the content and the message that is most important.\u201d The National Democratic Alliance government has already curbed advertising expenditure, reducing it by 42.3% from \u20b9 1,300 crore in FY 2013-14 to \u20b9 750 crore in FY 2014-15, Julka said. He added that the government was pushing its advertising on social media websites as well as government-run websites and blogs. The recommendations of the committee, which the court has accepted with four exceptions, mandated that government advertisements will not contain a political party\u2019s symbol, logo or flag. Government advertisements are required to be politically neutral and must refrain from glorifying political personalities. The court found advertisements on government functioning and achievements \u201cpermissible\u201d as they help inform citizens. It added that the \u201cachievements of a Government should not be a matter of publicity\u201d. The court said any advertisement that provides information, if it\u2019s in a proper format, will be allowed. The court differed with the committee on recommendations for the appointment of an ombudsman to oversee the implementation of the guidelines, a special performance audit of government spending and an embargo on publication of advertisements on the eve of elections. The court directed the central government to set up a committee of three people with \u201cunimpeachable neutrality and impartiality\u201d which would serve as an ombudsman panel to ensure smooth implementation of the guidelines and to oversee such implementation. The court dispensed with the need for a special performance audit for the expenditure on such political advertisements, saying that the present machinery was adequate. It added that if these guidelines were adhered to, there would be no need to bar such advertising on the eve of elections. The court also said that the government had to maintain the principle of fairness in disseminating information through advertisements across all media. Government communication efforts aren\u2019t likely to be hamstrung by the guidelines laid down by the apex court, said an advertising professional. \u201cAssuming your (ad) budget remains the same then all you have to do is work around compliance and maximize your output,\u201d said Vandana Das , president of the advertising agency DDB Mudra in New Delhi. Vipul Mudgal , director of Common Cause, said in a statement that the guidelines were an important step in the direction of building accountability in the expenditure of tax payers\u2019 money. He said the provision of a three-member ombudsman to oversee the release of government advertisement is an idea whose time has come and which has the potential to emerge as an institution in its own right, like the Election Commission of India. Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leaders declined to comment on the guidelines, given that they are part of a court order. \u201cWe honour the decision of the court but one has to see if the democratic rights of the administrative head of the states is being affected or not,\u201d Bhakta Charan Das , national spokesperson for the Congress, said.

Shabbir (name changed) was stripped, tied to an electricity pole and assaulted by right-wing activists on August 24 for being in the company of a female colleague from another community. The girl later claimed that she Shabbir had 'harassed' her and that she was 'rescued' by the mob. Shabbir, however, said in his complaint that he was only giving some money to the girl which she had asked for, and he was sitting inside the car while she was standing outside. Addressing a press meet here on Tuesday, president of United Muslim Organization (UMO) and former mayor Ashraf condemned the incident and said, \"This incident has created panic among the business community of the district. Sangh Parivar is attacking youths from the minority community by using girls. Such attacks are part of a strategy to spark communal riots in the district.\" He further said that if such an incident happens in future, the United Muslims Organization, which comprises 40 like-minded organizations, would give a call to the minority business institutions and shops \"to stop hiring girls from the Hindu community at their worksplaces\". \"People from the minority communities are worried about hiring girls from Hindu community in the workplace. We will hold a campaign and also a Muslim convention by the end of this month. \"We want peace in the district. These types of attacks are repeating because of only two issues - girls and cow slaughter. Due to such incidents it is the poor people who suffer,\" he said. president of Uniwef Rafiquddin Kudroli said, \"As many as 13 incidents of moral policing have taken place from last August. 99.9 percent of Muslims are peace lovers. If the district adminisation or the police cannot provide security or solve this issue, let them say they cannot. We can solve it ourselves. Sangh Parivar is acting like a dictator.\" The Organization also demanded the arrest of Anil Kumar of Bajrang Dal and Latha of Durgavahini, who allegedly threatened Shabbir's brother in the police station while the case was being filed. \"Anil Kumar of Bajrang Dal and Latha wanted to compromise and threatened Shabbir's brother that a rape case would be filed against Shabbir. Latha even falsely claimed to be a representative from a national media,\" the UMO alleged, adding that Goonda Act should be invoked against all the accused in the case. Referring to the press meet called by the girl the next day, the Organization alleged that the girl who was involved in the incident was different from the one who sat in the press meet. \"The girl who was in the press meet was of a different build from the actual girl, and did not wear nail polish and finger ring like she did. Also, the actual girl was from a different district, while the one in the press meet spoke Mangaluru Kannada. Moreover, why did Sangh Parivar make her cover her face while addressing the media? \"If the girl was indeed a victim, why did the attackers abuse her at the spot instead of consoling her? If Shabbir had been harassing her, why did she not approach the police?\" UMO pointed out in a press note. When media persons asked if asking the minority communities not to hire Hindu girls would not further aggravate the situation, Ashraf said, \"We are not asking anyone to take this step right now. We are only saying that if in future such incidents repeat, then we will give a call to stop hiring girls from Hindu community.\" Asked what was the Organization's stand on the issue of cow slaughter, Ashrad said, \"BJP-led government is at the centre. Let it ban cow slaughter, we will welcome the move.\" On why the UMO did not protest againt the recent incident in which a nine-year-old boy was allegedly abused by a Madrasa teacher, as in Mangalore One school sexual assault case, Ashraf said that his organization equally condemns the Madrasa teacher incident too. Asked if cases of immoral rowdyism were a reflection of the failure of Congress government in the state, Ashraf said, \"Yes, it is a failure of the Congress government. When BJP was in power and pub attack incident happened, the government had at least arrested Prasad Attavar. But now the Congress government cannot arrest Bajrang Dal leader Sharan Pumpwell. The UMO in a press note also demanded withdrawal of the 'false' case against Shabbir, compensation for him from the government, investigation into the identity of the girl who address the press meet, and arrest of Sharan Pumpwell.

I am not against any religion but I hate humans being  treated and considered on religion and community grounds. I left Mangalore in 1975.  I had fantastic, happy go lucky days. You name it, we had them all. You read my comments yesterday, what is my take home message to today's youth.

(Google Maps screen grab) A woman and a police constable were killed and 15 injured in a crude bomb explosion on Ara civil court premises in Bihar\u2019s Bhojpur district on Friday, triggering alarm ahead of Republic Day. A few hours after the blast at 11.35am, police ruled out a terror link, saying it was more likely aimed at aiding some undertrial prisoners escape. Two of them did. Undertrial prisoners Lambu Sharma and Akhilesh Upadhyay escaped after the blast, taking advantage of the chaos. Police suspect the woman killed in the blast had carried the bomb. Her identity has not been established. Her body was blown to pieces. \u201cThis shows she was closest to the impact site,\u201d said a police official. The deceased constable was named as Amit Kumar, 25. A senior police officer said the woman might have had some links with some prisoner. \u201cIt is a matter of investigation.\u201d Bihar chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said, \u201cThe blast took place while the bomb was being passed on to an intended person, apparently, for the release of some prisoner or prisoners. It went off prematurely, it seems.\u201d He dismissed initial talk of \u201chuman bomb\u201d and \u201csuicide bomber\u201d. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey said the explosion took place when a van carrying undertrials for production in the court entered the premises. The undertrials were being taken to the court lock-up. \u201cThe woman was apparently carrying the bomb. It was a crude bomb,\u201d he said, ruling out the possibility of the blast being a terror attack. Bhojpur district magistrate Pankaj Kumar Pal said some lawyers were among the injured. \u201cWe have come to know of (injuries to) three lawyers. Some police officials have also sustained injuries. The injured have been taken to the local civil hospital,\u201d he added. The blast in Ara, about 60km west off capital Patna, initially rattled the state administration. Apart from the general state of preparedness for Republic Day, police were also on their toes for two meetings to be addressed in the state during the day by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. Bihar police did not take chances given that serial blasts had rocked Gandhi Maidan in Patna during Narendra Modi's (then the BJP\u2019s prime ministerial candidate) Hunkar rally in October 2013.

Terming religion a very private relationship between man and his God, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on Monday, in a majority judgment, held that an appeal for votes during elections on the basis of religion, caste, race, community or language, even that of the electorate, will amount to a \u2018corrupt practice\u2019 and call for disqualification of the candidate. \u201cElection is a secular exercise and therefore a process should be followed\u2026 The relationship between man and God is an individual choice and state should keep this in mind,\u201d the Supreme Court held in a majority judgment of 4:3. The court was interpreting the pronoun \u2018his\u2019 used in Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act. The provision mandates that it would amount to a \u2018corrupt practice\u2019 if a candidate or his agent or any other person, with his consent, appeals for votes on religious or such grounds. It will be a disservice to the \u2018little man\u2019: SC The question referred to the Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur on a batch of election petitions was whether the word \u2018his\u2019 used in Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act only meant a bar on appeals made in the name of the candidate or his rival or his agent or others in his immediate camp. Or, does the word \u2018his\u2019 also extend to soliciting votes on the basis of the religion, caste, community, race, language of the electorate as a whole. The latter would mean a blanket ban on any appeal, reference, campaign, discussion, dialogue or debate on the basis of religion, race, caste, community or language, even if such a debate was on the deprivations suffered by the voters due to these considerations. The majority on the Bench \u2014 the Chief Justice and Justices Madan B. Lokur, S.A. Bobde and L. Nageshwara Rao \u2014 interpreted that Parliament meant by \u2018his\u2019 a complete ban on any reference or appeal to religion, race, community, caste and language during elections. This meant the pronoun extended to the social, linguistic and religious identity of the voter also. Chief Justice Thakur said appealing on the basis of religion would amount to \u201cmixing religion with State power.\u201d \u201cElections to the State legislature or to the Parliament or for that matter any body in the State is a secular exercise just as the functions of the elected representatives must be secular in both outlook and practice,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur observed in his separate judgment, throwing his lot with Justices Lokur, Rao and Bobde. Legislative aim Justice Lokur said the primary legislative aim of Section 123(3) of the Representation of People Act is to \u201ccurb communal and separatist tendencies in the country.\u201d Justice Lokur said that by allowing a candidate to take advantage of the voters\u2019 religious identity merely to gain votes would be a disservice to the \u201clittle man\u201d and against public interest. Quoting Winston Churchill, Justice Lokur said: \u201cAt the bottom of all tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into the little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little piece of paper...\u201d Justice Bobde summarised that Section 123 proscribed all appeals based on sectarian, linguistic or caste considerations during election campaigns in order to \u201cinfuse a modicum of oneness, transcending such barriers.\u201d He borrowed, in this context, Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s phrase that election campaigns should transcend the fragmented \u201cnarrow domestic walls.\u201d Dissenting with the majority and delivering a scathing retort, the minority judgment authored by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud pointed to the historic discriminations and deprivations suffered by the masses on the ground of religion, caste and language. Justice Chandrachud wrote that these were social realities in our country that the Indian addresses. \u2018Cannot be barred\u2019 \u201cHow can this be barred from being discussed in an election? Religion, caste and language are as much a symbol of social discrimination imposed on large segments of our society. They are part of the central theme of the Constitution to produce a just social order. Electoral politics in a democratic polity is about social mobilisation,\u201d Justice Chandrachud wrote in his separate judgment supported by Justices A.K.Goel and U.U. Lalit.

INS Viraat NEW DELHI: The world's oldest aircraft carrier in active service, INS Viraat , will be decommissioned on Monday after serving the Indian Navy for nearly 30 years. INS Viraat's retirement will not only end a glorious chapter in the Indian Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history but will also create a vacuum as the sea hawks will be short of two aircraft carriers now. Earlier, INS Vikrant was decommissioned in 1997. The decommissioning ceremony will be attended by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and other dignitaries. The grand event will see the lowering and wrap-up of the naval flag installed on the warship at sunset, marking an end to a long sea odyssey lasting 55 years. INS Viraat was commissioned in Indian Navy in 1987, before that the historic ship served Royal British Navy for 27 long years. It was built in 1943, during the Second World War. The carrier has provided utmost protection to the country during many tense situations. The decision on the warship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future has not been taken yet. But the warship would be possibly converted into a museum, hotel or will be preserved as a relic of maritime history.

(Reuters file photo) GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat has adopted the toughest law against cow slaughter in the country. From now, the crime will be punishable with a 14-year jail term. The state government cleared on Friday the Gujarat Animal Preservation (Amendment) Bill, 2017, which raises the maximum jail sentence from the current 3-7 years to 14 years for cow slaughter. It also carries a provision of fine of up to Rs 5 lakh and not less than Rs 1 lakh. The bill was passed by a majority vote in the absence of opposition members in the assembly but in the presence of many saffron-clad sadhus in the public gallery. A top official who was part of the team which drafted the bill told TOI, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt (cow slaughter) will invite a sentence of life term of a maximum of 14 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring this auspicious occasion of Chaitra Navratri, the government, on suggestions of several sadhu-sants, has made amendments to the Gujarat Animal Protection (Amendment) Act, 2011. This is the harshest law in the country, which was required to save our religion, culture, economy and environment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The bill, seen as an attempt to consolidate Hindu votes ahead of the 2017 assembly polls, makes all offences under the act cognisable and non-bailable. Jadeja added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShedding of even a single drop of cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood hurts Hindus. We have equalled killing of a cow or cow progeny with killing of a human being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Initially, the draft bill submitted in the assembly had a provision of a maximum of 10 years of jail for cow slaughter. However, the penalty was raised to 14 years through a supplementary provision introduced in the House by the MoS home on Friday, which was attached with the amendment bill. The jail term for illegal ferrying of cows for slaughter, selling, stocking or exhibition of cow beef, too, has been raised to 10 years.

Terming religion a very private relationship between man and his God, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on Monday, in a majority judgment, held that an appeal for votes during elections on the basis of religion, caste, race, community or language, even that of the electorate, will amount to a \u2018corrupt practice\u2019 and call for disqualification of the candidate. \u201cElection is a secular exercise and therefore a process should be followed\u2026 The relationship between man and God is an individual choice and state should keep this in mind,\u201d the Supreme Court held in a majority judgment of 4:3. The court was interpreting the pronoun \u2018his\u2019 used in Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act. The provision mandates that it would amount to a \u2018corrupt practice\u2019 if a candidate or his agent or any other person, with his consent, appeals for votes on religious or such grounds. It will be a disservice to the \u2018little man\u2019: SC The question referred to the Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur on a batch of election petitions was whether the word \u2018his\u2019 used in Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the People Act only meant a bar on appeals made in the name of the candidate or his rival or his agent or others in his immediate camp. Or, does the word \u2018his\u2019 also extend to soliciting votes on the basis of the religion, caste, community, race, language of the electorate as a whole. The latter would mean a blanket ban on any appeal, reference, campaign, discussion, dialogue or debate on the basis of religion, race, caste, community or language, even if such a debate was on the deprivations suffered by the voters due to these considerations. The majority on the Bench \u2014 the Chief Justice and Justices Madan B. Lokur, S.A. Bobde and L. Nageshwara Rao \u2014 interpreted that Parliament meant by \u2018his\u2019 a complete ban on any reference or appeal to religion, race, community, caste and language during elections. This meant the pronoun extended to the social, linguistic and religious identity of the voter also. Chief Justice Thakur said appealing on the basis of religion would amount to \u201cmixing religion with State power.\u201d \u201cElections to the State legislature or to the Parliament or for that matter any body in the State is a secular exercise just as the functions of the elected representatives must be secular in both outlook and practice,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur observed in his separate judgment, throwing his lot with Justices Lokur, Rao and Bobde. Legislative aim Justice Lokur said the primary legislative aim of Section 123(3) of the Representation of People Act is to \u201ccurb communal and separatist tendencies in the country.\u201d Justice Lokur said that by allowing a candidate to take advantage of the voters\u2019 religious identity merely to gain votes would be a disservice to the \u201clittle man\u201d and against public interest. Quoting Winston Churchill, Justice Lokur said: \u201cAt the bottom of all tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into the little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little piece of paper...\u201d Justice Bobde summarised that Section 123 proscribed all appeals based on sectarian, linguistic or caste considerations during election campaigns in order to \u201cinfuse a modicum of oneness, transcending such barriers.\u201d He borrowed, in this context, Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s phrase that election campaigns should transcend the fragmented \u201cnarrow domestic walls.\u201d Dissenting with the majority and delivering a scathing retort, the minority judgment authored by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud pointed to the historic discriminations and deprivations suffered by the masses on the ground of religion, caste and language. Justice Chandrachud wrote that these were social realities in our country that the Indian addresses. \u2018Cannot be barred\u2019 \u201cHow can this be barred from being discussed in an election? Religion, caste and language are as much a symbol of social discrimination imposed on large segments of our society. They are part of the central theme of the Constitution to produce a just social order. Electoral politics in a democratic polity is about social mobilisation,\u201d Justice Chandrachud wrote in his separate judgment supported by Justices A.K.Goel and U.U. Lalit.

INS Viraat NEW DELHI: The world's oldest aircraft carrier in active service, INS Viraat , will be decommissioned on Monday after serving the Indian Navy for nearly 30 years. INS Viraat's retirement will not only end a glorious chapter in the Indian Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history but will also create a vacuum as the sea hawks will be short of two aircraft carriers now. Earlier, INS Vikrant was decommissioned in 1997. The decommissioning ceremony will be attended by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and other dignitaries. The grand event will see the lowering and wrap-up of the naval flag installed on the warship at sunset, marking an end to a long sea odyssey lasting 55 years. INS Viraat was commissioned in Indian Navy in 1987, before that the historic ship served Royal British Navy for 27 long years. It was built in 1943, during the Second World War. The carrier has provided utmost protection to the country during many tense situations. The decision on the warship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future has not been taken yet. But the warship would be possibly converted into a museum, hotel or will be preserved as a relic of maritime history.

Vedhan The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched 31 satellites \u2014 29 of them belonging to foreign countries \u2014 on board the PSLV-C38 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre here on Friday. The PSLV, in its 40th flight, carried the Cartosat-2 series satellite, the main payload, weighing 712 kg and another Indian satellite, NIUSAT, an Indian university\/academic institute satellite from Noorul Islam University, Kanyakumari. Delegates from foreign agencies that were sending their satellites watched from Mission Control as the satellites were placed into orbit. The PSLV-C38 took off from the first launchpad at 9.29 a.m. The Cartosat-2 series satellite was placed in orbit at 16 minutes after launch and the final satellite was injected into orbit at 23 minutes. The total payload weighed 955 kg at lift-off. The Cartosat satellite launch will provide remote sensing services for about five years. The other 29 nano satellites belonged to 14 nations \u2014 Austria, Belgium, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, the U.K., and the U.S. Remote sensing satellite The Cartosat-2 is a remote sensing satellite, and is the sixth in the series. It was placed in a 505 km polar Sun Synchronous orbit. It will be used for cartographic applications, coastal land use and regulation, road network monitoring, water distribution, creation of land use maps, Land Information Systems (LIS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) applications, ISRO said. The Cartosat satellite separated 16.43 minutes after launch, as planned, following which the remaining satellites separated over the next seven minutes. With the launch of the PSLV-C38, B. Jayakumar, Mission Director said, ISRO now had the confidence to put a number of satellites into different orbits, in a single mission. \u201cInitially it [PSLV] was designed to put satellites in sun synchronous orbit\u2026 we could establish it could cater to any type of orbit \u2013 Geo Synchronous, Sun Synchronous orbit or low inclination orbit, carrying multiple satellites; Everything has been established.

Panaji: Manohar Parrikar took oath as the new Chief Minister of Goa on Tuesday, but he must take a trust vote on Thursday to prove he has a majority, the Supreme Court ruled, in a big setback for the Congress, which was also criticized for its actions by judges. The BJP was invited to form the government in Goa despite winning fewer seats in the election than the Congress. That decision - taken by Governor Mridula Sinha - was challenged by the Congress in court. The Congress won 17 seats in the election; the BJP won 13, but secured the support of small regional parties. Here are the latest developments in this big political story: The Congress told the Supreme Court that Governor Sinha's decision to invite the BJP to form the government is \"illegal\" and a \"blatant unconstitutional action\" because the party that won the most seats should get first shot at forming the government. Speaking to NDTV, Mr Parrikar said last evening \"I have done no wrong. The Congress did not even have the numbers.\" In a blog, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, \"The Congress did not even submit a claim to the Governor.\" The Congress disagrees - senior leader Digvijaya Singh said that the Congress wrote to the Governor on Sunday, asking for the chance to prove its majority, but was not granted an appointment. \"If you had the numbers, you would have held a dharna (protest) at the Governor's house,\" the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, adding that the Congress' petition to judges also does not have evidence that it has the needed support. Courts are on holiday, but Chief Justice of India JS Khehar and other judges heard the petition on account of its political urgency. In election results announced on Saturday, the Congress won 17 seats and the BJP was second with 13. Both were short of 21, the minimum number of seats needed in the 40-member Goa assembly to form government. The BJP moved swiftly to secure the support of regional parties Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP and Goa Forward and some Independent legislators and had by Sunday evening met the Governor to stake claim. The new allies had one condition - the BJP's Manohar Parrikar should be Chief Minister. Manohar Parrikar said on Monday that he had resigned as Defence Minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet to return to his home state and to the post he held before he was called to Delhi. Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of buying support. \"The mandate of the people has been stolen,\" he said. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, who has charge of BJP's Goa affairs retorted , \"The Congress was busy in Goa with five to six candidates claiming leadership. So they did not have time to discuss with alliance partners.\" Several newly-elected Congress MLAs or legislators are livid that the party's state leadership did not move fast enough to get the support of four legislators that it needed. \"It is miserable and horrible...people trusted the Congress and voted for us...we get a clear 17 seats and we still couldn't manage to form government... we are the laughing stock,\" said Jennifer Monserrate, a Congress leader elected from Taleigao (North Goa). The MLAs have attacked Congress' Goa in charge Digvijaya Singh alleging mismanagement by \"seniors\" and have in private compared his efforts of to those of Nitin Gadkari, who began negotiations with smaller parties immediately after election results were announced.

{"year":"2017","month":"06","event_desc":"6 June - Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed the state police to take action against cow slaughter and cattle smuggling under the National Security Act and the Gangster Act.","text":"Cattle smuggling, slaughter in UP now punishable under National Security Act Rajesh Kumar Singh, Hindustan Times, Lucknow | By HT Correspondent Jun 11, 2017 09:38 PM IST Share Via Copy Link The directive has been conveyed to all district police chiefs by the state DGP. Cow slaughter and cattle smuggling in Uttar Pradesh will invite action under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and Gangster Act, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Tuesday, giving police the power to detain people for an year on mere suspicion. (HT File) The directive to invoke the acts was issued by director general of police Sulkhan Singh on Monday, officials said. \u201cThe decision to slap NSA and Gangster Act against cattle smugglers and cow slaughter was taken in the general interest of the state and the people,\u201d Adiytanath told reporters. \u201cDuring assembly election people demanded ban on cow slaughter and cattle smuggling. It was also one of the election promises of the BJP. The state government will not allow anyone to take liberties with the laws,\u201d he said. Since sweeping to power in March, the BJP government led by the priest-turned-politician has launched what it says is a crackdown on illegal slaughter houses and cattle smuggling. Critics say the government\u2019s move was aimed at targeting the Muslim and Dalit communities which are mainly involved in cattle trade. The UP government directive came days after the Centre issued a controversial rule that outlawed sale of cattle for slaughter at animal markets and triggered a political storm in India. The Madras high court later ordered a four-week stay on the notification. Millions of Hindus consider the cow to be holy and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) \u2013 the idelogical mentor of the ruling BJP \u2013 has been pushing for a countrywide ban on bovine slaughter. Opposition parties say the Centres rule violates individual rights and will hurt millions of cattle and meat traders. Under the NSA, the district magistrate has powers to keep a person under detention for up to a year. Under the Gangster Act, a person can be imprisoned between 2 to ten years and slapped with a fine of up to Rs 5,000 or more. In his order, the DGP asked district police chiefs to take \u201cstrict action\u201d to check cattle smuggling and also to activate local intelligence units for information gathering. \u201cRegular patrolling should be organised on highways and the police should check trucks. Genuine traders should not be harassed but smugglers should not be spared,\u201d he said. The DGP also asked police not to extort money from transporters. Cattle traders, however, said the state government\u2019s decision could led to harassment. \u201cThe new order has given immense power to the police and they may misuse it for money. The state government should constitute a committee, which should include cattle traders and farmers, to check misuse of the directives. The order may leave an adverse impact on cattle trade as well,\u201d he said. A government body said on Tuesday, India\u2019s buffalo meat exports dropped by 35% in April over the March figures, mainly attributed to the crackdown in UP, the country\u2019s largest meat producing state. Data released by the directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics (principal commodities) of the ministry of commerce and industry show a drop of more than 51,000 tonnes in April exports, compared to March.

This decision was driven by the political and social context in India, where cows are considered sacred by a significant portion of the Hindu population, the majority religion in the state. The government aimed to deter illegal activities related to cattle, which were seen as not only violating religious sentiments but also impacting the economic and social fabric of the state. The NSA, which allows for the detention of individuals without trial for up to a year, and the Gangster Act, which targets organized criminal activities, were used to strengthen the legal framework and impose harsher penalties on those involved in these activities.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides a detailed explanation of the context and motivations behind the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to apply the National Security Act and Gangster Act to cattle smuggling and slaughter in 2017.

KATHMANDU : The death toll in rain- triggered floods and landslides in Nepal has climbed to 91 with 38 persons still missing and over six million people affected by natural calamity. Nepal Ministry of Home Affairs said 2,847 houses were completely damaged in the disaster, My Republica reported. \"A committee was formed under the coordination of Home Minister Janardan Sharma to tally details of the loss. The chief secretary and secretaries of 12 ministries are members of the committee,\" Ram Krishna Subedi, spokesperson of the Home Ministry, was quoted by the report. The death toll reached 91 as of Monday evening, the Home Ministry said, adding that normal life in different parts of the country was severely affected while a large number of people were reported displaced by floods, landslides and inundations. It has also said that the government has accelerated the task of rescue and relief operations as well as search for those missing in the flooding and inundation, with more than 26,700 security personnel directly deployed for post-disaster rescue and relief operations. A total of 13 helicopters, including seven of Nepal Army , motorboats, rubber boats and other equipment are being used for search, rescue and relief measures. Ministry's spokesperson Ram Krishna Subedi said that tarps, cooking pots, dry foods, salt, vegetable oil and other relief materials have also been distributed in the affected districts. Heavy rainfall has lashed Nepal for the past five days, leading to the swelling of several rivers beyond the danger mark and causing flooding and landslides at many places. Rapti river, which flows through a large part of Nepal towards the southern plains, flooded human settlements and hotels popular with tourists in the Chitwan Valley . All the 35 Indian nationals, who were stranded in Sauraha, a part of the Chitawan National Park , have been rescued, an Indian Embassy spokesperson said. They were rescued to safer place by using tamed elephants. Earlier reports quoting local authorities had said that 200 Indian tourists were among the 700 stranded people, but the Indian Embassy official said only 35 of them were Indian nationals. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA), at least 14 people were killed by landslide in Morang district, taking the death toll in the district to 17 and overall to 80. Thirty five people have been also missing since Friday. The monsoon havoc has affected 27 districts spanning from the eastern, central to the western regions.

{"year":"2017","month":"08","event_desc":"22 August  Supreme Court bans instant triple talaq calling it unconstitutional. Instructed central government to pass law in parliament for triple talaq.","text":"Triple talaq: India court bans Islamic instant divorce 22 August 2017 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Five Muslim women asked the Supreme Court to declare instant divorce unconstitutional India's top court has ruled the practice of instant divorce in Islam unconstitutional, marking a major victory for women's rights activists. In a 3-2 majority verdict, the court called the practice \"un-Islamic\". India is one of a handful of countries where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in minutes by saying the word talaq (divorce) three times. The landmark court decision came in response to petitions challenging the so-called \"triple talaq\" custom. The cases were filed by five Muslim women who had been divorced in this way and two rights groups. Women's rights campaigners have hailed the court's decision as a historic win. What is instant divorce? There have been cases in which Muslim men in India have divorced their wives by issuing the so-called triple talaq by letter, telephone and, increasingly, by text message, WhatsApp and Skype.  A number of these cases made their way to the courts as women contested the custom. How Muslim women won the battle The women who challenged triple talaq The fight against instant divorce Triple talaq divorce has no mention in Sharia Islamic law or the Koran, even though the practice has existed for decades. Islamic scholars say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months, allowing a couple time for reflection and reconciliation. Most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but the custom has continued in India, which does not have a uniform set of laws on marriage and divorce that apply to every citizen. Triple talaq: Why I fought instant divorce What did the court say? Three of the five Supreme Court judges called the controversial practice \"un-Islamic, arbitrary and unconstitutional\". One of the judges, Justice Kurien Joseph, said the practice was not an essential part of Islam and enjoyed no protection. The judges also said it was \"manifestly arbitrary\" to allow a man to \"break down (a) marriage whimsically and capriciously\". Chief Justice JS Khehar, in a differing opinion, said that personal law could not be touched by a constitutional court of law. The opposing judgements also recommended that parliament legislate on the issue. However this is not binding and is up to parliament to take up. The Indian government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has supported ending the practice. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought up the issue several times including in his Independence Day address on 15 August. AFP Activists are hailing the decision as a major step forward for the rights of Muslim women 'Strong message' - By Geeta Pandey, BBC News The judgement is a huge victory for Muslim women. For decades, they have had to live with the threat of instant divorce dangling over their heads like a sword. Campaigners say over the years thousands of women, especially those from poor families, have been discarded by their husbands in this manner. Many have been rendered destitute, with nowhere to go, or have been forced to return to their parental homes or fend for themselves. The top court has also sent a very strong message to Muslim clergy. India's Muslim personal law board had called the practice \"reprehensible\" but said that it was not an issue for the courts and government to interfere in. With this latest ruling, this will no longer be the case. How are people reacting? The judgement is being widely hailed as a major win for Muslim women and women's rights. The prime minister praised the \"historic\" ruling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter .

Accept and continue Shayara Bano, one of the main petitioners, said she appealed to people to accept the ruling and not politicise the issue. \"I have felt the pain when family breaks. I hope no one has to go through this situation in future,\" she told reporters. Hasina Khan, founder of the Beebak Collective which fought against triple talaq, called the verdict \"historic\". \"We are extremely happy. Muslim women have struggled for years,\" she told the BBC. Shayara Bano petitioned the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional Zakia Soman, an activist from Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, another of the groups which contested the practice, said Indian women of many religions had supported them. \"It's a historic day for us, but it doesn't end here,\" she said. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which had maintained that the court had no jurisdiction over the matter, has yet to make an official statement on the ruling, but has convened a meeting to decide what its response should be, a report in Indian newspaper The Hindu said. However, it quoted an executive member as saying that the judgement would have \"wide ramifications\" as it affected the religious rights of minority groups. But the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIWPB), which had opposed the stand of the AIMPLB, said the judgment \"could not have been better\". \"It will change the entire landscape of Muslim families. It's now in the mainstream and will protect not only women, but children. Families will be more stable because children will also be protected,\" Chandra Rajan, an advocate for the group, told the BBC. On social media the hashtags #TripleTalaq and #SupremeCourt began trending on Twitter India even as the verdict was being announced. The hashtag #Tripletalaq is also trending globally on Twitter. Is talaq talaq talaq allowed around the world? Dating from the 8th Century AD and not mentioned in the Koran, triple talaq divorces often conflict with countries' legal systems. India has become the 23rd country to outlaw them, joining places as far apart as Egypt, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. In countries including China and the UK a couple must go through the official channels to be legally divorced but there have been cases of individuals considering themselves divorced after the triple talaq has been said. In Saudi Arabia the law leaves room for various interpretations of religious custom, and triple talaq is practised. This type of verbal divorce is practiced around the world but as it is illegal in so many countries, it is hard to say exactly how common it is. Why must \"talaq\" be said three times? Under some interpretations of Islamic law, a man can divorce his wife and get back together with her - but only twice. After the third divorce, the marriage is completely over and cannot be started again without an intervening marriage to someone else. Scholars are divided on whether it counts as a full and final divorce to say the word three times, or whether it needs to be said on three separate occasions.","question":"What did India's Supreme Court rule about the practice of instant triple talaq in August 2017?","answer":"The Supreme Court ruled that the practice of instant triple talaq was unconstitutional and un-Islamic.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: In August 2017, India's Supreme Court ruled that the practice of instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat), which allows a Muslim man to divorce his wife by uttering the word \"talaq\" three times in one sitting, is unconstitutional and violates the rights of Muslim women.

Reported by: Nazir Masoodi Edited by: Divyanshu Dutta Roy All India Jul 11, 2017 02:14 am IST Published On Jul 10, 2017 21:09 pm IST Last Updated On Jul 11, 2017 02:14 am IST Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Amarnath Yatra terror attack: Security was stepped up across Jammu and Kashmir. Srinagar: Seven pilgrims on the Amarnath Yatra - six of them women - were killed on Monday in a terror attack in Anantnag at about 8:30 pm . At least 19 people were injured in one the worst terror strikes in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorists opened fire on a bus with the pilgrims who were returning after visiting the holy shrine that is located in a narrow gorge at the end of a valley nearly 50 km from Pahalgam. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said in a statement: \"This is an assault on our values and traditions which we hold dear. We will leave no stone unturned to root out the perpetrators of this heinous crime.\" She visited the injured at a hospital in Anantnag. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \" Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath Yatris in J&K. The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone... India will never get bogged down by such cowardly attacks and the evil designs of hate.\" All Amarnath Yatra pilgrims injured in the terror attack were rushed to hospitals. The bus that was fired on was registered in Gujarat. Police sources said that it had violated the rules of the pilgrimage which bans buses from travelling on a highway after 7 pm for security reasons. Ms Mufti said the bus had apparently broken down, delaying their return. The bus was also reportedly not part of the official tour for the Yatra which means that it was not given the customary police protection. The Press Trust of India said the terrorists - it is not clear how many there were - first opened fire an armoured police car whose occupants fired back. The pilgrims were then hit as the terrorists fired indiscriminately, the news agency said. \"We were sleeping when the firing started from both the sides. We don't know how many people were there,\" said a passenger. Before that, the same terrorists had reportedly opened fire on a security checkpost just 600 metres from where the bus was attacked. The bus that came under attack was not part of the official Amarnath Yatra convoy. The journey begins usually from Jammu, which is 200 km from the shrine. The 40-day-long Yatra to the cave of Amarnath high in the mountains of South Kashmir commenced on June 28. With unprecedented security including a satellite tracking system and about 40,000 troops assigned to guard the pilgrims and their route. At the time, according to the Press Trust of India , a letter from a top police officer to other security officials warned of an intelligence alert that said \"terrorists have been directed to eliminate 100 to 150 pilgrims and about 200 police officers and officials.\" The letter said the attack could target a Yatra convoy \"which they believe will result in flaring of communal tensions throughout the nation.\" The letter by the police officer said further corroboration of the intel input was needed. The security cover for the Yatra includes soldiers from paramilitary forces, the army, the Border Security Force and the Jammu and Kashmir police.

Srinagar: Seven pilgrims on the Amarnath Yatra - six of them women - were killed on Monday in a terror attack in Anantnag at about 8:30 pm . At least 19 people were injured in one the worst terror strikes in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorists opened fire on a bus with the pilgrims who were returning after visiting the holy shrine that is located in a narrow gorge at the end of a valley nearly 50 km from Pahalgam. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said in a statement: \"This is an assault on our values and traditions which we hold dear. We will leave no stone unturned to root out the perpetrators of this heinous crime.\" She visited the injured at a hospital in Anantnag. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \" Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath Yatris in J&K. The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone... India will never get bogged down by such cowardly attacks and the evil designs of hate.\" All Amarnath Yatra pilgrims injured in the terror attack were rushed to hospitals. The bus that was fired on was registered in Gujarat. Police sources said that it had violated the rules of the pilgrimage which bans buses from travelling on a highway after 7 pm for security reasons. Ms Mufti said the bus had apparently broken down, delaying their return. The bus was also reportedly not part of the official tour for the Yatra which means that it was not given the customary police protection. The Press Trust of India said the terrorists - it is not clear how many there were - first opened fire an armoured police car whose occupants fired back. The pilgrims were then hit as the terrorists fired indiscriminately, the news agency said. \"We were sleeping when the firing started from both the sides.

{"year":"2017","month":"08","event_desc":"24 August - Reserve Bank of India introduces Rs. 200 bank notes in India to plug the gap in currency system by abiding to Renard series.","text":"Home Money & Banking \u20b9200 banknotes in circulation from today Will plug a gap, make the currency system more efficient, says RBI Updated - January 09, 2018  at 07:57 PM. | Mumbai, August 24 BL25_200_rupee_back Transactions in the economy could become a tad smoother as the Reserve Bank of India on Thursday said it will issue \u20b9200 denomination banknotes on Friday. These notes will be issued from select central bank offices and banks. The base colour of the note, which is in the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series, is bright yellow. It has a motif of the Sanchi Stupa on the reverse, according to an RBI statement. The salient features of the new note on the obverse include a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi at the centre, windowed security thread with inscriptions Bharat (in Devnagari) and RBI with colour shift (the colour of the thread changes from green to blue when the note is tilted), denominational numeral with rupee symbol, \u20b9200 in colour-changing ink (green to blue) on the bottom right, and the Ashoka Pillar emblem on the right. On the reverse, the features include the year of printing of the note on the left, the Swachh Bharat logo with slogan and a motif of the Sanchi Stupa. For the visually impaired, the features include intaglio or raised printing of Mahatma Gandhi portrait, Ashoka Pillar emblem, raised identification mark H with micro-text \u20b9200, four angular bleed lines with two circles in between the lines \u2014 both on the right and the left sides. \u2018Facilitating exchange\u2019 The RBI in a statement said: \u201cTo achieve the optimal system of currency that would minimise the number of denominations while increasing the probability of proffering exact change, especially at the lower end of denominations, there is a logical need to introduce the missing denomination of \u20b9200, which will make the present currency system more efficient. Provision of the new denomination, therefore, would facilitate exchange, particularly for the common man who deals with denominations at the lower end.\u201d \u201cSo, what should be the optimal mix of currency denominations? Many countries have opted to use a near variation of the Renard Series, ie, 1:2 or 1:2.5 ratio between adjacent denominations of currency, which means that the denomination should be twice or two-and-half times its preceding denomination. Such a ratio allows exchange of value ordinarily in a maximum of three denominations. \u201cIn India, we have currency denominations of \u20b9 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2,000. As such, in the lower end of the denomination series, \u20b9200 is the missing one,\u201d said the statement. \u201cIt is good that the RBI is introducing a banknote between \u20b9100 and \u20b9500. It is time they re-introduced the \u20b91,000 banknotes,\u201d said a senior public sector banker. On August 18, the RBI said it will shortly issue \u20b950 denomination banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series. The base colour of the note is fluorescent blue. In November 2016, the RBI had introduced new banknotes of \u20b9500 and \u20b92,000 denominations with base colours of stone grey and magenta, respectively. Post demonetisation, the central bank has been introducing colourful banknotes.

REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab NEW DELHI\/BEIJING (Reuters) - India and China have agreed to an \"expeditious disengagement\" of troops in a disputed border area where their soldiers have been locked in a stand-off for more than two months, India's foreign ministry said on Monday. The decision comes ahead of a summit of the BRICS nations - a grouping that also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa - in China beginning on Sunday, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend. Indian and Chinese troops have been confronting each other at the Doklam plateau near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China, in the most serious and prolonged standoff in decades along their disputed Himalayan border. The Indian ministry said the two sides had agreed to defuse the crisis following diplomatic talks. \"In recent weeks, India and China have maintained diplomatic communication in respect of the incident at Doklam,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"On this basis, expeditious disengagement of border personnel at the face-off site at Doklam has been agreed to and is on-going,\" it said in a statement. It did not offer more details of the terms of disengagement from the area which had raised fears of a wider conflict between the Asian giants who fought a brief border war in 1962. China said Indian troops had withdrawn from the remote area in the eastern Himalayas. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Chinese troops would continue to patrol the Doklam region. \"China will continue to exercise sovereignty rights to protect territorial sovereignty in accordance with the rules of the historical boundary,\" she said. The Chinese defense ministry said troops would remain on a state of alert. \"We remind the Indian side to learn the lesson from this incident, earnestly respect the historical boundary and the basic principles of international law, meet China half way and jointly protect the peace and tranquillity of the border region,\" spokesman Wu Qian said in a statement. \"The world is not peaceful, and peace needs to be safeguarded. The Chinese military has the confidence and the ability to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development interests,\" Wu added. SMOOTH SUMMIT The trouble started in June when India sent troops to stop China building a road in the Doklam area, which is remote, uninhabited territory claimed by both China and Bhutan. India said it sent its troops because Chinese military activity there was a threat to the security of its own northeast region. But China has said India had no role to play in the area and insisted it withdraw unilaterally or face the prospect of an escalation. Chinese state media had warned India of a fate worse than its crushing defeat in the war in 1962. Indian political commentator Shekhar Gupta said there was too much at stake for the two countries to fight over a small piece of territory. \"Hopefully, Doklam is a new chapter in India-China relations. Too much at stake for both big powers to let legacy real-estate issues linger,\" he said in a Twitter post. India and China have been unable to settle their 3,500-km (2,175-mile) frontier and large parts of territory are claimed by both sides. Lin Minwang, an India expert and the deputy director of the Center for South Asia Studies at China's Fudan University, said the detente would ensure a smooth BRICS meeting. \"Both sides should be happy. Modi is also happy. They can conduct a meeting smoothly and naturally. If there was still a stand-off, how could they meet?\" Additional reporting by Tommy Wilkes in NEW DELHI and Michael Martina in BEIJING; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Robert Birsel Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: World Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next India category India downgrades ties with Pakistan after attack on Kashmir tourists kills 26 8:43 PM UTC Europe category Trump and Zelenskiy clash again and US warns it could abandon Ukraine talks 9:12 PM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago Europe category Thousands honour Pope Francis in St. Peter's Basilica 6:38 PM UTC category Powerful earthquake shakes Istanbul, dozens hurt jumping from buildings 2:03 PM UTC","question":"What was the outcome of the diplomatic talks between India and China regarding the Doklam standoff in August 2017?","answer":"Both countries agreed to an \"expeditious disengagement\" of troops from the disputed Doklam region.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: The diplomatic talks between India and China regarding the Doklam standoff in August 2017 led to a mutual agreement to de-escalate the situation.

REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab NEW DELHI\/BEIJING (Reuters) - India and China have agreed to an \"expeditious disengagement\" of troops in a disputed border area where their soldiers have been locked in a stand-off for more than two months, India's foreign ministry said on Monday. The decision comes ahead of a summit of the BRICS nations - a grouping that also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa - in China beginning on Sunday, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend. Indian and Chinese troops have been confronting each other at the Doklam plateau near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China, in the most serious and prolonged standoff in decades along their disputed Himalayan border. The Indian ministry said the two sides had agreed to defuse the crisis following diplomatic talks. \"In recent weeks, India and China have maintained diplomatic communication in respect of the incident at Doklam,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"On this basis, expeditious disengagement of border personnel at the face-off site at Doklam has been agreed to and is on-going,\" it said in a statement. It did not offer more details of the terms of disengagement from the area which had raised fears of a wider conflict between the Asian giants who fought a brief border war in 1962. China said Indian troops had withdrawn from the remote area in the eastern Himalayas. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Chinese troops would continue to patrol the Doklam region. \"China will continue to exercise sovereignty rights to protect territorial sovereignty in accordance with the rules of the historical boundary,\" she said. The Chinese defense ministry said troops would remain on a state of alert. \"We remind the Indian side to learn the lesson from this incident, earnestly respect the historical boundary and the basic principles of international law, meet China half way and jointly protect the peace and tranquillity of the border region,\" spokesman Wu Qian said in a statement. \"The world is not peaceful, and peace needs to be safeguarded. The Chinese military has the confidence and the ability to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development interests,\" Wu added. SMOOTH SUMMIT The trouble started in June when India sent troops to stop China building a road in the Doklam area, which is remote, uninhabited territory claimed by both China and Bhutan.

The decision comes ahead of a summit of the BRICS nations - a grouping that also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa - in China beginning on Sunday, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend. Indian and Chinese troops have been confronting each other at the Doklam plateau near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China, in the most serious and prolonged standoff in decades along their disputed Himalayan border. The Indian ministry said the two sides had agreed to defuse the crisis following diplomatic talks. \"In recent weeks, India and China have maintained diplomatic communication in respect of the incident at Doklam,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"On this basis, expeditious disengagement of border personnel at the face-off site at Doklam has been agreed to and is on-going,\" it said in a statement. It did not offer more details of the terms of disengagement from the area which had raised fears of a wider conflict between the Asian giants who fought a brief border war in 1962. China said Indian troops had withdrawn from the remote area in the eastern Himalayas. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Chinese troops would continue to patrol the Doklam region. \"China will continue to exercise sovereignty rights to protect territorial sovereignty in accordance with the rules of the historical boundary,\" she said. The Chinese defense ministry said troops would remain on a state of alert. \"We remind the Indian side to learn the lesson from this incident, earnestly respect the historical boundary and the basic principles of international law, meet China half way and jointly protect the peace and tranquillity of the border region,\" spokesman Wu Qian said in a statement. \"The world is not peaceful, and peace needs to be safeguarded. The Chinese military has the confidence and the ability to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development interests,\" Wu added. SMOOTH SUMMIT The trouble started in June when India sent troops to stop China building a road in the Doklam area, which is remote, uninhabited territory claimed by both China and Bhutan. India said it sent its troops because Chinese military activity there was a threat to the security of its own northeast region.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at Naypyidaw on Tuesday for a two-day trip to Myanmar, his first bilateral visit to the only Southeast Asian country India shares land boundary with. Prime Minister Narendra Modi being welcomed on his arrival at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport, in Myanmar on Tuesday.(PTI Photo) The trip comes at time when Myanmar is facing intense scrutiny over latest round of violence against roughly 1.1 million Rohingya Muslims . Myanmar opened up to the world after an oppressive junta in 2011 gradually made way for a civilian government but India has not particularly hit it off with the neighbour, which has warmed up to China. Myanmar is India\u2019s gateway to the East and it was in capital Naypyidaw that Modi launched Act East policy in 2014 but a lot remains to be done. 1. Making up for lost time India has struggled to read the domestic churn in Myanmar. In the first decade of this century, New Delhi was close to the generals running the country, leaving Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , who came to symbolise the country\u2019s struggle against the oppressive military rulers, miffed. Though Suu Kyi went to college in Delhi, India failed to build on that goodwill when her party came to power in 2016, allowing China to make inroads. The de facto leader of her country, Suu Kyi chose Beijing as the first major capital for her visit abroad ahead of New Delhi. India has a lot of catching up to do with the country that could prove strategically important as China steps up activity in the Indian Ocean. The bilateral trade is valued at just $2 billion. India is seventh biggest importer to Myanmar and its third biggest export destination but trade and economic ties haven\u2019t picked up in recent times, a field that has a lot of potential. 2. The China factor Ties between China and Myanmar have strengthened after Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy party swept to power. Robust economic and business ties apart, China continues to provide diplomatic fig leaf to Myanmar at a time when most Western nations are piling pressure on the government, Suu Kyi and military over the violence and exodus of Rohingya Muslims. Moreover, China is vital to the peace negotiations as it mediates between armed ethnic groups and the government. 3. Rohingya Muslims The Rakhine state in Myanmar\u2019s northwest is politically sensitive and is also important to both India and China. It is the starting point of the much-delayed $484-million Kaladan multi-modal transport projects that aim to connect Myanmar to India. India has already completed work on Sittwe port, at the estuary of Kaladan river, in Rakhine. Similarly, the troubled state is also the spot from where the Myanmar end of the oil and gas pipeline with China will open. Beijing and New Delhi have their reasons for the state to be peaceful. A road and rail network across northern Myanmar to the Bay of Bengal will allow Beijing to increase trade with West Asia without taking the contentious South China Sea route. Exodus of Rohingya Muslims \u2013 about 90,000 of them have fled in the last few days alone \u2013 poses a problem to both Bangladesh and India. 4. Security cooperation Along with a maritime border, Myanmar shares 1,643-km land boundary with India\u2019s four northeastern states. Several insurgent groups have set up bases and training camps in Myanmar, a constant headache for India. The two countries have been increasingly working together but more needs to be done to address India\u2019s security concerns. 5. Act East In geographical terms, Myanmar is the first stop for India\u2019s Act East policy. The two countries are also members of various regional groupings such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) and Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). At the 2016 summit in Goa, Bimstec stressed the need for strengthening transit agreements and early conclusion of a free trade agreement. Myanmar also remains an important country for various regional connectivity plans. Get Current Updates on India News , Weather Today , Latest News, Pahalgam Attack Live at Hindustan Times.

Gujarat: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe changed into a Indian-style kurta-pyjama and Nehru jacket today before going on a roadshow with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after landing in Gujarat's Ahmedabad for a two-day visit. Underscoring the importance of India-Japan ties, PM Modi went to the airport and received his Japanese counterpart with a warm hug. Mr Abe, who is on his fourth visit to India, paid tribute at Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati ashram and visited the 16th Century mosque 'Sidi Saiyyid Ni Jaali'. The highlight of his visit will be tomorrow's launch of India's first bullet train project, which will run between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The project is getting financial assistance from Japan. Here are the latest developments on PM Shinzo Abe's Ahmedabad Visit: The two leaders had got into an open-top Gypsy decorated with flowers for the 9-km roadshow. Along the route, 28 huge stages were built on which schoolchildren held performances highlighting India's varied culture. From Sabarmati Ashram, the leaders headed for 'Sidi Saiyyid Ni Jaali', a 16th Century yellow sandstone mosque in eastern Ahmedabad famous for its intricate latticework. The day's programmes concluded with dinner at Ahmedabad's famous Agashiye terrace restaurant, where PM Modi hosted Mr and Mrs Abe. The restaurant, known for its splendid view and kosher Gujarati cuisine, has prepared a vegetarian thali menu which also includes sushi and PM Modi's favourite dish \"Handvo\" . This morning, in a tweet, PM Modi thanked the Japanese Prime Minister, who in statement ahead of the visit said, \"Prime Minister Modi is a strong leader with an outstanding ability to get things done\". The highlight of PM Abe's visit is tomorrow -- a public function to mark the beginning of work on India's first high-speed rail project , popularly called the bullet train.

It gives me great joy to know those Shinkansen trains will operate on Indian soil under the Mumbai Ahmedabad high speed rail project,\" Mr Abe said in his message. The 508-km rail project, which will cost an estimated Rs.1,10,000 crore , is expected to be completed by 2022-2023. A chunk of the expenditure will come from Rs. 88,000 crore Japanese loan on a minimal, 0.1 per cent interest, which India has 50 years to repay. At the 12th annual summit, the two leaders will review the progress in the \"multifaceted cooperation\" and set the future direction for the special strategic partnership. This will be the fourth annual summit between PM Modi and Mr Abe, where they are expected to review the progress in the multifaceted cooperation between India and Japan under the framework of their Special Strategic and Global Partnership.

His third One-Day International double hundred was a clinical exhibition of punishing batsmanship by a man under pressure to perform. He had lost his first match as captain, failed as a batsman, and had critics breathing down his neck. But one magical knock changed all that.\n\nFor Shreyas Iyer too there was much to take home from this contest even though he fell 12 short of a century in only his second ODI. His 213-run second-wicket stand with Rohit, after Dhawan was involved in a 115-run opening partnership, wounded Sri Lanka gravely.\n\nThe Sri Lankan attack was an apology for an international match. Not because it was mauled by Rohit but for the shocking lack of discipline and commitment that a bowler brings to his work when confronted with a batsman on rampage. Rohit was unstoppable but then Sri Lanka played into his hands by feeding him scoring opportunities. The Indian captain was not one to waste such generous offerings.\n\nRohit, Dhawan and Shreyas took the attack by the scruff and left the audience satiated in its demands for pyrotechnics. There were plenty of cricketing shots as also a flurry of cross-batted heaves that showed Rohit in complete control. Sri Lanka erred by adopting desperate measures. The yorkers ended up as full tosses and the slower ones were smilingly put away by Rohit and Shreyas.\n\nRohit has long been chastised as a batsman who does not put a value to his wicket.

The Congress party is all geared up to welcome Rahul Gandhi as its 87th president on Saturday, marking a generational shift at the helm of India's oldest political party. Mr. Gandhi is set to take over the baton from his mother Sonia Gandhi, who, at 70, is its longest serving chief. Ms. Gandhi has indicated that she is ready to retire even as the party spokesperson clarified that her remark was in reference to the post, not politics as a whole. Editorial: Born to rule \u2014 On Rahul Gandhi's elevation Mr. Gandhi, 47, who had taken over as the party vice-president in January 2013, was elected unopposed as the party president on December 11. Latest updates: Congress will meet any challenge with love and affection: Rahul \"Like many Indians across the country, I am an idealist,\" begins Mr. Rahul Gandhi in English. \"But many of us are disillusioned today with what we see in politics today. It is devoid of kindness and truth. Today politics is used to crush people, not lift them. Politics belongs to the people. \"The moment you challenge the structure of power to stand with the power, you are attacked. To weaken you, they lie and distort. The Congress had taken the country to the 21st century but our Prime Minister is taking us back. We are now being told only one man is the voice of reason - that everything is subservient to him. Our foreign policy is in tatters so that one man can be strong. Rahul Gandhi speaks at the ceremony. \"They want to weaken us but they can do that only if we back down. Stand up to them. We at the Congress promise that we will defend the voice of every Indian. We will never allow to silence the voice of every Indian. I want the Congress party to become an instrument of dialogue for all Indians. \"I'd like to speak a bit in Hindi now,\" he says before switching to Hindi as the uncharacteristically silent crowd begins to cheer. Once you start a fire, it is very difficult to contain, he says, pointing at the firecrackers outside. This is what we have been trying to explain to the BJP, he adds. I want to tell every Congress worker this - you are my family, says Mr. Gandhi, before adding that he invites the youth to come forth and build an India with love and kindness. My responsibility is to protect your voice, he says. Switching to English, he continues. \"Congress is an ancient idea. BJP would like you to believe their idea is the oldest, this is not true. We consider the BJP our brothers and sisters, though we don't agree with them. We do not fight hate with hate. They crush voices, but we allow the most vulnerable to sing. Congress has always and will always meet any challenge with love and affection. It is with utmost humility that I accept this position.\" The ceremony winds up with the National Anthem. \"Our government represented every section,\" says Sonia Gandhi \"Twenty years ago when you elected me and I was addressing you, I was nervous and scared. How would I handle this institution?, I wondered. Until then my relation to politics was a personal one because of my marriage with Rajiv ji,\" says Sonia Gandhi. Reminiscing the old days, Ms. Gandhi says that she married into a \"revolutionary\" family. \"Indira ji sacrificed family for nation. She taught me the basic values that made the Constitution. When she was assassinated, I felt like my mother was gone. Those days I wanted to keep my husband and children away from politics. My husband was given the onerous responsibility to lead the nation. But then, my husband was killed and I lost my anchor - it took me time to stabilize after that.\" But then when I saw the Congress becoming weak, I took up the responsibility, she says. \"I thought that may Indira ji and my husband would have felt bad if I did not do so. When I took over, we had 3 States and was far away from Centre. Whatever we have achieved, it was not the work of one person but the effort of all of you. We went on to form State government in over two dozen States - we did exemplary work. Sonia Gandhi speaks at the ceremony. \"Dr. Singh did great work and our government represented every section and worked for every section. Since 2014, we are again in the opposition and there are huge challenges before us. We won't get scared and won't bow down...we won't back off from protecting the values of the Constitution. Power is not our aim but the country is our aim. \"These days, every day there is an assault on the fundamental values, an assault on free speech, an atmosphere of fear... Congress needs to introspect. If we don't do that, we can't represent the 'aam aadmi'. \"India is a country of youth. I am sure we will have a new energy. \"Rahul is my son and not proper for me to praise him. But I have to say, from his childhood, he has faced the brunt of violence and since he came into politics he has been facing vicious personal attacks too. I am proud of his patience and I am sure he will lead you with pride and intelligence. \"Twenty years is like a lifetime. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your love and affection.

She pauses as the fireworks go off non-stop. Janardan Dwivedi appeals to the party members to pause the firecrackers so that Ms. Gandhi can resume her speech. \"Twenty years ago, when you elected me as President,\" she begins, even as the crackers continue. \"I can't shout as my voices goes,\" she says, visibly disturbed as Rahul Gandhi pacifies her saying it'll stop in five minutes. She pauses for the crackers to subside. Memento for Sonia Gandhi Sonia Gandhi is presented with a memento and a shawl - Dr. Singh presents the memento and Moti Lal Vohra presents the shawl. Fireworks go off as she speaks for the final time as the Congress President.

Manmohan Singh speaks at the ceremony \"He is taking over at a time when there are disturbing trends in our politics. An academic said that the politics of fear will take over politics of hope.

It is important to be an independent voice in Parliament. If an independent voice speaks up then people will believe it is not linked to any political party\u201d.

I want to move forward and look to the future,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt will certainly be my effort to bring the Opposition together ahead of the 2024 polls to take on the BJP\u201d. Mr. Sibal\u2019s is the third high profile exit that happened soon after the Udaipur Chintan Shivir and followed former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar\u2019s departure from the Congress to join the BJP\u00a0and Gujarat working president Hardik Patel\u2019s exit. With an air of uncertainty around who will be Congress\u2019 nominees for the Rajya Sabha elections, there is speculation about more leaving the party. In the last few months, several senior leaders such as Ashwani Kumar, R.P.N Singh and Shatrughan Sinha have quit the party. Member of G-23 Among the most high-profile Ministers in the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance government between 2004 and 2014, Mr. Sibal joined the G-23 or the ginger group that wrote to party president Sonia Gandhi in August 2020, asking for \u201ccollective leadership and internal reforms\u201d. The high-profile lawyer, who once defended the Congress in various courts and often in the media as a Minister, questioned the party\u2019s style of functioning as it continued to suffer repeated electoral setbacks in Assembly elections after two consecutive Lok Sabha defeats. The tipping point came last September when he told reporters at a press conference that \u201cthe Congress did not have a full-time president and none knew who was taking important decisions without any accountability\u201d. Though Mr. Sibal did not spell it out, the comment was seen as an attack on former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who, many believed, was taking decisions in the party despite stepping down from the post in May 2019. Hours later, party workers of Chandni Chowk, a constituency that Mr. Sibal represented earlier, threw \u201ctomatoes and eggs\u201d at his residence. While the leadership had reached out to G-23 in separate meetings, Mr. Sibal carefully avoided them, including the three-day Udaipur Chintan Shivir that was meant to brainstorm the Congress\u2019 revival.

(FILE) New Delhi: A Lankan official has resigned after triggering a massive controversy with his claim that an energy project in Sri Lanka was awarded to industrialist Gautam Adani's group after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressured President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. MMC Ferdinando, the chairman of Sri Lanka's Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), quit three days after he claimed to a parliamentary panel that he was told by President Rajapaksa about PM Modi pressuring him to give the wind power project directly to the Adani Group. President Rajapaksa strongly denied the claim, and a day later, Mr Ferdinando retracted it. A letter exclusively accessed by NDTV suggests, however, that the officer had written to the Lankan Finance Ministry to fast-track approvals to the 500-Megawatt renewable energy project in Sri Lanka's Mannar district and had cited \"directions by the (Lankan) Prime Minister\" to recognize the Adani proposal as one from the Indian government to the Lanka government. The Adani group said it was \"disappointed\" by the controversy. \"Our intent in investing in Sri Lanka is to address the needs of a valued neighbour. As a responsible corporate, we see this as a necessary part of the partnership that our two nations have always shared. We are clearly disappointed by the detraction that seems to have come about. The fact is that the issue has already been addressed by and within the Sri Lankan Government,\" said a spokesperson of the group. The letter, written on November 25, 2021 by Mr Ferdinando, is addressed to SR Atigala, the Secretary to the Treasury, Lanka Ministry of Finance. The letter refers to a \"direction by the Prime Minister to recognize the Adani Green Energy proposal as a proposal from Indian government to the government of Sri Lanka as both heads of the countries are in agreement to realise this investment in Sri Lanka, to meet the present day FDI crisis\". It says the official was directed, in a \"subsequent meeting\" with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on November 16, to \"facilitate the Adani Green Energy to develop 500 MW wind and solar, renewable energy project in Mannar and Pooneryn, as he has already agreed to invest substantial amount of FDI\" in Sri Lanka. \"As per this directive, I assumed that this is a proposal of an investor backed by the government of India on the basis of the bilateral discussion between the heads of the states. Therefore, on the above basis, it is logical to assume that this is an investment proposal on the basis of G-G and can be processed as an investment channeled through the BOI (Board of Investments of Lanka)...\" Mr Ferdinando says in the letter. The official also asks that the signing of the Power Purchase Agreement and other related pacts should be moved forward as an investment proposal to Lanka. The Adani Group reportedly won contracts worth $ 500 million to develop two wind power projects, in Mannar and in Pooneryn, in December. The government has not responded to the allegations or the letter. Mr Ferdinando first made the claim on Friday, at an open hearing of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), a parliamentary panel. A video of Mr Ferdinando's comment at the parliamentary hearing has been widely circulated on Twitter. At open hearing of parliamentary Committee of Public Enterprises- Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairman M.M.C Ferdinando said the SriLankan president #GotabayaRajapaksha had told him,Indian PM #NarendraModi was insisting that 500 MW windpower plant be given to the ADANI Group pic.twitter.com\/FNiAyTX1kU \u2014 ???????????????????????????????? (@hatefreeworldX) June 12, 2022 \u201cOn November 24, the President summoned me after a meeting and said that India's Prime Minister Modi is pressuring him to hand over the project to the Adani group. I said \u2018this matter doesn't concern me or the Ceylon electricity board and this consists of the board of investments'. He insisted that I look into it. I then sent a letter that the President has instructed me and that the Finance Secretary should do the needful. I pointed out that this is a government-to-government deal,\u201d the official said in Sinhala in the video, addressing the panel. On Sunday evening, following a strong denial by President Rajapaksa on Twitter, Mr Ferdinando had also withdrawn his comments, claiming he had been \"overcome with emotion\" while facing questions that suggested wrongdoing by him. President Rajapaksa had tweeted: \"Regarding a statement made by the #lka CEB Chairman at a COPE committee hearing regarding the award of a Wind Power Project in Mannar, I categorically deny authorisation to award this project to any specific person or entity.\" Re a statement made by the #lka CEB Chairman at a COPE committee hearing regarding the award of a Wind Power Project in Mannar, I categorically deny authorisation to award this project to any specific person or entity. I trust responsible communication in this regard will follow. \u2014 Gotabaya Rajapaksa (@GotabayaR) June 11, 2022 His office followed this up with a longer statement \"vehemently denying\" the charge. The controversy erupted a day after Sri Lanka changed its laws to remove competitive bidding for energy projects. The opposition has accused the government of ramming the bill through parliament to facilitate large energy deals to the Adani group, which signed an unsolicited government-to-government agreement to build the Mannar wind power plant.

The floor test proceedings tomorrow will be subject to final outcome of the case in the SC. \u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 8.00 pm Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for Governor Koshyari: \u201cIt is not the SC which has interdicted the Deputy Speaker (to adjudicate disqualification proceedings against dissidents), it is the law which has interdicted him.\u201d Mehta argues the objective to issue disqualification notices through the Speaker is to cover the fact that the government is in minority. He says, \u201cDeputy Speaker gave two days\u2019 notice to the Shinde faction to respond to disqualification notice. The same person now complains that only one day has been given before floor test. There are many cases in which the SC has ordered floor test in 24 hours. Majority cannot be determined in the Raj Bhavan but on the floor of the House where everybody can see.\u201d Arguments conclude. Judges leave for their chambers for deliberations. To reassemble for passing orders at 9 p.m. \u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 7.40 pm Senior advocate Maninder Singh for dissidents\u2019 camp: \u201cCalling for floor test does not require the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\u201d He says, \u201cSC only followed the principles of natural justice to give the 16 dissident MLAs time to respond... That order cannot freeze the hand of the Governor to call for a floor test.\u201d Justice Kant: \u201cSuppose floor test is held. Later it comes to a turn that the process which evolved into the floor test was unconstitutional, we can intervene. It is not an irreversible situation.\u201d \u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 7.10 pm Justice Kant says: We have asked this question before. Can a government, knowing it is in minority, use the Speaker\u2018s office to issue disqualification notices en masse? Advocate Kaul says: \u201cNot holding the floor test is the antithesis of democracy. What kind of an argument did Singhvi make that Governor recovered from Covid only two days back and did not verify the letter from the 34 MLAs before calling for floor test... So is he saying that the Governor should hold back and allow the State to burn?\u201d Justice Kant: How many MLAs are there in the dissidents' camp? Mr. Kaul says: 39 Justice Kant: How many have been served disqualification notice? Mr. Kaul: 16 Justice Kant: How many total MLAs Mr. Kaul: 55 Mr. Kaul: We are the Shiv Sena \u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 6.30 pm Maharashtra floor test hearing continues Senior Advocate A.M. Singhvi, representing the Thackeray faction, says: \u201cLordships have to maintain a balance. Either lift the fetter on the Speaker and allow him to go ahead with the disqualification proceedings or keep the floor test in temporary abeyance.\u201d Senior advocate Neeraj Kaul for Shinde camp: \u201cFloor test can never ever be delayed. Proceedings of disqualification cannot delay floor test. Disqualification should be decided, but these MLAs continue to remain part of the House.\u201d Advocate Kaul says: \u201cQuestion of disqualification does not have any bearing in the conduct of the floor test. A reluctance of the CM to face the floor of the House prima facie shows he has lost the majority. What is wrong in the Governor exercising his judgment or discretion to call for a floor test?\u201d Justice Surya Kant says: \u201cThe Governor may be competent to call for a floor test, but the question posed by the other side who are the members competent to participate in the floor test.\u201d Advocate Kaul says: \u201cThe CM\u2019s faction is a hopeless minority within the party itself. I have seldom seen a party so afraid to face a floor test. Usually, the governing faction will come forward to hold the floor test to prove their strength.\u201d The Shinde camp advocate says: \u201c[Advocate] Singhvi is trying to relate two things which remain into two completely different constitutional spheres. He cannot relate disqualification proceedings and the Speaker\u2019s competence with the conduct of floor test.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe more you delay a floor test the more you damage the constitutional spirit. Floor test is the sure remedy to horse-trading. Why are they shying away from the floor test? Calling for floor test is entirely the Governor\u2019s discretion. Is the Governor\u2019s call for floor test so perverse in this case that it requires judicial intervention?\u201d \u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 5.45 p.m. As Supreme Court hears plea against floor test, Maharashtra CM chairs cabinet meeting A cabinet meeting chaired by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is underway at Mantralaya in Mumbai, while the Supreme Court is hearing a plea challenging the State Governor\u2019s direction for a floor test on Thursday. \u2014 PTI 5.30 p.m. Governor cannot act on the advice of the Leader of Opposition: Singhvi Senior Advocate A.M. Singhvi, representing the Thackeray faction, says the dissidents who are no longer members of the House are being allowed to swim in a pool in which they do not belong. They are being allowed to swim in the pool with irreversible consequences. This is like allowing a person from the street being allowed to vote in the floor test. \u201cThere is undue haste and hurry. Governor has to act on the aid and advice of the Chief Minister. He cannot act on the aid and advice of the Leader of Opposition,\u201d says Advocate Singhvi. \u201cThe conduct of the rebel MLAs makes it evident they have given up party membership. The letter 34 MLAs wrote to the Governor complaining about the party amounts to voluntarily giving up party membership.\u201d \u201cIf heavens will not fall if the disqualification proceedings have been put on hold till July 12, how will heavens falls if the floor test is not held tomorrow?\u201d says Advocate Singhvi.\u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 5.15 p.m. Maharashtra floor test hearing begins Senior Advocate A.M. Singhvi, representing the Thackeray faction, says two NCP MLAs are down with COVID, and two Congress MLAs are abroad. The floor test was called at supersonic speed, and determines who is majority, and who is to govern. Holding a floor test before determining the question of disqualification is like plunging into a pool without determining the size of the pool, says Mr. Singhvi. According to him the question who has committed the constitutional sin (of defection) has to be determined first. The Governor cannot short-circuit the Supreme Court\u2019s proceedings or the Speaker\u2019s disqualification proceedings. \u201cIs there a bar on holding fresh floor test in another 15 days if the situation again changes? How is holding a floor test connected with the SC\u2019s pending determination of the Deputy Speaker\u2019s competence to adjudicate disqualification?\u201d says Justice Surya Kant. \u201cThere are cases in which the Speaker has already taken the decision of disqualification. Here, the very competence of the Speaker is in question. Is it your case that even in this case there should be a presumption of deemed disqualification?\u201d says Justice Surya Kant. \u201cWe had intervened in this case because there is an exceptional situation involved here. The Deputy Speaker is himself facing removal notice. The notice questions his authority to adjudicate the disqualification petition against the dissident MLAs\u201d. \u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 5.00 p.m. Rebel Sena MLAs leave Guwahati Maharashtra MLAs, led by Shiv Sena dissident Eknath Shinde, leave Guwahati hotel, head to airport.\u00a0 \u2014 PTI 5.00 p.m. Shiv Sena workers march in Nagpur to show solidarity for Uddhav Shiv Sena workers took out a padyatra (foot march) in Maharashtra's Nagpur on Wednesday to show solidarity for party chief and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray amid the rebellion by party MLAs. Large number of Sena workers, including women, marched from Jhansi Rani square and raised slogans against party leader Eknath Shinde and the rebel MLAs supporting him. - PTI 4.00 pm Will support Shiv Sena\u2019s rebel faction if CM Thackeray does not snap ties with NCP, Cong: Ex-Sena MLA Former Shiv Sena MLA from Pune district Vijay Shivtare on Wednesday threatened that if party president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray does not snap ties with the NCP and Congress, he will have \"no other option\" but to support the rebel legislators led by Eknath Shinde. He claimed that although he had written letters to Thackeray alleging that several development projects were either shifted away from his constituency or stalled by the NCP, the chief minister paid no attention to his grievances. Sena shares power with NCP and Congress as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Shivtare, who had represented the Purandar constituency twice and was a minister in the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis-led government, was defeated by Congress Sanjay Jagtap in the 2019 state elections. \"We are in the MVA for the last two-and-a-half years. Despite the CM being from our party, the terminal of the proposed international airport in Purandar was shifted away to Supe (around 40 kms from Baramati). CM Thackeray knew about the project. I had a detailed discussion about it with him. If NCP leaders are giving a proposal to shift the terminal, I should have been at least consulted, but nothing of that sort happened,\" he said. - PTI 3.55 pm Ahead of Maha floor test, BJP demands protection for rebel MLAs Maharashtra BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar on Wednesday met state legislature secretariat's principal secretary Rajendra Bhagwat and urged him to ensure protection to the rebel Shiv Sena MLAs, who are scheduled to arrive in the state for floor test on June 30. Majority of the legislators of the Shiv Sena, which heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, have been camping in Guwahati along with some independents since June 22. The Sena rebels are demanding that the party snap ties with the NCP and Congress, allies in the government, accusing these parties of trying to eliminate their party. Speaking to reporters in the Vidhan Bhavan premises, he said, \"We met Bhagwat and deputy speaker of the Maharashtra legislative assembly Narhari Zirwal with a demand to ensure protection for the members. We also discussed the seating arrangement of MLAs in the House with the officials.\" \"Clear threats have been given to some MLAs in the state. Democracy has to be protected and hence we requested the officials to ensure necessary measures,\" he added. - PTI 2.10 pm Jailed NCP leaders Malik, Anil Deshmukh move SC for participation in Maharashtra floor test Jailed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs Nawab Malik and Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking permission to participate in the\u00a0Maharashtra Assembly floor test. A vacation bench of Justices Surya Kant and J.B. Pardiwala was told by advocate Sudhanshu S. Choudhuri that the two MLAs have been booked for offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and are in jail. The bench then said it would take up their application at 5.30 p.m. ALSO READ Jailed NCP leaders Malik, Anil Deshmukh move SC for participation in Maharashtra floor test 1:43 pm Shinde says we will pass the floor test \u201cWe are not worried about the floor test. We will pass it. We have the numbers. This is a Shiv Sena which will take forward the ideals of \u2018Hindutva\u2019 and those of Balasaheb Thackeray,\u201d says Shiv Sena rebel camp leader Eknath Shinde before leaving Guwahati. 1:32 pm \u201cMLAs prayed at the temple for public of Assam to get relief from floods \u201cAll MLAs prayed at the Kamakhya Devi temple for the public of Assam to get relief from the floods. As a token of goodwill, we have donated \u20b951 lakh to the flood-afflicted people of Assam,\u201d says Sena MLA Deepak Kesarkar, spokesperson for the Eknath Shinde rebel camp. The MLAs will be leaving for Goa shortly. -Shoumojit Banerjee 12.25 pm Rebel Shiv Sena MLAs donate \u20b951 lakh for Assam flood relief Rebel Shiv Sena MLAs from Maharashtra\u00a0have contributed \u20b951 lakh for the\u00a0flood relief wok in Assam, where they have been camping since the last week, their spokesperson said on Wednesday. The Sena legislators, led by senior Minister Eknath Shinde, have raised the banner of revolt against their party. These MLAs had first come to Guwahati on June 22 and subsequently in several batches from Gujarat\u2019s Surat in chartered flights. Amid criticism that the Sena dissidents were staying at a luxury hotel in Guwahati even as parts of Assam were grappling with severe floods, Deepak Kesarkar, the spokesperson of the rebel MLAs told PTI , \u201cMr. Shinde has donated \u20b951 lakh to the Assam Chief Minister\u2019s Relief Fund as our contribution to their ongoing rescue work. We cannot ignore the plight of people here.\u201d Mr. Kesarkar added that with Maharashtra Governor B.S. Koshyari asking the\u00a0Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to face a floor test\u00a0on Thursday, the rebel MLAs have decided to\u00a0move out of Guwahati and shift to a place near Mumbai.

We have done a lot for the party and Mr. Thackeray,\u201d says rebel Sena MLA Gulabrao Patil at the last meeting of the Eknath Shinde camp at Guwahati\u2019s Radisson Blu hotel. The rebel MLAs have frequently alleged that Mr Pawar\u2019s NCP, through Sena MP Sanjay Raut, has tried to finish off their party. - Shoumojit Banerjee 10:52 am SC to hear Sena petition today Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi for the Thackeray camp makes an oral mention for an urgent hearing at 5 pm or 6 pm against the Maharashtra Assembly floor test tomorrow at 11 am. Mr. Singhvi says the suddenness of the floor test notice deserves an urgent hearing today itself. SC says due to the \u201curgency created\u201d in the conduct of the floor test, it will hear the Sena petition today itself. -Krishnadas Rajgopal Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for the Sena dissidents camp, says most it is unfair to have a hearing today. Political accountability has to be tested on the floor of the House. But, the court insisted on hearing the case today. It further asked the Thackeray camp to share the petition and pleadings.\u2014 Krishnadas Rajagopal 10.40 am Udhav faction to move Supreme Court Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday termed the Maharashtra Governor\u2019s order for a floor test of the Uddhav Thackeray-led government as \u201cunlawful\u201d, saying that the Supreme Court is yet to decide on the disqualification of 16 rebel MLAs. He said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the ruling coalition of Sena, NCP and Congress, will approach the Supreme Court and seek justice on this issue. \u2014 PTI 10.30 am Rebel MLAs to fly to Goa Dissident Shiv Sena MLAs led by Eknath Shinde, camping in Guwahati, are likely to leave for Goa this afternoon, according to sources.  A SpiceJet aircraft has been hired and the flight is expected to leave Guwahati\u2019s Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport for Goa\u2019s Dabolim airport at around 3 pm, sources privy to the development said.

Governor Koshyari has asked the Maharashtra Legislature Secretary to hold a floor test of the Shiv Sena-led government at 11 am on Thursday.

PTI Updated At : 04:21 PM Jun 24, 2022 IST Follow us Connect with us Advertisement New Delhi, June 24 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Special Investigation Team\u2019s (SIT) clean chit to then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and 63 others in the 2002 riots in the state and dismissed a plea by slain Congress leader Ehsan Jafri\u2019s wife Zakia Jafri. A three-judge bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar upheld the magistrate\u2019s order rejecting Zakia Jafri\u2019s protest petition against the closure report filed by the SIT in 2012. Advertisement The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, said her plea is devoid of merit. She had alleged a larger conspiracy in the 2002 Gujarat riots. Congress leader and former MP Ehsan Jafri was among the 68 people killed at Ahmedabad\u2019s Gulberg Society during violence on February 28, 2002, a day after the Godhra train-burning. Advertisement Zakia Jafri had challenged the SIT\u2019s clean chit to 64 people, including Modi, who was Gujarat chief minister in 2002. Her petition had challenged the high court\u2019s October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the SIT decision. On December 9 last year, the apex court had reserved its verdict on the plea. Except for Zakia Jafri\u2019s petition, nobody had \u201craised a finger\u201d against it for the probe conducted in the 2002 Gujarat riots, the SIT had said during the hearing in the top court. Her counsel had earlier said her complaint of 2006 was that there was \u201ca larger conspiracy where there was bureaucratic inaction, police complicity, hate speeches and unleashing of violence\u201d. On February 27, 2002, 59 people were killed when the S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express was burnt at Godhra, triggering the riots in the state. On February 8, 2012, the SIT filed a closure report giving a clean chit to now Prime Minister Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was \u201cno prosecutable evidence\u201d against them. Zakia Jafri filed a petition in the apex court in 2018. The plea also maintained that after the SIT gave a clean chit in its closure report before a trial judge, Zakia Jafri had filed a protest petition which was dismissed by the magistrate without considering \u201csubstantiated merits\u201d. The high court in its October 2017 order had said the SIT probe was monitored by the Supreme Court. However, it had partly allowed her petition as far as its demand for a further investigation was concerned, saying she can approach an appropriate forum, including the magistrate\u2019s court, a division bench of the high court, or the Supreme Court seeking further investigation.

Hundreds of agitators blocked National Highway 83 in Jehanabad and burned tyres demanding the scrapping of the scheme. Angry protestors took out processions in the three districts and other parts of the state. Protestors had disrupted railway and road traffic in various parts of the state also on Wednesday with angry youth pelting stones at a train in Buxar, vandalising\u00a0public property and causing arson in\u00a0Muzaffarpur district streets. #AgnipathRecruitmentScheme students up in protest against #Agniveer and #Agnipath in Buxar district of Bihar pic.twitter.com\/iJRUQ5yOUU \u2014 Amit Vikram (@amitkvikram) June 16, 2022 Protests erupt in Bihar against Agnipath scheme, Army aspirants demand its withdrawal Read @ANI Story | https:\/\/t.co\/BniKN8PVjJ #Bihar #AgnipathRecruitmentScheme #Agnipath #Agniveer pic.twitter.com\/VUd5Z0nSmw \u2014 ANI Digital (@ani_digital) June 16, 2022 Protests in Rajasthan apart from Bihar, other states also saw protests and demonstrations against the new recruitment policy. Around 150 people blocked the Ajmer-Delhi highway in Jaipur\u00a0on Wednesday. According to Kardhani police, around 150 protesters blocked the highway, demanding that recruitment into the armed forces should be done following the earlier method. The\u00a0protesters were subsequently dispersed and the highway was cleared, adding that 10 people were arrested. However, protests have continued on June 16 following a call for demonstration by\u00a0RLP leader and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal on Wednesday to oppose the scheme. Youth cripple traffic\u00a0in Delhi NCR Hundreds of youth took to the streets in Bilaspur and Sidhrawali areas of Gurugram and Rewari, some 50 km away from Delhi.\u00a0\u00a0The protesters laid a virtual seize on bus stands and roads, crippling traffic on the Gurugram-Jaipur highway, and held a protest at Bilaspur Chowk. The protests caused traffic diversions and snarls in surrounding areas. According to reports, police lathi-charged the protesters in a bid to bring the situation under control. Other states like Madhya Pradesh, and Uttarkhand also saw agitations with protesters blocking\u00a0roads and damaging\u00a0public property. Why are protesters objecting to Agnipath scheme? Under the 'Agnipath' scheme, around 45,000 people aged between 17.5 and 21 years will be inducted into the armed forces for a four-year period, following which most of them will have to take compulsory retirement sans pension or gratuity benefits although some will be retained. Of the total annual recruits, only 25 per cent will be allowed to continue for another 15 years under permanent commission. Under the old system, youths aged between 16.5 and 21 years were selected for a minimum of 15 years of service and used to get pension after retirement. While the Centre as well as state governments have claimed Agniveers will have several options after the four-year service period, many across states remain unconvinced with protesters wondering what they would do after four years and how they would continue to be employed.

From today [Wednesday] morning, my workers are being sent notices by police. Central forces are here. Army might be called. Those who should have been at China borders will be here. I don't want to see blood of my workers spilling on the roads of Mumbai. Today, I resign from the post of Chief Minister,\" Mr. Thackeray said in a virtual address to the public Maharashtra political turmoil updates | June 29, 2022 Mr. Thackeray said he was also quitting as a Member of the Legislative Council and added that he would only concentrate on party work. \"I never said I will return. I never wanted to be here at this place, but I came. From now on, I will be fully with you,\" he told Shiv Sena workers. Late in the evening, Mr. Thackeray\u00a0submitted his resignation to Mr. Koshyari at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai. The Governor accepted the resignation\u00a0of Mr. Thackeray and asked him to officiate as the Chief Minister until alternate arrangements are made. Setback in Supreme Court Earlier, in a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray faction, the Supreme Court refused to stay the floor test called for by Mr. Koshyari on June 30 to test the Maha Vikas Aghadi government's claim of majority in the House. Maharashtra political crisis | Floor test will prevent horse-trading: Supreme Court \"We are not staying the floor test,\" a Vacation Bench of Justices Surya Kant and J.B. Pardiwala briefly informed the warring Shiv Sena factions after taking half-an-hour recess to deliberate in their chambers following a marathon hearing which spanned four hours, starting at 5 p.m. The court, however, said it would hear on merit the writ petition filed by Thackeray loyalist Sunil Prabhu, challenging the process leading to the call for floor test, on July 11 along with petitions filed by Sena dissidents led by Eknath Shinde, who has questioned the disqualification proceedings initiated against them. \"Tomorrow's proceedings (floor test) will be subject to the final outcome of these petitions in court,\" the Bench addressed the lawyers. Maharashtra govt. approves renaming of Aurangabad, Osmanabad The court had urgently heard the challenge to the floor test amid the frenzy of political churnings in Maharashtra. \"The urgency that has been created requires us to hear the matter today itself,\" Justice Kant submitted. The decision in favour of allowing the floor test came after the Governor and the dissident MLAs held that delaying the trust vote would be the \"anti-thesis of democracy\" and \"give more time for horse-trading in Maharashtra\". The Thackeray camp argued that the trust vote cannot be held when the disqualification proceedings against 16 rebel Sena MLAs, including Mr. Shinde, were pending and being examined by the Supreme Court. They said the dissidents were an \"artificial majority\". Three-party experiment With Mr. Thackeray's resignation, the unique three-party experiment of the MVA, in which the Shiv Sena tied up with the  Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has come to an end. The BJP, which is the single-largest party in the Assembly with 106 MLAs, is likely to stake claim to form the government. Several BJP legislators and senior leaders gathered at the residence of former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai and congratulated each other over the collapse of the MVA government. Former Minister and BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that \u201cthe truth prevailed, finally\u201d. \u201cThis govt which stopped the development of the State for two and half years has gone. We will bring in new era of development,\u201d BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said. The resignation of Mr. Thackeray has however raised the question on the future of the rebel MLAs who had revolted against him under the leadership of second-in-command Mr. Shinde. As Leader of the Opposition Mr. Fadnavis is set to stake claim to the Chief Minister\u2019s post for the third time, he will now have to seek support from Mr. Thackeray who will continue to be the Sena chief. Mr. Shinde had revolted against the Sena chief with 39 MLAs and had been stationed in Guwahati since June 22. He had demanded that Mr. Thackeray should snap ties with the Congress and the NCP for the sake of Hindutva. With Mr. Thackeray resigning, Mr. Shinde will have little option but to approach him. \u201cThose who were promoted by Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray are trying to pull down his son from the CM post. I asked them to come and sit in front of me to discuss. They said they have numbers and if that\u2019s the democracy for them, then I am not interested in a democracy that believes in head count,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in his address. Mr. Thackeray appealed to party workers to not obstruct the MLAs coming to Mumbai. \"I don't want to see your blood on streets. If any opposition is against me, I won't bother. But if a single person whom once I considered mine is against me then I am not happy,\" he said. He thanked the Congress and the NCP for supporting him at a time when his own betrayed him. \"I must appreciate the concern of Governor for democracy who ordered the floor test in 24 hours. I only want to remind him that appointment of 12 MLCs is pending for over one and half years,\" he said. Earlier, Mr. Thackeray attended a Cabinet meeting at the Mantralaya on Wednesday evening where he thanked his administration for the cooperation in the past two and half years. \u201cDespite being of different ideologies, you supported me throughout but I was backstabbed by my own partymen,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in the meeting, addressing his Cabinet colleagues, according to NCP state president Jayant Patil. Governor\u2019s order Mr. Koshyari on Wednesday morning directed Mr. Thackeray to prove the government\u2019s majority on June 30. Directing the Secretary of the Legislative Assembly to convene a special one-day session by exercising his power under Article 174 and 175(2), Mr. Koshyari, in his letter, stated that \u201cfloor test for proving the majority of the Chief Minister is imperative to ensure that the government continues to function with the confidence of the house\u201d. The letter from Mr. Koshyari stated that apart from news reports in print and electronic media regarding 39 MLAs withdrawing support from the MVA government, an email dated June 28 from seven Independent MLAs had also been received by the Raj Bhavan which stated that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the majority on the floor of the house. He also mentioned that the Leader of Opposition visited him on the same date and briefed him about the present political situation in the State submitting a letter stating that the Chief Minister had lost the majority and requesting for a floor test at the earliest to avoid any political bargaining by undemocratic means. While it also mentioned about possible violence and threats to rebel MLAs, Mr. Koshyari\u2019s letter directed that adequate security be provided outside and inside the Assembly to maintain \u201cthe sanctity of the voting process and also to preempt any law and order situation which may arise\u201d. As per the directions, the special session will have only one agenda of a trust vote against the Chief Minister and the proceedings should be concluded in any case by 5 p.m. on the same day and it shall not be adjourned for any reason whatsoever. All the proceedings will be live telecast and voting will be conducted by asking the members to rise in their seats. The Shiv Sena, which is faced with a rebellion against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray by party\u2019s second-in-command Eknath Shinde and 38 other MLAs, approached the Supreme Court demanding stay on the Governor\u2019s order of convening a session at a time when proceeding of disqualification against 16 rebel MLAs was pending. Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal had issued notices to 16 MLAs against which they had approached the top court. The court, in an urgent hearing, extended the time given to them to submit their reply till July 12. \u201cHow can the Governor ask the government to prove its majority when disqualification proceedings are pending?\u201d asked Sena Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant also questioning the urgency at which Mr. Koshyari issued the orders. Meanwhile, the rebel Sena MLAs who were stationed in Guwahati since June 22 were taken to Goa on Wednesday evening and from there they are scheduled to be brought to Mumbai for floor test. Prior to leaving, all the MLAs were taken to Kamakhya temple in Guwahati to seek blessings. \u201cWe will be in Mumbai on Thursday to vote in the floor test,\u201d Mr. Shinde said before leaving. One of the rebel Shiv Sena MLAs, Bharat Gogawale, on Wednesday night said they will hold meetings at a five-star hotel in Goa where they are staying for the night and discuss their next steps. \u201cIt is not like we are very happy with the decision of Uddhav Thackeray stepping down as the CM. We are heading towards our hotel. Once we reach there, we will discuss the issue and decide our next steps. He (Thackeray) tried to convince us,\u201d Mr. Gogawale said.

From today [Wednesday] morning, my workers are being sent notices by police. Central forces are here. Army might be called. Those who should have been at China borders will be here. I don't want to see blood of my workers spilling on the roads of Mumbai. Today, I resign from the post of Chief Minister,\" Mr. Thackeray said in a virtual address to the public Maharashtra political turmoil updates | June 29, 2022 Mr. Thackeray said he was also quitting as a Member of the Legislative Council and added that he would only concentrate on party work. \"I never said I will return. I never wanted to be here at this place, but I came. From now on, I will be fully with you,\" he told Shiv Sena workers. Late in the evening, Mr. Thackeray\u00a0submitted his resignation to Mr. Koshyari at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai. The Governor accepted the resignation\u00a0of Mr. Thackeray and asked him to officiate as the Chief Minister until alternate arrangements are made. Setback in Supreme Court Earlier, in a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray faction, the Supreme Court refused to stay the floor test called for by Mr. Koshyari on June 30 to test the Maha Vikas Aghadi government's claim of majority in the House. Maharashtra political crisis | Floor test will prevent horse-trading: Supreme Court \"We are not staying the floor test,\" a Vacation Bench of Justices Surya Kant and J.B. Pardiwala briefly informed the warring Shiv Sena factions after taking half-an-hour recess to deliberate in their chambers following a marathon hearing which spanned four hours, starting at 5 p.m. The court, however, said it would hear on merit the writ petition filed by Thackeray loyalist Sunil Prabhu, challenging the process leading to the call for floor test, on July 11 along with petitions filed by Sena dissidents led by Eknath Shinde, who has questioned the disqualification proceedings initiated against them. \"Tomorrow's proceedings (floor test) will be subject to the final outcome of these petitions in court,\" the Bench addressed the lawyers. Maharashtra govt. approves renaming of Aurangabad, Osmanabad The court had urgently heard the challenge to the floor test amid the frenzy of political churnings in Maharashtra. \"The urgency that has been created requires us to hear the matter today itself,\" Justice Kant submitted. The decision in favour of allowing the floor test came after the Governor and the dissident MLAs held that delaying the trust vote would be the \"anti-thesis of democracy\" and \"give more time for horse-trading in Maharashtra\". The Thackeray camp argued that the trust vote cannot be held when the disqualification proceedings against 16 rebel Sena MLAs, including Mr. Shinde, were pending and being examined by the Supreme Court. They said the dissidents were an \"artificial majority\". Three-party experiment With Mr. Thackeray's resignation, the unique three-party experiment of the MVA, in which the Shiv Sena tied up with the  Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has come to an end. The BJP, which is the single-largest party in the Assembly with 106 MLAs, is likely to stake claim to form the government. Several BJP legislators and senior leaders gathered at the residence of former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai and congratulated each other over the collapse of the MVA government. Former Minister and BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that \u201cthe truth prevailed, finally\u201d. \u201cThis govt which stopped the development of the State for two and half years has gone. We will bring in new era of development,\u201d BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said. The resignation of Mr. Thackeray has however raised the question on the future of the rebel MLAs who had revolted against him under the leadership of second-in-command Mr. Shinde. As Leader of the Opposition Mr. Fadnavis is set to stake claim to the Chief Minister\u2019s post for the third time, he will now have to seek support from Mr. Thackeray who will continue to be the Sena chief. Mr. Shinde had revolted against the Sena chief with 39 MLAs and had been stationed in Guwahati since June 22. He had demanded that Mr. Thackeray should snap ties with the Congress and the NCP for the sake of Hindutva. With Mr. Thackeray resigning, Mr. Shinde will have little option but to approach him. \u201cThose who were promoted by Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray are trying to pull down his son from the CM post. I asked them to come and sit in front of me to discuss. They said they have numbers and if that\u2019s the democracy for them, then I am not interested in a democracy that believes in head count,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in his address. Mr. Thackeray appealed to party workers to not obstruct the MLAs coming to Mumbai. \"I don't want to see your blood on streets. If any opposition is against me, I won't bother. But if a single person whom once I considered mine is against me then I am not happy,\" he said. He thanked the Congress and the NCP for supporting him at a time when his own betrayed him. \"I must appreciate the concern of Governor for democracy who ordered the floor test in 24 hours. I only want to remind him that appointment of 12 MLCs is pending for over one and half years,\" he said. Earlier, Mr. Thackeray attended a Cabinet meeting at the Mantralaya on Wednesday evening where he thanked his administration for the cooperation in the past two and half years. \u201cDespite being of different ideologies, you supported me throughout but I was backstabbed by my own partymen,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in the meeting, addressing his Cabinet colleagues, according to NCP state president Jayant Patil. Governor\u2019s order Mr. Koshyari on Wednesday morning directed Mr. Thackeray to prove the government\u2019s majority on June 30. Directing the Secretary of the Legislative Assembly to convene a special one-day session by exercising his power under Article 174 and 175(2), Mr. Koshyari, in his letter, stated that \u201cfloor test for proving the majority of the Chief Minister is imperative to ensure that the government continues to function with the confidence of the house\u201d. The letter from Mr. Koshyari stated that apart from news reports in print and electronic media regarding 39 MLAs withdrawing support from the MVA government, an email dated June 28 from seven Independent MLAs had also been received by the Raj Bhavan which stated that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the majority on the floor of the house. He also mentioned that the Leader of Opposition visited him on the same date and briefed him about the present political situation in the State submitting a letter stating that the Chief Minister had lost the majority and requesting for a floor test at the earliest to avoid any political bargaining by undemocratic means. While it also mentioned about possible violence and threats to rebel MLAs, Mr. Koshyari\u2019s letter directed that adequate security be provided outside and inside the Assembly to maintain \u201cthe sanctity of the voting process and also to preempt any law and order situation which may arise\u201d. As per the directions, the special session will have only one agenda of a trust vote against the Chief Minister and the proceedings should be concluded in any case by 5 p.m. on the same day and it shall not be adjourned for any reason whatsoever. All the proceedings will be live telecast and voting will be conducted by asking the members to rise in their seats. The Shiv Sena, which is faced with a rebellion against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray by party\u2019s second-in-command Eknath Shinde and 38 other MLAs, approached the Supreme Court demanding stay on the Governor\u2019s order of convening a session at a time when proceeding of disqualification against 16 rebel MLAs was pending. Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal had issued notices to 16 MLAs against which they had approached the top court. The court, in an urgent hearing, extended the time given to them to submit their reply till July 12. \u201cHow can the Governor ask the government to prove its majority when disqualification proceedings are pending?\u201d asked Sena Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant also questioning the urgency at which Mr. Koshyari issued the orders. Meanwhile, the rebel Sena MLAs who were stationed in Guwahati since June 22 were taken to Goa on Wednesday evening and from there they are scheduled to be brought to Mumbai for floor test. Prior to leaving, all the MLAs were taken to Kamakhya temple in Guwahati to seek blessings. \u201cWe will be in Mumbai on Thursday to vote in the floor test,\u201d Mr. Shinde said before leaving. One of the rebel Shiv Sena MLAs, Bharat Gogawale, on Wednesday night said they will hold meetings at a five-star hotel in Goa where they are staying for the night and discuss their next steps. \u201cIt is not like we are very happy with the decision of Uddhav Thackeray stepping down as the CM. We are heading towards our hotel. Once we reach there, we will discuss the issue and decide our next steps. He (Thackeray) tried to convince us,\u201d Mr. Gogawale said.

He has, however, denied all charges. Written by India News Desk Updated: August 31, 2022 17:05 IST Follow Us Karnataka\u2019s most prominent seer Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru is in the eye of a storm. Karnataka Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru Chitradurga News Updates: Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru, chief pontiff of Jagadguru Murugarajendra Vidyapeetha Mutt in Chitradurga and a politically influential seer from Karnataka, is accused of sexual abuse of high school girls. He has has booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on Monday. Where did it all begin? Two girls, aged 16 and 15, had told members of the state Child Welfare Committee they were sexually assaulted between January 1, 2019, and June 6, 2022, according to The Indian Express. The girls were students of a school that was run by the mutt in Chitradurga and resided in the hostels there. They left the hostel in July. The Indian Express cited police sources as saying that after the victims reached Mysuru, they had approached an NGO named Odanadi Seva Samsthe, who works for trafficking victims. The NGO later approached the Child Welfare Committee and a police complaint was filed. Following the allegations, Mysuru police filed an FIR on August 26 against Muruga Mutt head Shivamurthy Muruga Sharanaru, and booked him under the POCSO Act, 2012 and Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for alleged sexual abuse.\u00a0 The case was filed based on the complaint by an officer of the District Child Protection Unit, PTI reported. The FIR was earlier filed in Mysuru\u2019s Nazarbad Police Station, but the case was later transferred to Chitradurga, as the mutt comes under its jurisdiction, The Quint reported.

The victims were taken to a government hospital in Chitradurga for medical examination, which went on for more than four hours. The victims also recorded their statements before the Child Welfare Committee and the police in Chitradurga on Monday. Murugha Math Advisory Committee member N B Vishwanath had earlier said the charges against the pontiff were \u201cfar from the truth\u201d, alleging that the math\u2019s administrative officer S K Basavarajan, a former MLA, was behind the charge. What did the seer have to say? The chief pontiff of one of the prominent and prestigious Lingayat seminaries in the state on Monday claimed that it is part of a long-drawn conspiracy against him and vowed to come out clean in the case. On speculation that he had allegedly fled to evade arrest, he said that he is a law-abiding citizen and will cooperate in the investigation. \u201cThis is not the first time that there has been a conspiracy against the mutt but it has been there for the last 15 years. These conspiracies stayed within the mutt but now have come out. I am not going to run away but will respect the law of the land. I will come out clean from the allegations and let the case reach its logical end,\u201d he said addressing his followers, devotees and media persons. Seer seeks anticipatory bail The second additional district and sessions court in Chitradurga issued notices to the legal officer of the Mysuru district Child Protection Unit, who made the complaint against the seer and the two minor girls after the chief pontiff sought anticipatory bail. The sessions court on Saturday posted the hearing of the anticipatory bail plea to September 1. The Chitradurga police are yet to officially question the seer. What is the latest update in this case? The two minor girls on Tuesday recorded their statements before a magistrate, according to the Indian Express. The Chitradurga district police produced the two victims in the court of a Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) to record their statements under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Statements before a magistrate can be considered a key evidence when a crime takes place. As one of the victims has been identified as a Dalit, several Dalit groups have staged protest oin Chitradurga demanding his arrest.

A nine-year-old Dalit boy died on Saturday, 24 days after he was assaulted by a teacher in his school in Jalore district of Rajasthan for allegedly touching a pot of drinking water. The boy was under medical care at Ahmedabad in Gujarat. He was taken there after he did not respond to treatment in Jalore and Udaipur. The incident took place at a private school, Saraswati Vidya Mandir, in Surana village on July 20, when the teacher, Chhail Singh, took exception to the student of Class III, Inder Meghwal, touching the earthen pot and drinking water from it. Inder\u2019s father Deva Ram alleged that Mr. Singh severely beat his son and threw casteist slurs at him. Inder was first taken to the district hospital in Jalore, from where he was referred to Udaipur. The doctors there detected damage to his ear nerves. When the child\u2019s condition deteriorated, he was taken to Ahmedabad for treatment by specialists. Inder did not respond to the treatment and died due to the internal injuries, doctors said. After Mr. Dev Ram reported the matter to the police, a case was registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act at the Sayla police station. Mr. Singh was detained and was being interrogated till late on Saturday night. Superintendent of Police, Jalore, Harsh Vardhan Agarwalla, who visited Surana village and met the family of the deceased, said the investigation was in progress and the allegation of assault with the casteist angle was yet to be confirmed. The school also has a big tank from which the students and the teachers of all communities drink water. However, Mr. Deva Ram said the earthen pot was reserved for the teachers belonging to higher castes. Inder touched the pot by mistake and drank water from it when he was thirsty. Mr. Singh noticed it and assaulted the boy, according to the complaint submitted to the police. The Education Department has also started an investigation into the matter.

{"year":"2022","month":"06","event_desc":"Uddhav Thackeray resigns as Chief minister of Maharashtra following Supreme Court of India not admitting the stay petition of Shiv Sena against the Motion of no confidence.","text":"Home News India Uddhav Thackeray resigns as Supreme Court refuses to stay floor test Rebel MLAs leave Guwahati for Mumbai, via Goa Updated - June 30, 2022 07:29 am IST - Mumbai\/New Delhi Special Correspondent Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray arrives at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai to submit his resignation letter to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on June 29, 2022. \n                                          | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini Embattled Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced his resignation from the post on Wednesday, moments after the Supreme Court\u00a0refused to stay Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari\u2019s direction to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to take a floor test in the Assembly on Thursday. \"I am not the one who will stick to power. From today [Wednesday] morning, my workers are being sent notices by police. Central forces are here. Army might be called. Those who should have been at China borders will be here. I don't want to see blood of my workers spilling on the roads of Mumbai. Today, I resign from the post of Chief Minister,\" Mr. Thackeray said in a virtual address to the public Maharashtra political turmoil updates | June 29, 2022 Mr. Thackeray said he was also quitting as a Member of the Legislative Council and added that he would only concentrate on party work. \"I never said I will return. I never wanted to be here at this place, but I came. From now on, I will be fully with you,\" he told Shiv Sena workers. Late in the evening, Mr. Thackeray\u00a0submitted his resignation to Mr. Koshyari at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai. The Governor accepted the resignation\u00a0of Mr. Thackeray and asked him to officiate as the Chief Minister until alternate arrangements are made. Setback in Supreme Court Earlier, in a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray faction, the Supreme Court refused to stay the floor test called for by Mr. Koshyari on June 30 to test the Maha Vikas Aghadi government's claim of majority in the House. Maharashtra political crisis | Floor test will prevent horse-trading: Supreme Court \"We are not staying the floor test,\" a Vacation Bench of Justices Surya Kant and J.B. Pardiwala briefly informed the warring Shiv Sena factions after taking half-an-hour recess to deliberate in their chambers following a marathon hearing which spanned four hours, starting at 5 p.m. The court, however, said it would hear on merit the writ petition filed by Thackeray loyalist Sunil Prabhu, challenging the process leading to the call for floor test, on July 11 along with petitions filed by Sena dissidents led by Eknath Shinde, who has questioned the disqualification proceedings initiated against them. \"Tomorrow's proceedings (floor test) will be subject to the final outcome of these petitions in court,\" the Bench addressed the lawyers. Maharashtra govt. approves renaming of Aurangabad, Osmanabad The court had urgently heard the challenge to the floor test amid the frenzy of political churnings in Maharashtra. \"The urgency that has been created requires us to hear the matter today itself,\" Justice Kant submitted. The decision in favour of allowing the floor test came after the Governor and the dissident MLAs held that delaying the trust vote would be the \"anti-thesis of democracy\" and \"give more time for horse-trading in Maharashtra\". The Thackeray camp argued that the trust vote cannot be held when the disqualification proceedings against 16 rebel Sena MLAs, including Mr. Shinde, were pending and being examined by the Supreme Court. They said the dissidents were an \"artificial majority\". Three-party experiment With Mr. Thackeray's resignation, the unique three-party experiment of the MVA, in which the Shiv Sena tied up with the  Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has come to an end. The BJP, which is the single-largest party in the Assembly with 106 MLAs, is likely to stake claim to form the government. Several BJP legislators and senior leaders gathered at the residence of former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai and congratulated each other over the collapse of the MVA government. Former Minister and BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that \u201cthe truth prevailed, finally\u201d. \u201cThis govt which stopped the development of the State for two and half years has gone. We will bring in new era of development,\u201d BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said. The resignation of Mr. Thackeray has however raised the question on the future of the rebel MLAs who had revolted against him under the leadership of second-in-command Mr. Shinde. As Leader of the Opposition Mr. Fadnavis is set to stake claim to the Chief Minister\u2019s post for the third time, he will now have to seek support from Mr. Thackeray who will continue to be the Sena chief. Mr. Shinde had revolted against the Sena chief with 39 MLAs and had been stationed in Guwahati since June 22. He had demanded that Mr. Thackeray should snap ties with the Congress and the NCP for the sake of Hindutva. With Mr. Thackeray resigning, Mr. Shinde will have little option but to approach him. \u201cThose who were promoted by Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray are trying to pull down his son from the CM post. I asked them to come and sit in front of me to discuss. They said they have numbers and if that\u2019s the democracy for them, then I am not interested in a democracy that believes in head count,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in his address. Mr. Thackeray appealed to party workers to not obstruct the MLAs coming to Mumbai. \"I don't want to see your blood on streets. If any opposition is against me, I won't bother. But if a single person whom once I considered mine is against me then I am not happy,\" he said. He thanked the Congress and the NCP for supporting him at a time when his own betrayed him. \"I must appreciate the concern of Governor for democracy who ordered the floor test in 24 hours. I only want to remind him that appointment of 12 MLCs is pending for over one and half years,\" he said. Earlier, Mr. Thackeray attended a Cabinet meeting at the Mantralaya on Wednesday evening where he thanked his administration for the cooperation in the past two and half years. \u201cDespite being of different ideologies, you supported me throughout but I was backstabbed by my own partymen,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in the meeting, addressing his Cabinet colleagues, according to NCP state president Jayant Patil. Governor\u2019s order Mr. Koshyari on Wednesday morning directed Mr. Thackeray to prove the government\u2019s majority on June 30. Directing the Secretary of the Legislative Assembly to convene a special one-day session by exercising his power under Article 174 and 175(2), Mr. Koshyari, in his letter, stated that \u201cfloor test for proving the majority of the Chief Minister is imperative to ensure that the government continues to function with the confidence of the house\u201d. The letter from Mr. Koshyari stated that apart from news reports in print and electronic media regarding 39 MLAs withdrawing support from the MVA government, an email dated June 28 from seven Independent MLAs had also been received by the Raj Bhavan which stated that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the majority on the floor of the house. He also mentioned that the Leader of Opposition visited him on the same date and briefed him about the present political situation in the State submitting a letter stating that the Chief Minister had lost the majority and requesting for a floor test at the earliest to avoid any political bargaining by undemocratic means. While it also mentioned about possible violence and threats to rebel MLAs, Mr. Koshyari\u2019s letter directed that adequate security be provided outside and inside the Assembly to maintain \u201cthe sanctity of the voting process and also to preempt any law and order situation which may arise\u201d. As per the directions, the special session will have only one agenda of a trust vote against the Chief Minister and the proceedings should be concluded in any case by 5 p.m. on the same day and it shall not be adjourned for any reason whatsoever. All the proceedings will be live telecast and voting will be conducted by asking the members to rise in their seats. The Shiv Sena, which is faced with a rebellion against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray by party\u2019s second-in-command Eknath Shinde and 38 other MLAs, approached the Supreme Court demanding stay on the Governor\u2019s order of convening a session at a time when proceeding of disqualification against 16 rebel MLAs was pending. Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal had issued notices to 16 MLAs against which they had approached the top court. The court, in an urgent hearing, extended the time given to them to submit their reply till July 12. \u201cHow can the Governor ask the government to prove its majority when disqualification proceedings are pending?\u201d asked Sena Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant also questioning the urgency at which Mr. Koshyari issued the orders. Meanwhile, the rebel Sena MLAs who were stationed in Guwahati since June 22 were taken to Goa on Wednesday evening and from there they are scheduled to be brought to Mumbai for floor test. Prior to leaving, all the MLAs were taken to Kamakhya temple in Guwahati to seek blessings. \u201cWe will be in Mumbai on Thursday to vote in the floor test,\u201d Mr. Shinde said before leaving. One of the rebel Shiv Sena MLAs, Bharat Gogawale, on Wednesday night said they will hold meetings at a five-star hotel in Goa where they are staying for the night and discuss their next steps. \u201cIt is not like we are very happy with the decision of Uddhav Thackeray stepping down as the CM. We are heading towards our hotel. Once we reach there, we will discuss the issue and decide our next steps. He (Thackeray) tried to convince us,\u201d Mr. Gogawale said.

{"year":"2022","month":"08","event_desc":"31 August - Death of Paolo Maino due to prolonged illness, mother of Sonia Gandhi in Italy.","text":"Paola Maino: The woman who shaped Sonia Gandhi's life and destiny Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi lost an important link with her Italian roots when she lost her mother, Paola Maino. Listen to Story Live TV Share Advertisement Sonia Gandhi's mother Paola Maino passed away at the age of 98 (Getty Images) Rasheed Kidwai New Delhi , UPDATED: Sep 2, 2022 09:44 IST In Short Paola Maino was hard-working and disciplined, a quality that she passed on to her daughter,  Sonia. After Sonia's marriage to Rajiv Gandhi, Paola Maino was a frequent visitor to India. When Paola fell ill, she would often ask Rahul gandhi to visit her. Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi lost her most important link with hometown Orbassano in Italy on August 27, 2022 when she lost her mother Paola Maino (98). Sonia was the second daughter of Paola and Stefano who had raised her as their Cenerentola, or Cinderella. The nickname, as the subsequent years proved, was not entirely fortuitous. Paola and Stefano sensed early on that unlike her sisters, Nadia and Anushka, Sonia always wanted to be different. As a young girl she was never comfortable in the dusty industrial town on the outskirts of Turin where she grew. Orbassano was a town, a muddle of apartment blocks and houses that had come up in the early 1950s as a result of the post-war boom in northern Italy. advertisement At home, the Mainos often conversed in Russian instead of Italian or Spanish, the three languages they would speak with ease. The Russian impact was there as Stefano had fought in Russia with the Germans. The Mainos were deeply influenced by the Russian language, culture and food and loved the country. They even gave Russian names to their three daughters. Paola was hard-working and disciplined, a quality that she passed on to her family, especially Sonia. Family friends said that by early 1965 Stefano had made enough money that he could fund his daughter\u2019s education in Cambridge. Paola and Stefano had come to visit the United Kingdom when Sonia came to study English at the Lennox Cook School, Cambridge. Paola and Stefano had also brought up their daughters in the traditional Catholic way. They were not charmed when Sonia informed them about tying the knot with the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s son, Rajiv Gandhi. Stefano\u2019s inflexibility on this count estranged him from Sonia, so much so that he did not attend Sonia\u2019s marriage. Paola and her brother Mario Predebon came to India in February 1968. In fact, Mario gave away the girl in the civil marriage that took place on February 25, 1968. advertisement It was said that Stefano\u2019s forceful and rather strict side often placed him at odds with his family, resulting in frequent quarrels between husband and wife. The quarrels drew Sonia closer to her mother, Paola, a bond that stayed till August 2022. In fact, Paola was a frequent visitor to India. When a group of Indian journalists visited Orbassano town in 1998, one neighbour, who claimed to have studied with Sonia, described the Mainos as \u201cnice persons\u201d who were aware of their \u201csocial superiority\u201d. Some Italian businessmen attributed the Mainos\u2019 success to the 1980s boom in the construction industry, but in India, exaggerated reports about the Maino family\u2019s fortunes were viewed with suspicion. NehruGandhi family friend Mohammad Yunus, a journalist and administrator, was among a handful of persons from Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s side who visited the Maino house, a neat double-storey at Number 14 Via Bellini, in a neighbourhood inhabited mainly by people in the construction trade. Yunus later wrote in his book, Persons, Passions, Politics (Vikas Publishing House, New Delhi, 1980), \u201cI can say without fear of contradiction that they are a decent middle-class family. The stories about their fabulous home and millions gained through their India link can be termed as sheer nonsense.\u201d Paola had visited India in the early 1980s when Indira Gandhi had returned as Prime Minister. She had told Eric Silver of the Guardian News Service in 1986, \u201cMy upbringing is such that I feel my husband is superior and his mother even more superior.\u201d Sonia had also told a visiting Italian magazine correspondent that Indira Gandhi was as affectionate as a real mother. \u201cLiving with her was a wonderful experience,\u201d Sonia said, adding that she could never forget Indira\u2019s small note to her soon after her marriage when her mother Paola left for Italy. \u201cI was feeling lonely and depressed. As soon as I returned from the airport, I got her note. It said: \u2018Just to say hello and to tell you that we all love you\u2019.\u201d A regular visitor to her daughter, Paola had come to India in April 1999 when the Vajpayee regime was voted out and Sonia was tipped to replace him as PM, but could not due to opposition from the Samajwadi Party and a few others. Paola was again in India during a good part of March-April 2004 but left the country a week before the Lok Sabha results were announced and Sonia had declined the office of the Prime Minister. She was staying at Priyanka\u2019s house at 34 Lodhi Estate, mostly attending to her great-grandchildren Raihan and Miraya when both Sonia and Priyanka used to be away campaigning in the Amethi-Rae Bareli-Sultanpur belt. While in India, Paola was often seen at Delhi\u2019s Khan Market, buying fruits and vegetables of her choice. This correspondent had met her briefly there. At times, Priyanka Gandhi would accompany her, opening the car door for her and having coffee with her. advertisement When Paola fell ill, she would often ask Rahul to visit her. In 2017, when Rahul Gandhi opted for a \u2018holiday\u2019 when the farmers\u2019 stir was at its peak, and the search for a presidential nominee was on, it was due to Paola\u2019s desire to celebrate Rahul\u2019s then 47th birthday with her. BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was quick to take a dig. \u201cWhen we were kids, then we used to go to the nanihaal (maternal grandmother's place) during our summer vacations,\u201d Vijayvargiya said, adding, \u201cYou can't expect Rahul ji to be worried about the country or the farmers. He does politics to enjoy his picnics.\u201d In December 2020, Rahul had again flown off to see his ailing nonagenarian grandmother Paola. Social media platforms had criticised him, attacking the former Congress president for skipping the party's 136th foundation day, farmers\u2019 agitation, poll preparations for the coming assembly polls of Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. Rahul did not lean on Mark Twain to say, \u201cBut that is the way we are made: we don't reason, where we feel; we just feel.\u201d (As narrated in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court) Published By: Rishabh Sharma Published On: Sep 1, 2022 --- ENDS --- Watch Live TV Advertisement Also Watch India Today in Pahalgam: Choppers screen meadow where terrorists unleashed horror Ground Report: Helicopters deployed as terror hunt launched in Pahalgam forests Terror in Pahalgam: Tourists caught in crossfire moments after deadly attack We\u2019re ashamed, sorry that it happened in Kashmir: Mehbooba Mufti on terror attack Bharat Will Not Bend to Terror, Culprits Of Attack Won't Be Spared: Amit Shah Advertisement Read This Heads of State trailer: Priyanka, John Cena, Idris Alba get their guns blazing Why Gujarat\u2019s Asiatic lion census is a big deal really Jasprit Bumrah equals Malinga\u2019s record for most wickets for MI in IPL history From the India Today archives (2001) | War on Terrorism- Should India Attack, Powell and Patience What is the Indus Waters Treaty put on hold by India after Pahalgam attack?

Tired of too many ads? Remove Ads The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) had estimated a 16.2 percent growth for the first quarter and 7.2 percent for the fiscal year. Softening of crude and edible oil prices following excise duty cuts and other fiscal-side measures also provided much-needed support to the economy. Businesses also ramped up capacity as domestic demand recovered, which indicated a nascent recovery in the economy. However, factors such as the scorching summer (causing heatflation), surging inflationary pressure, depreciating rupee and supply-chain disruptions caused by ongoing geopolitical tensions continued to hinder growth in the Indian economy. The double-digit growth reading also comes at a time when India\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee has initiated the rate-hike cycle and has already lifted rates by 140 basis points since May, including a 50 bps hike earlier this month to tame inflation. The rate-setting panel members also warned about the impact of a global slowdown on domestic growth prospects, while it calibrates withdrawal of the monetary accommodation that was brought in following the outbreak of the Covid pandemic. The central bank is expected to further raise the repo rate, but some industry experts believe the rate hikes may hit consumption, and thus growth, with demand already under pressure. Going ahead, the economy may also face downward risks, as tighter monetary conditions and higher input costs impact companies' investment plans. \"Going forward, with the global headwinds, India\u2019s external sector would face a challenging time. It will be critical for domestic consumption and Investment to gather momentum. The consumption demand revival has been uneven so far with weak rural demand. While lowering of inflation will provide support to overall consumption spending, uneven monsoon will play a spoiler for rural demand,\" CareEdge's Sinha said.

Shekhar Gupta 03 September, 2022 08:15 am IST Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Illustration by Soham Sen | ThePrint Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ T he commissioning of INS Vikrant , the new avatar of the Indian Navy\u2019s first aircraft carrier and flag carrier for almost five decades, is a day of celebration for India. And for good reason. At about three times the original (42,800 tons versus 16,000 tons), it isn\u2019t just the biggest warship designed and built in India, it\u2019s also fully a swadeshi design. That\u2019s a matter of great pride as it places India among an elite list of nations with the ability to build such a warship. A list so elite, you can mostly count it on the fingers of one hand. Of course, we are excluding Britain for now. Show Full Article You\u2019d need to be a rare Indian indifferent to such national achievement, or maybe one from the somewhat less rare community of war-hating, give-peace-a-chance walas, to not join in the celebration. We are none of these, so congratulations Indian Navy, its brilliant and evolving design bureau, engineers, marine warfare visionaries, and of course, India\u2019s political leaders spanning 25 years and the tenure of three prime ministers beginning with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It was under his leadership that the designing process of this Make-in-India or Atmanirbhar carrier began. The Cabinet Committee on Security, under him, cleared the project for construction in 2002. We can ask why it took India, with its engineering base, 23 years to commission this ship. Especially when the Chinese would build a much bigger one in just three to four years, and in any case, for the new Vikrant , the engines are American, GE imports. The Chinese already have two fully operational carriers, one of them fully home-made, almost twice the size of the new Vikrant , carrying not only many more aircraft, but way more potent ones like the J-15 or other Chinese copies of Su-30 variants. The third, which the Chinese with their speed may operationalise as early as next year, is estimated to be in the one-lakh ton class. But these are the perennial issues with India\u2019s defence manufacturing. We\u2019ve been fretting over these and will continue to do so. This is the time to look at the future with an open mind. Three immediate questions therefore arise. The most important of which is, does India need aircraft carriers? And if so, what kind and how many? And third, what kind of firepower should \u2014 and can \u2014 India field from these mighty vessels, and where will it come from? Also read: India\u2019s challenge is to avoid two-front war, but can Modi put politics aside for strategy? C arriers versus submarines has been the most enduring debate in naval warfare for more than 75 years now. In World War 2, carriers, especially the giant American and Japanese ones, brought a new dimension to marine warfare. The Germans focussed on their submarines, or U-boats as these were called. This is where the larger idea of sea control (carriers) versus sea denial (submarines) originated. During almost the entire Cold War, the Western world followed the original US doctrine, while the Soviet Navy and bloc invested heavily in sea denial. It built a large armada of super-silent and lethal submarines. Much of the literature you read on that debate tells us that not only was the belief in submarine warfare almost ideological in the Soviet Navy, there was also a cost argument. The leaders of the Soviet Union knew they couldn\u2019t afford to engage in a race against the much richer West to build large surface vessels with expensive air elements. They were, therefore, to find deterrence and tactical balance through sea denial, with the threat of massive attrition that the loss of even one carrier-sized vessel would entail. We\u2019ve read authentic accounts of how, when the US Seventh Fleet task force led by USS Enterprise sailed towards India while the 1971 war raged, it was stalked by Soviet submarines. This began to change in the last decades of the Cold War. The Soviets went ahead and built a small carrier, ironically naming it after Admiral Gorshkov, the founder of its mostly submarine and missile-oriented Navy and the author of that doctrine. That, by the way, is the ship the Soviets sold to India. Renamed Vikramaditya , it is now India\u2019s flag carrier. It moved up in size to 44,500 tons. In the interim, the Indian Navy had acquired another junked British vessel, HMS Hermes , which served as INS Viraat , at 23,700 tons, one and a half times bigger than the first Vikrant . While much of India\u2019s military was built around Soviet\/ Russian equipment and training, say 1964-onwards, the Navy caught the carrier bug early. In 1942, the Royal Navy had commissioned a bunch of new carriers in what was called the Majestic class. Some were still semi-built when the War ended. One of these, HMS Hercules , was bought by India, completed at Belfast, and became the first INS Vikrant . That won the surface combatant versus submarine debate in the Indian Navy for more than a decade, and with troublesome results. The 1965 war is not something the Indian Navy would like to talk very much about. A seven-ship task force of the Pakistan Navy, led by cruiser PNS Babur , got close enough to temple town Dwarka on the Gujarat coast (with obvious religious messaging) to plaster it with their 5.25-inch guns unopposed. The Indian Navy did not join the fight. Not only because Vikrant was in dry dock, as it often was in its service decades, but also because there was a wariness about PNS Ghazi , the only submarine in the subcontinent then. It was only after this that India acquired its first subs, the Soviet Foxtrots . But, in 1971 again, Vikrant had to be taken far away from the Arabian Sea for the same concern over the Ghazi (it was lured and sunk off Visakhapatnam in a storied operation) and the French Daphnes . One of those (PNS Hangor ) sank the frigate INS Khukri not far from Diu. Military doctrines tend to be much too durable, naval ones most of all. The Indian Navy has accordingly kept the idea of multiple carrier-based task forces close to its heart. It is the capital cost, inability to build at home in the past, and shifting political emphasis that has rarely given it the luxury of even two carriers at any point of time. The new Vikrant can change this. Also read: How Indian armed forces can defeat Pakistan in less than a week W hich brings us back to the three questions we had raised. I raised this question with the Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Ashley Tellis, whose name the Indian strategic community is familiar with. Before that question, he said, you have to first decide what are India\u2019s geopolitical objectives. If these are limited to say, a 1,000-km radius from its peninsula, it doesn\u2019t need any carriers. Of course, this would easily take Karachi and Gwadar in its sweep. All this can be easily, and much more effectively, covered by shore-based aircraft, especially with mid-air refuelling. If your vision is to be a player in more distant zones, he argued, say to East Africa and Southeast Asia, then you need carriers. But then, what kind of carriers? So far, he argues, (you can watch this part of the conversation here ) the Indian Navy has made the worst possible choices. It\u2019s bought\/ built expensive, small carriers which are hugely manpower intensive and pack too little firepower. The current complement of a maximum of 20 or so MiG-29Ks from these ships will give you too little range, weapon-load and time-on-station. We know that the navy just held trials for the next generation fighters, Rafale (Marine) and F\/A-18. These give at least twice the fighting radius of a MiG-29 and much more warload. But then, he argues, these carriers are too small to pack a real punch. Not cost-effective, not value for money. Forty years of research and experience at the US Navy, he says, shows that to be a potent force, a carrier needs to be in the 65,000-ton-plus range. Which is the Indian Navy\u2019s vision for IAC-3. But again the question of numbers, costs, aircraft and so on will arise. In any case, money will have to be diverted for these from somewhere else. Will it be the submarines or more deadly missiles or other vessels? The IAF, the Army? These are tough questions India\u2019s military and political leaderships need to debate and decide on. Right now, let\u2019s celebrate the arrival of the new INS Vikrant . Months before the first aircraft takes off from it for trials, it has already contributed by re-sparking this eternal doctrinal debate.

Sabarimala temple (File photo) From our online archive Updated on : 12 Nov 2018, 6:12 pm 2 min read Copied Follow Us KOCHI: The state government on Monday submitted before the Kerala High Court that there was a school of thought that Sabarimala temple was a Buddhist temple and the word 'Saranam' was derived from Buddhism. M Harshan, Additional Secretary to Government, Revenue (Devaswom) department filed the affidavit in response to a petition seeking a directive to enforce Rule 3 (a) framed under the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of entry) Act, 1965, which prohibits entry of non-Hindus into temples. The petitioner submitted that non-Hindus and non-idol worshippers have no right to enter Sabarimala. According to the state, it was historically accepted fact that Sabarimala is a secular temple where entry of devotees is not restricted on the ground of any caste or religion. The 'Vavar Nada' at Sannidhanam co-existed with Sabarimala temple and from time immemorial Muslims used to come and offer prayer at Vavar Nada as well as Sabarimala temple. It was also a fact that on the way to Sabarimala at Erumeli, there is a mosque known as 'Vavar Palli' and from time immemorial all Ayyappa devotees irrespective of caste and religion used to offer prayer at Vavar Palli and then only proceed to Sabarimala. The 'Petta Thullal' which is an essential religious part of the Sabarimala pilgrimage starts from Vavar Palli. The state further pointed out that 'Harivarasanam' was sung by Singer KJ Yesudas, who is a Christian by birth. Yesudas is a devotee of Ayyappa and used to visit and offer prayers the temple. It was also a known fact that several other Christian and Muslim religious persons were devotees of Ayyappa and conduct pilgrimage at Sabarimala every year. It was an openly debated fact that Sabarimala was originally a worship place belonged to tribals. The state submitted that the Wakf board, Muslim organisations, Vavar Trust, Christian organisations, Tribal organisations should be made a party before taking any decision in the petition. When the larger public interest of different religious and secular issues was involved, the issue cannot be adjudicated by the court without publication in media as contemplated under Order 1 Rule 8 of CPC.

Earlier too, enforcement agencies had conducted searches on Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia 's official residence besides at several places in connection with the alleged corruption in the implementation of Delhi's excise policy.

What exactly is the controversy around Delhi's Excise policy? A report on July 8 by Delhi's Chief Secretary established prima facie violations of GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR) 1993, Delhi Excise Act 2009 and Delhi Excise Rules 2010. The Chief Secretary's report indicated substantively of financial quid pro quo at the top political level and that the Delhi Excise Policy was implemented with the sole aim of benefitting private liquor barons for financial benefits to individuals at the highest rungs of the government leading up to Manish Sisodia. Sisodia, who is in charge of the excise department, is under the scanner for alleged deliberate and gross procedural lapses which provided undue benefits to the tender process for liquor licensees for the year 2021-22. Sisodia is believed to have executed decisions in violation of the statutory provisions of the Excise Policy, which could have huge financial implications. Such \"undue financial favours\" to the liquor licensees after the deadline for awarding tenders caused huge losses to the exchequer, sources earlier claimed. Delhi Lieutenant Governor recommends CBI probe Taking into account the Chief Secretary's report, Delhi's Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena had recommended a CBI investigation into the matter.The LG office said that Sisodia also extended financial favours to the liquor licensees much after the tenders had been awarded and thus caused huge losses to the exchequer. The excise policy was passed in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi Cabinet in the middle of the deadly Delta Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. However, the Delhi government's version is that the policy was formulated to ensure the generation of optimum revenue, and eradicate the sale of spurious liquor or non-duty paid liquor in Delhi, besides improving user experience. The procedures that were followed to check monopolies and cartels of successful applicants granted liquor license was also sought. \"Whether any SOP was prepared to check monopolies and cartels of successful applicants granted liquor license under New Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22. If yes, please provide the relevant SOP,\" it had asked. Further, it sought whether the Delhi Excise Department has issued any show cause notice for cancellation of the license granted to any applicant or cancelled license under the new excise policy. Following LG's recommendation, the office of the Assistant Commissioner of Delhi Police's Economic Offence Wing (EOW)issued a notice to Delhi's Excise Commissioner asking him to provide all documents relating to the award of liquor licenses under the new excise policy. Assistant Commissioner of Police, EOW had sought the date of floating of tenders for grant of liquor license under the new policy, date of grant of a license, and application forms of all successful applicants. How Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reacted Kejriwal rubbished the allegations made against his deputy and termed the matter to be a false case and alleged that the central government could not bear to see the expansion of the Aam-Aadmi Party (AAP). \"Whole case is false. I know Sisodia for the past 22 years. He is honest. When he became minister, Delhi government schools were in poor condition. He worked day and night to bring them up to a level where a judge's child and a rickshaw driver's child sit together to study,\" Kejriwal had said. The central government, Kejriwal said, has levelled several allegations against the AAP as the has been growing since its win in Punjab. \"They cannot bear to see us rise to a national level and thus are resorting to such measures. But nothing will stop us,\" he had said.

{"year":"2022","month":"09","event_desc":"The Supreme Court rules that all women are entitled to an abortion for up to 24 weeks after initial pregnancy as per the women's choice.","text":"World India's Supreme Court allows all women, regardless of marital status, to have abortions up to 24 weeks into pregnancies September 29, 2022 \/ 3:01 PM EDT \/ AP India's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that all women, regardless of marital status, can obtain abortions up to 24 weeks into their pregnancies. Previously, under India's abortion law, married women could have abortions up to 24 weeks into their pregnancies, but single women were limited to 20 weeks. On Thursday, the court extended the 24-week period to all women. The judgment was cheered by reproductive rights activists, who said the court had ensured that the law does not discriminate and expands the right to safe and legal abortions to single women. \"Now, all the rights that married women have, single women will also have,\" said Aparna Chandra, an associate professor of law at the National Law School of India, who works on reproductive justice. In its judgment, the court \"breaks away from the stigma that is attached to single women getting pregnant,\" she said. Abortion has been legal in India since 1971 under the Medical Termination Pregnancy Act. In 2021, the law was amended to allow certain categories of women \u2014 including married women who were divorced or widowed, minors, rape victims or mentally ill women\u2014 to obtain abortions at up to 24 weeks, raising it from the previous 20 weeks. But the changes did not include single women, causing many to question why the law differentiated on the basis of marital status. \"The artificial distinction between married and unmarried women cannot be sustained. Women must have autonomy to have free exercise of these rights,\" Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud said. The court said denying single women the same access to abortion violated the right to equality before the law under India's Constitution. Abortion rights have been a contentious issue across the world, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court in June overturned the Roe v. Wade judgment which had established a constitutional right to abortion in the country. \"Internationally, judgments affect each other \u2014 and this is a landmark one because it recognizes a woman's right over her body and reproductive freedom regardless of what governments and legislatures might say,\" said Supreme Court of India lawyer Karuna Nundy. The ruling came after an unmarried woman in a consensual relationship was denied an abortion by a lower court in July because she was past 20 weeks in her pregnancy. Later that month, the Supreme Court allowed her to get an abortion up to her 24th week of pregnancy, and on Thursday extended that right to all women.

{"year":"2022","month":"10","event_desc":"13 October - Two bench Supreme Court Panel provided a split decision over the Hijab row, and would be further transferred to a larger CJI led bench.","text":"Home Opinion Editorial Split over hijab: On the Supreme Court verdict The Supreme Court of India\u2019s verdict on the head-scarf case should not lead to denial of education rights Updated - October 14, 2022 03:42 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT A two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court has been unable to resolve the conflict between a girl student\u2019s freedom to wear a head-scarf and the state\u2019s interest in keeping schools a place of equality and secularism. It is unfortunate that a clear verdict did not emerge from the elaborate arguments advanced before the Court for and against the Karnataka government\u2019s bar on the wearing of the hijab . The split verdict perhaps reflects the division in the wider society on issues concerning secularism and the minorities. Justice Hemant Gupta, rejecting the idea that hijab could be worn in addition to the uniform, has held that permitting one community to wear religious symbols to class will be the antithesis of secularism. Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia, on the other hand, has ruled that asking to remove the head-scarf at an institution\u2019s gates is an invasion of their privacy and dignity. The issue is why a head-scarf that does not interfere with the uniform cannot be a matter of choice without being a target of hostile discrimination; and whether the hijab is going to be used to deny girl students their right to education. Justice Dhulia represents this viewpoint when he asserts that discipline should not be at the cost of freedom, when he wonders why a girl child wearing a hijab should be a public order problem and declares that \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 of this practice will be a sign of a mature society. He also empathises with the position of girl students who have to overcome greater odds than boys to get an education. Justice Gupta, on the other hand, has foregrounded equality and discipline as the essential hallmarks of a secular institution in a diverse country, and rules that the Government violates no constitutional principle when enforcing a prescribed uniform. He goes to the extent of saying the constitutional goal of fraternity would be defeated if students are permitted to carry their apparent religious symbols with them to the classroom. The split verdict has given rise to the question of whether matters on which opinions could be sharply divided and have significant political implications should be placed before Division Benches of even number. In the prevailing political climate, the Karnataka government mandating either a prescribed uniform or any dress that was \u201cin the interest of unity, equality and public order\u201d was seen as majoritarian assertion in the garb of enforcing secular norms, equality and discipline in educational institutions. A verdict that legitimises this non-inclusive approach to education and a policy that may lead to denial of opportunity to Muslim women will not be in the country\u2019s interest. Reasonable accommodation should be the course as long as the hijab or any wear, religious or otherwise, does not detract from the uniform. You can read this editorial in Hindi here.

The screenshot of the WhatsApp status of the deceased suspect A.Jameesha Mubin, accessed exclusively by THE WEEK, reveals that Mubin knew he was going to die. The WhatsApp status also indicated that Mubin knew that he was committing mistakes and did not want people around him to remember his failures and shortcomings. The screenshot, written in Tamil and designed like a poster reads, \u201cIf the news of my death reaches you, forgive my mistakes. Hide my shortcomings. Participate in my Janasa. Pray for me.\u201d In Tamil it reads - \u201cYen marana seythi ungalai adainthal Yen thavarugalai manniyungal Yen kuraigalai maraiththu vidungal Yen janasaavil kalandhu kollungal Yenakaga prarthanai seiiyungal.\u201d The Whatsapp status of Mubin has led the agencies to investigate a terror plot angle and whether there were plans to execute explosions at Koniyamman and Kottai Easwaran Temples in Coimbatore. Among the documents seized from his house was a letter, which allegedly had mentions about several landmark locations in Coimbatore including the Collector\u2019s office, railway station, race course and Victoria hall, mentioned under the head, \u201cThe tourist places to be visited,\u201d say sources. The investigation is also carried out based on the documents seized from his house. On Monday, the police arrested five people in connection with the blast-Mohammad Thalka (25), Mohammad Asarudheen (25) of Ukkadam; Mohammad Riyaz (27), Feroz Ismail (27) and Mohammad Navaz Ismail (27) of GM Nagar in Coimbatore. Thalka is reportedly the nephew of banned terrorist organisation Al Ummah chief S.A. Basha, who was involved in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blasts. All five arrested, according to the police, were involved with Mubin in moving a huge gunny bag into the car which exploded. \u201cTwo LPG cylinders and three drums. We have sent (samples) to the forensic department to find out what was there in the drum. They carried the explosive materials from Mubin\u2019s house, knowing what it is. Around 75 kilos of Charcoal, potassium nitrate, aluminium powder and sulphur were there. We have seized the materials and a report has been submitted to the court,\u201d V.Balakrishnan, Coimbatore City Police Commissioner said. All five were arrested based on the CCTV footage recovered near Mubin\u2019s house. They were carrying a gunny bag from Mubin\u2019s house into the car, as seen in the CCTV footage. The stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act has also been invoked on the five arrested and are being interrogated, according to the police. \u201cWe are investigating. Some of the arrested suspects have visited Kerala to meet their accomplices like Mohammed Azharuddin in prison. We will know all this after the investigation. UAPA Act has been invoked. The forensic investigation regarding whatever was there inside the LPG cylinder that exploded is also being done. NIA had conducted an enquiry on a few of those involved in this blast and we have been probing their activities after that. We are looking at all the CCTV footage in and around the scene of crime. A huge volume of CCTV footage has been collected and it is being investigated,\u201d V.Balakrishnan said. However, the car blast, the arrests, the investigation and the fact that the DGP had rushed to the spot, travelling 600 kilometres from Chennai, along with top officials indicates that the blast has shaken the administration. It proved that situation was volatile. The alacrity with which the government reacted has surprised the observers. It was further strengthened by the statement of DGP after visiting the spot wherein he said the explosive materials in the car would have been meant for further planning. The DGP\u2019s statement indirectly admits and almost borders that it was indeed not just an accident, but there was a terror plot. \u201cWe are looking into every possibility because the materials taken from his home may have been meant for a future plan,\u201d Sylendra Babu told during a press conference on Monday. Also, the explosives carried in the gunny bag were similar to the materials used by Zahran Hassim in the Easter bomb attacks in Sri Lanka in 2019. Also, Mubin tried to execute an explosion a few years ago and it was thwarted by Tamil Nadu police. He was then picked up by the NIA in 2019 for his ties with the radical network associated with Zahran Hassim and for his alleged close links with ISIS. The NIA investigated him after he was found to be attending Bayan classes at a mosque in Coimbatore, run by Tamil Nadu Thowheeth Jamath (TNTJ). These classes were closely linked to Mohammed Azharuddin, who is in a prison in Kerala for his links in an IS case. Sources also say that Mubin was an associate of Azharuddin and the former visited the latter in prison along with one of the five arrested. Azharuddin was a Facebook friend of Zahran Hasim, the mastermind of the Sri Lanka bombings. Refuting the intelligence information, TNTJ general secretary R. Abdul Kareem told THE WEEK that Mubin was not in anyway connected to the organisation and that their Bayan classes preach only humanity and not enmity.\u00a0 \"The Bayans conducted in TNTJ are not promoting any such wrongful activities. There is no relationship between Mubin and TNTJ.\u00a0 This is completely baseless. Neither Mubin was known to attend the Bayan classes in TNTJ's Coimbatore masjid, nor do our Bayans promote enmity and violence. TNTJ has been preaching the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad in all its sermons (Bayans) which is totally opposite to the way it is portrayed. Sermons are preaching about humanity, fraternity, self discipline and welfare of others, which are the core concept of Islam and will never lead to any terrorist acts. These sermons are conducted openly for the public, and are not like the secret meetings conducted by the RSS ,\" says Kareem. Meanwhile, six special teams are working in Coimbatore to probe the reasons behind the car blast, to know more about Mubin, if anyone else visited his home in the recent past, his phone call records and his social media activities. Also, senior officials of NIA are camping in Coimbatore and investigating parallelly with Tamil Nadu. Also read Tamil Nadu Governor R.N.

{"year":"2022","month":"09","event_desc":"Lt General Anil Chauhan appointed as the new Chief of Defence Staff.","text":"New CDS a border expert, collector of masks, keen golfer By Rahul Singh , New Delhi Sep 29, 2022 09:34 AM IST Read this news in brief form Share Via Copy Link The 61-year-old general is senior to the three serving chiefs \u2014 General Manoj Pande, Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari, and Admiral R Hari Kumar The country\u2019s new chief of defence staff (CDS), Lieutenant General Anil Chauhan (retd), is known to be an authority on border-related issues, has one of the best collections of masks from around the world in the armed forces, and has a solid golf swing, according to people who have known him from his younger days. Lt Gen Anil Chauhan was commissioned into the 11 Gorkha Rifles, the same regiment as former CDS Gen Bipin Rawat, in 1981.(HT_PRINT) Chauhan is also an author \u2014 his first book Aftermath of a Nuclear Attack was published in 2010, and he has just completed another book, Military Geography of India\u2019s Northern Borders . The 61-year-old general is senior to the three serving chiefs \u2014 General Manoj Pande, Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari, and Admiral R Hari Kumar. He is from the same regiment as his predecessor General Bipin Rawat \u2014 11 Gorkha Rifles. Chauhan is from the 6th battalion of 11 GR, while Rawat was from 5\/11 GR. New rules announced by the govt in June state that the service of CDS can be extended to 65 years. If that be the case, Chauhan will work with six service chiefs to power the theaterisation drive. \u201cAnil is a one of finest military leaders, and has a reputation for getting things done. He is taking on a demanding appointment and will live up to everyone\u2019s expectations. He is mature, intelligent and focused,\u201d said military affairs expert Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan (retd) who is also from 6\/11 GR and has known General Anil Chauhan for almost 45 years. General Shokin Chauhan said the new CDS understands India\u2019s border issues better than most others, with consensus-building one of his strengths, and gave his vote of confidence that the government has picked the right man as Rawat\u2019s successor. He was good at basketball in his younger days, plays golf when he gets the time, and his collection of masks depicting different global cultures is outstanding, he added. Born on May 18, 1961, Anil Chauhan was commissioned into the 11 GR in 1981. He comes with rich operational experience. Chauhan was the Eastern Army commander from September 2019 and held the charge till his retirement in May 2021. He has also served as director general of military operations (DGMO), commanded a corps in the North-East and a division in Kashmir during his 40-year military service. He has also served as a United Nations peacekeeper in Angola. \u201cApart from his deep knowledge and in-depth expertise in border-related issues, he is also a counterterrorism expert. He brings a lot of experience to the table,\u201d said a senior serving officer, who asked not to be named. As officers from the same regiment, Chauhan was known to be close to Rawat who held him in high esteem and valued his expertise, said another officer. When an army base along the China border in Arunachal Pradesh and a key road that supports military movement near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) were named after Rawat earlier this month, Chauhan flew down from Delhi to attend the ceremony. The Kibithu military camp, which looks out over Chinese deployments in the Rima-Tatu area across LAC, was renamed General Bipin Rawat Military Garrison, as was the 22km road stretch linking the base to Walong where outnumbered and outgunned Indian soldiers halted the Chinese war machine during the 1962 war. Chauhan will spearhead the theaterisation drive to best utilise the military\u2019s resources for future wars and operations. The drive slowed down after Rawat\u2019s death and the government will now expect Chauhan to provide impetus to the long-awaited military reform by building consensus among the three services. \u201cChauhan is a soft-spoken man but when he talks, people listen,\u201d said a third officer.

Sermons are preaching about humanity, fraternity, self discipline and welfare of others, which are the core concept of Islam and will never lead to any terrorist acts. These sermons are conducted openly for the public, and are not like the secret meetings conducted by the RSS ,\" says Kareem. Meanwhile, six special teams are working in Coimbatore to probe the reasons behind the car blast, to know more about Mubin, if anyone else visited his home in the recent past, his phone call records and his social media activities.

Three judges on the Constitution Bench, in views which formed both the majority and minority opinions, said the policy of reservation in education and employment cannot continue for an indefinite period. Justice Bela M. Trivedi, who was part of the majority judgment , said reservation policy must have a time span. \u201cAt the end of 75 years of our Independence, we need to revisit the system of reservation in the larger interest of the society as a whole, as a step forward towards transformative constitutionalism,\u201d Justice Trivedi said.

Reservation should not be allowed to become a vested interest. Real solution, however, lies in eliminating the causes that have led to the social, educational and economic backwardness of the weaker sections of the community\u201d. He said \u201clongstanding development and the spread of education\u201d had resulted in tapering the gap between the classes to a considerable extent. Large percentages of Backward Class members attain acceptable standards of education and employment. They should be removed from the Backward categories so that attention could be paid toward those genuinely in need of help. \u201cIt is very much necessary to take into review the method of identification and the ways of determination of Backward Classes, and also, ascertain whether the criteria adopted or applied for the classification of Backward is relevant for today\u2019s conditions,\u201d Justice Pardiwala said.

How long had she been suffering silently at the hands of her tormentor and coping with a toxic relationship? Shraddha had left her home, parents and social milieu for Aaftab, relocating to a new city. She did not heed her parents\u2019 or friends\u2019 advice. When her live-in relationship turned abusive, she chose to bottle up rather than seek help. The stakes were perhaps too high, as one of these abusive episodes ended in her hospitalisation. And if she had ever gathered courage to confront Aaftab, her resolve would have melted away in front of his cajoling\/ intimidation. advertisement Shraddha\u2019s friends claim she feared her life would be snuffed out anytime. It was a late premonition. Data released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in November 2021 says that of the 81,000 women\/ girls killed in 2020, about 58 per cent (47,000) died at the hands of an intimate partner or a family member\u2014a woman or girl killed every 11 minutes in their home. Shraddha was educated and financially independent. The question is why young accomplished women like her have to put up with abusive partners. The answer lies within a system that considers \u2018adjustment\u2019 and \u2018compromise\u2019 as womanly virtues with men having all the prerogatives to be otherwise. Shraddha had even more reason to endure the relationship because having forsaken her family, she had nowhere to go, no one to turn to. advertisement The attitude of forbearance is strong among many abused women, who end up being victims of it in the end. Mahuya Ghosh, a Kolkata-based psychologist who counsels many women enduring abuse at the hands of their partners, says: \u201cWe offer counsel but ultimately it depends on the woman as to how she wants to deal with the situation. In a patriarchal society, it is ingrained in women to think from a man\u2019s point of view. No matter how much we try, abused women tend to be held back by conventional beliefs and stereotyped ideas.\u201d The other reason why a woman silently suffers is the fear of victim-shaming, which is all too common in our society conditioned to judge things from a man\u2019s perspective. A woman as a victim of male abuse\u2014physical or mental\u2014becomes an easy prey for societal dissection. Society suddenly feels responsible to talk about her, pass judgements, sensationalise her story and keep the gossip mill grinding. And in case the woman in question happens to be young, carefree, opinionated or non-conformist, society tends to immediately take an unkindly stand. Her plight is declared a fallout of her decision to go against societal traditions and customs. \u201cWe talk of society having progressed and women becoming liberated. We link empowerment to growing instances of women seeking divorce. But deep down, cases like that of Shraddha Walkar show where things actually stand,\u201d says Ghosh. advertisement Another major reason why abused women dither to open up is that help is uncertain, inaccessible or unreliable. There\u2019s also serious lack of awareness as to where to seek help. So, women continue living in an abusive relationship in the absence of institutionalised support systems. A woman wronged in her private space by people close to her risks becoming an object of pity in public eye should she decide to spill the beans. In rural India and also in fairly large pockets of semi-urban areas, parents want their daughters to \u2018adjust\u2019 rather than go through the stigma of leaving their abusive spouse or seeking divorce. In order to encourage women to break free from their toxic relationships, the need is awareness and an environment for healthy conversation. An ecosystem that is ready to open up, empathise and embrace the troubled souls without being critical.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday unveiled the logo , theme and website for India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s G20 presidency , saying the opportunity to lead the powerful grouping represents a moment of pride for the country as well growing global confidence in it. The PM said while each meeting of a powerful block like G20 has its own diplomatic and geo-political significance, for India the significance of hosting it is much more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndia sees it as a new responsibility and as a measure of the international community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rising confidence in it. Today, there is tremendous curiosity across the globe about India which is now being analysed in a new context. People are studying our current achievements while expressing optimism about our future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Modi. Watch: PM Modi unveils logo, theme and website of India's G20 presidency Modi said Indian philosophy of monism (Advaita) reflects the belief in the essential unity of all living beings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis school of thought can provide a way out of the conflicts and dilemmas which are rife in the contemporary world. The choice of logo and the theme represents India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to promote to reinforce the Buddha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message of peace and Gandhian resistance to violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Referring to the symbol of lotus in the G20 logo \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a choice made on the basis of suggestions from people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he emphasised that it represents hope at the time of crisis and chaos in the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe world is going through the after-effects of a disruptive once-in-a-century pandemic, conflicts and a lot of economic uncertainty. The symbol of the lotus in the G20 logo is a representation of hope in these times. No matter how adverse the circumstances, the lotus still blooms. Even if the world is in a deep crisis, we can still progress and make the world a better place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. India assumed G20 presidency from December 1. Modi said G20 is a group that comprises two-third of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd India is now going to lead and chair this G20 group. You can imagine what a big opportunity has come before the country in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Amrit Kal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Independence. It is a matter of pride for every Indian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The PM located the G20 presidency in the context of his favourite theme of national pride. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis represents the power and potential of 130 crore Indians . It is the journeys undertaken by us over thousands of years, our countless experiences which have helped us reach this stage. During the course, we witnessed achievements and splendour but we also had to endure the dark phase where we remained enslaved for centuries. India has reached this point after having suffered the atrocities inflicted by invaders. As we mark the ascent from those depths, the experience has been the biggest source of our strength,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the PM said as he complimented all governments for contributing to the progress. PM Modi said that the logo of G20 is not just a symbol but a message. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Indian culture, goddesses of both knowledge and prosperity are seated on a lotus. This is what the world needs the most today\u00e2\u0080\u0094 shared knowledge that helps us overcome our circumstances, and shared prosperity that reaches the last person at the last mile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the PM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is why, in the G20 logo, the earth is placed on a lotus too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stay updated with the latest news on Times of India .

On Friday, the BCCI invited applications for the position of national selectors (Senior Men). The last date of application is November 28. BCCI logo and Chetan Sharma NEW DELHI: The BCCI on Friday sacked the entire four-member senior national selection committee led by Chetan Sharma after the Indian cricket team failed to reach the final of the T20 World Cup in Australia. On Friday, the BCCI invited applications for the position of national selectors (Senior Men). The last date of application is November 28. That Chetan will be sacked was first reported by PTI on October 18 after the BCCI AGM but it is learnt that his committee has not even been told about the sacking. The new chairman's job mandate has an interesting description of \"selecting captain in each format\" which suggests that BCCI might be moving towards split captaincy in near future. Chetan (North zone), Harvinder Singh (Centra Zone), Sunil Joshi (South Zone) and Debasish Mohanty (East Zone) have had the shortest stint as senior national selectors in recent times. Joshi and Harvinder were appointed national selectors in February 2020. After the AGM in January 2021, Chetan took over as chairman of selectors with Mohanty and Kuruvilla joining him. A senior national selector normally gets a four-year term subject to extension. There was no selector from West Zone after Abbey Kuruvilla 's tenure ended. Once, India lost in the semifinal of the T20 World Cup, the writing was always on the wall that Chetan was on borrowed time. During Chetan's tenure, India had also failed to reach the knock-out stage in the 2021 edition of T20 World Cup and lost the World Test Championships final. \"For Chetan to save his job, India needed to win the T20 World Cup. Nothing less could have saved him. But once, he was asked to select four squads at one go (New Zealand and Bangladesh away series) which was unprecedented, one could read between the lines,\" a BCCI insider, who has been tracking the developments, told PTI on conditions of anonymity. There are multiple reasons that the BCCI mandarins were unhappy with Chetan and his committee's shoddy performance. It is believed that Chetan was never assertive when it came to certain decisions. Some of the reasons believed to have led to his sacking are: not being able to have a settled squad, allowing eight international captains in just one year with some select seniors turning workload management into a joke, picking KL Rahul after a eight month hiatus from T20 cricket, going on almost each and every India tour but not being able to create a decisive set of players in coordination with team management. No tangible plan as to whether a 37-year-old senior like Shikhar Dhawan would be carried to the 2023 World Cup when he would be above 38 is among the issues that has never been addressed. Chetan and his team could never reward the domestic or IPL performers and pick specialists across two T20 World Cups. Theirs is a committee under whom India have lost two T20 World Cup games by 10 wickets, something that has never happened earlier. That Chetan's days were numbered was understood when he cut a lonely figure during the T20 World Cup in Australia. He never travelled with the team and would stand at a fair distance from head coach Rahul Dravid at the end of bowlers' run-up at the nets. The media in Australia never witnessed any major conversation between the duo. New chairman to select captains in \u00e2\u0080\u009ceach format\u00e2\u0080\u009d, report to Apex Council In what could be a major development, the new selection committee, as and when it takes charge, will be mandated to choose captains across three formats which effectively means that BCCI will be going for split captaincy. This could mean that Rohit Sharma will remain captain in ODIs and Test cricket for the time being while Hardik Pandya becomes the shortest format leader till 2024 T20 World Cup in USA and West Indies. The qualification criteria remained the same. The age cap is 60 years and the incumbent would have to be retired from active cricket for at least five years. He has to play at least seven Test matches or 30 first-class games or 10 ODIs along with 20 first-class games. The job domain has two key points which had never been in any earlier selection committee advertisements -- prepare and provide evaluation report of respective team performance to the Apex Council of BCCI on quarterly basis, and appoint captain for the team in each format. Also for the first time, the BCCI job domain description contains that the chairman would have to address the media with regards to team related queries.

In the picture, Shraddha\u2019s eyes look sad while the lips, with a cut mark, appear to be attempting to break into a smile. How long had she been suffering silently at the hands of her tormentor and coping with a toxic relationship? Shraddha had left her home, parents and social milieu for Aaftab, relocating to a new city. She did not heed her parents\u2019 or friends\u2019 advice. When her live-in relationship turned abusive, she chose to bottle up rather than seek help. The stakes were perhaps too high, as one of these abusive episodes ended in her hospitalisation. And if she had ever gathered courage to confront Aaftab, her resolve would have melted away in front of his cajoling\/ intimidation. advertisement Shraddha\u2019s friends claim she feared her life would be snuffed out anytime. It was a late premonition. Data released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in November 2021 says that of the 81,000 women\/ girls killed in 2020, about 58 per cent (47,000) died at the hands of an intimate partner or a family member\u2014a woman or girl killed every 11 minutes in their home. Shraddha was educated and financially independent. The question is why young accomplished women like her have to put up with abusive partners. The answer lies within a system that considers \u2018adjustment\u2019 and \u2018compromise\u2019 as womanly virtues with men having all the prerogatives to be otherwise. Shraddha had even more reason to endure the relationship because having forsaken her family, she had nowhere to go, no one to turn to. advertisement The attitude of forbearance is strong among many abused women, who end up being victims of it in the end. Mahuya Ghosh, a Kolkata-based psychologist who counsels many women enduring abuse at the hands of their partners, says: \u201cWe offer counsel but ultimately it depends on the woman as to how she wants to deal with the situation. In a patriarchal society, it is ingrained in women to think from a man\u2019s point of view. No matter how much we try, abused women tend to be held back by conventional beliefs and stereotyped ideas.\u201d The other reason why a woman silently suffers is the fear of victim-shaming, which is all too common in our society conditioned to judge things from a man\u2019s perspective. A woman as a victim of male abuse\u2014physical or mental\u2014becomes an easy prey for societal dissection. Society suddenly feels responsible to talk about her, pass judgements, sensationalise her story and keep the gossip mill grinding. And in case the woman in question happens to be young, carefree, opinionated or non-conformist, society tends to immediately take an unkindly stand. Her plight is declared a fallout of her decision to go against societal traditions and customs. \u201cWe talk of society having progressed and women becoming liberated. We link empowerment to growing instances of women seeking divorce. But deep down, cases like that of Shraddha Walkar show where things actually stand,\u201d says Ghosh. advertisement Another major reason why abused women dither to open up is that help is uncertain, inaccessible or unreliable. There\u2019s also serious lack of awareness as to where to seek help. So, women continue living in an abusive relationship in the absence of institutionalised support systems. A woman wronged in her private space by people close to her risks becoming an object of pity in public eye should she decide to spill the beans. In rural India and also in fairly large pockets of semi-urban areas, parents want their daughters to \u2018adjust\u2019 rather than go through the stigma of leaving their abusive spouse or seeking divorce. In order to encourage women to break free from their toxic relationships, the need is awareness and an environment for healthy conversation. An ecosystem that is ready to open up, empathise and embrace the troubled souls without being critical.

Jaipur: Three students preparing for competitive exams in Rajasthan's Kota allegedly died by suicide on Monday. The boys were 16, 17 and 18. Two of the students, Ankush and Ujjwal, were friends from Bihar and were staying in rooms next to each other. One was preparing for his engineering college entrance, while the other was studying to crack the medical college entrance tests. No suicide notes have been found yet. The third student, Pranav, came to Kota from Madhya Pradesh, and was preparing for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) or NEET -- a pre-medical entrance test. Kota, the hub of private coaching centres that provide preparatory classes for competitive engineering and medical examinations, has seen an alarming number of deaths by suicide over the past few years. The deaths highlight the extreme pressure on young men and women to perform well and qualify for India's best colleges. Advertisement Students, including many who prepare for these competitive exams alongside their final two years in school, often complain about high stress. The coaching hub is notorious for pushing students over the edge with long class hours, long assignments, and very competitive internal tests which determine whether a student is promoted or demoted among the many \"batches\". Top batches get the most sought-after teachers. Advertisement In response to widespread media scrutiny of Kota's teen suicides and self-harm cases in the past, the administration had set up a suicide hotline where anxious students could seek counselling. A student in 2016 had called for all coaching centres to be shuttered, before jumping to her death despite having cleared the highly coveted IIT-JEE exam. Advertisement In 2019, the Rajasthan government constituted a state-level committee to prepare a legislative draft for regulation of coaching centres to reduce stress among those studying at such institutes.

This is the second notable incident between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the disputed LAC.

Both sides immediately disengaged from the area: Sources pic.twitter.com\/vQLXcM3xLS \u2014 ANI (@ANI) December 12, 2022 According to some media reports, the clash took place on December 9 i.e. last Friday. News Agency ANI said: On 9th Dec 2022, PLA troops contacted the LAC in the Tawang Sector of Arunachal Pradesh which was contested by Indian troops in a firm and resolute manner. This face-off led to minor injuries to a few personnel from both sides. Both sides immediately disengaged from the area: Sources As a follow-up of the incident, India\u2019s Commander in the area held a Flag Meeting with his counterpart to discuss the issue in accordance with structured mechanisms to restore peace and tranquillity: Sources In certain areas along the LAC in the Tawang Sector in Arunachal Pradesh, there are areas of differing perception, wherein both sides patrol the area upto their claim lines. This has been the trend since 2006: Sources The Hindu, quoting Indian defense officials, writes that in the clash in Tawang, Arunachal, more number of Chinese soldiers were injured than Indian soldiers. This is the first such case after the violent clash between the soldiers of the two countries after the deadly clash in on 15 June 2020 in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh. At that time, 20 Indian soldiers were killed, and China said its 4 soldiers lost their lives. However, till now, no official comment has come from the Government of India. China has also not issued any statement. US Trashed China\u2019s Ambitions In Arunachal China was silent about the McMahan Line as long as the British ruled over India. But with the British exit, China reverted to its expansionist ambitions and claimed Arunachal Pradesh as its territory. China has brought forward no justifiable argument for making such an outrageous claim. Yes, ethnically, the people in Arunachal Pradesh could be part of Mongoloid extraction. But apart from that, there is no historical proof that Arunachal was part of Tibet or China. Physical anthropology is not considered a deciding factor in establishing the nativity of any community. It has to be recalled that in the course of history, substantial human migrations have resulted in group crossbreeding. State boundaries cannot be determined based on ethnicity only. But China is fastidiously holding physical ethnography as the basis of the nativity of a group of people. This is what Beijing says about Eastern Ladakh and other border peripheries also. China is trying to make Arunachal Pradesh a bone of contention between her and India. Throwing to winds the Panchsheel theory of peaceful inter-state relationship endorsed in the Bandung Conference in 1952, China launched a full-throated military incursion into Arunachal Pradesh in 1961 on a flimsy pretext. It was clear that China had expansionist ambition, and she would use military power to realize her ambitions. India was in deep slumber. She did not fathom the real intentions of the Chinese leaders at the Bandung Conference. Nehru\u2019s misplaced idealism had never envisaged an attack from China because Nehru had not only sheepishly conceded Tibet to Chinese aggression but had never strongly and effectively repudiated the claims laid to Arunachal by China. India suffered a defeat at the hands of China. Although China withdrew from the area it had occupied due to the incursion, it never stopped claiming Arunachal Pradesh as disputed land between India and China. Not only that, China began to raise objections to Indian top authorities (Prime Minister, Home Minister, and Defense Minister) paying official visits to Tawang. Even whenever a foreign dignitary visited Tawang, China would raise a hue and cry only to keep the dispute alive. After the 1962 war, while continuing its hostility towards India, China refrained from taking any drastic action to bring the two armies into a confrontational stance along the eastern border. The reason for somewhat lowering its Arunachal-related hostility was the world community\u2019s reaction against her expansionist designs. Moreover, the then Soviet leadership discouraged Beijing from escalating the situation on the Arunachal border. Some observers say that Congress regimes in India soft-paddled with China to buy peace, which was not to be there. File Image: Arunachal Pradesh, a region that China disputes as Indian territory China thought of dovetailing her relationship with India in the background of India-Pakistan relations. China made it clear that the enemy\u2019s enemy is a friend. As such, she decided to befriend Pakistan if she wanted a next-door neighbor to be outrightly hostile to India. The Modi government reviewed India\u2019s China policy, particularly on two counts. One was China\u2019s indirect support to Pakistan-based terrorist organizations and individuals designated by the US. For the third time, China opposed the joint proposal of the US and India at the Security Council to designate the Pakistani terrorist Mir. This attitude stood in direct contrast to Beijing\u2019s Uighur policy. Secondly, the Modi government took serious note of Beijing constantly obstructing India\u2019s membership of the Security Council. The dilly-dallying tactics of the PLA at the dialogue table to resolve the East Ladakh tangle was a recurring phenomenon. Consequently, the Modi government brought about a sea of change in the defense and security perspective concerning Chinese hostility. In a comparatively short time, India raised its defense preparedness by building roads close to the border, inducting more sophisticated weapons, adopting new strategies conducive to higher altitude warfare, upgrading air defense, etc. File Image: K-9 Thunder used in India as K-9 Vajra In the Galwan episode, for the first time, China tasted India\u2019s robust and unassailable military reaction to its oft-repeated clandestine encroachment activity by stealth. Beijing removed its army commander PLA posted on the East Ladakh border and punished some junior officers for failing to push back the Indian troops. It was the PLA\u2019s first acceptance of formidable resistance by the Indians. Coming back to the Arunachal issue, the US has signaled in clear terms that it accepts Arunachal Pradesh as an integral part of the Indian Union. This has come as a shock to Beijing. The announcement has come when Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, and many rumors of a coup in Beijing are making rounds. What the US has said conforms with the known stand of Washington on Arunachal status. The US embassy in New Delhi co-sponsored an event highlighting the culture of the indigenous tribes in the State of Arunachal Pradesh. This was part of India\u2019s ongoing Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations and the seventy-fifth anniversary of Indo-US ties. Three years ago, the US ambassador\u2019s inauguration of the annual Tawang Festival \u2014 a cultural extravaganza in western Arunachal \u2014 enraged Beijing. In October 2016, Richard Verma became the first US ambassador to India to visit Arunachal Pradesh, triggering a volley of angry reactions from China. China has also expressed opposition to US support for some social sector projects and educational programs in the eastern state. The Dalai Lama indicated earlier this month that he would be visiting Arunachal Pradesh \u201csoon.\u201d The Tibetan spiritual leader, an anathema to China\u2019s ruling communists, has visited Arunachal seven times since 1983. His last visit was in 2017. In the final analysis, the international community is convinced that China\u2019s claim to Arunachal Pradesh is part of her expansionist policy. She has already grabbed more than five thousand square kilometers of the Indian Territory in Aksai Chin. Besides that, she coerced Pakistan to cede the Shaksgam Valley, which China needed for laying the railway line to Lhasa in Tibet. China is also disturbing the peaceful atmosphere and normalcy on the Bhutan-China border but cannot achieve its expansionist objective because of resistance from the Indian government. India has to keep a vigil along the entire Sino-Indian Himalayan border and always keep its defense and security to the fullest preparedness.

Infections due to HMPV tend to peak in late winter and spring as it is with other seasonal respiratory illnesses. Preventive measures include practicing hygiene, frequent handwashing, avoidance of close contact with ailing individuals, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Since no antiviral treatment specifically for HMPV exists, supportive care like hydration and fever management helps to improve symptoms. Higher awareness and early intervention would go a long way in managing and reducing the impact of this virus. In infants, HMPV symptoms often mimic those of other respiratory infections and can range from mild to severe. Common symptoms include: Fever: Low-grade to moderate fever. Cough: Persistent and may become severe. Congestion: Nasal stuffiness or runny nose. Difficulty breathing: Rapid or labored breathing, wheezing, and flaring nostrils. Fatigue: Increased irritability and reduced activity. Poor feeding: Difficulty breastfeeding or bottle-feeding due to breathing issues. In severe cases, HMPV can lead to bronchiolitis or pneumonia, requiring medical intervention. Parents should monitor for signs of respiratory distress, such as bluish lips or excessive fatigue, and seek immediate medical care if these occur. Early diagnosis and supportive care are essential for managing HMPV in infants. \"Please know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to worry\" Taking to Instagram the panic around HMPV, Dr Nihar Parekh, Pediatrician, has shared a video and has urged people not to panic. \"The latest scare is HMPV (Human metapneumovirus). With a few cases being reported in India, ripples of panic can be felt. Please know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to worry. HMPV, an existing virus has been present through all the winter flus. As it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mild one, it was never tested for specifically. Now, things are changing! India is testing for HMPV, and the numbers are bound to rise. As it becomes more prominent in your world, make sure you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit the panic button. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a regular cough & cold virus, which unfortunately, like any other respiratory virus, may cause pneumonia or bronchitis in some cases. Take the same precautions you do in case you or your child catch a normal viral. Stay calm, stay safe, sail through this phase,\" he posted on Instagram. Is HMPV similar to COVID? \"HMPV infection is NOT similar to COVID, and can not become a pandemic,\" says Dr Sudhir Kumar, popularly known as the hyderabaddoctor on X. In a series of posts, Dr Kumar talks about HMPV, its prevalence in India and if there is any need to worry about the virus. \"The fact that these infants or their family members had no history of international travel confirms that this infection already exists in India. In fact, HMPV infection is routinely detected in several children suffering from flu every year,\" he writes. Less than 5% of the HMPV cases require hospitalizations he says. Let's not compare HMPV with COVID \"... Let's not compare this (HMPV) with Covid-19 because that was a completely new virus and none of us had immunity against it... HMPV has been described since 2001, and even based on evidence, it dates back to the late 1950s... By the age of 10, the majority of the children develop immunity against this.. .,\" Additional Professor for Internal Medicine in AIIMS Delhi, Dr Neeraj Nischal told ANI. Good diet can help you recover better \u00e2\u0080\u009c...Usually, it will go away in a matter of three to five days. First two days will be severe but after two days your immune system will take over\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Must note, during this time, you have to be careful not to cough on someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, you need to put your elbow on. Please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use your hands because you will be touching things that will help spread the virus. People need to eat at least two fruits in a day, drink three litres of water and reduce physical and mental stress,\" Bengaluru-based physician Dr Ramana Rao told news agency PTI. In India we have seen cases of HMPV in the community \"It is not a new virus and it is commonly seen during winter months predominantly. In India we have seen cases of HMPV in the community. It is commonly seen in children who are below 5 years of age, elderly and immunocompromise individuals. Around 40% patients could be asymptomatic and, in most individuals, it causes a mild flu like illness- mild fever, runny nose, cough, sore throat and wheezing. In few cases pneumonia is reported. There is a paucity of data about its ICU admissions rate and hospitalizations predominantly because it causes mild illness in most individuals who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need hospital admission.\" said Prof. Dr. Rahul Pandit, Chair Critical Care Reliance Foundation Hospital and all other Reliance Foundation Healthcare Initiatives, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital. \"Treatment is predominantly symptomatic; most patients will recover with symptomatic care. If symptoms persist beyond couple of days or worsen it is advisable to seek medical advice and follow it. Self-testing and self-medication should be avoided. A qualified medical practitioner will be able to guide testing and treatment as needed,\" he warned and added, \"There is no specific vaccine available for HMPV. But general respiratory etiquettes shall be reasonably protective if followed in its true spirit. Community awareness about NOT to panic and only follow official ICMR, Ministry of Health and Family welfare or state health ministry guidelines is recommended. Viral messages on social media only add to panic and cause more confusion, hence do not forward such messages.\" States, UTs preparing to tackle the virus In view of the growing cases of HMPV, Delhi authorities have asked hospitals have been instructed to promptly report Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases. Hospitals are required to maintain proper documentation of SARI cases and lab-confirmed influenza cases to ensure accurate monitoring. According to a statement, Dr Vandana Bagga, Director General of Health Services, convened a meeting with chief district medical officers and the state programme officer of IDSP on Sunday to discuss preparedness to address respiratory illnesses in Delhi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith recent reports in the media about the spread of HMPV disease in China, the government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a statement on Jan 4 that HMPV is like any other respiratory virus which causes a common cold and flu-like symptoms during winter season, especially among the younger and older age groups,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Union Health Ministry has said. \"Most cases present with symptoms such as cold, cough, and fever, which are self-limiting and manageable with general medicine at home. Children rarely require hospitalization, as the infection is generally mild,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr Suresh Gupta, pediatrician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital told the media. \"There are no HMPV cases in Andhra Pradesh. The virus, detected in China, does not warrant any panic,\" Public Health and Family Welfare Director K Padmavathi, Andhra Pradesh said in an official press release and stated that the virus spreads from person to person, similar to Covid-19, primarily affecting children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immunity. The Department of Health and Family Welfare Services stated in the official statement that till date there has been no case of HMPV reported in Karnataka. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrently, there is no need to panic regarding the spread of HMPV and the Health Department is monitoring the situation closely in coordination with the Director National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the release stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith recent reports in the media about the spread of HMPV disease in China, the government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a statement on Jan 4 that HMPV is like any other respiratory virus which causes a common cold and flu-like symptoms during winter season, especially among the younger and older age groups,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Department stated. After two girls, aged 13 and 7, from Nagpur, Maharashtra were identified with HMPV, the state government has established a Task Force headed by the JJ Hospital Dean Dr Pallavi Saple to craft standard operating procedure (SOP) and decide on future course of action. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth these girls had cough and fever, their samples have been sent to NIV as they had slightly different symptoms. Both the children did not need to be admitted to the hospital and both the patients have recovered,\" sources told IANS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cParents don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to worry, this virus is not like Corona. It is mild,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Superintendent of Government Medical and Hospital in Nagpur Dr Avinash Gawande. However, he suggested that children should wear masks. Maharashtra Health Minister Prakash Abitkar called an urgent meeting of the department regarding the HMPV virus. It is reported that Union Minister of State for Health Prataprao Jadhav will also be present in this meeting. The minister has urged the people not to panic.

{"year":"2025","month":"01","event_desc":"5 January  An HAL Dhruv helicopter of the Indian Coast Guard crashes during a training flight in Porbandar, Gujarat, killing three crew members.","text":"Coast guard helicopter crashes in Gujarat during training, 3 dead By HT News Desk Jan 05, 2025 06:39 PM IST Share Via Copy Link According to officials, the helicopter experienced technical difficulties, resulting in the crash. An Indian Coast Guard Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Dhruv crashed on Sunday in Gujarat's Porbandar during a routine training sortie, killing three crew members on board. The incident occurred at the Coast Guard Air Enclave in Porbandar. Rescue work underway after a helicopter of the Indian Coast Guard crashed while landing at Porbandar airport (PTI) The helicopter experienced technical difficulties at 12.10 pm, resulting in the crash, officials said. There were three people on board, including the two pilots. All three have been killed in the crash, reported news agency PTI. \"While two of them were declared brought dead, one was alive when brought to the hospital and died later,\" Kamala Baug police station's inspector Rajesh Kanmiya said. Porbandar Superintendent of Police Bhagirathsinh Jadeja said the chopper crashed near the runway and caught fire. The blaze was later brought under control with the help of a fire tender, he said. The three crew members onboard were brought out of the chopper and rushed to a hospital in Porbandar in a severely burnt condition, he said. The Indian Coast Guard is investigating the incident. The incident comes at a time when a critical safety upgrade on the military\u2019s ALH fleet, initiated by HAL after a string of accidents last year, has been completed and the upgraded control system installed on the locally made choppers is expected to improve their airworthiness. The Dhruv fleet, plagued by a nagging design issue, was grounded several times last year after the accidents called into question its flight safety record. Similar horror months ago In September, a Dhruv advanced light helicopter (ALH Mk-III) crashed into the Arabian Sea near Porbandar. In response to the incident, the Coast Guard ordered a one-time safety inspection of its ALH fleet, focusing on the flying controls and transmission system, as per an internal communication obtained by HT. The fleet has been temporarily grounded. The Coast Guard operates 16 ALHs, which are designed and manufactured by Bengaluru-based Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The helicopter was on a medical evacuation mission, responding to an emergency aboard a tanker, when it crashed into the sea about 15 minutes later, around 11:15 pm. The term \"ditching\" refers to an aircraft making an emergency landing in water. This same helicopter had recently played a key role in rescue operations during floods in Gujarat. \"The Indian Coast Guard ALH, which saved 67 lives during the recent cyclonic weather in Gujarat, was launched around 11:00 pm on September 2, 2024, for the medical evacuation of a seriously injured crew member aboard the Indian-flagged motor tanker Hari Leela, about 45 km from Porbandar, in response to a request from the vessel's master,\" the Coast Guard said in a statement.

A total of 6 people have died. some are from Tamil Nadu and some are from Andhra Pradesh.

Tirupati District Collector S Venkateswar on Thursday said that a miscommunication about the opening of the gate led to chaos. \"The gate was initially opened to let one person go as he wasn\u2019t feeling well and then it was closed again. There was commotion among people that gates are being opened so then they rushed towards the gate,\" he said. Who's Responsible For Tirupati Stampede? Speaking about the elaborate arrangement that was made for 'Ekadasi Darshan', TTD Board Member Bhanu Prakash Reddy said that the management had set up 91 counters to control the crowd. \u201c ...To distribute tokens for 'Ekadasi Darshan', we opened 91 counters...it is unfortunate that stampede happened. 6 devotees died in the stampede, 40 have sustained injuries, we are providing best medical facilities possible to them.

There was no organised system for obtaining tokens earlier. The heavy rush caused a stampede, and six members of my family were injured. Male pilgrims rushing for tokens caused injuries to several women, who were later shifted to the hospital.\" Another victim's husband recounted the devastating loss of his wife. \u201cShe was trying to obtain Vaikunta Dwara Darshan tickets when the stampede occurred, resulting in her death.

There were no injuries. The blaze was caused by the explosion of a gas cylinder and was contained by firefighters, police said.

The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started last Monday and is the world\u2019s largest religious gathering. At least 77 million people are attending and authorities expected more than 400 million in total over the next six weeks. Hindus believe that bathing at the confluence will cleanse them of their sins and release them from the cycle of rebirth. To accommodate tens of thousands of holy men, pilgrims and tourists visiting the festival, authorities have built a sprawling tent city on the riverbanks. It\u2019s equipped with 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 toilets and also has roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals.

The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August highlighted once again the chronic issue of violence against women in the country . The trial in the case was fast-tracked through India\u2019s notoriously sluggish legal system and arguments began in November. Judge Anirban Das said the sentence for 33-year-old Sanjay Roy will be announced on Monday and could range from life imprisonment to the death penalty. Police discovered the bloodied body of the woman at the city\u2019s R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital\u2019s seminar hall on Aug. 9. An autopsy later found the victim had been strangled and confirmed sexual assault. Roy was arrested a day after the crime. He has since consistently maintained his innocence and told the court that he was not guilty. The case was initially being investigated by the Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.

Thousands of women across the country also protested on the streets, demanding justice for the victim as they participated in \u201cReclaim The Night\u201d marches. Some protesters called for the perpetrator of the crime to be given the death penalty. The incident highlighted rising sexual violence against women in India and prompted India\u2019s Supreme Court to set up a national task force that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals. Many cases of crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women\u2019s rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing. Still, the number of recorded rape cases in the country has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape \u2014 a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders. The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.","question":"Who was convicted for the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata in August 2024?","answer":"Sanjay Roy, a police volunteer, was convicted for the rape and murder of the trainee doctor.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: As of my last update in August 2024, specific details about the conviction for the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata have not been widely reported or confirmed.

If I can make you work on Sundays, I will be more happy, because I work on Sundays also.\u201d Mr Subrahmanyan then questioned what employees gained from taking time off at home.

The $932 million project includes a second tunnel and a series of bridges and high mountain roads that will link Kashmir with Ladakh, a cold desert region nestled between India, Pakistan and China that has faced territorial disputes for decades. Amid high security, Narendra Modi visited the resort town of Sonamarg where he inaugurated the 6.5-kilometer (4-mile) tunnel. The town denotes the end of the conifer-clad mountains of the Kashmir Valley before Ladakh begins across the rocky Zojila mountain pass. The tunnel, named Z-Morh, will now grant it accessibility for the first time all year round. The second tunnel, about 14 kilometers (9 miles) long, will bypass the challenging Zojila pass and connect Sonamarg with Ladakh and is expected to be completed in 2026. Sonamarg and Ladakh have been plagued with severe snowfalls that close the mountain passes due to massive snowfalls, forcing them to remain cut off from neighboring towns for nearly six months every year. RELATED COVERAGE India suspends water treaty and downgrades ties with Pakistan after deadly Kashmir attack Disputed Kashmir witnesses deadliest attack on civilians in years, sparking fears of rising tensions Vance calls for greater ties with India, hails progress on trade talks Authorities on Monday deployed police and soldiers in the area and established multiple checkpoints at key intersections as an enhanced security measure for the prime minister\u2019s visit. Troops also stationed sharpshooters at several points and carried out drone surveillance to ensure constant vigilance. Modi later at a public meeting, attended by hundreds of people in freezing weather, said the ambitious project would improve road connectivity and boost tourism in the region. The meeting also was attended by some of Modi\u2019s Cabinet ministers and Kashmir\u2019s chief minister Omar Abdullah . Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh while also providing civilians with freedom of movement year-round between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh. In October, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on the tunnel project and injured at least five others. Police blamed insurgents fighting for decades against Indian rule in the region. In 2019, New Delhi stripped Kashmir\u2019s special status as a semi-autonomous region with a separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. The federal government also downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories , Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, the first time in the history of India that a region\u2019s statehood was downgraded to a federally administered territory. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Indian and Chinese soldiers have been engaged in a military standoff in Ladakh since 2020 even as Beijing and New Delhi agreed in October on patrols in disputed areas. Both countries have stationed tens of thousands of soldiers along their frontier, backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets.

Her family had already resolved to depart the festival and were on the move when a surging crowd spilled over police cordons, knocking her to the ground, trampling her and breaking her leg. \"The atmosphere was festive but... just when we were about to leave we lost our balance with all the pushing and shoving,\" relative Anita Gupta, keeping vigil by Parvati's bedside, told AFP. Both women had travelled to the Kumbh Mela on a train overflowing with pilgrims, arriving in the northern city of Prayagraj hours after schedule and forced to sleep in the open after they were unable to find a room. Anita credited a group of men for saving them from death after they formed a protective cordon around the pair when the throng began to swell. A pilgrim weeps outside a hospital after a deadly stampede during the Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj, India \u00a9 Niharika KULKARNI \/ AFP But her account of those moments, matched by others in the ward, suggested serious safety lapses and a hapless official response to a stampede that killed at least 30 people. Anita said that several routes leading from the riverside had been blocked by police, causing the chaos and overcrowding that led to the accident. Gauri Sharma, another woman wounded in the crush, said blame rested squarely on the shoulders of festival organisers. \"Authorities had closed off some routes, leaving us stuck in one place,\" she told AFP. \"Then the entire crowd piled up, with people pushing and pressing against each other.\" 'Attained salvation' An injured pilgrim is taken to a hospital after a stampede during the Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj, India \u00a9 Niharika KULKARNI \/ AFP Wednesday marked one of the holiest days in the six-week Kumbh Mela, and authorities seemed determined not to let the deadly stampede dampen festivities. Millions of people have participated in sacred bathing rituals as normal and periodic police briefings on Wednesday refused to confirm deaths while downplaying the severity of the accident. \"There was no stampede. It was just overcrowding due to which some devotees got injured,\" police officer Rajesh Dwivedi said at one briefing nearly 12 hours after the fatal crush. An official statement issued that evening credited police at the scene for quickly bringing the situation under control and ambulances for swiftly attending to the injured. \"Eyewitnesses praised the swift action\" of police, saying that \"their timely intervention prevented a major disaster\", the statement said. Police finally confirmed that 30 people had been killed and dozens more injured nearly 18 hours after the stampede, once the sun had set and the day's bathing was drawing to an end. Several present at the stampede said they believed the police toll was likely understated. \"I am sure that more people died,\" Anita said. Many were also quick to dismiss the official account of the response to the accident. \"Why couldn't they have prepared better?\" Prayagraj resident Rahul Shukla told AFP. \"Everyone knew well in advance that the festival would host more than 100 million people.\" The 27-year-old said he was grieved by the deaths. But, he added, \"those who died at such a holy spot must have immediately attained salvation\". \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

(Representational) Bhopal: Security forces gunned down 31 Maoists in an encounter in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district today, the police said. The encounter began deep inside the forest in the Indravati National Park area when a security team was conducting an anti-Maoist operation. Two security personnel have been killed in the gunfight. According to a government statement, two security personnel have also been injured. They are out of danger and have been evacuated for treatment. Announcing the news in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Union Home Minister Amit Shah reiterated his \"resolve\" to root out Maoists by March 31, 2026. Expressing his condolences for the two soldiers who lost their lives, he wrote, \"This country will always be indebted to these heroes\". A rough translation of his Hindi post read: \"In the direction of making India Naxal-free, the security forces have achieved a major success in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh. In this operation, along with killing 31 Naxalites, a large amount of weapons and explosives have also been recovered. Today we have lost two of our brave soldiers in ending anti-human Naxalism. This country will always be indebted to these heroes. I express my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyred soldiers. Also, I reiterate my resolve that before 31 March 2026, we will root out Naxalism from the country, so that no citizen of the country has to lose his life due to it\".

Following the gunfight, the forces found the bodies of 31 rebels in fatigues. They also recovered a large number of firearms, including AK 47 rifles, Self Loading Rifles and INSAS, and grenade launchers. Explosives were also recovered. Officials have said the Maoists killed in the gunfight are being identified. A search operation is on and more forces have been rushed to the encounter site, officials said. Mr Shah had reiterated his resolve on January 6 after eight District Reserve Guard personnel and their driver were killed when their vehicle was blown up by Maoists in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur. According to Chhattisgarh Police, so far this year, 49 Maoists have been killed in the state in separate encounters. Of them, 33 were killed in the Bastar division that comprises seven districts, including Bijapur. On January 20-21, the police said, 16 Maoists were killed in an encounter with security personnel in Raipur division's Gariaband district.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"5 February  2025 Delhi Legislative Assembly election The Bharatiya Janata Party wins a two-thirds majority in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.","text":"Modi's BJP wins big in high-stakes Delhi election 8 February 2025 Share Save Nikita Yadav, Zoya Mateen and Soutik Biswas BBC News, Delhi Share Save Getty Images The victory is a shot in the arm for Prime Minister Modi's BJP Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party will form the government in Indian capital Delhi for the first time in 27 years as it scripted an impressive election victory. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won or is leading in 48 seats in the 70-member legislative assembly, while the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is ahead in 22 seats, according to data from the Election Commission of India (EC). A party that wins more than the halfway mark of 35 seats can form the government. \"Development wins, good governance triumphs,\" Modi wrote on X, adding his party would leave \"no stone unturned\" in developing Delhi . In a video message on X, the AAP's former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he and his party \"humbly accepted\" the verdict of the people and congratulated the BJP on its win. \"I hope they live up to the expectations of the people who voted for them,\" he said. The election was a battle of prestige for both the BJP and AAP, given Delhi's symbolic importance as the country's capital. The city, a federally-administered territory, had been governed by the AAP since 2013, with voters backing its strong record of welfarism. But the party and its leaders have faced several challenges recently, with leaders embroiled in corruption allegations which they have denied. For the BJP, securing Delhi represents more than just electoral success - it marks a crucial foothold in the nation's capital after being out of power there since 1998. The party threw resources at the Delhi campaign, with Modi as well as Home Minister Amit Shah attending events. Congress, the main opposition party at the national level, was also in the race, but did not win even one seat. The party governed Delhi from 1998 to 2013, but was ousted over allegations of corruption that saw voters turn to AAP instead. It has failed to make a mark since. Getty Images More than 60% of eligible voters in Delhi cast their ballot in the election this week Experts say the win in politically crucial Delhi will reinforce Modi's popularity among Indian voters after his party lost its outright majority in last year's general election . The defeat is a big blow to the AAP, a much smaller party praised in its early years in power for focusing on improving education and health facilities in the city. It also governs Punjab state, but retaining Delhi would have been a triumph for the beleaguered party now facing questions about its future. After more than a decade in power in Delhi, AAP's appeal has waned, especially among the middle-class, which was once drawn to Kejriwal's anti-corruption stance. Kejriwal, once a champion of the middle-class-led anti-corruption movement, had pivoted to becoming the party of the poor - it is not yet clear when the poor and Delhi's struggling working class abandoned him. Corruption allegations, the jailing of key leaders and Kejriwal's own arrest damaged AAP's campaign, creating a vacuum the BJP swiftly filled. Backed by vast resources and a powerful electoral machine, the BJP's \"double-engine\" pitch - where state and federal governments are ruled by the same party - promised stability and better governance. This is a historic victory - BJP's first Delhi majority in almost 30 years. Its \"Parivartan\" (change) message struck a chord, but its political and financial muscle sealed the landslide win. Fresh off wins in the states of Haryana and Maharashtra, this cements BJP's resurgence after last year's general election setback. With Delhi slipping away, the fragmented opposition is in disarray, while the BJP enters the next electoral cycle with a clear upper hand. On Saturday, the biggest upsets for AAP included top leaders Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia losing in the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, respectively. Incumbent Chief Minister Atishi managed only a narrow victory from the Kalkaji constituency. More than 60% of eligible voters cast their ballots. Most exit polls had predicted an absolute majority for the BJP, although such predictions have gone wrong in the past. EPA AAP's defeat is a blow to former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal (left) and Atishi (right), who took charge after his resignation Much of the BJP campaign targeted Kejriwal , an anti-graft activist, who - along with Sisodia - had been jailed over the past two years in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy. Both leaders, who deny all the charges, separately got bail last year after spending months in jail . Kejriwal has accused Modi's party of carrying out a \"political vendetta\" against him and the AAP, which the BJP denies. Delhi has a unique governance structure. Key decisions related to public order, police and land are taken by the lieutenant governor (LG) who is appointed by the federal government. The state legislature handles matters including education, health and public services. This division has often caused friction between the federal government and state legislature when they are run by rival parties. The power structure was also a reason why the election campaigning in Delhi was more focused on welfare than on political or identity issues, which play a larger role in elections elsewhere in the country. The AAP and BJP campaigns both promised improvements to public schools and free healthcare services, as well as cash handouts to women. Meanwhile, the BJP hoped for a boost from last week's federal budget , which slashed income tax for the salaried middle class, a key voting bloc in the capital. One topic, however, remained largely off the agenda during the bitter weeks-long campaign - Delhi's perennial air pollution crisis, which affects the city of more than 30 million for much of the year. The BJP had promised to reduce the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) by half by 2030 if it won, and other parties also made references to the crisis in their manifestos.

The raids began on Friday in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city. Police said in a post on the social media platform X that they acted \u201cbased on credible intelligence regarding the clandestine sale and distribution of literature promoting the ideology of a banned organization\u201d and seized 668 books. According to booksellers, the seized books were mostly published by New Delhi-based Markazi Maktaba Islami Publishers, which is affiliated with the Indian branch of one of the largest Islamic and political organizations in the Indian subcontinent, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. Indian authorities banned Jamaat-e-Islami in Kashmir as an \u201cunlawful association\u201d in Feb. 2019, months before New Delhi ended the region\u2019s semi-autonomy in Aug. 2019. In New Delhi\u2019s effort to shape what it calls \u201cNaya Kashmir,\u201d or a \u201cnew Kashmir,\u201d the territory\u2019s people have since been largely silenced as India has shown no tolerance for any form of dissent. Most of the books seized were authored by Abul Ala Maududi, a prominent twentieth-century Islamic scholar and founder of Jamaat-e-Islami who advocated integration of state and religion. RELATED COVERAGE Indian-controlled Kashmir has been the scene of many violent attacks in past decades India suspends water treaty and downgrades ties with Pakistan after deadly Kashmir attack Disputed Kashmir witnesses deadliest attack on civilians in years, sparking fears of rising tensions Booksellers in Srinagar said police officers passed by their stores, ordering them to surrender any books by Maududi and to stop selling them in the future. One shopkeeper said he told them the books were available across India and on online platforms, but they refused to entertain any argument and confiscated the books. More books were seized as police teams also carried out raids in some other parts of Kashmir and conducted \u201cstringent checks\u201d of bookshops \u201cto prevent the circulation of banned literature linked to Jamaat-e-Islami,\u201d a police statement said on Saturday. \u201cThese books were found to be in violation of legal regulations, and strict action is being taken against those found in possession of such material,\u201d police said. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety, while militants in the Indian-controlled portion have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists that militancy in Kashmir is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Jamaat previously sided with the armed rebellion against Indian rule, but in the late 1990s it said it distanced from it and instead advocated political means. During the time, when the rebellion and counterinsurgency measures were at peak, many Kashmiris were detained for keeping such literature. In response, some people got rid of the books while others buried them to protect themselves during anti-rebel raids. In 2011, authorities filed charges against Kashmir education officials over a textbook for first graders that illustrated the word \u201ctyrant\u201d with a sketch resembling a police official. Praveen Donthi, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said the most recent crackdown \u201creeks of naivete\u201d and potentially could give such literature new traction by making Kashmir\u2019s alienated youth curious about the works. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult to find a soft copy of the same,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a time when New Delhi has been trying to project normalcy and stability, the optics of this move don\u2019t do any good to its democratic credentials.\u201d The crackdown on books has been widely criticized in Kashmir. Several Jamaat leaders who contested a recent local election in Kashmir called the seizure of these books \u201cunjust, unconstitutional and a violation of fundamental rights.\u201d In a statement, they said the seized books were legally published in New Delhi and were being lawfully distributed to bookstores across the region. \u201cIf the government has any security concerns, we are fully prepared to cooperate with any investigation,\u201d the statement added. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , a key resistance leader in Kashmir, called the police operation \u201ccondemnable\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cPolicing thought by seizing books is absurd to say the least, in the time of access to all information on virtual highways,\u201d Mirwaiz said in a statement.","question":"What action did police in Indian-controlled Kashmir take against bookstores in February 2025?","answer":"Police raided bookstores and seized 668 books linked to the banned Islamic organization Jamaat-e-Islami.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: In February 2025, police in Indian-controlled Kashmir raided several bookstores and seized books that were deemed to promote separatist sentiments or were considered inflammatory.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"10 February  Ranveer Allahabadia's remarks on the show India's Got Latent sparks nation-wide outrage and debate on free speech and laws on obscene content on social media.","text":"YouTuber's 'dirty' comments spark massive row in India 19 February 2025 Share Save Cherylann Mollan BBC News, Mumbai Share Save BeerBiceps\/YouTube Ranveer Allahbadia, also known as BeerBiceps, is a popular Indian podcaster \"Dirty.\" \"Perverted mind.\" \"Disgusting.\" These were the words India's Supreme Court used on Tuesday while granting interim protection from arrest to a popular YouTuber who has been in the eye of a storm in the country over the past week. The furore began after Ranveer Allahbadia - whose YouTube channel BeerBiceps has eight million followers - asked a contestant the question: \"Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\" The comments, made on the show India's Got Latent on 9 February, sparked  massive outrage, police cases and even death threats. YouTube quickly removed the episode, but that didn't stall the tide of anger directed at Allahbadia and the show. In fact, the amount of attention the incident has received is mind-boggling: it has made national headlines, been covered on primetime TV and some of India's most prominent news sites have even run live pages. Not surprising, considering the star status of Allahbadia. He has interviewed federal ministers, top Bollywood celebrities, cricketers and Hollywood actors. And last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed him a \"National Creators Awards\" trophy. Since the controversy erupted, Allahbadia and the show's creator, Samay Raina, have apologised for the comments and Raina has taken down all previous episodes of the show. The Supreme Court in its recent order has even banned Allahbadia from posting content on social media. But the incident continues to make news. \"It feels like the state is trying to make an example out of Allahbadia,\" says Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation. Saket Gokhale, an opposition lawmaker, also condemned the targeting of Allahbadia and the show. \"Crass content can be criticised if it offends you. However, you cannot have the state  persecute and lock up people for offending your 'moral sentiments',\" he wrote in a post on X. Popular comedian Vir Das also weighed in on the controversy and criticised news channels for their one-dimensional coverage of the incident and for taking a disparaging view of all digital content. Allahbadia's remarks and the subsequent backlash have triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity laws; it has also sparked conversations around the thirst for viral content and the consequences its makers face when their content crosses lines upheld by the very people who watch it. Getty Images The latest controversy has triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity law Raina's show, which debuted in June, has been popular from the start, with each episode being viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube. And it hasn't shied away from kickstarting controversies either. The show has platformed some bizarre performances and judges and contestants have been seen making crass and crude comments more than a few times. Critics have accused the show of spewing misogynistic views and for body-shaming guests. A popular fashion influencer once walked out of the show after a male contestant compared her to a former adult film actress while another asked her about her \"body count\" (a slang term for the number of sexual partners a person has had). But that seems to have been the appeal of the show too. Fans of the show have hailed it for championing \"raw talent and unfiltered jokes\". Some have said that they liked the roasts - a form of insult comedy - which was popular on the show. Experts have underscored how , with the entertainment landscape exploding, digital content creators often feel compelled to push the envelope - even if it means resorting to the risqu\u00e9 and lewd - just to gain views and virality. It's safe to say the show pushed the envelope and the buttons of many. But then, it backfired. Samay Raina\/YouTube Samay Raina is a popular stand-up comedian in India \"A lot of comedy, especially of a certain masculine kind, is cruel and punches down on people. It has a violent undercurrent. So if you contribute to that culture, it's not a shock if it comes back to bite you some day,\" filmmaker Paromita Vohra says. She adds that successful comedy calls for a fine-tuned awareness of the audience it is being performed for and what boundaries it can push. Interestingly, Allahbadia's question, which sparked the furore, was almost identical to the question asked by the host of an Australian comedy show called OG Crew's Truth or Drink. While the question didn't spark outrage in Australia, it has in India. \"The internet has made it possible for content to reach spaces and people it was not organically playing to. Unthinkingly appropriating content can have unexpected consequences,\" she says. But she also says that there's a need to guard against making such issues a question of morality. \"When such controversies erupt, there is always the risk of morality being weaponised to punish people who have gone against what's accepted by society,\" she says and adds that morality is increasingly being beaten into the legal framework of the country, which can have a divisive effect. Some critics have also accused the authorities of using the controversy as a smoke screen to divert attention from other pressing problems - like unemployment and pollution. Some fear that it will be used by the federal government as a reason to justify further regulating content creation. After the controversy, a report by NDTV news channel stated that a parliamentary panel was considering making laws around digital content stricter. The Supreme Court too has pushed for more regulations around online content. Mr Gupta says the state already has a \"tremendous amount of power\" to prosecute people accused of flouting various data and content laws and that while the state exercises its powers without restraint, content creators don't have as many legal safeguards to protect them. \"Instead of tighter laws, we need more reform; existing legal standards need to be more tolerant of free expression,\" he says. \"Other systems, like education and digital learning should be strengthened so that young people know to get their education from the classroom, and turn to the internet only for entertainment.\" YouTubers Asia Social media influencers India","question":"What controversial question did Ranveer Allahbadia ask on the show India's Got Latent in February 2025?","answer":"He asked a contestant, \"Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\"","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: The question you've asked seems to be based on a fictional or hypothetical scenario, as there is no known show called \"India's Got Latent\" and no record of Ranveer Allahbadia asking a controversial question on such a show in February 2025.

Former party student leader Rekha Gupta, 50, was named New Delhi chief minister, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad announced. The party won the most seats in the high-stakes New Delhi polls earlier this month for the first time in 27 years. With 48 seats in the 70-member local assembly, Bharatiya Janata Party ousted the Aam Aadmi Party , which won 22 seats. Gupta thanked the party and said she would work hard to meet the challenges ahead. She faces significant tasks in tackling air and river pollution and poor infrastructure in the Indian capital. Before elections, her party had offered to revamp government schools, give free health services, free electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,500 rupees ($29) to poor women in Delhi. Gupta is the fourth female chief minister in Delhi, but it is still rare for Indian political parties to name women to top positions. The only other woman who is chief minister of a state currently is West Bengal\u2019s Mamata Banerjee, of the All India Trinamool Congress party. RELATED COVERAGE India blames Pakistan for a deadly attack in Kashmir and suspends a key water treaty Vance calls for greater ties with India, hails progress on trade talks Militants kill at least 26 tourists at a resort in Indian-controlled Kashmir A law for India\u2019s legislatures to have 33% female membership is expected to be implemented by 2029. Women hold about 14% of parliamentary seats now, India\u2019s highest proportion since independence but far below the global average of 26.5%. Gupta, a former BJP general secretary, started out as a student leader at Delhi University in 1992. She is known for initiatives on the welfare of women and children, as well as support for impoverished female students. The BJP has not run Delhi for over a quarter of a century. It yielded power to the Congress party that ruled Delhi from 1998 to 2013, until the AAP burst onto the scene on an anti-corruption platform. The party\u2019s victory was a boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year\u2019s national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning three state elections in northern Haryana and Delhi and western Maharashtra. Ahead of the election earlier this month, the BJP slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class , one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget. The AAP suffered a major setback when its founder and leader Arvind Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two other party officials on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusation, claiming it was a part of a political conspiracy. Kejriwal and the two others were later released on bail by the Supreme Court and Kejriwal subsequently stepped down as Delhi chief minister.","question":"Who was named as the Chief Minister of Delhi by the BJP in February 2025?","answer":"Rekha Gupta was named as the Chief Minister of Delhi by the BJP in February 2025.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information available about who will be named as the Chief Minister of Delhi by the BJP in February 2025.

Singh, from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quit on Sunday after facing months of pressure to step down. Ethnic clashes broke out between the state's majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities in May 2023 over economic benefits, land rights and job quotas. More than 250 people have been killed in the conflict and tens of thousands displaced. The state hit the global headlines in July 2023 when a video showing two women being paraded naked by a mob went viral, sparking outrage in India. While the scale of unrest has reduced since the peak in 2023, divisions between the communities persist and violent incidents continue to occur. Singh's position had become increasingly untenable in recent months with Kuki groups accusing him of favouring the Meitei community, of which he is a member - an accusation he denied. Media reports said there was also rising discontent against him within the BJP. BJP leaders tried but failed to agree on someone to replace him as chief minister. On Thursday evening, the office of President Droupadi Murmu announced that federal rule - known as President's rule in India - had been imposed in the state. \"After receiving a report from the governor and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India,\" the statement said. Manipur's last assembly session was held in August and Monday was set to be the first day of the new session, but federally-appointed governor Ajay Bhalla released a statement declaring the session \"null and void\". Earlier, opposition Congress party members had said they would bring a no-confidence motion against the chief minister during the session. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told the ANI news agency that Singh resigned as he sensed the motion would be passed. Ramesh called for federal Home Minister Amit Shah to resign. Opposition leaders have also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has not visited the state since the violence began. Meanwhile India's Supreme Court is hearing a plea against Singh filed by a Kuki organisation which accuses him of playing a direct role in fuelling the violence. The petitioners have submitted leaked audio tapes to back up their claims. The court has sought a forensic report on the tapes before the next hearing. Singh has denied any wrongdoing. What is the Manipur conflict? The conflict involves the state's two largest ethnic groups, the majority Meitei and minority Kuki, and their battle over land and influence. Tensions boiled over in May 2023 when Kukis began protesting against demands from the Meiteis to be given official tribal status. The Kukis argued this would strengthen the Meiteis' already strong influence on government and society, allowing them to buy land or settle in predominantly Kuki areas. But there are myriad underlying reasons. The Kukis say a war on drugs waged by the Meitei-led government is a screen to uproot their communities. Since the violence, Manipur has been divided into two camps, with Meiteis inhabiting the Imphal Valley and the Kukis living in the surrounding hill areas. Borders and buffer zones guarded by security forces and community members separate the two regions. Efforts to hold peace talks between the communities by federal and state officials have so far failed to end the conflict.

Around 50 workers had been working inside the 43km (26.7-mile)-long tunnel, located in Nagarkurnool district, when a part of its roof caved in early Saturday morning. Officials say 43 of them managed to come out safely but efforts to reach the remaining eight men have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil, mud and slush inside the tunnel. They have also been unable to establish contact with the trapped men, or provide them with oxygen and other essential supplies. Jupally Krishna Rao, a state minister overseeing the rescue effort, told PTI news agency that \"the chances of their survival are very remote.\" On Monday an expert team of \"rat-hole miners\" - people trained in narrow tunnel navigation - arrived to clear the debris and get to the workers. The same team had sucessfully rescued 41 construction workers trapped in a tunnel after a landslide in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in 2023. Approximately 33km of excavation has been completed so far and roughly 10km remain, officials said on Tuesday. Rescuers are using a train to get to a point from where they need to climb on to a conveyor belt to remove the debris. Reports say they are also continuously pumping out water to ensure oxygen supply within the tunnel. But the rough terrain of the region has slowed them down. As rescue efforts continue, families of the trapped workers - most of whom are daily wage workers - are anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. \"I just hope that this time my son comes back safe. I will never send him away to earn again,\" said Rampratap Sahu, a resident of Jharkhand state.

The accident took place after a slab of concrete covering seepage on the roof slipped and fell off. At least a dozen workers were injured in the chaos. The tunnel is part of the longest-running irrigation project of the Telangana government. Located in a hilly forested area, it passes through the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam tiger reserve which is the largest in India. Officials said construction work had resumed just four days before the accident, after a gap of almost three years. Various relief teams, including personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, firefighters and soldiers from the Indian army, are at the spot. Officials told BBC Telugu that a team of firefighters was the first to go inside on Sunday. \"We covered 11km by train, 2km by conveyor belt and the remaining distance on foot,\" an official, who wanted to stay anonymous, said. \"But then we hit a roadblock.\" \"There were tall mounds of mud and soft soil. The boring machine that was being used by the workers lay upside down, blocking all passage beyond.\" The rescuers said they were forced to return from that point as they did not have the necessary tools and machines to clear the slush. \"We shouted and screamed, whistled and pointed torches, hoping for a response but didn't hear anything.\" Relatives of some of the trapped men are now desperately hoping for a miracle. \"When I left home, my wife held me, wept and said, do not come back empty handed.

In a letter seen by the BBC from India's Drugs Controller General, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi said permission to manufacture and export the drugs had been withdrawn BBC Eye found one pharmaceutical company, Aveo, had been illegally exporting a harmful mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire. India's Food and Drug Administration said the company's factory in Mumbai had since been raided and its entire stock seized. The circular from Dr Raghuvanshi, dated to Friday, cited the BBC investigation in his decision to ban all combinations of tapentadol and carisoprodol, which was to be implemented with immediate effect. He said this also came after officials had looked into \"the potential of drug abuse and its harmful impact on population\". Tapentadol is a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant so addictive it is banned in Europe. Carisoprodol is approved for use in the US, but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia and hallucinations. The combination of the two drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world as they can cause breathing difficulties and seizures and an overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. Nigerian authorities store illegal drugs they have seized - mostly opioids - in a warehouse in Lagos Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, has shipped millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. The BBC World Service also found packets of these pills with the Aveo logo for sale on the streets of Nigeria, and in Ivoirian towns and cities. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. As part of the investigation, the BBC also sent an undercover operative - posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria - inside one of Aveo's factories in India, where they filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. Filmed secretly, Vinod Sharma said Aveo's cocktail drug was \"very harmful\", adding \"this is business\". In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma in response replies \"OK,\" before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding that \"nowadays, this is business\". Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals did not respond to a request for comment when the BBC's initial investigation was published. India's Food and Drug Administration said a sting operation saw Aveo's entire stock seized and further production halted in a statement on Friday. Further legal action will be taken against the company, it added. The agency said it was \"fully prepared\" to take action against anyone involved in \"illegal activities that tarnish the reputation of the country\".

Rajesh Abraham Updated on : 21 Feb 2025, 12:30 am 5 min read Copied Follow Us Kerala means business. That will be the state\u2019s message at the two-day Invest Kerala Global Summit, which begins in Kochi on Friday. While the Left government may be under pressure to show concrete outcomes at the end of the investor meet on Saturday, the real difference the event aims to bring about is a change in the outside world\u2019s perception of Kerala\u2019s business environment. \u201cBasically, the Invest Kerala Global Summit is a strategic campaign to communicate that ours is an investor-friendly place. We [the state] have a past, and the past is history,\u201d says V K Mathews, executive chairman of the IBS Group. \u201cWe are different now, and for that, we have made changes for the better. And the summit is a platform to convey this message.\u201d Workers give final touches to an interactive touch wall set up at the venue TP SOORAJ@The New Indian Express.Kochi. Mathews, who founded IBS nearly three decades ago in Thiruvananthapuram with just 55 employees, has grown the company into one of the largest IT product firms in the country, with around 3,000 employees and over 200 clients worldwide. He points out hosting a grand summit alone will not draw big-ticket investment. \u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cNo company, including IBS, will make investments just because there\u2019s an investment summit. IBS has invested in 11 countries, and that\u2019s not the way we make decisions. People attend investor summits to know more about a place.\u201d C J George, founder of Geojit Financial Services, echoes this view. \u201cThe investor summit is a big platform for messaging. The current environment appears conducive for investment in Kerala,\u201d he says. \u201cThe social infrastructure is at the highest level, including the ease of doing business, irrespective of the political controversy (that followed a recent article by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in TNIE praising Kerala).\u201d George, who founded the stockbroking company in Kochi in 1987, now employs over 3,000 people across the country, including about 1,000 to 1,200 in Kerala. Geojit\u2019s success has been remarkable, considering that stockbroking is mostly operated from Mumbai. Notably, Geojit\u2019s key functions, such as its data centre and risk management, are located at its Kochi head office. \u201cWe get good-quality talent here. We never had any problems,\u201d he says, declaring a strong vote of confidence in the state as an investment destination \u201cIf you ask me to start another company, I would do so in Kerala.\u201d Notably, several business leaders highlight that they are \u201chappy in Kerala\u201d as hartals, trade union issues and strikes do not haunt them anymore. \u201cGenerally, there is a peaceful environment,\u201d says one of them. Another success story from the state, Paul Thomas, MD and founder of ESAF Small Finance Bank, notes \u201ca paradigm shift\u201d in Kerala: society\u2019s evolving approach towards business. \u201cIn my view, there is an overall positive environment for business in Kerala. As a society, we have started celebrating entrepreneurship,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe Kerala is well on its way to becoming a global hub for innovation. The state\u2019s startup ranking is prime testimony that we are growing in the right direction. Initiatives such as Invest Kerala can help build the state into a prosperous, sustainable, and inclusive economy.\u201d According to Viju Jacob, managing director of Kochi-based Synthite, the world\u2019s largest oleoresins (spice extracts) maker, the Invest Kerala summit is a \u201ckey moment\u201d in the state\u2019s economic development. \u201cI have been watching the massive drive led by (Industries Minister) P Rajeeve and his team to transform the state into a business- and industry-friendly destination,\u201d he says. Canopies arranged near the expo venue TP SOORAJ@The New Indian Express.Kochi. About 80 to 90 per cent of the world\u2019s oleoresins comes from India, and Kerala accounts for its entire production. Within this sector, the state dominates globally, with about 40 per cent of the world market held by Synthite. Other major Kerala-based players include Plant Lipids, Mane Kancor Ingredients, and Akay Group \u2013 all headquartered in Kochi. \u201cFirst, second, third, fourth, and fifth in oleoresins are all from Kerala,\u201d Viju points out. He adds that dwelling on the past would lead nowhere. \u201cEveryone has a past, present, and future. Looking at the future, this government is undertaking a massive drive to increase businesses in Kerala,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government appears to be seeking to convey the message that the old Kerala is a thing of the past. They want to assert that this is a new Kerala, and this is our new and changed approach\u2026 that the government will support businesses and industries wholeheartedly for the state\u2019s development and job creation. Let\u2019s not look at the past when someone is ready to make the change.\u201d Will we see big-ticket announcements? \u201cI see that a lot of work, including the roadshows, has been done,\u201d says George of Geojit. \u201cDelegations from Kerala met many business people and industrialists. They were given presentations, approvals were made easier, particularly, if the investment is of significant amount. So, there is an expectation of some announcements of new investments at the Summit.\u201d He believes IT, electronics, precision electronics, and industry that don\u2019t need huge tracts of land are the sectors that could attract investments in Kerala. \u201cSectors that are non-polluting and environment-friendly,\u201d he adds. According to Mathews of IBS, the existing companies may announce their expansion plans at the summit. \u201cIn two days, we are not only seeing and interacting with the state ministers and bureaucrats, but also engaging the other potential investors,\u201d he says. \u201cThere will be more information sharing. Each company has their own investment strategy departments. They will study the possibilities and make the decisions.\u201d Viju, meanwhile, reveals that Synthite is looking to expand into supplements. \u201cWe will make that expansion in Kerala,\u201d he says. Green sheen A key factor that business leaders point out is that the state is suitable for environment-friendly industries. The militant labour and environment activism that the state witnessed during the early 1980s ensured that there was little scope for polluting industries here. Looking back, this suited the geography of the state, which has high population density. And, this proved to be a blessing in disguise. This is a point that Rajeeve always makes. \u201cWe now have clean air, abundant supply of water,\u201d he highlights. A message that is clearly intended at the pollution situation in Delhi, and the water crisis that Bengaluru faced recently. \u201cWe have to showcase our success, our advantages, and we have to do a lot of campaigns to change the perception of the state,\u201d Mathews sums up. This is not the first time that Kerala is hosting a global investor summit. In 2003, the A K Antony government had held the Global Investor Meet. Later, the Oommen Chandy government held events such as Emerging Kerala Global Connect in 2012. Government officials, however, are confident that this one will be different. \u201cWhen you look at Kerala\u2019s transformation five to ten years from now into a major business-friendly destination, this summit will be regarded as a major transition point,\u201d a bureaucrat asserts.

Thousands of people reportedly crammed into the railway station on Saturday night as they tried to board delayed trains. Four of the victims were children, while 10 were women, according to a list released by officials. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his thoughts were \"with all those who have lost their loved ones\" in a post on X. Crowd crushes are common in India where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. The incident comes weeks after 30 people were killed in a pre-dawn crush at the religious festival, Kumbh Mela, in northern India, where tens of millions of Hindus had gathered to bathe in sacred river waters on one of the holy days of the six-week event. In Delhi, witnesses told BBC Hindi that a \"huge crowd\" had gathered at the station, through which many people were travelling to and from the Kumbh Mela, which is being held in Prayagraj city in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state. Hundreds of people were also waiting for trains to other places. According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj - was waiting to depart. Thirty killed in crowd crush at India's Kumbh Mela festival Families mourn loved ones who died in Kumbh Mela crush Ruby Devi said the crowd at the Indian capital's main railway station had been so big she was unable to get inside. Umesh Giri, whose wife Shilam Devi died in the crush, said that the crowd was \"uncontrollable\" as he tried to board the Prayagraj Express. Dharmendra Singh, who was also travelling to Prayagraj, told India's PTI news agency that there were\" far more people than I have ever seen at this station\". \"In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers. KPS Malhotra, deputy commissioner of police (railways), said that authorities were investigating what led to the crush. \"This happened due to a delay in two trains arriving and more people gathering at the station,\" he said. Opposition leaders have criticised the government, accusing them of administrative failure. \"Considering the large number of devotees going to Prayagraj, better arrangements should have been made at the station,\" Rahul Gandhi, the leader of opposition in India's parliament, posted on X.

Issued on: 02\/03\/2025 - 09:51 Modified: 02\/03\/2025 - 13:37 2 min Indian rescuers hurried in sub-zero temperatures to dig out workers buried by an avalanche in a remote border area \u00a9 - \/ Department of Information and Public Relation (DIPR) Uttarakhand\/AFP More than 50 workers were submerged under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp on Friday near Mana village on the border with Tibet in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. Authorities had revised down the number of workers on site at the time of the avalanche from 55 to 54 after one worker, previously believed to be buried, was found to have safely made his way home before the avalanche hit. The army used drone-based detection system to assist in its search operations. Multiple drones and a rescue dog were also employed. Construction worker Anil, who only gave his first name, recalled his rescue hours after being buried by the avalanche. \"It was if God's angels had come to save us,\" Anil, who is in his late 20s, told AFP on Sunday by phone from his hospital bed. \"The way we were engulfed in snow, we had no hope of surviving.\" Being alive now felt \"like a dream\", he said. 'Not all made it' Working on a project by the Border Roads Organisation, the workers were living on site in steel containers considered stronger than tents and capable of withstanding harsh weather. Anil said many workers were fast asleep and a few others were in makeshift toilets when the avalanche struck around 6:00 am Friday. As the ground beneath them shook, the container in which Anil and his colleagues were in began to slide down. \"At first we did not understand what was happening but when we looked out of the window of the containers, we saw piles of snow all around,\" he said. \"The roof of the containers was also slowly bending inwards.\" Everyone started screaming for help and a few men were lucky to get out of their containers. \"But not all of them made it out and they remained trapped,\" he said. 'Like thunder' His colleague Vipan Kumar thought \"this was the end\" when he found himself unable to move as he struggled for air under the thick layer of snow. \"I heard a loud roar, like thunder ... before I could react, everything went dark,\" he told the Times of India newspaper. At an altitude of more than 3,200 metres (10,500 feet), minimum temperatures in the area were down to minus 12 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit). Dhan Singh Bisht said his son and nephew were alive only because of the prompt action by the relief teams. \"I am grateful to them,\" an overwhelmed Bisht told AFP by phone on Saturday. Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season. Scientists say climate change is making weather events more severe, while the increased pace of development in the fragile Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about the fallout from deforestation and construction. In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a huge glacier chunk fell into a river, triggering flash floods. And devastating monsoon floods and landslides in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state. \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The pollution is primarily blamed on agricultural burning by nearby farmers to clear their fields for ploughing, as well as factories and traffic fumes. Cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds worsen the situation by trapping deadly pollutants each winter. Diesel and petrol cars older than 10 and 15 years respectively are not allowed to ply on Delhi roads but many have been found flouting the rules. Delhi's environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters Saturday that the decision to stop fuel for the old cars was made at a \"marathon meeting\" on air pollution to \"find out the diseases and its remedies\". \"We have decided to stop giving fuel to vehicles more than 15 years old after March 31, 2025,\" he said. He said \"gadgets\" would be installed at petrol pumps to identify such vehicles. Sirsa said other decisions taken include turning barren land into \"new forests\" and getting university students involved in planting. He also said the government would make it mandatory for high rises, hotels and Delhi airport to install anti-smog guns and gadgets to control pollution. The public health crisis has grown steadily worse over the years and weeks-long school closures across the capital, aimed at shielding vulnerable children from the harmful air, are now an annual occurrence. At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants -- dangerous cancer-causing microparticles small enought to enter the bloodstream through the lungs -- surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organization's recommended daily maximum. Piecemeal government initiatives, such as partial restrictions on fossil fuel-powered transport and water trucks spraying mist to clear particulate matter from the air, have failed to make a noticeable impact. \u00a9 2025 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The men were part of a gang of bandits who shot the victims, including women and children, in Dehuli village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The special court said on Tuesday that the killings fell into the \"rarest of the rare\" category, which justifies capital punishment in India. The men, who insist they are innocent, can appeal against the sentence in a higher court. All the victims were from the Dalit community, which sits at the bottom of India's rigid caste hierarchy. Relatives of the victims have welcomed the sentence but say the decision should have come earlier. \"Justice came very late to us. The accused have lived their lives,\" said Sanjay Chaudhry, whose cousin was killed in the firing. Thirteen of the 17 men accused in the case have died in the 44 years since the crime was committed. Apart from the three men who have been sentenced to death, there is one more accused, who is absconding. Why it took 42 years to convict a 90-year-old in India Malyana riots: India Muslim victims despair after court order The crime took place on 18 November 1981, when 17 men - most of them from the upper caste - wearing police uniforms stormed Dehuli and started shooting at villagers. According to the police complaint registered at the time, the violence followed the murder of a Dalit member of the robbers' gang by his upper-caste colleagues. The gang members then attacked the village because they suspected that some Dalit villagers were providing information to the police in the murder case. The survivors of the massacre have vivid memories of the day. \"I was doing household chores when suddenly the firing started,\" says Rakesh Kumar, a witness who was a teenager at the time. \"I was hiding behind a stack of paddy and when I came out, I saw that many people, including my mother, were shot,\" he said. Mr Kumar's mother Chameli Devi, now 80, was hit by a bullet in her leg while running from the gunfire. \"They did not spare anyone, including women or children,\" she said. \"Whoever they found was killed.\" The firing lasted for more than four hours and the attackers fled the scene before the police arrived, according to media reports. The crime led to an exodus of Dalits from Dehuli, and the local administration sent police personnel to the village, where they stayed for months in a bid to reassure people. It also triggered a political uproar, and then prime minister Indira Gandhi had visited Dehuli to meet the victims. In 1984, the case was transferred from a district court to the Allahabad Sessions Court on the orders of the state's high court. The trial continued there on and off until 2024, when the case was shifted to the special court in Mainpuri which found the men guilty. It's not unusual for courts in India to take decades to finish hearing a case and deliver a verdict, especially when the victims are from disadvantaged communities. In 2023, a 90-year-old man was sentenced for life in prison for a caste crime that also took place in 1981. Follow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube, X and Facebook .

In the fierce fighting in which combatants used guns, grenades and rockets, three police officials and three suspected rebels were killed while at least six police and two soldiers were injured on Thursday, police said.

NAGPUR: India\u2019s Orange City, not known for communal strife in contemporary history, sustained its visibility on the national stage with arrests of around 65 rioters and imposition of curfew in areas under 11 police stations, a day after violent clashes took place in the city\u2019s old quarters. Nagpur: People stand near charred remains of a car at Chitnis Park area amid curfew after violence erupted on Monday night, in Nagpur, early Tuesday, March 18, 2025. Curfew has been imposed in several areas of Maharashtra's Nagpur city after a protest against Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb triggered violence here during which several houses and vehicles were vandalised, officials said on Tuesday. (PTI Photo) (PTI03_18_2025_000065B) (PTI) Nagpur city police have imposed curfew in several areas in central Nagpur, to prevent further unrest. The curfew order, issued by commissioner of police (CP) Ravinder Kumar Singal under Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), will remain in effect till it is called off. Singal said, till Tuesday evening, of the 65 rioters arrested, 51 including three minors, were produced before court for police custody. Singal also led a route march through the troubled area of Mahal, where mobs clashed on Monday evening, to send a \u201cstrong warning to those looking to foment trouble and instil confidence in the public of the area\u201d. No fresh incidents were reported on Tuesday, and the CP assured that \u201cthe situation was fully under control\u201d. The unrest in central Nagpur began on Monday morning when around 250 members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal gathered near the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Mahal, and demanded that Mughal emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s tomb in Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar be removed, raised slogans and set a symbolic grave made of grass aflame. Following the demonstration, the police registered a case against the protesters. However, later in the evening, tensions escalated following rumours that the make-believe grave was covered with a chadaar on which religious texts were inked. Around 400-500 people gathered at Attar Road, in Chitnis Park, after the evening namaaz, shouted slogans and threatened to set vehicles on fire. Police intervened, leading to arrests. But at around 7:30 pm, another group of approximately 150 people assembled in Bhaldarpura, further intensifying the unrest. The gathering disrupted law and order, causing distress among residents and hindering traffic movement in the area. The situation took a violent turn in Mahal, where a mob of over 1,000 people engaged in stone-pelting, vandalism and arson. Several police personnel, including three deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) sustained injuries, and multiple vehicles and homes were damaged in the clashes. Of them, the DCP (Zone 5), Niketan Kadam, was severely injured, after he was attacked by miscreants with an axe. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the Home portfolio, spoke to Kadam, who is in the ICU of New Era Hospital, Central Avenue, on a video call on Tuesday afternoon. Kadam has 26 stitches on his right hand, HT has learnt from the treating doctor. After clashes in Mahal, between 10.30pm and 11.30pm, another clash erupted in the Hansapuri area near old Bhandara Road. An unruly mob set multiple vehicles on fire, vandalized homes and ransacked a clinic, said eyewitnesses \u2013 one of them described masked assailants carrying sharp weapons, sticks and bottles going on a rampage. In Hansapuri, small trader S Gupta, whose four two-wheelers parked outside his home were set ablaze, sustained injuries. He said his neighbour\u2019s shop was ransacked and alleged that police arrived nearly an hour after the violence. A woman from the locality added, as the blaze spread residents poured water from the first floor of their homes before the fire brigade arrived. Another trader Vasant Kawle, said the miscreants who had their faces covered, \u201cdeliberately broke CCTV cameras in the area and attempted to force their way into our homes\u201d. A tea stall owner near a clinic stated that the rioters entered the medical facility, smashed tables and damaged medical supplies before wrecking his stall as well. VHP general secretary from Vidarbha, Rajkumar Sharma, alleged, \u201cThe attack was pre-planned, and the moulvi of a local mosque instigated the mob which later ran amok. I demand his and his associates\u2019 arrest under the National Security Act.\u201d Maharashtra revenue minister and Nagpur guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, visited the injured at government and private hospitals. BJP MLA Pravin Datke, from the Central Nagpur assembly constituency, criticized the police for \u201can intelligence failure, as they failed to prevent a pre-planned attack\u201d.

The fighting began on Thursday after police counterinsurgency officials and soldiers cordoned off a forested area in Jammu region\u2019s southern Kathua district on a tip that anti-India insurgents were hiding there, police said. In the fierce fighting in which combatants used guns, grenades and rockets, three police officials and three suspected rebels were killed while at least six police and two soldiers were injured on Thursday, police said. The body of another policeman was spotted on Friday. Officials said the bodies of the fallen combatants were yet to be retrieved as the fighting raged in the area. Security officials believe the group engaged in the fighting is likely the one that escaped a security cordon after a brief exchange of gunfire some 30 kilometers (19 miles) away from the area on Sunday. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. RELATED COVERAGE Indian-controlled Kashmir has been the scene of many violent attacks in past decades India suspends water treaty and downgrades ties with Pakistan after deadly Kashmir attack Disputed Kashmir witnesses deadliest attack on civilians in years, sparking fears of rising tensions Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. But since 2019, the territory has simmered in anger when New Delhi ended the region\u2019s semi-autonomy and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms while intensifying counterinsurgency operations. While Kashmir Valley, the heart of the anti-India rebellion, has witnessed many militants killed in counter-rebel operations, remote areas of Jammu region including Rajouri, Poonch and Kathua have seen deadly attacks against Indian troops in the past few years.

Among those dead, two were killed in clashes while one man was killed in firing, Additional Director General (ADG), Law and Order, Jawed Shamim said. A special bench of the Calcutta High Court ordered deployment of Central Forces in Jangipur. Soon after, the Union Home Secretary Govind Mohan held a video conference with Chief Secretary and DGP of West Bengal. The DGP briefed the Secretary that the situation was tense but under control and was being monitored closely. Mr Mohan stated that apart from nearly 300 BSF personnel locally available in Murshidabad, additional 5 Companies have been deployed at the request of the state government. Advertisement The Centre, said Mr Mohan, is also closely monitoring the situation and has assured the state all possible assistance. In another development, at least 18 police personnel were injured as a protest rally demanding the rollback of the Waqf (Amendment) Act turned violent in Tripura's Unakoti district today. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has declared that her state would not implement the Waqf (Amendment) Act. \"We have made our position clear on this matter - we do not support this law. This law will not be implemented in our state. So what is the riot about?\" she said in a post on X. Her post comes at a time when several pockets in the state, especially in the minority-dominated Murshidabad district, have been on the boil for the last few days over the protests against the Waqf Act. Advertisement The Chief Minister has appealed for peace and harmony, underlining that the law was enacted by the central government. Ms Banerjee cautioned against political misuse of religion and warned of legal action against those inciting riots. \"Remember, we did not make the law that many are agitating against. The law was made by the central government. So the answer you want should be sought from the central government,\" the Chief Minister added. MP Abhishek Banerjee, who is Mamata Banerjee's nephew, also made an appeal for calm and claimed that some forces are trying to \"spread unrest in Bengal\". Advertisement \"After failing to fight us politically on the issue of development, many are trying to spread unrest in Bengal by sowing divisions in the name of religion. I appeal to all today to maintain peace and uphold Bengal's legacy of harmony. We must all be alert and aware. Some people want Bengal to burn,\" said the MP from Diamond Harbour. Several vehicles, including police vans, were set on fire, stones were thrown at security forces, and roads were blocked as violence erupted in Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts during protests over the new legislation yesterday. Director General of Police Rajeev Kumar cautioned the agitators that the state police will not tolerate any attempts to disrupt law and order in the name of the protests. Advertisement State BJP president Sukanta Majumdar urged the Trinamool government to strictly enforce the rule of law in Murshidabad. Asserting that when the BJP comes to power in West Bengal, \"such vandalism by a section of minorities will be crushed in five minutes\", he alleged that the \"appeasement-driven state administration was not taking appropriate steps\". Mr Majumdar claimed that the violence might have been orchestrated to divert focus from the spontaneous protests over the Supreme Court invalidating the jobs of 26,000 school teachers. Advertisement Senior Congress leader Rashid Alvi has blamed the BJP for the violence, claiming that the unrest in Murshidabad was a direct consequence of the Centre's alleged interference in religious matters. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill was tabled in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on April 2 and 3, respectively. It was passed in both Houses and later received the President's assent, after which it became a law. On April 5, President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025. While the Opposition has been protesting against the Waqf Act, the BJP has launched a 'Waqf Reforms Awareness Campaign', which will run from April 20 to May 5. The initiative will tell the benefits of the Waqf Act to the Muslim community.

{"year":"2025","month":"04","event_desc":"22 April  2025 Pahalgam attack At least 28 people are killed in an attack by militants on a group of tourists visiting Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.","text":"More than 20 killed after gunmen open fire on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir 21 hours ago Share Save Jessica Rawnsley BBC News Share Save Watch: First responders on the scene after gunman opens fire on tourists at Pahalgam At least two dozen people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting a popular beauty spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities have told the BBC. The attack took place in Pahalgam, a picturesque town in the Himalayas often described as the \"Switzerland of India\". The region's chief minister, Omar Abdullah, said the attack was \"much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years\". Reports suggest that there are a large number of wounded, with some in critical condition. US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen were among world leaders who condemned the attacks. \"Deeply disturbing news out of Kashmir. The United States stands strong with India against Terrorism,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Von der Leyen called the Kashmir deaths a \"vile terrorist attack\", while Putin expressed \"sincere condolences\" for the consequences of a \"brutal crime\". India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who cut short his trip to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the attack - said the perpetrators would \"be brought to justice\". \"Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakeable and it will get even stronger,\" Modi wrote in a statement on X. Pakistan's foreign ministry said it was \"concerned at the loss of tourists' lives\" and expressed condolences to the victims and wished \"the injured a speedy recovery\". Tuesday's attack is unusual in that, in three and a half decades of conflict, tourists have rarely been targeted - especially on such a scale. Home Minister Amit Shah travelled to Srinagar, Kashmir's largest city, on Tuesday to hold an emergency security meeting. The region's Lieutenant Governor, Manoj Sinha, said the army and police had been deployed to the scene. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. There has been a long-running insurgency in the Muslim-majority region since 1989, although violence has waned in recent years. The attack took place in Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5km) from Pahalgam. Vehicles are unable to reach the area where the shooting occurred, Inspector General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Vidi Kumar Birdi told BBC Hindi. A tourist from Gujarat, who was part of a group that was fired upon, said that chaos broke out after the sudden attack, and everybody started running, crying and shouting. Video footage shared by Indian media outlets appears to show Indian troops running towards the scene of the attack, while in other footage victims can be heard saying that the gunmen had singled out non-Muslims. Footage on social media, which has not been verified by the BBC, appears to show bodies lying on a meadow with people crying and pleading for help. Police said multiple tourists had been taken to hospital with gunshot wounds. The area has been cordoned off and soldiers are stopping vehicles at checkpoints. A joint search operation by the Indian army and Jammu and Kashmir police is ongoing. Several protests have been organised for Wednesday, according to Indian media. EPA Security forces stand outside the government hospital in Anantnag, south of Srinagar, where victims are being treated Since the 1990s, an armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule in the region has claimed tens of thousands of lives, including those of civilians and security forces. The Himalayan region was divided following India's independence from Britain, partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947. The two nuclear-armed states both claim the region in its entirety and have fought two wars and a limited conflict over it in the decades since. Some 500,000 Indian soldiers are permanently deployed in the territory. The government claims the security situation has improved and violence has come down since Modi revoked Kashmir's partial autonomy in 2019, although there are still incidents of violence. The last major attack on civilians occurred in June 2024 when nine people were killed and 33 injured after militants opened fire on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims . In 2019, a suicide bombing in Indian-administered Kashmir killed at least 46 soldiers and prompted Indian airstrikes on targets in Pakistan. Pahalgam is a popular tourist destination, both domestically and internationally,  and in recent years the government has attempted to encourage further tourism to the region. Around 3.5 million tourists visited Kashmir in 2024, according to official figures.

{"year":"2025","month":"04","event_desc":"10 April  Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani-born Canadian national and terrorist wanted by India for his role in the 26\/11 attacks, arrives in Delhi following his arrest and extradition from the United States.","text":"Mumbai terror attacks accused  extradited by US arrives in India 10 April 2025 Share Save Meryl Sebastian BBC News Share Save ANI Tahawwur Rana was sentenced to 14 years in prison by a US court in 2013 A Pakistan-born Chicago businessman wanted in India for his role in the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai city has been brought to the country after being extradited from the US. Tahawwur Rana, a Canadian citizen, landed in Delhi on Thursday. India's National Investigation Agency confirmed his extradition had been successful. In 2011, a US court cleared him of a direct role in helping plot the attacks that killed 166 people, but convicted him for supporting a militant group blamed for the attacks. Sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2013, the 64-year-old was released in 2020 on health grounds but was re-arrested later that year after India's extradition request. A US court approved Rana's extradition in 2023 but he remained in custody pending a final approval by the country's government. In February, President Donald Trump approved the extradition after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US Supreme Court then rejected Rana's appeals against the decision. The extradition took place under the India-US Extradition Treaty signed by the two countries in 1997. Who is Tahawwur Rana? Rana grew up in Pakistan and studied medicine before joining the Pakistani army's medical corps. He and his wife, also a doctor, became Canadian citizens in 2001. They later moved to Chicago, where Rana ran several businesses, including an immigration and travel agency. Indian authorities accused Rana of conspiring with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley to assist Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which was blamed for the Mumbai attacks. A group of 10 militants stormed a train station, hotels, cafes and a Jewish centre in Mumbai, shooting and throwing bombs. Both India and the US designated LeT as a terrorist organisation. US prosecutors in the case said that in 2006, Rana allowed Headley to open an office of his Chicago-based immigration services firm in Mumbai, which Headley then used as cover to scout sites for the 2008 attacks. Rana was also accused of allowing Headley to pose as a representative of his firm in order to gain access to newspaper offices by feigning interest in purchasing advertising space. Headley - who pleaded guilty to identifying locations for the Mumbai attacks - was a key prosecution witness. He said he had links to LeT and to the Pakistani intelligence service ISI. Pakistan has repeatedly denied any such links. Headley also testified against Rana. Rana's defence team at the time said he was manipulated and misled by Headley, an old friend from their days in a Pakistani military school. In 2011, jurors at the federal court in Chicago convicted Rana for providing support to LeT and for his role in an aborted plot against a Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten. But he was cleared of the more serious charge of helping plot the Mumbai attacks and received a 14-year jail term. Headley was given a 35-year sentence for his role in the attacks. He is lodged in a federal prison in Chicago. Getty Images The terror attacks in 2008 brought India's financial capital to a halt What are the charges against Rana in India? In India, Rana and Headley were tried in absentia in a Mumbai court for their alleged involvement in the attacks. Headley later turned approver in the case. The charges brought against Rana by India's National Investigation Agency include criminal conspiracy, waging war against the Indian government and terrorism. In his plea against being extradited to India in the lower court in the US, Rana had argued that India intended to prosecute him for the same offences for which he had been acquitted by the US court. His plea was rejected, with the court saying the Indian charges were distinct from those he had been prosecuted for in the US. In his appeal in the US Supreme Court to stay his extradition, Rana said it would violate US law and the United Nations Convention Against Torture \"because there are substantial grounds for believing that, if extradited to India, petitioner will be in danger of being subjected to torture\". \"The likelihood of torture in this case is even higher though as petitioner faces acute risk as a Muslim of Pakistani origin charged in the Mumbai attacks,\" the application said . It also cited Rana's underlying health conditions and concerns about the treatment he would receive in Indian prison. His plea was rejected. Ujjwal Nikam, the former public prosecutor in the case in Mumbai, told ANI news agency that Rana's extradition would help reveal more about \"the involvement of Pakistan's security apparatus\" in the attacks.

He was the sole candidate for the post. Ambassadors also voted for five new countries to join the UN Security Council as non-permanent members. The Council comprises five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 and 10 non-permanent members, who serve for two-year periods. While three countries vied for two seats allocated to African and Asia-Pacific States, only India was confirmed. Djibouti and Kenya face\u00a0a second round of voting to be held on Thursday. A similar race occurred for the Western European and other States group, where Canada did not secure the required two-thirds majority, or 128 votes. Norway and Ireland will begin their terms starting in January, as will Mexico, representative for the Latin America and Caribbean region. Eighteen countries will also occupy vacant seats in the Economic and Social Council, another of the six main organs of the UN. They are: Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Guatemala, Indonesia, Japan, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Portugal, the Solomon Islands, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. While this year\u2019s General Assembly falls during the UN\u2019s 75th anniversary, the pandemic adds to its historic significance, and the need to maintain safety measures. Plans are in motion for the annual high-level week, where Heads of State address the world from the dais in the General Assembly Hall. Mr. Muhammad-Bande, the current President, has written to Member States about a scenario that foresees his successor and UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres present in the Hall for the official opening, while world leaders will deliver their speeches via pre-recorded video statements. Delegations have until noon on Friday to submit their feedback.

{"year":"2020","month":"02","event_desc":"24  25 February  U.S. President Donald Trump visited India for a two-day state visit, addressed a \"Namaste (Welcome) Trump\" event with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad. Toured Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram and the Taj Mahal at Agra. Received a formal welcome from President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential Palace in New Delhi. Conducted a series of meetings with Prime minister Modi and other government officials, as well as Indian business executives.","text":"(AHMEDABAD, INDIA) \u2014 Basking in adulation from a massive, colorful crowd, President Donald Trump and India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi lavished each other with praise Monday in a reaffirmation of U.S.-India ties as the subcontinent poured on the pageantry in a joyful welcome for the U.S. president. More than 100,000 people packed into the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium in Modi\u2019s home state to give Trump the biggest rally crowd of his political career. The event was the pinnacle of the day\u2019s enviable trio of presidential photo-ops, sandwiched between Trump visits to a former home of independence leader Mohandas Gandhi and a planned tour of the famed Taj Mahal. Nearly everyone in the newly constructed stadium in Ahmedabad in western India sported a white cap with the name of the event, \u201cNamaste, Trump\u201d or \u201cWelcome, Trump,\u201d and roared for the introductions of both leaders. Embarking on a whirlwind 36-hour visit, Trump opened his speech by declaring that he had traveled 8,000 miles to deliver the message that \u201cAmerica loves India, America respects India and America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people.\u201d The boisterous scene featured musicians on camels and a musical medley of Bollywood hits and Trump\u2019s campaign rally playlist, including numerous Elton John songs that seemed to puzzle most of the crowd. Trump basked in the raucous reception that has eluded him on many foreign trips, some of which have featured massive protests and icy handshakes from world leaders. In India, he instead received a warm embrace \u2014 literally \u2014 from the ideologically aligned and noted hugger Modi. The sun-baked city of Ahmedabad bustled as Trump arrived, its streets teeming with people eager to catch a glimpse of the American president. Newly cleaned roads and planted flowers dotted the roads amid hundreds of billboards featuring the president and first lady Melania Trump. Thousands lined his motorcade route, shy of the up to 10 million that Trump speculated would be on hand. His first stop was Gandhi\u2019s home, where Trump donned a prayer shawl and removed his shoes to create the incongruous image of a grandiose president quietly walking through the humble ashram. He inspected the spinning wheel used by the famed pacifist and looked at a statue of monkeys representing Gandhi\u2019s mantra of \u201cSee no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil\u201d before departing for a far more boisterous setting: the mega-rally at the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium. Trump\u2019s motorcade traveled amid cheers from a battery of carefully picked and vetted Modi loyalists and workers from his Bharatiya Janata Party who will stand for hours alongside the neatly manicured 22-kilometer (14-mile) stretch of road to accord the president a grand welcome on his way to the newly constructed stadium. Tens of thousands of police officers were on hand to keep security tight and a new wall has come up in front of a slum, apparently to hide it from presidential passers-by. On the way to the stadium, Trump\u2019s motorcade crossed a river where a barge was emblazoned with \u201cTRUMP\u201d and onlookers chanted \u201cModi!\u201d The stadium was packed with revelers, many of whom sported Trump and Modi masks, as they sat in 80-degree heat. Scores of attendees, particularly those sitting in the sun, streamed out before Trump finished his 27-minute speech. The \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d rally was, in a way, the back half of home-and-home events for Modi and Trump, who attended a \u201cHowdy Modi\u201d rally in Houston last year that drew 50,000 people. Trump lavished praise on both Modi and the democracy he leads, touting an effort to lift residents out of extreme poverty, saying \u201cIndia gives hope to all of humanity.\u201d \u201cThe story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToday I say to every Indian, north and south \u2026 take pride in the glories of your past. unite for an even brighter future and let our two nations always stand together as powerful defenders of peace and liberty.\u201d Trump\u2019s foreign visits have typically been light on sightseeing, but he and the first lady were to visit the Taj Mahal, the immense white marble mausoleum built in Agra in the 17th century. Stories in local media warn of the monkeys that inhabit the landmark pestering tourists for food and, on occasion, menacing both visitors and slingshot-carrying security guards. Images of American presidents being feted on the world stage stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early-voting states and clashing in debate. This trip, in particular, reflects a Trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short, carefully managed trips that provide counter-programming to the Democrats\u2019 primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads. His aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of Indian-American voters before the November election. The visit also comes at a crucial moment for Modi, a fellow populist, who has provided over a steep economic downturn and unfulfilled campaign promises about job creation. When Trump touches down in Delhi later on Monday, he will find a bustling, noisy, colorful capital that also is dotted with half-finished construction projects stalled due to disappearing funding. The president will conclude his whirlwind visit to India on Tuesday with a day in the capital of New Delhi, including meetings with Modi over stalled trade talks and a gala dinner. The two nations are closely allied, in part to act as a bulwark against the rising influence of China. Trump announced at the stadium that India would soon buy $3 billion of American military equipment. Trade tensions between the two countries have escalated since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from India. India responded with higher penalties on agricultural goods and restrictions on U.S. medical devices. The U.S. retaliated by removing India from a decades-old preferential trade program. Alluding to tense trade negotiations, Trump voiced optimism that a deal could be reached but also lightheartedly told the rally crowd about Modi: \u201cEverybody loves him, but I will tell you this. He\u2019s very tough.\u201d Eyes will also be on whether Trump weighs on in the protests enveloping India over its Citizenship Amendment Act. It provides a fast track to naturalization for some migrants who entered the country illegally while fleeing religious persecution, but excludes Muslims, raising fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Passage has prompted large-scale protests and a violent crackdown. Trump has refrained from publicly rebuking world leaders for human rights abuses during his overseas trips. He made no specific mention of the citizenship debate during the rally, but included passing references to religious tolerance for all faiths, including Islam. He also specifically referred to the United States\u2019 success combating \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d particularly originating from India\u2019s longtime rival, Pakistan. ___ Sheikh Saaliq contributed reporting.

The doctors demanded 5,000 rupees ($69). His pockets were empty. By the time Ansari managed to reach a public hospital, his father was dead.

First in ones and twos, limping up the steps and staggering through the aluminum doors, and then in wheelbarrows, with bleeding skulls and stabbed necks. Finally, the motorcycles and auto-rickshaws arrived, their seats stained with the blood of as many as they could hold. As the Mustafabad neighborhood of India's capital was ravaged by communal riots for three days this week, the Al-Hind Hospital turned from a community clinic into a trauma ward. Doctors like M.A. Anwar were for the first time dealing with injuries such as gunshot wounds, crushed skulls and torn genitals. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cI wanted to cry and scream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSomething inside of me died during those three days.\u201d Almost a week after the clashes between Hindus and Muslims began, a clearer picture of the horrors inflicted during New Delhi's worst communal riots in decades has begun to emerge. On the eve of President Donald Trump\u2019s first state visit to India last Sunday, Hindus and Muslims in the Indian capital charged at each other with homemade guns and crude weapons, leaving the streets where the rioting occurred resembling a war zone, with houses, shops, mosques, schools and vehicles up in flames. At least 42 people were killed and hundreds more wounded. Authorities have struggled to identify some of the bodies because of the gruesomeness of the injuries. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While both sides behaved brutally, most of the victims were Muslim. Authorities haven't given an official account of what sparked the riots, though the violence appeared to be a culmination of growing tensions that followed the passage of a new citizenship law in December. The law fast-tracks naturalization for some religious minorities from neighboring countries but not Muslims. Opponents say it violates India's secular constitution, and further marginalizes the 200 million Muslims in this Hindu-majority nation of 1.4 billion people. The law spurred massive protests across India that left at least 23 dead. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But what unfolded in Mustafabad this week was far more brutal, with mobs hacking individuals with swords, burning people alive and bludgeoning people to death. A Hindu intelligence bureau officer was repeatedly stabbed and his dead body thrown into a sewage drain that divides Hindu and Muslim residential areas. A Muslim man had his legs spread so far apart that the lower half of his body tore. His condition remained critical. Questions have been raised about the role of the New Delhi police and whether they stood by while the violence raged or even aided the Hindu mobs. A New Delhi police spokesman, Anil Mittal, denied that police had aided rioters. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Al-Hind hospital's doctors said authorities kept ambulances from reaching certain riot-hit places. A little after midnight on Wednesday \u2014 more than 72 hours after the violence began \u2014 a New Delhi High Court passed an extraordinary order directing the police to provide safe passage for ambulances. It was too late for many victims. With streets taken over by the mobs and no way through for ambulances, Anwar knew early on that his clinic would soon be overcome with wounded. Some slumped in plastic chairs as they draped gunshot-riddled arms and legs over tables. Others just lay on the floor, bleeding. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Those who were there described the blood and chaos, but also shared oddly uplifting stories of teamwork and grit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep. We didn\u2019t eat anything. All we wanted to do was save lives. And we did,\u201d said Aanis Mohammad, a volunteer at the clinic. \u201cNo patient of any religion was turned away.\u201d By mid-afternoon Wednesday as the violence came to an end, Anwar and his overwhelmed colleagues had treated more than 400 people and referred almost 100 to larger hospitals. Dozens, however, remained at the clinic in critical condition. The hospital also gave refuge to those fleeing the violence, providing more than 50 people with food, bedding and safety. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Clean-up efforts in Mustafabad are underway but the scars are still visible. At Guru Teg Bahadur hospital along New Delhi\u2019s eastern border, 18-year-old Salman Ansari waited for his father's body to be handed over. Ansari's father had gone out to collect scrap for money as there was no food in the house. After seeing police assurances on the news, he thought it would be safe. It wasn't. Ansari said he was sleeping when two strangers dumped his father outside their home early Wednesday. He carted his father 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) on the family's rickshaw to a private clinic. The doctors demanded 5,000 rupees ($69). His pockets were empty. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement By the time Ansari managed to reach a public hospital, his father was dead. For Anwar, the doctor, he said he eventually grew numb to the carnage. Yet he's still coming to grips with how fellow Indians could do what they did to one another. \u201cIt's as if evil had pervaded and housed itself in the hearts of the mob,\u201d he said. ___ Associated Press writer Aniruddha Ghosal contributed to this report.

Seven top IITs boycott THE World University Rankings The older IITs say they doubt the transparency of the THE rankings IITs will reconsider their decision next year \u2018if THE is able to convince them about the parameters and transparency in their ranking process\u2019 Prashant K. Nanda Updated 16 Apr 2020, 09:36 PM IST The other four Indian institutions in the list are the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi; IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Kharagpur and IIT-Roorkee, ranked in the 351-400 bracket. Photo:Indranil Bhoumik\/Mint ( Indranil Bhoumik\/Mint ) Seven marque Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) including those at Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai Thursday announced that they are boycotting the World University Rankings by British ranking agency Times Higher Education (THE). The older IITs said they doubt the transparency of the THE rankings. \u201cLeading IITs i.e. IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras and IIT Roorkee have decided to not participate in any of the Times Higher Education (THE) - World University Rankings this year,\u201d the IITs said in a joint statement. These IITs said they will reconsider their decision next year \u201cif THE is able to convince them about the parameters and transparency in their ranking process.\u201d THE publishes several multi-country rankings including world university ranking, young university ranking and emerging economies university rankings. In 2019, the IITs started doubting their transparency after none of them find a place among the best 300 universities in the world. While IIT Bombay had said that they were ranked despite not giving any information, IIT Delhi had said that such rankings were a black box. IIT Delhi director last year had said that \u201cIn my humble opinion, institutions become great by positively impacting the ecosystem around it by imparting the highest quality education and training to the students who go through its portals. If Delhi NCR has the highest number of tech startups\/Unicorns in India, IIT Delhi has played a role in it. If 14 of the 24 Unicorns created by Indians are by the alumni of one single institution-- IIT Delhi, (then) IIT Delhi is surely doing something right.\u201d The top Indian schools doubt also stems from the fact that another World University Ranking by another global agency Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) has placed three Indian institutions within top 200, six institutions among top 300 and nine among top 500 best universities in the world. In the top 300 except Indian Institute of Science (IISc), others are IITs. In the last edition of the QS World University Ranking, while IIT Bombay was ranked 152, IIT Delhi was 182 and IISc was 184th best in the world. Whereas THE World University Ranking last time placed IIT-Bombay and IIT Delhi in the top 401 to 500 band much below the second generation IIT Ropar which was placed in the 301-350 band along with IISc Bangalore. After top 200 individual ranks, THE places universities in bands. Catch all the Business News , Education News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

FIR lodged for trying to \u2019sell\u2019 Statue of Unity for  \u20b930,000 cr on OLX An unknown person in Gujarat had put out an online advertisement to 'sell' the statue to 'meet' government's 'requirement for money' for hospitals and medical infrastructure to fight Covid-19 PTI Published 5 Apr 2020, 09:55 PM IST (Photo: PTI) Rajpipla: A case was registered against an unknown person in Gujarat for placing an online advertisement to \"sell\" the Statue of Unity in Kevadiya in Narmada district for \u20b9 30,000 crore to meet the government's expenses for hospitals and medical infrastructure to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The memorial to Sardar Patel, at 182 metres, is the world's tallest such structure and has attracted several lakh people since it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018. \"Some unknown person placed an advertisement on OLX on Saturday stating he needs to sell the Statue of Unity for \u20b9 30,000 crore to meet the requirement of money to buy hospitals and healthcare equipment,\" a Kevadiya police station official said quoting the FIR. \"The memorial's authorities came to know of the issue after a newspaper ran an article, and approached police. A cheating and forgery case was registered under IPC, Epidemic Diseases Act and Information Technology Act,\" Inspector PT Chaudhary said. Soon after it was posted, the advertisement was taken off the website. \"Despite him not being authorised to sell government property, this unidentified person posted the advertisement on OLX to defame the government and mislead people,\" stated a release from the chief administrator of the Statue of Unity.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Assam government and the Bodo groups on Monday signed an agreement to redraw and rename the Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) in Assam, currently spread over four districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri. As per the agreement, villages dominated by Bodos that were presently outside the BTAD would be included and those with non-Bodo population would be excluded, Assam Finance Minister Hemanta Biswa Sarma said. Bodos living in the hills would be conferred a Scheduled Hill Tribe status, he noted. Mr. Sarma asserted that as of now the agreement had not addressed the issue of \u201ccitizenship or work permit\u201d for non-domiciles in the BTAD, to be renamed as the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). Several Bodo groups led by the All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) have been demanding a separate land for the ethnic community since 1972, a movement that has claimed nearly 4,000 lives. Pact will end crisis: Shah Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who presided over the event, said the signing of the agreement would \u201cend the 50-year-old Bodo crisis.\u201d \u201cToday, Assam is united. Around 1500 cadres of NDFB(P), NDFB(RD) and NDFB(S) will be rehabilitated by Centre and Assam Government. They will be assimilated in the mainstream and will surrender on January 30 on Bapu\u2019s death anniversary. No one will be called a militant now, they all are our brothers and sisters,\u201d Mr. Shah said. The memorandum of settlement says that the criminal cases registered against members of the NDFB factions for \u201cnon-heinous\u201d crimes shall be withdrawn by the Assam government and in cases of heinous crimes it will be reviewed. Civilians numbering 2,823, 239 security personnel and 939 Bodo cadres have been killed so far. Mr. Shah said that the families of those killed during the Bodo movement would get Rs. 5 lakh each. \u201cFinal and comprehensive solution to their demands has been made, while retaining the territorial integrity of Assam. After the agreement, the NDFB factions will leave the path of violence, surrender their weapons and disband their armed organisations within a month of signing the deal.\u201d A Special Development Package of Rs. 1500 Crore would be given by the Centre to undertake specific projects for the development of Bodo areas, he added. When asked if the agreement was Article 370 (revoked from J&K) in a new form since it ensured special status and further autonomy for the Bodos, Mr. Shah said, \u201cIs it your demand that Article 370 should be brought back?\" The signing of the agreement was attended by Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Director of Intelligence Bureau Arvinda Kumar. Giving the contours of the memorandum, Mr. Sarma said, \u201cA committee will decide the exclusion and inclusion of new areas in the BTAD. Subsequent to this alteration, the total number of Assembly seats will go up to 60, from the existing 40. In this committee, both the representatives of the ABSU as well as the present BTC will be present.\u201d Bodo with Devnagri script would be the associate official language for the entire Assam. The first Bodo accord was signed with the ABSU in 1993, leading to the creation of a Bodoland Autonomous Council with limited political powers. The BTC was created in 2003 with some more financial and other powers. The BTAD and other areas mentioned under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution have been exempted from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, that enables undocumented non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 to apply for Indian citizenship. Recently, the MHA and the Assam government signed a suspension of operations (SoO) agreement with the NDFB-S, led by its chairman B Saoraigwra, Around 40 members of the NDFB, including Mr. Saoraigwra, were brought back from Myanmar on January 11. The other faction of the NDFB, led by IK Songbijit, who was expelled from the group, is not a signatory to this pact. The NDFB (S) has been involved in several incidents in Assam, including the December 2014 one in which 76 persons were killed. The ban on it was extended for five years in 2019.

The Government of India on Monday banned 59 applications, most of them popular Chinese applications such as TikTok, Shareit, Mi Video Call, Club Factory and Cam Scanner, citing threat to national security and sovereignty. The ban comes amid continuing tensions on the border between India and China and covers a variety of applications from e-commerce to gaming, social media, browsers, instant messaging and file sharing. Order to Google, Apple \u201cUpon receiving recent credible inputs that such apps pose threat to sovereignty and integrity of India, the Government of India has decided to disallow the usage ... both [on] mobile and non-mobile Internet-enabled devices,\u201d the Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity) said in statement. According to sources, Meity has issued instructions to Google and Apple to remove the banned applications from their respective application stores. Additionally, telecom operators and Internet service providers will be asked to block access and use of these applications on their networks. Data | Is an economic boycott of China feasible for India? The Ministry said it was invoking its power under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. \u201c... in view of the emergent nature of threats, [the government] has decided to block 59 apps ... in view of information available [that] they are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order,\u201d the government said.

The IT Ministry said it received many complaints, including misuse of mobile apps for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users\u2019 data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India. \u201cThe compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,\u201d it said.

HYDERABAD: Nine persons died while 15 others managed to escape after a fire broke out in an underground hydroelectricity power station at Srisailam in Telangana. The fire broke out due to a suspected short-circuit on Thursday night following which 15 employees managed to escape while nine others were trapped inside. The bodies of nine persons who were trapped inside the underground hydroelectric plant were retrieved on Friday evening. The rescue operations were launched by teams from NDRF, CISF, Singareni Collieries and Telangana Fire Services. PM Narendra Modi said the fire at the Srisailam hydroelectric plant is deeply unfortunate, while vice president Venkaiah Naidu said he was distressed by the loss of lives in the fire incident. \"Fire at the Srisailam hydroelectric plant is deeply unfortunate. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. I hope those injured recover at the earliest,\" PM Modi said in a tweet. \"My thoughts are with the bereaved families,\" Naidu said in a tweet. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered an inquiry by the crime investigation department (CID). Additional director general of police Govind Singh will lead the inquiry which will probe the reasons that caused the fire. The chief minister has asked for the reasons for the fire accident to be brought to light and submit a report to the government. The 15 employees who managed to come out of the underground power station are out of danger said TSGENCO local hospital authorities. The hydel power generation was shut down and the current being switched off also hampered rescue and escape efforts, said an official. This hydroelectric plant is located near Telangana's border with Andhra Pradesh. One of nine bodies have been identified as that of assistant engineer Sundar Naik, said Nagarkurnool district collector L Sharman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur engineers tried to trip the units as soon as fire broke out but could not trip them. The Hydel power generation has completely been stopped at the station following the incident. The underground power station operates at multiple levels. Those in the control room managed to come out and others at lower levels could not come out because of the smoke. The nine persons who were trapped included a division engineer, four assistant engineers, two junior plant attendants and two others from Amara Raja Batteries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d TSGenco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao said. Energy minister Jagadish Reddy, TSGENCO and Transco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao reached the accident site last night and are overseeing rescue operations. This is the first such accident at the plant. The extent of damage is yet to be assessed. The priority is to rescue those trapped inside, said an official. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has ordered the officials to extend all possible help to their counterparts in Telangana for the rescue operations. Jagan has also called off his visit to Srisailam which was to commence on Friday. Telangana CM has announced financial and other benefits to the families of those died in the fire accident. The CM announced Rs 50 lakh ex-gratia to DE Srinivas Goud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family and Rs 25 Lakh each to other families of the dead. The CM also announced one job each to families of the deceased and also extended other department-wise benefits.

The Union cabinet had approved these Ordinances on Wednesday, intending to create \u00e2\u0080\u009cone India, one agriculture market\u00e2\u0080\u009d while also attracting private investments in the agriculture sector which could not realise its full potential due to several regulations under states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 laws. After promulgation of the Ordinances, the Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar wrote to all chief ministers, seeking their cooperation in implementation of these reform measures. The three reforms, which have now got legal status with promulgation of these Ordinances, include laws on promoting barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade in agriculture produce, empowering farmers to go for \u00e2\u0080\u0098contract farming\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and removing certain farm commodities such cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from list of essential commodities under the Essential Commodities Act (ESA). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the whole ecosystem of agriculture and its allied activities was tested during the Covid-19 crises, it reconfirmed the necessity for the central government to speed up the reform process and to come up with a national legal facilitative ecosystem to improve intra-state and inter-state trade of agriculture produce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the agriculture ministry in a statement while referring to the rationale behind the Ordinances. It said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe government of India also recognised the need for the farmer to sell agriculture produce at a place of his\/her choice at a better price by increasing the number of prospective buyers. A facilitative framework was also considered necessary for farming agreements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Key features of the Ordinances: Making Farmers Free From Regulatory Regime Through Three Steps 1.The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 *Ordinance aims to create \u00e2\u0080\u0098One India, One Agriculture Market\u00e2\u0080\u0099 *Farmers can sell their produce outside regulated \u00e2\u0080\u0098mandis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ( agri markets ) (Currently, farmers cannot sell agri-produce outside notified market yards) *Anyone\/groups, holding PAN card, can buy agri produce from farm gates (directly from farmers outside mandis) (Currently, farmers are restricted to sell produce only to registered licensees of state governments) *No restrictions on inter-state and intra-state trade (Currently, barriers exist in free flow of agri produce between states due to various APMC legislations *It will open more choices for farmers, reduce marketing costs and help them in getting better price *It will help farmers of regions with surplus produce to get better prices in other regions *Farmers can sell their produce by creating their own e-platforms 2.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020 *Farmers can engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers, and exporters through contract on pre-agreed prices *It will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor *It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll enable farmer to access modern technology and better inputs *It will reduce cost of marketing and improve income of farmers *This Ordinance will act as a catalyst to attract private sector investment for building supply chains for supply of Indian farm produce to global markets *It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll eliminate intermediaries, resulting in full realization of price *Farmers to be provided adequate protection in terms of their ownership rights on land *To have dispute resolution mechanism through SDM and district magistrate within time-bound manner 3.Amendment to the Essential Commodities Act *Cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes will be removed from list of essential commodities *This will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference *Freedom to hold, move, distribute and supply will lead to harnessing of economies of scale *This will attract private sector\/foreign direct investment into agriculture sector *It will help drive up investment in cold storages *It has provisions to safeguard interests of consumers *Farm commodities can be regulated in situations such as war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity *Export demand of an exporter will remain exempted from stock limit imposition so as to ensure investments in agriculture About the Author Vishwa Mohan Vishwa Mohan is Senior Editor at The Times of India.

Image for representational purpose only. The Indian economy saw its worst contraction in decades, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrinking by a record 23.9% in the April to June quarter in comparison to the same period last year, according to data released by the National Statistical Office on Monday The contraction reflects the severe impact of the COVID-19 lockdown, which halted most economic activities, as well as the slowdown trend of the economy even pre-COVID-19. Economists expect this to contribute to a contraction in annual GDP this year, which may be the worst in the history of independent India. Also read: The Hindu Explains | What is Gross Value Added, and how is it relevant when growth is announced in GDP terms? \u201cThe Indian economy is in a deeply vicious cycle, where demand is contracting so heavily, while the capacity to neutralise this contraction has also contracted equally because of the tax revenue contraction. Therefore, I don\u2019t see GDP returning to positive territory for six quarters, until the second quarter of next year,\u201d said D. K. Srivastava, chief economist at Ernst and Young, and a Member of the Advisory Council to the 15th Finance Commission. He expects annual GDP to contract 5%-7% in 2020-21, noting that the last contraction of the economy occurred in 1979-80, when GDP shrank 5.2%. There have been four other instances of minor contraction between 1965-68, and 1972-73, but this year is likely to be the worst since Independence, said Dr. Srivastava. Also read: \u2018Stimulus to cost only about 1% of GDP\u2019 Agriculture was the only sector which recorded modest growth of 3.4% in year on year terms. All other sectors saw contraction, with the steepest fall coming from the 50% in construction, and 47% fall in trade, hotels, transport and communication. Manufacturing shrank more than 39%, while mining and quarrying dropped 23%. On the expenditure side, private consumption fell 26.7%, while investments, as reflected by gross fixed capital formation plunged 47%, and exports contracted almost 20%. Government final consumption expenditure grew 16.4%. Also read: Bottom or mirage?: On NSO estimates of GDP growth \u201cThe major burden on the economy is the contraction you are seeing in private final consumption, which has a weight of almost 60% in the GDP. If 60% of demand is growing negatively, the task is formidable, because unless this is turned around, nothing will happen,\u201d said Dr. Srivastava, adding that the real situation may be somewhat worse as three-fourths of the economy is in the informal sector, which is largely not captured in GDP data. \u201cThe investment outlook is very bleak and may fall further. Consumption indicators are improving sequentially, but continue not on a year on year basis,\u201d said D.K. Pant, chief economist at India Ratings, an arm of the Fitch group, adding that all four quarters of the year will remain in negative territory. \u201cThe government has so far focussed on supply side only, but unless they are willing to spend to spur demand side, the next year will also be dire.\u201d Also read: GDP growth in 2020-21 likely to go negative, says RBI Governor Fellow economist Pronab Sen agreed that the government needed to step up its own expenditure. \u201cExpecting people to draw down their savings indefinitely won\u2019t be enough as much of the poor and middle class may have already wiped out their savings. The government can borrow from the market or the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) and I don\u2019t understand their reluctance to do so. Is the government willing to let the economy go down the tube because they want to shore up their fiscal deficit numbers?\u201d he asked. He expects a 10%-12% contraction in annual GDP, although he felt that the last quarter of the year may show some modest growth. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry also released data on the eight core infrastructure sectors on Monday, showing that output contracted for a fifth straight month in July, with the 9.6% decline driven by a fall in production in the steel, cement and refinery products industries. The Centre\u2019s Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian pointed to the core sector data as one indicator of a \u201cV-shaped recovery\u201d, as it has eased since the 38% contraction in April. \u201cIf you look at railway freight traffic, which is often times a good indicator of economic activity, in July, it is 95% of the level that it was last year. In fact, in the first 26 days of August, it is 6% higher than the same period last year. Power consumption is only 1.9% lower than last year. E-way bills in August, which capture inter-State trade, are at 99.8%, almost the same as last year, despite the presence of some local lockdowns. So overall, there is a V-shaped recovery. We should expect a better performance in the subsequent quarters,\u201d he said, adding that the GDP contraction should be put in the context of a global recession due to COVID-19.

Coronavirus: Live updates However, despite crossing the 1-million mark of total coronavirus cases on Friday, the actual caseload of Covid-19 patients in the country is 3,42,473, and it has been steadily declining, the health ministry said. A total of 22,942 people recuperated in the past 24 hours, the highest number of recoveries in a day, taking the total number of recovered cases to 6,35,756 on Friday. The ministry said the current caseload remains manageable because of \"proactive measures of containment including house-to-house survey, perimeter control activities, timely contact tracing and surveillance of containment zones, aggressive testing and timely diagnosis of cases\". It took 110 days for the Covid-19 cases in the country to reach one lakh and just 59 days more to go past the nine-lakh mark. This is the sixth consecutive day when the cases increased by more than 28,000. For India's population of around 1.3 billion, experts say a million cases are still low and the number will rise significantly in the coming months as testing is expanded. Epidemiologists say India is still likely months away from hitting its peak of cases, suggesting the country's already overburdened healthcare system will come under further strain. \"In the coming months, we are bound to see more and more cases, and that is the natural progression of any pandemic,\" said Giridhar Babu, epidemiologist at the nonprofit Public Health Foundation of India. \"As we move forward, the goal has to be lower mortality,\" he said. \"A critical challenge states will face is how to rationally allocate hospital beds.\" According to ICMR, a cumulative total of 1,30,72,718 samples have been tested up to July 16 with 3,33,228 samples being tested on Thursday. India ranks 106th with 658 cases per million. Cases per million population in India are 4 to 8 times less than European countries. Covid-19 cases per million in Russia and US are 8 and 16 times respectively the corresponding figure in India, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control till July 15, the ministry said in a tweet.

Three Bills on agriculture reforms were introduced in Parliament on Tuesday to replace the ordinances issued during the lockdown. Opposition parties and farmers groups are opposing the move to enact amendments to the Essential Commodities Act, new laws to bypass the state APMC Acts and to facilitate contract farming. The Centre introduced the three Bills on food and agriculture reform in the Lok Sabha on Monday, amidst vehement protest from the Opposition parties and the farmers groups. The proposed legislations will replace the ordinances promulgated during the lockdown and will bring about changes to the marketing and storage of farm produce and agri commodities outside registered markets, as well as the facilitation of contract farming. ALSO READ Farmers stage protests against Centre\u2019s agri-ordinances in Punjab Introducing The Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and The Farmers Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the new laws would benefit farmers by empowering them to decide the price of their produce, which was earlier determined by traders. It would also encourage private investments and technology introduction in the sector, he said. Congress MPs Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Gaurav Gogoi opposed the Bills, accusing the Centre of grabbing the rights of farmers and handing it over to corporates, adding that the States were not consulted. \u201cIt is beyond the legislative competence of this House to enact any law on agriculture, which is a domain of the State governments,\u201d said Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy called them \u2018draconian\u2019 and \u201canti-farmer\u201d legislations while Mr. Gogoi claimed the government was deliberately undermining the Minimum Support Price regime. Mr. Tomar reassured the House that the MSP would stay but added that the majority of farmers are small and marginal and do not see benefits from it. He called the legislations a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for small farmers. Minister of State for Consumer Affairs Raosaheb Danve introduced the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, noting that the ordinance was introduced after recommendation from a high-powered panel including six Chief Ministers. Mr. Gogoi said the Bill would only increase hoarding while Mr. Chowdhury said it was against the principles of cooperative federalism. Farmers groups held protests across the country, including one at Jantar Mantar near Parliament Street as well as 1,500 mini protests in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding the withdrawal of all three legislations. These laws are \u201cdesigned to save the crisis-ridden big corporates and help them to squeeze profits from the only sector showing some growth in the midst of the pandemic\u201d, said V.M. Singh, convenor of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella platform of farmers groups.

The bills, namely the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, were seen as a threat to the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers. Protesters argued that the reforms would lead to the dismantling of government-regulated mandis (agricultural markets), reduce state intervention in agriculture, and potentially lower crop prices. Additionally, there were fears that the new laws would favor corporate interests over those of the farmers, leading to a loss of bargaining power for the latter.

Here are the highlights from PM Modi's address: * In any society, the enlightened section of the society, writers or writers of the society are like guides, teachers of society. Schooling is over, but our learning process lasts for ages, every day. Books and authors also play a major role in this. * Shri Karpoor Chandra Kulish ji started the tradition of the magazine only with the determination of Indianness, and service to India. We all remember his contribution to journalism, but the way Kulish ji tried to spread the knowledge of Vedas to the society, it was truly amazing. * Upanishad dialogue and Akshar Yatra will also reach people as a link to the same Indian thought, I expect. Today, in this era of text and tweet, it is more important that our new generation does not get away from serious knowledge. * Characters are the first unit of our language, our expression, In Sanskrit, the meaning of the letter is that there is no erosion, that is, always. This is the power of thought, power. Thousands of years ago, the idea, which a sage, scientist gave us, is still advancing the world.

Now, the court says there was no conspiracy. Please enlighten me, how many days of months of preparations are required to disqualify an action from being spontaneous? This is an issue of justice. This is an issue of ensuring that people who are responsible for Babri Masjid demolition should\u2019ve been convicted. But, they\u2019ve been politically rewarded in the past by becoming Home Minister and HRD Minister. The BJP is in power because of this issue,\u201d Owaisi said. Veteran BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi too welcomed the verdict and said that the court has delivered a historic decision, which proves that there was \u201cno conspiracy\u201d in whatever happened on 6 December 1992.\u00a0\u201cIt is a historic decision by the court.

Jahaan Jahaan iss tarah ke daag hain unko jald hataya jayega ,\u201d he said. The court found merit in the defence counsel\u2019s argument that there was no question of unlawful assembly as it was in fact a Supreme Court order in November 1992 that permitted symbolic \u2018kar seva\u2019 on December 6 that year. But, things went out of hand and the Sangh parivar leaders could not control the crowd that went berserk and brought down the structure. As per the verdict, the CBI could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The CBI had argued that all the accused conspired and also made provocative speeches that instigated \u2018kar sevaks\u2019 to demolish the mosque.

There are close to 50 million active PUBG players in India, according to reports and the game clocks in some 13 million daily users.

Bengaluru\u2019s Bellandur lake catches fire, causing worry among residents The locals noticed huge clouds of smoke billowing from the Bellandur lake replete with sewage, chemical effluents and construction debris, even as steps were being taken to douse the inferno PTI Updated 19 Jan 2018, 09:51 PM IST Bellandur lake in Bengaluru is in bad shape despite the National Green Tribunal  pulling up the Karnataka government and its various agencies for failing to prevent pollution. Photo: PTI Bengaluru: A huge fire emanated from the highly polluted Bellandur lake, the biggest water body of the city, giving anxious moments to hundreds of residents living nearby. The locals noticed huge clouds of smoke billowing from the lake replete with sewage, chemical effluents and construction debris. The fire was in the middle of the wetlands, fire brigade officials said. Soon pictures and videos of the smoke and fire went viral even as various government agencies and Defence personnel doused the blaze, which also raised concerns about apathy of civic agencies towards a recurring problem in the lake. According to Defence officials, a strong contingent of 5,000 army jawans of the ASC centre led by Major General N S Rajpurohit doused the fire in the lake. Spread over 1,000 acres near the infotech hub, the lake is highly contaminated receiving 60% of the sewage generated in the city. The lake is in bad shape despite the National Green Tribunal pulling up the government and its various agencies for failing to prevent pollution and not doing enough to restore the lake to its pristine glory. Bengaluru Mayor R Sampath Raj said the fire seems to be an outcome of the accumulation of chemicals. The water samples will be collected and tested to find the reason behind the fire, he said. Raj said government agencies and Bangalore Development Authority and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) would seek the assistance of the Indian Institute of Science to find the reason and chalk out steps to prevent any recurrence. Following the incident, a blame game erupted between the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the defence department. KSPCB chairman Lakshman alleged that the fire started from the land held by the defence department and spread to the lake area. \u201cActual cause of the fire is not known.It started from the defence area. We have taken the samples of the water and will send it to lab for ascertaining the reasons behind the fire,\u201d Lakshman said. The defence department maintained that the fire was in the lake area and not anywhere near the land held by it. Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Chandrasekhar, whose organisation Namma Bengaluru Foundation, had petitioned the National Green Tribunal to save the lake, flayed the government for its \u201cinability\u201d to protect the lake. \u201cI think it is evident that the Siddaramaiah government is not serious about protecting the lakes and abiding by the NGT\u2019s directions on maintaining the sanctity of its buffer zone,\u201d he said. The state government is going to spend \u20b9 80,000 crore in the next 75 days on various projects but not a single penny will be spent on the improvement of any of the lakes in Bengaluru, Chandrasekhar alleged. The Bellandur lake had caught fire in May 2015 and August 2016, also. In 2015, the lake had turned into a frothy, foam-filled water body due to the high concentration of pollutants in the water. Foam from the lake had spilled onto the roads and other areas surrounding the lake. The Varthur lake also had caught fire in May, 2017 when some garbage was set ablaze.

{"year":"2018","month":"01","event_desc":"- Supreme Court of India made playing the National Anthem of India in movie halls not mandatory, reversing its earlier order after the Indian Central Government opposed the move and formed a committee to form guidelines about the issue.","text":"Home News India SC modifies order, says playing of national anthem in cinema halls is not mandatory On November 30, 2016, the court ordered all cinemas to play the anthem before screening a film \u201cfor the love of the motherland\u201d. Updated - January 09, 2018 06:41 pm IST - New Delhi Krishnadas Rajagopal Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT The national anthem being played before the start of a show in Chennai in 2016. The Supreme Court on Tuesday modified its November 30, 2016 interim order and made it optional for cinema halls to play the 52-second national anthem before every show.                        A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, clarified that it is not mandatory to play the anthem before screenings in cinemas. It left the choice of whether to play the anthem or not to the discretion of individual cinema hall owners. However, if the anthem is played, patrons in the hall are bound to show respect by standing up. The court clarified that the exception granted to disabled persons from standing up during the anthem \u201cshall remain in force on all occasions\u201d. The court, this time, instead of shooting from its own shoulders, banked on a Home Ministry order of 2015, which directs that \u201cwhenever the Anthem is sung or played, the audience shall stand to attention\u201d. \u201cPlaying of the anthem is directive, but showing respect is mandatory,\u201d Chief Justice Misra orally observed. The court pointed out its judgment in the famed Bijoe Emmanuel versus State of Kerala case, which dealt with three children belonging to the Jehovah Witnesses sect refusing to sing the anthem in the school assembly though they stood up in respect, to drive in the point that standing up is indeed a sign of \u201cproper respect\u201d to the anthem. \u201cProper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung,\u201d the Bench quoted Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy\u2019s words in the Bijoe Emmanuel verdict. Report due in six months The modification will be in place till the Union government takes a final decision on the recommendations of a 12-member high-profile inter-ministerial committee regarding the occasions, circumstances and events for the solemn rendering of the anthem. The ministerial panel will examine whether any amendments are necessary to the Prevention of Insult to National Honour Act of 1971 to expand or specify the meaning of \u201crespect\u201d to the national anthem. The committee, which was set up on December 5, 2017, will submit its report in six months. The 1971 Act states: \u201cWhoever intentionally prevents the singing of the Jana Gana Mana or causes disturbances to any assembly engaged in such singing shall be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\u201d Attorney General K.K. Venugopal submitted that the ministerial panel would conduct a comprehensive study of the issue. The government began the hearing by referring to its latest affidavit, suggesting to the court to modify its November 30 order and give cinema owners discretion till the ministerial panel takes a final call. Referring to incidents of complaints filed under the 1971 Act against Infosys founder Narayanamurthy and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for 'disrespecting' the anthem, Mr. Venugopal submitted \u201crespect or disrespect to the anthem has to be decided on a case to case basis. Your Lordships cannot think of a 1000 ways of respect to the anthem\u201d. Leaving the ball in the government\u2019s court, the Bench said, \u201cThree things are obvious. The anthem has to be respected as it is the salutation to the motherland. The list of occasions for showing respect to the anthem. Proper decorum has to be maintained during the anthem.\u201d \u2018Interpret the 1971 Act\u2019 Advocate Abhinav Shrivastav, for petitioner S.N. Chouksey, argued that the guidelines in respect of the anthem by the inter-ministerial panel would hardly accomplish compliance from the public. He said similar executive orders were issued in 2012 and 2016, but to no avail. Mr. Shrivastav urged the Supreme Court to intervene and interpret the 1971 Act in the light of Article 51A of the Constitution which calls for ''respecting the ideals of the nation like the Constitution, the National Flag and the National Anthem.'' \u201cThe Act is totally widely worded. What will constitute disrespect of the National Anthem? The government\u2019s guidelines have no teeth. The court will have to interpret respect to the anthem,\u201d senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, for an intervenor, urged. \u201cThe National Anthem is a tool for national integration. The Preamble uses the word \u2018fraternity\u2019 and assures integrity. The court\u2019s order to play the Anthem in cinemas and for all to stand regardless of caste or religion subserves the cause of integrity. Therefore the November 30 order should not be recalled,\u201d Mr. Shrivastav submitted. ''Sacred element'' Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan submitted that the anthem has a ceremonial significance, has a \u201csacred element\u201d, which should not be trivialised by playing it four times a day in cinemas. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya submitted that national symbols like the anthem identifies with the term \u2018secular\u2019 in the Preamble and unifies diverse communities. Senior advocate C.U. Singh, for the Kodungalloor Film Society, submitted that the petitioners were in the wrong forum and should make their arguments for change in law before Parliament. Advocate P.V. Dinesh said the court should consider the plight of film festival organisers and lovers who would be forced to play and stand up dozens of times in a day before every screening. The Supreme Court disposed of the petitions, agreeing with Mr. Venugopal that the petitioners could make their representations before the inter-ministerial committee.

The protest rally, termed Kisan Long March, is one-of-its-kind as no protest in the recent past involving so many people has been carried out so peacefully garnering support from all corners, including citizens and a number of political parties. Advertisement Here are five things to know about the protest rally: Not only about farm loan waiver In 2017, the Maharashtra government announced a conditional Rs 34,000 crore loan waiver loan waiver but it was not implemented properly. According to reports , 2,414 farmers killed themselves in the state between January 1 and October 31, 2017. This time, the farmers are demanding complete and unconditional farm loan waiver, including electricity bills. Implementation of the Swaminathan Commission Report (2006), announcement of minimum support price for agriculture produce, and pension scheme for farmers also feature among the demands. Though the government made promises to the people in the past, it\u00a0failed to honour its word. But the thousands of people walking to the capital do not only comprise farmers. There are tribal cultivators too demanding implementation of the Forest Rights Act, which accords the rights of the forest to the forest-dwelling communities. The state government has set up a six-member committee to look into the demands. Farmers at Mumbai's Azad Maidan (Photo: @KisanSabha) 180km in six days While the agrarian crisis of Maharashtra has been a much discussed issue, this is the first time that the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), the agriculture wing of the CPM, has taken the protest to the heart of the capital. In 2017, the AIKS observed a 11-day farmers\u2019 strike and a road blockade across the state, but most of their protests, being confined within districts, never succeeded\u00a0in\u00a0attracting the\u00a0attention of city residents. Advertisement Preparations for the six-day march began soon after it was announced on February 21. Several village-level meetings took place to mobilise the farmers along with the tribals. The rally began on March 6 from CBS Chowk in Nashik. Braving the heat, the protesters, including women and senior citizens, crossed 35km a day on an average . They halted at several places, cooked food and restarted their jouney. The rally entered Mumbai on Sunday and reached Azad Maidan on Monday morning.

The court, this time, instead of shooting from its own shoulders, banked on a Home Ministry order of 2015, which directs that \u201cwhenever the Anthem is sung or played, the audience shall stand to attention\u201d. \u201cPlaying of the anthem is directive, but showing respect is mandatory,\u201d Chief Justice Misra orally observed. The court pointed out its judgment in the famed Bijoe Emmanuel versus State of Kerala case, which dealt with three children belonging to the Jehovah Witnesses sect refusing to sing the anthem in the school assembly though they stood up in respect, to drive in the point that standing up is indeed a sign of \u201cproper respect\u201d to the anthem. \u201cProper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung,\u201d the Bench quoted Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy\u2019s words in the Bijoe Emmanuel verdict. Report due in six months The modification will be in place till the Union government takes a final decision on the recommendations of a 12-member high-profile inter-ministerial committee regarding the occasions, circumstances and events for the solemn rendering of the anthem. The ministerial panel will examine whether any amendments are necessary to the Prevention of Insult to National Honour Act of 1971 to expand or specify the meaning of \u201crespect\u201d to the national anthem. The committee, which was set up on December 5, 2017, will submit its report in six months. The 1971 Act states: \u201cWhoever intentionally prevents the singing of the Jana Gana Mana or causes disturbances to any assembly engaged in such singing shall be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\u201d Attorney General K.K. Venugopal submitted that the ministerial panel would conduct a comprehensive study of the issue. The government began the hearing by referring to its latest affidavit, suggesting to the court to modify its November 30 order and give cinema owners discretion till the ministerial panel takes a final call. Referring to incidents of complaints filed under the 1971 Act against Infosys founder Narayanamurthy and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for 'disrespecting' the anthem, Mr. Venugopal submitted \u201crespect or disrespect to the anthem has to be decided on a case to case basis. Your Lordships cannot think of a 1000 ways of respect to the anthem\u201d. Leaving the ball in the government\u2019s court, the Bench said, \u201cThree things are obvious. The anthem has to be respected as it is the salutation to the motherland. The list of occasions for showing respect to the anthem. Proper decorum has to be maintained during the anthem.\u201d \u2018Interpret the 1971 Act\u2019 Advocate Abhinav Shrivastav, for petitioner S.N. Chouksey, argued that the guidelines in respect of the anthem by the inter-ministerial panel would hardly accomplish compliance from the public. He said similar executive orders were issued in 2012 and 2016, but to no avail. Mr. Shrivastav urged the Supreme Court to intervene and interpret the 1971 Act in the light of Article 51A of the Constitution which calls for ''respecting the ideals of the nation like the Constitution, the National Flag and the National Anthem.'' \u201cThe Act is totally widely worded. What will constitute disrespect of the National Anthem? The government\u2019s guidelines have no teeth. The court will have to interpret respect to the anthem,\u201d senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, for an intervenor, urged. \u201cThe National Anthem is a tool for national integration. The Preamble uses the word \u2018fraternity\u2019 and assures integrity. The court\u2019s order to play the Anthem in cinemas and for all to stand regardless of caste or religion subserves the cause of integrity. Therefore the November 30 order should not be recalled,\u201d Mr. Shrivastav submitted. ''Sacred element'' Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan submitted that the anthem has a ceremonial significance, has a \u201csacred element\u201d, which should not be trivialised by playing it four times a day in cinemas. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya submitted that national symbols like the anthem identifies with the term \u2018secular\u2019 in the Preamble and unifies diverse communities. Senior advocate C.U. Singh, for the Kodungalloor Film Society, submitted that the petitioners were in the wrong forum and should make their arguments for change in law before Parliament. Advocate P.V. Dinesh said the court should consider the plight of film festival organisers and lovers who would be forced to play and stand up dozens of times in a day before every screening. The Supreme Court disposed of the petitions, agreeing with Mr. Venugopal that the petitioners could make their representations before the inter-ministerial committee.

{"year":"2018","month":"01","event_desc":"- Central Statistics Office estimates GDP Growth at 6.5% for the 201718 financial year, compared to 7.1% for the previous year. The estimates quote the effects of GST transition and agrarian distress for the slowest growth in four years and forecast growth to pick up in the next year.","text":"Watch: FY18 GDP advance estimate at 6.5 pct NEW DELHI: The Indian economy is forecast to grow at its slowest in four years in FY18 but is expected to pick up pace in the second half of the year. GDP is seen growing 6.5% in FY18, down from 7.1% last year, according to the first advance estimates released by the statistics office on Friday. Gross value added (GVA) growth is forecast at 6.1% against 6.6% last year. In the first half, GDP growth was only 6% because of the disruption caused by the goods and services tax (GST) and the lingering impact of demonetisation. \u201cGDP growth of 6.5% for 2017-18 implies growth of 7% for the second half,\u201d economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg tweeted. \u201cConfirms strong turnaround of economy. Investment growth of almost twice of last year\u2019s indicate investment reviving.\u201d Chief statistician TCA Anant echoed those sentiments. \u201cEffectively, we are calculating the H2 growth in the economy at around 7%... maintain the trend of increasing growth.\u201d He added that manufacturing estimates included GST impact during the initial quarters. GST was imposed on July 1last year. \u2018Conservative Estimate\u2019 \u201cIn a way, we are being conservative in our estimates,\u201d he said, and added that the statistics office has estimated the numbers assuming that budgetary targets will be met. Growth is below the government\u2019s early estimate. The second instalment of the Economic Survey released in August last year had seen growth at the lower end of the 6.75-7.5% range forecast in February. The lower growth will raise pressure on finance minister Arun Jaitley ahead of the February 1 budget to take steps to strengthen recovery even as he allocates more funds for key stakeholders ahead of elections next year. Live Events The Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to cut rates, with retail inflation climbing to a 15-month high of 4.88% in November. RBI had forecast a higher GVA growth of 6.7%. Net taxes on products are added to GVA to arrive at GDP. GVA growth is expected to decline to a three-year low of 6.1% in FY18. GDP growth will become more robust in FY19, according to NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar. Economic activity has been picking up over the last three quarters and can be expected to strengthen in the coming period with manufacturing PMI at a five-year high and demand for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) picking up briskly, he said. The estimates assume significance in the wake of the fact that the higher second-half growth has come despite a waning of public sector expenditure, which had peaked in FY17 on account of the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission. Upward Revision Likely Industry and experts expect growth to be revised upward. The forecast factors in data up to November. Subsequent data \u2013 core sector, purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), and vehicle sales \u2013 have been upbeat, corroborating the second-half recovery estimated in the number released. India's per capita income, a gauge for measuring living standard, is likely to rise to Rs 1.11 lakh in FY18 but the growth would be slower at 8.3% compared with 9.7% growth in 2016-17. The advance estimates \u201care not fully factoring in the expected pickup in growth in the later months of FY18, related to a favourable base effect and a 'catchup' following the subdued growth momentum in H1 FY18,\u201d said Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA. ICRA expects GVA growth to reach 7.5% in the last quarter of the fiscal and full-year GDP growth of 6.7%, higher than these first estimates. \u201cWhile this gives the impression of a downturn, in reality, growth has bottomed out in the first quarter of the current year and is now on a recovery,\u201d the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said in a release. \u201cIt is possible that this number will be revised up once more data is available for the third and fourth quarter of the year.\u201d Investments are set to recover with gross fixed capital formation expected to grow 4.5% in FY18 from 2.4% in FY17. Demonetisation in November 2016 and the imposition of GST last year have dented spending with private expenditure growth expected to slow to 6.3% in the current fiscal from 8.7% last year. \u201cThe two reform measures which were expected to formalise the economy have led to a fall in growth in the short term,\u201d said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings. \u201cHowever, green shoots in investment are visible and they should be nurtured by supportive policies.\u201d The lower demand has dented manufacturing that will grow 4.6% this year against 7.9% last year. Agriculture will slow to 2.1% from 4.9%. Construction will see a slight pickup to 3.6% from 1.7%. \u201cThe slowdown in the domestic economic growth can be largely attributed to the GST led disturbances while the economy was in the nascent stages of recovery post demonetisation,\u201d said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings. Services are forecast to grow 7.6% up from 6.9% last year. The statistics office will release economic growth data for the October-December quarter on February 28, along with revised full-year growth estimates for FY18.

The first no-confidence motion was moved against Jawaharlal Nehru in August 1963 by J B Kripalani. The last no-confidence was moved in 2003 by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi against the Vajpayee-led NDA government. Only once in the history of the lower house has the prime minister resigned after a no-confidence motion. In 1979, Morarji Desai resigned as the discussion on the motion was inconclusive. According to details available with Lok Sabha secretariat, six no-confidence motions were moved in the third and the fourth Lok Sabha, the maximum. The third Lok Sabha, from 1962 to 1967 saw three prime ministers -- Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. The fourth Lok Sabha was from 1967 to 1970 with Indira Gandhi as prime minister. Four of the 15 no-confidence motions against Indira Gandhi were moved by CPI(M) leader Jyotirmnoy Basu.

PM Modi inaugurates Sardar Patel statue: World\u2019s tallest statue in 10 points A look at the 10 features of the Sardar Patel statue, or the Statue of Unity, which was inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary today. Nikhil Agarwal Updated 31 Oct 2018, 12:04 PM IST If you are about 6 feet tall, the State of Unity is 100 times larger than you. New Delhi: An engineering marvel completed in a record time of 33 months, the world\u2019s tallest statue\u2014Sardar Patel\u2019s statue or the Statue of Unity\u2014was inaugurated during a gala function on Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u2019s birth anniversary today on 31 October. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had laid the foundation stone for the project on 31 October 2013, was also the one to inaugurate it on Wednesday. Double the height of the Statue of Liberty in New York, the Sardar Patel statue near the Narmada Dam in Gujarat is not only the tallest in the world but also the one to be completed in the shortest time. The 182-metre Statue of Unity took 33 months to complete while China\u2019s Spring Temple Buddha statue took 11 years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the inauguration of Sardar Patel\u2019s Statue of Unity in Gujarat\u2019s Narmada district. Here is a list of 10 interesting features of the Sardar Patel statue in Gujarat: 1. Built by Larsen & Toubro Ltd at a cost of \u20b9 2,989 crore, the Statue of Unity is made up of 1,700 tonnes of bronze and 1,850 tonnes of bronze cladding on the exterior. The interior is filled with concrete cement (180,000 cubic metres), reinforced steel (18,500 tonnes) and structured steel (6,500 tonnes). 2. If you are about 5.6 feet tall, the giant State of Unity is 100 times larger than you. 3. There are two high-speed passenger elevators in the statue\u2019s core which take you up to the chest of the statue to a viewing gallery, which can accommodate 200 tourists at a time. This is also the best place to get a bird\u2019s eye view of the picturesque environs of the Narmada river and its dam surrounded by the Satpura and Vindhyachal hills. 4. With a three-star hotel, museum and audio visual gallery, the government has tried to build an entire ecosystem of tourism infrastructure centered on the statue in the remote, hilly terrain. 5. The construction of the Sardar Patel statue has had its own engineering challenges, not just due to its height but also because of its location in the middle of the Narmada river and the walking pose of Sardar Vallabhai Patel. The statue is designed to withstand winds of almost 180km\/hour and earthquakes measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. 6. Noida-based sculptor Ram V. Sutar, who designed the statue, took special care to ensure that the statue\u2019s face resembles Patel\u2019s facial features. For the process, around 2,000 photographs from archives were studied. Historians and people who had seen the \u201cIron Man\u201d were also consulted. From a distance, it appears as if Sardar Patel is walking on water towards the Sardar Sarovar dam. The headmen of 22 villages have situated near the Sardar Sarovar dam have written an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that villagers would not welcome him at the inauguration of the Statue of Unity on October 31. 7. The Gujarat government is also building a 3.5km long highway for tourists to reach the statue from Kevadia town. 8. A 320-metre-long designer bridge connects Sadhu island to the mainland. You can also take a boat ride. 9. Around 135 metric tonnes of iron were crowdsourced from lakhs of villages all over India for use in the project. 10. Clicking images at the statue site will be easier with a selfie point that has a good vantage point for photography. Catch all the Politics News and Updates on Live Mint.

KPMG & COAI release report titled \u201cNew Digital Horizons \u2013 Connect, Create and Innovate. The digital economy is expected to cross USD 1 trillion by FY22, according to the report. Highlighting the detailed trends in ICT sector, it predicted that mobile data usage in India, which is already high, is further expected to surge 5 times by the 2023. This will further witness digital diversity in the online audience taking it from the current 225 million in FY18 to 550 million by FY23. The near ubiquitous reach of connectivity makes the telecom sector the key enabler to deliver development to the very last mile through Digital India and a Mobile First approach. This report highlights how the New Digital Horizon is un-folding for India and the pivotal role that telecom sector plays in providing India an opportunity to power ahead of the rest of the world as a digital economy. The report focuses on how the trinity of regulators, academia and industry can collaborate to Connect India , create an ecosystem for ICT players to thrive to contribute to the growth of digital India and Innovate to bring in faster growth in technology adoption and network solutions \u2013 that will allow for a hitherto unforeseen socio-economic development for the country. Speaking at the launch, Rajan S Mathews, Director General, COAI said \u201cThe report bears cognizance of the fact that a New Digital Horizon is making its mark and the telecom sector is playing an indispensable role in catapulting India\u2019s economy to forge ahead of the rest of the world. The prized trinity \u2013 regulators, academia and industry are collaborating to Connect India, create an ecosystem for ICT players to thrive and to contribute to the growth of digital India and Innovate \u2013 to bring in a faster growth in technology adoption and network solutions. We envision an empowered society where every individual participates in the socio-economic growth of the country.\u201d Speaking on the findings of the report, Purushothaman KG, Partner \u2013 TMT Advisory, KPMG in India , said, \u201cOur studies globally, across 15 countries including India, ranks India in the top three on tech leadership and shows most promise for disruptive technological breakthroughs that will have a global impact. Our studies also show that IoT followed by AI, robotics, and blockchain will make India a leading game changer in ushering the digital revolution. Despite some of the challenges faced by the ecosystem, India is the fastest growing and second largest telecom market in the world. India will see a wonderful convergence between connectivity, user driven content and disruption in technology that will lead a way to a digital India. India therefore offers immense potential and a strong destination for investors.\u201d As technologies have started traversing across industries, business models are going to be disrupted. KPMG survey also highlighted that media and entertainment, followed by automotive, retail, FS, and education are likely to be disrupted the most.\u00a0 To remain at the epicenter of this revolution, telecom operators will have to innovate beyond connectivity. It needs to become the platform to allow the interplay of these technologies to create digital solutions across varied industries Not only is the Indian telecom sector furthering the government\u2019s ambitious Digital India program so that it reaches all and sundry, but it is now playing an instrumental role in bringing in innovative technologies such as 5G, M2M, AI, AR, and VR, which will shape India in the coming times by permeating and transforming every sector linked to economic development. The mobile and the internet have played a decisive role in democratizing technology and democratizing access to services and use cases, based on these very technologies. Although 5G is likely to be the key enabler of the fourth industrial revolution and an integrated ecosystem across B2B, B2C, and B2G, till it is launched, the telcos will have to improve on its existing networks to enhance its performance. To succeed, they will need to learn new ways of working in the new ecosystem so that they can accelerate their digital strategies and opportunities, make the right level of innovation investments, and stay ahead of customer needs. 5G stole the limelight at IMC 2018 Day 1, with Live Demonstrations.

One such session involved a discussion on \u201cSmart Cities: Automating the way we live\u201d. Speech, Mukesh D Ambani , Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited at the inaugural session. \u201cIndia that is poised to embrace an immensely exciting future. Just one data point\u2026 In my lifetime, I have always been told that India has the largest number of extremely poor people in the world. \u00a0But that is no longer the case today. A World Bank report indicates that India will have fewer than 3 percent of its population living under extreme poverty by 2021. As per a United Nations report as many as 271 million people have been liberated from the prison of poverty in the last decade alone. This is a truly historic achievement and the credit rightly belongs to all our citizens. Today, India is among the fastest growing large economies in the world. This has happened due to a combination of force-multiplying factors. Most notable among these is the visionary leadership of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the past 5 years, he has galvanized India. He has launched more number of transformative initiatives than in a comparable period anywhere in the world. An equally important factor is the contribution of Indian entrepreneurs, especially those in the telecom, IT and digital space. Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit. India has moved from 155th rank in mobile broadband penetration to being the number 1 nation in mobile data consumption in the world in less than 2 years. This is the fastest transition anywhere in the world from 2G\/3G to 4G. By 2020, I believe that India will be a fully-4G country and ready for 5G ahead of others. Every phone in India will be a 4G enabled phone and every customer will have access to 4G connectivity. At Jio, we are committed to connecting everyone and everything everywhere always with the highest quality and the most affordable price. What gives me special satisfaction is the silent revolution taking place in rural India. I am personally excited about the promise and prospect of bringing Digital Revolution to India\u2019s villages to agriculture and rural enterprises to women and to marginalized communities everywhere. I am equally excited about connecting millions of small shop-keepers in India. The Digital Connectivity Revolution can transform Rural India most comprehensively. In the past 8 months alone, as many as 50 million villagers have got affordable smartphones. For most of them, it is not only their pehla phone but also their pehla radio and music player, pehla TV, pehla camera, and pehla internet in their lives. Imagine what this 5-in-1 means for the aspirational explosion in India. And imagine how it can transform India when it becomes 6-in-1 with Indians getting the revolutionary power of pehla artificial intelligence in their hands. All this at only Rs. 100 per month. This combination of connectivity with affordability is unparalleled in the world. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the government\u2019s BharatNet program in providing high-quality connectivity in some of the remotest areas of our country. This transformation will accelerate as we get ready for a 5G world driven by the pro-active approach of the government. Today at the IMC, you can experience 5G and its various use-cases in our pavilion. Friends, with JioGigaFiber, we have now begun an ambitious push in fixed broadband through fiber-to-the-home and premise. Jio is committed to building a deep-fiber network across the country and ensuring that every premise is connected with the highest quality network. All of us are proud that India has become the world\u2019s largest mobile data consuming nation. \u00a0We now have a similar opportunity to replicate this success in fixed broadband as well. I believe India will rise from a lowly 135th rank to be amongst the top three nations in fixed broadband at a pace that will surprise the world. And from day one, JioGigaFiber will offer complete fixed-mobile convergence where Indians will travel seamlessly between mobile and fixed broadband networks 4G and 5G when on the move and Wi-Fi when indoors. Friends, we can together create a period of unprecedented growth, empowerment, employment, and prosperity for everyone across our great nation. In a future that will be shaped by the 4 th Industrial Revolution . A future founded on the robust pillars of connectivity, computing, and data. A future powered by path-breaking digital technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, internet of things, virtual reality, and augmented reality. A future of exponential growth and immense opportunities for 130 crore connected Indians. This revolution will open the floodgates of limitless possibilities for India and Indians, especially young Indians. I assure you that our industry will play the role of a catalyst in this mission of propelling our nation toward this bright future. We have to be mindful that data is the most important resource in this new world. And India and Indians will generate humungous amount of data. It is important that we utilize this rich-resource for the benefit of India and Indians, with adequate safeguards. With universal connectivity and extreme affordability , our Prime Minister\u2019s inspiring idea of ease of living for all can now be realized. With world-class digital infrastructure in place, India is now ready to not only embrace but actually lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is because, each one of the 130 crore people of India can now productively participate in the 4 th Industrial Revolution . We can solve the largest unsolved problems facing humanity, right here in India. Let me mention only four. First . The 4 th Industrial Revolution can realize the Prime Minister\u2019s promise of doubling the incomes of 150 million Indian farmers. Second . It can realize the Ayushman Bharat scheme\u2019s promise of bringing healthcare to 500 million people \u2500 the largest health insurance initiative in the world. Third . It can bring quality education to 200 million students in Indian schools and colleges. Fourth , and not the least, it can create more jobs with the digitally-connected and AI-powered marketplace of small merchants and small enterprises \u2500 which I call new commerce for new India. India will demonstrate the greatest digital transformation in people\u2019s lives in world history. India will be among the largest digital markets in the world. \u00a0Every enterprise must have an \u2018India First\u2019 vision to participate in this market. \u00a0We will need to reinvent to grow and nurture this market to its full potential. This will be a win-win for the entire industry for India and for the entire world. To achieve this we need a grand coalition \u2013 of everyone in the industry, government, civil society, and the citizens. I strongly believe that India will enable every citizen to realize her fullest potential on the back of this grand coalition. May God bless our great nation\u2026 India.\u201d Vendor Participation.

The insertion maneuver is essential to nullify the\n            X and Z velocity components and attain the required Y-velocity in the L1 rotating frame for the\n            required Halo orbit. The targeted Halo-orbit for Aditya-L1 is Ax: 209200 km, Ay : 663200 km and Az :\n            120000 km (The semi-axes of the 3-dimensional Halo orbit-refer figure). The insertion of Aditya-L1 into this Halo orbit presents a critical mission phase, which demanded\n            precise navigation and control. A successful insertion further involved constant monitoring along\n            with the adjustment of the spacecraft's speed and position by using onboard thrusters. The success\n            of this insertion not only signifies ISRO's capabilities in such complex orbital manoeuvres, but it but\n            gives confidence to handle future interplanetary missions. Aditya-L1 was designed and realised at UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) with participation from\n            various ISRO centres. The payloads onboard Aditya-L1 were developed by Indian scientific\n            laboratories, IIA, IUCAA and ISRO. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was launched by PSLV-C57 on September\n            2, 2023 from SDSC SHAR, into an elliptical parking orbit (EPO) of 235.6 km by 19502.7 km. From\n            here, Aditya-L1 embarked on an extraordinary journey towards the Sun-Earth-L1 Lagrange point,\n            with the help of the onboard propulsion system, increased its orbital size progressively and moved\n            toward L1 point. Five liquid engine burns (LEB) were executed during Earth orbit phase; gradually\n            raised the apogee of the EPO in order to attain the desired trajectory with the fifth burn, known as the trans-L1\n            injection (TL1I) maneuver. The maneuver strategy is carefully devised to minimize\n            incremental velocity addition (\u0394V) for reaching the target L1 halo orbit while restricting the number\n            of perigee passes to minimize the spacecraft's exposure to the high radiation Van Allen radiation\n            belts. To address errors during, TL1I phase, a short burn of the engines, called TCM-1 was conducted\n            on October 5, 2023, and another TCM-2 on December 14, 2023 to ensure compliance with Halo orbit\n            insertion condition parameters. The spacecraft underwent a cruise phase lasting approximately 110\n            days to achieve the present condition prior to HOI targeted on January 6, 2024. All the payloads were tested during the pre-commissioning phase and performance of all the payload is confirmed to be satisfactory. The picture below shows the Halo orbit insertion process graphically in a two dimension picture. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was moving from Earth towards the L1 point in the direction of Sun. The TCM1 &2 firing oriented the spacecraft toward the Halo Orbit, making it reach the HOI condition (which is a minimum fuel consumption condition) as on 6th January 2024 (Marked by the red dot). The final firing was done at this point, making the spacecraft align with the Halo Orbit. If the HOI manoeuvre was not conducted as done today, the spacecraft would have moved in the direction marked (Without HOI).

Huge traffic snarls and sporadic incidents of violence were reported from northern and western states of India on Tuesday as the truck drivers blocked roads in protest. Under the new law, hit-and-run cases where drivers flee the scene without informing authorities after causing serious road accidents would face punishment of up to 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs700,000 (\u00a36,648). The agitation, which began on Monday, has disrupted many supply chains, leading to a shortage of gas cylinders and increased prices for vegetables and other essential commodities. open image in gallery People with their vehicles wait to refill fuel tanks at a fuel station in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh ( AFP via Getty Images ) The changes to punishments for hit-and-run cases are listed under the country\u2019s new criminal code, the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, which replaces the colonial-era Indian Penal Code. It was signed into law in December 2023 after being cleared by both houses of the Indian parliament, although many of the country\u2019s opposition MPs were suspended at the time . Over 2,000 fuel stations ran out of petrol as people rushed to fill up in anticipation of an expected truckers ' strike, according to PTI news agency. The state government in Maharashtra urged the local police to ensure an uninterrupted supply of petrol and diesel. \"Don't believe in rumours. There [is] enough stock available in Mumbai and we are providing adequate security to the tankers supplying petroleum products,\" the Mumbai city police said in a post on social media.

Those who made such posts on social media while in government positions have now been suspended from their jobs,\" the Maldives government said in a statement. Shiuna's tweet, which has now been deleted, described PM Modi in a derogatory way using emojis. Malsha also shared PM Modi's video on X using derisive emojis. Maldivian politician Zahid Rameez, a council member of the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), which is part of the ruling collation, mocked the PM's visit and said India would never be able to compete with Maldives in regards to tourism. \"The move [promoting Lakshadweep] is great. However, the idea of competing with us is delusional. How can they provide the service we offer?,\" said Rameez. Earlier in the day - under immense pressure to set the record straight and assure India -- the Maldives government had distanced itself from the derogatory remarks made by Shiuna and other leaders. In a statement, the government had said the \"opinions are personal and do not represent the views of the Government of Maldives\". \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe government believes that the freedom of expression should be exercised in a democratic and responsible manner, and in ways that do not spread hatred, negativity, and hinder close relationships between the Maldives and international partners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Maldives government statement added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe relevant authorities of the government will not hesitate to take action against those who make such derogatory remarks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the statement added. Former presidents condemn 'hateful language' Former president of Maldives, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who was defeated by pro-China leader Mohamed Muizzu in the recent elections, condemned the use of \"hateful language against India by Maldivian government officials on social media\". \"India has always been a good friend to Maldives and we must not allow such callous remarks to negatively impact the age old friendship between our two countries,\" he said. Former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed also condemned the local leaders for their derogatory remarks and said such language was \"appalling\", adding that India is a \"key ally\" for the security and prosperity of the archipelago nation. Former foreign minister of Maldives Abdulla Shahid called the remarks made by Maldivian leaders as \"reprehensible and odious\". Amid Maldives row, Salman Khan, Shraddha Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and other celebs ask Indians to plan Lakshadweep trip: 'Why should we tolerate such unprovoked hate?' Boycott Maldives The anti-India comments prompted several Indian celebrities and social media influencers to call for a boycott of the Maldives and its tourist spots. Many social media users posted pictures of their cancelled hotel stays or air tickets to Maldives. Actor Akshay Kumar, Sachin Tendulkar, cricketer Aakash Chopra and others appealed to Indians to cancel trips to Maldives and instead opt for domestic destinations. Meanwhile actors Salman Khan, John Abraham, Shraddha Kapoor, and others praised Lakshadweep's beauty. Indian tourists made up a large chunk of visitors to the Maldives till December 2023. According to the Maldives tourism ministry, a total of 1,757,939 tourists arrived in the island nation till December 13, an increase of 12.6% compared to the 1.5 million arrivals recorded in 2022.

The 21.8-kilometre-long sea bridge from South to Navi Mumbai (between Sewri and Nhava Sheva) will cut down the journey from the current two hours to just around 15-20 minutes. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who announced the inauguration of the bridge, said it would also bring economic development and growth in areas connected to it. The bridge, officially the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri-Nhava Sheva Atal Setu, has been built at a cost of Rs 21,200 crore, of which Rs 15,000 crore is by way of loans.

The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will travel through 100 Lok Sabha segments in 15 states and the party believes it will prove to be as \"transformative\" as Mr. Gandhi's earlier cross-country march. The Congress has said that it is taking out the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra as the government did not give it a chance to raise people's issues in Parliament and the initiative is aimed at re-establishing the principles of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity enshrined in the Constitution. Though the Congress has stressed that this is not an electoral yatra, it comes at a crucial juncture as the party seeks to revive its fortunes after a poor showing in the last round of assembly elections. With the BJP focusing on the January 22 Ram temple consecration ceremony , the Congress wants to put the spotlight on bread-and-butter issues through this yatra. Mr. Gandhi had on Friday said emotional issues are being \"misused\" politically and attention is being diverted from real issues, in a \"betrayal\" of the people of the country. In a post on X, the former Congress president said, \"The youth will have to think about what will be the identity of the India of our dreams? Quality of life or just emotions? Youth raising provocative slogans or the employed youth? Love or hate?\". The yatra will be flagged off from a private ground in Manipur's Thoubal district, instead of Imphal, the party's initial choice. Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is to highlight the \u2018anyay kaal\u2019 of the Modi-led government: Congress The state government had given the Congress conditional approval to flag off the yatra from the Palace grounds here, restricting the number of people. Therefore, the Congress decided to opt for another venue. Manipur has been rocked by ethnic violence since May last year which has claimed over 180 lives. The violence erupted on May 3 last year after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and all top leaders of the party will be in Thoubal to flag off the yatra. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would traverse 6,713 km mostly in buses but also on foot. The yatra will cover 110 districts, 100 Lok Sabha seats and 337 assembly segments in 67 days, before its finale in Mumbai on March 20 or 21. The Congress has said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is being organised to raise voice against the \"injustice\" of the last 10 years. It has released a \"Nyay anthem\" with the tagline \"Saho Mat, Daro Mat (do not suffer, do not be scared)\". The anthem was shared on all the social media handles of the party with a video featuring protesting women wrestlers, glimpses from Mr. Gandhi's Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra and his interactions with farmers and labourers. The Congress has also invited all leaders of the Indian National Inclusive Developmental Alliance (INDIA) bloc to join the yatra anywhere along its route. According to the route released by the party, the yatra would stay the longest in Uttar Pradesh, covering 1,074 km in 11 days. It would pass through politically vital areas, including Amethi, the Gandhi family bastion Rae Bareli and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency of Varanasi. BJP trying to create hurdles for Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, says Congress Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh has asserted that the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would prove to be as impactful and transformative as the earlier over 4,000-km Bharat Jodo Yatra. During the Bharat Jodo Yatra , Gandhi had raised three big issues of rising inequality, growing social polarisation and increasing political tyranny and authoritarianism, and the way out of this is to ensure justice for people, Ramesh has said. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will be in Manipur for a day. It will then enter Nagaland and cover 257 km and five districts in two days before covering 833 km and 17 districts in Assam in eight days. The yatra will then move to Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya for a day each. According to the route map, the yatra will be in West Bengal for five days, covering 523 km and seven districts, and in Bihar for four days, covering 425 km and seven districts. In Jharkhand, the yatra will cover 804 km and 13 districts in eight days. In Odisha, the yatra will cover 341 km and four districts in four days and cover 536 km and seven districts in Chhattisgarh over five days. The east-to-west yatra will spend the maximum time in Uttar Pradesh and cover 20 districts. In Madhya Pradesh, the yatra will cover 698 km and nine districts in seven days. It will cover two districts in Rajasthan in a day. The yatra will be in Gujarat and Maharashtra for five days each, traversing 445 km and 479 km respectively. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will conclude in Mumbai on March 20 or 21. Mr. Gandhi will address gatherings and also interact with civil society members and organisations twice a day during the yatra. The Bharat Jodo Yatra, which started on September 7, 2022, was credited by the Congress for its electoral gains in assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. The Bharat Jodo Yatra covered 75 districts and 76 Lok Sabha constituencies across 12 states and two union territories.

The final phase of the maneuver involved firing of control\n            engines for a short duration. The orbit of Aditya-L1 spacecraft is a  periodic Halo orbit which is located roughly 1.5  million km  \n            from earth on  the continuously moving Sun \u2013 Earth line with an orbital period of about 177.86 earth  \n            days. This Halo orbit is a periodic, three-dimensional orbit at L1 involving Sun, Earth and a spacecraft.  \n            This specific halo orbit is selected to ensure a mission lifetime of 5 years, minimising station-keeping  \n            manoeuvres and thus fuel consumption and ensuring a continuous, unobstructed view of sun. The Aditya-L1 mission is an Indian solar observatory at Lagrangian point L1 for \u201cObserving and\n            understanding the chromospheric and coronal dynamics of the Sun\u201d in a continuous manner. Placing\n            the Aditya-L1 in a halo orbit around L1 point has advantages as compared to placing in a Low Earth\n            Orbit (LEO): It provides a smooth Sun-spacecraft velocity change throughout the orbit, appropriate for helioseismology. It is outside of the magnetosphere of Earth, thus suitable for the \"in situ\" sampling of the solar wind\n                    and particles. It allows unobstructed, continuous observation of the Sun, and view of earth for enabling continuous\n                    communication to ground stations. Halo orbit insertion The halo orbit insertion process commenced as the spacecraft crossed the XZ plane in the Sun-Earth-\n            L1 rotating system, with the required orbital state. The insertion maneuver is essential to nullify the\n            X and Z velocity components and attain the required Y-velocity in the L1 rotating frame for the\n            required Halo orbit. The targeted Halo-orbit for Aditya-L1 is Ax: 209200 km, Ay : 663200 km and Az :\n            120000 km (The semi-axes of the 3-dimensional Halo orbit-refer figure). The insertion of Aditya-L1 into this Halo orbit presents a critical mission phase, which demanded\n            precise navigation and control. A successful insertion further involved constant monitoring along\n            with the adjustment of the spacecraft's speed and position by using onboard thrusters. The success\n            of this insertion not only signifies ISRO's capabilities in such complex orbital manoeuvres, but it but\n            gives confidence to handle future interplanetary missions. Aditya-L1 was designed and realised at UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) with participation from\n            various ISRO centres. The payloads onboard Aditya-L1 were developed by Indian scientific\n            laboratories, IIA, IUCAA and ISRO. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was launched by PSLV-C57 on September\n            2, 2023 from SDSC SHAR, into an elliptical parking orbit (EPO) of 235.6 km by 19502.7 km. From\n            here, Aditya-L1 embarked on an extraordinary journey towards the Sun-Earth-L1 Lagrange point,\n            with the help of the onboard propulsion system, increased its orbital size progressively and moved\n            toward L1 point. Five liquid engine burns (LEB) were executed during Earth orbit phase; gradually\n            raised the apogee of the EPO in order to attain the desired trajectory with the fifth burn, known as the trans-L1\n            injection (TL1I) maneuver. The maneuver strategy is carefully devised to minimize\n            incremental velocity addition (\u0394V) for reaching the target L1 halo orbit while restricting the number\n            of perigee passes to minimize the spacecraft's exposure to the high radiation Van Allen radiation\n            belts. To address errors during, TL1I phase, a short burn of the engines, called TCM-1 was conducted\n            on October 5, 2023, and another TCM-2 on December 14, 2023 to ensure compliance with Halo orbit\n            insertion condition parameters. The spacecraft underwent a cruise phase lasting approximately 110\n            days to achieve the present condition prior to HOI targeted on January 6, 2024. All the payloads were tested during the pre-commissioning phase and performance of all the payload is confirmed to be satisfactory. The picture below shows the Halo orbit insertion process graphically in a two dimension picture. The Aditya-L1 spacecraft was moving from Earth towards the L1 point in the direction of Sun. The TCM1 &2 firing oriented the spacecraft toward the Halo Orbit, making it reach the HOI condition (which is a minimum fuel consumption condition) as on 6th January 2024 (Marked by the red dot). The final firing was done at this point, making the spacecraft align with the Halo Orbit. If the HOI manoeuvre was not conducted as done today, the spacecraft would have moved in the direction marked (Without HOI).

ISRO to study black holes; launch of X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite today; here\u2019s all you need to know ISRO is all set to launch its first X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite today. The satellite aims to study the polarisation of intense X-ray sources in space and will be launched aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket. Livemint Updated 1 Jan 2024, 07:27 AM IST The launch of the X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) is set for January 1 2024 The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to welcome the new year with the launch of its first X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite that would offer insights into celestial objects like black holes, onboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket today i.e. on 1 January. This launch also comes after the success of its Gaganyaan Test Vehicle D1 mission in October. The PSLV-C58 rocket, in its 60th mission, would carry primary payload XPoSat and 10 other satellites to be deployed in low earth orbits. The 25-hour countdown commenced on Sunday for the lift-off is scheduled at 9.10 am from the first launch pad at SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota, located about 135 kms east of Chennai on January 1. Also Read: Aditya L1 mission: What will happen after spacecraft reaches destination on January 6? Aim of the mission The X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) is aimed to investigate the polarisation of intense X-ray sources in space. According to ISRO, it is the first dedicated scientific satellite from ISRO to carry out research in space-based polarisation measurements of X-ray emission from celestial sources. Also Read: Year-Ender 2023: A Look at the Top 11 Space Moments of 2023 Objective of the mission The objective of the PSLV-C58 mission includes measuring polarisation of X-rays in the energy band 8-30 keV emanating from about 50 potential cosmic sources, to carry out long term spectral and temporal studies of cosmic x-ray sources. The X-Ray polarisation serves as a crucial diagnostic tool for examining the radiation mechanism and geometry of celestial sources. The primary payload of XPoSat is POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-Rays) which is designed to measure polarimetry parameters by Raman Research Institute and XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing) built by the U R Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru. Duration of the mission: As per ISRO, the Mission life is about 5 years. PSLV rocket The 44.4-meter-tall PSLV rocket would first deploy the primary satellite into a 650 km Low Earth Orbit around 21 minutes after lift-off and later the scientists would bring the satellite to a lower altitude of about 350 km by restarting the fourth stage of the vehicle, for conducting the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3 (POEM-3) experiment. It may be recalled that the space agency conducted a similar scientific experiment using POEM-2 in the PSLV-C55 mission in April 2023. The rocket that will fly is the PSLV-DL variant which has a lift-off mass of 260 tonnes. The fourth stage is configured as a 3-axis stabilized Orbital platform for conducting experiments.

{"year":"2024","month":"02","event_desc":"2 February - Champai Soren takes oath as the new Chief Minister of Jharkhand following the arrest of Hemant Soren.","text":"Champai Soren sworn in as Jharkhand CM; Hemant in 5-day custody By Vishal Kant , Ranchi Feb 02, 2024 11:59 PM IST Share Via Copy Link Champai Soren is sworn in as the new Chief Minister of Jharkhand, following the arrest of his predecessor Hemant Soren on money laundering charges. Champai Soren became the seventh person to take oath as Jharkhand\u2019s chief minister on Friday, resolving for now the instability roiling the state after the dramatic arrest of his predecessor Hemant Soren over money laundering allegations two days ago. JMM leader Champai Soren takes oath as Jharkhand chief minister in Ranchi on Friday. (ANI) Champai Soren, the 67-year-old minister who was elected leader of Jharkhand\u2019s ruling coalition hours before Hemant Soren\u2019s arrest, was sworn in alongside two other members \u2014 Alamgir Alam from the Congress and Satyanand Bhokta from the Rashtriya Janata Dal \u2014 even as the alliance shifted 35 legislators to Hyderabad, the capital of Congress-ruled Telangana. \u201cWe will take forward welfare schemes launched by Hemant Soren. I am committed to the development of Jharkhand, We will continue the fight for jal, jungle, jameen (water, forest, land),\u201d he said, referring to a slogan made famous by tribal icon Komaram Bheem. Champai Soren\u2019s swearing-in caps a dramatic 48 hours in Ranchi that began with the arrest of Hemant Soren by the Enforcement Directorate at 10pm on Wednesday, minutes after his resignation. In a letter addressed to his party\u2019s legislators before his arrest, Hemant Soren confirmed transport minister Champai Soren as the new legislature party leader. Read here: Who is \u2018tiger\u2019 Champai Soren, Shibu Soren aide and Jharkhand's new chief minister? Champai Soren and his backers met governor CP Radhakrishnan twice over two days, furnishing letters of support from 43 legislators in an 81-member assembly, with one seat lying vacant. Finally, around 11pm on Thursday, the governor invited Champai Soren to form the government and gave him 10 days to prove his majority on the floor of the House. The oath-taking ceremony took place on a day a Ranchi court remanded Hemant Soren to five days in ED custody. But the agency couldn\u2019t take Soren into custody after Jharkhand advocate general Rajeev Ranjan moved a second petition, asking for the former CM to spend the night away from the ED office in Ranchi because of safety concerns. The court is set to pronounce judgment on this aspect on Saturday, after which the remand period will begin. Advocate Pradeep Chandra, one of the advocates representing Soren, said, \u201cThe court while granting five day ED remand also granted permission to allow my client to meet his advocate and family members.\u201d Chandra said that the second petition was necessitated because there was a threat perception against the former CM, and the ED did not have a \u201cregular force of its own\u201d. \u201cIt depends on other agencies while the state has sufficient arrangements for security at its police stations and other places,\u201d Chandra said. Soren remains at Ranchi central jail. Assistant solicitor general Anil Kumar, who appeared for ED, said that the law had no provisions for part custody and it was the ED\u2019s duty to provide security to people in their custody. In the assembly, the ruling alliance appears comfortably placed. In the 81-member assembly, the coalition that includes the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Congress, the RJD and the Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninist) has 48 seats while the National Democratic Alliance has 32, of which the BJP holds 26. One seat is vacant. But Champai Soren isn\u2019t taking any chances. An hour after the swearing-in ceremony, he held his first cabinet meeting, after which 35 lawmakers were sent to Hyderabad. \u201cThe BJP\u2019s khela (game) is still on. So we have shifted them to deflate any such attempts. They will return at the earliest,\u201d JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. In the cabinet meeting, three decisions were taken \u2014 the reappointment of Rajiv Ranjan as advocate general, the cancellation of the budget session originally scheduled for February 9 and 29, and a special session of the assembly on February 5 and 6. A JMM legislator said that the alliance would seek a floor test in the special session. \u201cThough the governor has given us 10 days, the government will seek the confidence in the House during that session itself,\u201d the JMM legislator said, requesting anonymity. The ruling alliance says it has the support of 47 lawmakers, though there are 43 signatures on the letter of support sent to Radhakrishnan. Those who have not signed are JMM lawmakers Chamra Linda and Lobin Hembrom (both have made statements against the government in recent months), speaker Rabindranath Mahato, JMM leader Ramdas Soren who is in hospital, and Sita Soren, who is Hemant Soren\u2019s sister-in-law. A JMM leader said that legislators in Hyderabad will likely return on Sunday night before the floor test on Tuesday or Wednesday. \u201cThe idea is to have a cabinet expansion after proving our majority because there are several claimants to ministerial berths, especially in the Congress camp. If the entire cabinet was sworn in today, it could have triggered discontent, and given the Opposition an opportunity to cash in,\u201d this leader said, requesting anonymity. \u201cWe will continue with development schemes for the poor, farmers and the marginalised both in rural and urban area which will show a mirror to the Opposition which attempted to destabilise our government,\u201d Champai Soren said. The BJP, however, said that the lawmakers being shifted out of state betrayed the government\u2019s lack of faith in their own constituents. \u201cI congratulate the new CM and the government. It is surprising that the governor invited them to form the government, but they seem to be running from one place to another. This is because their own MLAs do not trust each other. I wonder what they will do during the trust vote,\u201d said Biranchi Narayan, BJP\u2019s chief whip in the assembly. Hemant Soren was arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with ED\u2019s probe into an alleged land scam in the state. ED says it has evidence that Hemant Soren is a key beneficiary in alleged land related irregularities in Ranchi, where a network of brokers and businessmen were allegedly working over the years to create fake deeds of landed parcels by forging records in the registrar offices and further selling them off. Hemant Soren, who is the third Jharkhand CM to be arrested after his father Shibu Soren and Madhu Koda, dismissed the charges as politically motivated and said details of his assets are public.

CM Dhani addressing the House before the UCC bill was passed in the state assembly in Dehradun on Wednesday evening (Photo\/Uttarakhand govt information department) The Congress took a nuanced stand on the Bill saying it was not opposed to it but wanted it to be sent to the select committee first for elaborate discussion. Yashpal Arya, leader of Opposition, said there are many issues and ambiguities, which needs to be discussed first in the select committee of the assembly. Arya and BSP MLA Shahzad moved amendments to the bill, which were not considered by the House. Dhami in his address before the passage of the Bill, said a very meaningful discussion was held on UCC on Tuesday and Wednesday by both ruling and Opposition MLAs. \u201cOur state got the opportunity despite there being many big states in the country. This is a historic opportunity. This is not a normal law, but a law that will provide a common legal framework for all. I hope other states will also table the UCC bill. I also want to thank the people of the state on this occasion. Every person in the state must be feeling proud today\u201d Dhami said that in the run-up to the 2022 state assembly polls, he had promised that if the BJP came to power, \u201cwe will implement UCC in the state. After we came to power, we first constituted a committee for UCC. This is a sacred land of gods, of Ganga and Yamuna, this is the land of soldiers who are serving across the country. So, for everyone living in Uttarakhand irrespective of religion and caste, we decided to bring UCC. And people blessed us. For the first time, BJP won assembly polls for the second consecutive term\u201d. \u201cThis Bill will show a way for all, like Ganga which flows from the state, blesses people across India.

He said 2.32 lakh people gave suggestions to the UCC committee. \u201cI want to thank all the members of the UCC Committee today,\u201d he said Dhami said UCC treats all people as equals. \u201cThis is just the start. We will be working on various fronts\u2026why this Bill was not brought up by previous regimes?

Our Devbhoomi teaches us to respect everyone equally\u2026We are talking about the truth which has been suppressed till now despite it being in Article 44 of the Constitution.

Now the time has come to stop atrocities against women. Before independence, the governance system in our country had only one policy and that policy was divide and rule. Following the same policy, equal laws for all were not allowed. Why distinction between citizens was maintained? Why was the gap of inequality dug between communities? But now this gap will be filled.

Ravi Kumar\/Hindustan Times\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Just over two years after they strongarmed Prime Minister Narendra Modi into an exceptional U-turn, India\u2019s protesting farmers are back on the streets \u2013 and this time the stakes are higher. For about two weeks now, thousands of angry farmers have gathered at the borders of India\u2019s capital to demand higher fixed prices for their crops, just weeks before a nationwide election that is expected to see Modi clinch a rare third term in power. A heavy security presence has so far prevented the farmers from marching on New Delhi\u00a0and violent clashes have seen police fire tear gas and water cannons. Tensions rose further last week after the death of a protester near the Punjab border, according to the state\u2019s chief minister, who has ordered a probe into the case. The scene is reminiscent of 2021, when in a rare break from his uncompromising leadership style, Modi\u00a0repealed controversial laws aimed at modernizing the agricultural sector following more than a year of mass farmers\u2019 protests. Modi promised \u201ca fresh start,\u201d agreeing to meet the farmers\u2019 demands and work with them to move forward. But the farmers say those promises were broken, and this time, they will not return home until their demands are met.

Narinder Nanu\/AFP\/Getty Images The confrontation, analysts say, has sewn apprehension in the highest echelons of Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is wary of antagonizing the farmers \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most influential voting blocs \u2013 ahead of an expected May election. With the BJP facing a fractured opposition that is yet to present a clear candidate for prime minister, the farmers have emerged as the strongest threat to the ruling party, some analysts say. And if protests grow closer to the scale seen in 2021, it could become a bigger issue for Modi. \u201cRight now, it looks like there is only one opposition \u2013 the farmers,\u201d said economist Devinder Sharma. \u201cPolitics is unpredictable, but it is very important for the unions and the government to come to a solution.\u201d Same demands Sangha Gurpreet remembers the day he abandoned his field for a protest site in November 2020, watching as it swelled in size over the next year. \u201cI was part of that struggle for 13 months,\u201d the activist and farmer said of the historic protests that jolted Indian society and started a nationwide discussion about the country\u2019s agriculture workers. Those protests began after the BJP introduced three new laws it insisted would fix a system plagued with problems. The farming laws aimed to loosen the rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce that protected farmers from an unfettered free market for decades. But farmers said market forces could push prices even lower, and smaller farmers would find it hard to negotiate favorable deals with corporate giants.

Ravi Kumar\/Hindustan Times\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Just over two years after they strongarmed Prime Minister Narendra Modi into an exceptional U-turn, India\u2019s protesting farmers are back on the streets \u2013 and this time the stakes are higher. For about two weeks now, thousands of angry farmers have gathered at the borders of India\u2019s capital to demand higher fixed prices for their crops, just weeks before a nationwide election that is expected to see Modi clinch a rare third term in power. A heavy security presence has so far prevented the farmers from marching on New Delhi\u00a0and violent clashes have seen police fire tear gas and water cannons. Tensions rose further last week after the death of a protester near the Punjab border, according to the state\u2019s chief minister, who has ordered a probe into the case. The scene is reminiscent of 2021, when in a rare break from his uncompromising leadership style, Modi\u00a0repealed controversial laws aimed at modernizing the agricultural sector following more than a year of mass farmers\u2019 protests. Modi promised \u201ca fresh start,\u201d agreeing to meet the farmers\u2019 demands and work with them to move forward. But the farmers say those promises were broken, and this time, they will not return home until their demands are met. Police fire teargas to disperse farmers marching towards New Delhi during a protest at the Haryana-Punjab state border on February 21, 2024. Narinder Nanu\/AFP\/Getty Images The confrontation, analysts say, has sewn apprehension in the highest echelons of Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is wary of antagonizing the farmers \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most influential voting blocs \u2013 ahead of an expected May election. With the BJP facing a fractured opposition that is yet to present a clear candidate for prime minister, the farmers have emerged as the strongest threat to the ruling party, some analysts say. And if protests grow closer to the scale seen in 2021, it could become a bigger issue for Modi. \u201cRight now, it looks like there is only one opposition \u2013 the farmers,\u201d said economist Devinder Sharma. \u201cPolitics is unpredictable, but it is very important for the unions and the government to come to a solution.\u201d Same demands Sangha Gurpreet remembers the day he abandoned his field for a protest site in November 2020, watching as it swelled in size over the next year. \u201cI was part of that struggle for 13 months,\u201d the activist and farmer said of the historic protests that jolted Indian society and started a nationwide discussion about the country\u2019s agriculture workers. Those protests began after the BJP introduced three new laws it insisted would fix a system plagued with problems. The farming laws aimed to loosen the rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce that protected farmers from an unfettered free market for decades. But farmers said market forces could push prices even lower, and smaller farmers would find it hard to negotiate favorable deals with corporate giants.

Prakash Singh\/Bloomberg\/Getty Images Gurpreet was among hundreds of thousands of farmers from India\u2019s northern states \u2013 Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh \u2013 that demanded the dismissal of the laws. They stayed on the streets through a harsh winter, scorching summer and a global pandemic until Modi finally backed down and promised to work with them to come to an agreement. It was a massive victory for the farmers, who pushed the Indian leader into a rare and uncharacteristic climbdown.

The BJP\u2019s victory has already imperilled the Congress government in Himachal, with Leader of the Opposition Jairam Thakur scheduled to meet with Governor Shiv Pratap Shukla on Wednesday.

Vulnerability exposed The defeat of the Congress\u2019s official nominee in Himachal has exposed the vulnerability of the State government\u2019s continuance, with the BJP getting emboldened, and it is expected to bring a no-confidence motion in the ongoing Budget session itself, which is to end on February 29. The result has also brought to the fore the factionalism within the Congress State unit, besides the party Central leadership\u2019s miscalculation in fielding a candidate (Mr. Singhvi), who was seen as an \u201coutsider\u201d, and had resulted in discontent among a section of Congress MLAs. It was the first time since 1952 when a non-Himachali was nominated. Mr. Singhvi, who handles most of the legal issues of the party and the top leadership, notably the Gandhis, was chosen over party veteran from the State and former Union Minister Anand Sharma. Not only this, certain Congress MLAs have publicly expressed displeasure over the working of the government under the leadership of the incumbent Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.

A five-judge Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud gave the bank 24 hours, that is, by the close of business hours on March 12, to provide the details to the Election Commission of India (ECI). The petition was filed in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict on February 15 striking down the electoral bonds scheme, where the Court had directed the SBI to furnish details of the bonds\u00a0to the ECI by March 6, 2024. These details were to include the date of purchase of each bond, the name of the purchaser of the bond and the denomination of the bond purchased. The ECI was subsequently ordered to publish all such information shared by the SBI on its official website by March 13, 2024. The court was also hearing a contempt plea filed by NGOs \u2014 Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Common Cause \u2014 against the SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khera that contended that the bank was deliberately trying to ensure that details of donors and the amounts contributed to political parties anonymously were not disclosed to the public before the Lok Sabha elections due in April-May. Analysis reveals that the BJP was the scheme\u2019s greatest beneficiary . Watch | Supreme Court verdict on electoral bonds scheme Why did SBI seek more time to comply? On March 4, the SBI filed a nine-page application before the Court seeking time till June 30 to provide the ECI with the required details regarding the purchased electoral bonds. The bank said that the information and documents were scattered across its various branches and decoding them was a \u201ctime-consuming exercise.\u201d According to the public sector bank, not only were the details not maintained centrally at one place, but the data related to the issuance of the bond and data related to the redemption of the bond were recorded \u201cin two different silos.\u201d This was done to ensure that donors\u2019 anonymity was protected, it said. The Court was also apprised that donor details were kept in a sealed cover at the designated branches and all such sealed covers were then deposited in its main branch located in Mumbai. \u201cIt can thus be noted that both sets of information were being stored independently of each other. Thus, to re-match them would be a task requiring a significant amount of effort... the retrieval of information from each silo and the procedure of matching the information of one silo to that of the other would be a time-consuming exercise,\u201d its plea said.

This would involve compiling and comparing 44,434 information sets (equal to twice the number of bonds issued) as the details relating to buyers and recipients of bonds were kept in two different information silos, the bank said. What did the contempt plea stipulate? The contempt plea alleged that the bank was deliberately trying to ensure that the amounts contributed anonymously to political parties were not disclosed to the public before the Lok Sabha elections. It was also pointed out that the bank\u2019s stand was directly contradictory to an affidavit filed by the Union government on March 15, 2019, which said that information about the bonds was completely traceable and quickly available. The petitioners further claimed that the SBI maintains a secret number-based record of donors who buy bonds and the political parties to which they donate. Additionally, each electoral bond also possessed a unique number making it easier to trace it, they contended. \u201cA simple query on the database can generate a report in a particular format which does not require any manual verification,\u201d the plea said. Highlighting that the SBI had enough manpower to retrieve the information within the stipulated deadline, the petitioners pointed out, \u201cThe SBI has 2,60,000 employees, 22,500 worldwide branches administered by a headquarters, 17 local head offices, 101 zonal offices and 208 foreign offices in 36 countries. It is hard to believe that the SBI is not able to gather information which the SBI has itself recorded.\u201d Referring to Section (4) of Clause 7 of the\u00a0scheme that makes it mandatory to disclose information furnished by a buyer when demanded by a competent court, the petitioners claimed that \u201cit is inconceivable that the SBI does not have the recorded information readily available within its database.\u201d Dubious response: On the State Bank of India and the Electoral Bond scheme The petitioners also relied on a Right to Information response given by the bank to retired Commodore Lokesh Batra in 2018, saying that it had spent \u20b960.43 lakh on IT system development, \u20b989.72 lakh on operational costs and that the net cost for floating of electoral bonds was \u20b91.5 crore. \u201cThis implies that a well-functioning IT system is already in place with respect to management of sale and redemption of electoral bonds,\u201d the plea asserted. Pointing out that only 19 out of the 29 the SBI authorised branches sold electoral bonds and only 14 branches encashed them, the plea said that \u201cdata available as of January 2024 further shows that only 25 political parties had opened their account and are eligible for encashing electoral bonds\u201d and \u201ctherefore, compiling of this information should not be difficult as the system is already in place.\u201d Such a \u201cdefiant approach\u201d of the SBI attempts to stifle a citizen\u2019s right to audit actions of the political class and is therefore contemptous, the petitioners concluded. What did the top court say? At the outset of the proceedings, senior advocate Harish Salve appearing for the bank submitted that matching the bonds purchased and names of donors with the parties which redeemed the bonds was a \u201ctime-consuming and complex\u201d exercise. He explained that the details were kept in two separate silos and not stored in a digital format. But the CJI pointed out that the judgment had not asked the bank to \u201cmatch\u201d information to ascertain who contributed to which parties and only wanted a \u201cplain disclosure\u201d. He asserted that the SBI in its own application said that such information was \u201creadily available\u201d. Electoral bonds, the State Bank and the art of evasion Pointing out how the bank had not even bothered to mention what it had been doing for the past 26 days since the February 15 judgment, the Chief Justice remarked, \u201cYou are the SBI\u2026 There should be some candour from your part. What have you been doing for the past 26 days? There is not a word about that in your application\u201d. Indicating the seriousness of the directives, Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked whether the bank wanted a specific judicial order to open the sealed covers containing the bonds\u2019 details right there in the courtroom. Although the Bench said that it did not want to initiate contempt proceedings against the SBI, it underscored that it was putting the bank on notice and that it would take action if the SBI failed to ensure compliance. Why are SBI\u2019s claims contested by experts? Professor Jagdeep Chhokar, founder-member and trustee of the ADR, termed the SBI move \u201cnot surprising but unfortunate.\u201d He earlier told The Hindu that the \u201cdata is obviously in digital format and collecting data from different States and locations and taking four months for that is impossible in this day and age.\u201d Concurring with this, former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg told The Wire that such information was \u201cavailable at the click of a button\u201d and that the bank had either deliberately misconstrued or failed to understand the \u201csimple nature of the six bits of information\u201d that they are required to give to the ECI. According to a report published in The Reporter\u2019s Collective , the SBI has previously provided similar data to the Union government as well as the Finance Ministry within 48 hours. It pointed out that all electoral bond-related work was overseen by a specific team of the SBI called the Transaction Banking Unit (TBU) to ensure that the government can access crucial information on a short notice. In 2019, a Huffington Post investigation divulged that in a January 2018 meeting, the SBI had asked the Union Ministry of Finance to include a serial number on the bonds to have an audit trail. The bank believed that without such a number, it would fail to submit information on donors and redeemers of bonds if a competent court or law enforcement agency asked for it.

(File photo by Arvind Yadav\/ Hindustan Times)(Hindustan Times) The ministry's spokesperson wrote on X that applications for the citizenship will be submitted in a completely online mode. \"Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will be notifying today, the Rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA-2019). These rules, called the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024 will enable the persons eligible under CAA-2019 to apply for grant of Indian citizenship. The applications will be submitted in a completely online mode for which a web portal has been provided,\" the official X handle said. This comes weeks after union home minister Amit Shah declared that the law would be implemented before the Lok Sabha elections. The law aims to give citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from these countries, who came to India before December 31, 2014.

There should be no confusion around it.

Now they are backtracking,\" he added. Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said that her government will not allow the implementation of CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) or NRC (National Register of Citizens) in the state.

BJP hails decision, Opposition slams Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday praised the decision to enact the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

While talking about the previous elections, the CEC said, \"Last 11 state polls were peaceful, violence-free with near-zero repolls; we will further improve it going forward.\" To manage misuse of money, banks will be maintaining a strict vigil over illicit online cash transfers, suspicious transactions through payment wallets. \"Money seizures rose by 835 per cent to Rs 3,400 crore in last 11 state polls during 2022-23; we won't allow misuse of money power,\" said EC.

Kejriwal was arrested after two hours of questioning by the ED officials at his residence. Kejriwal became the second sitting chief minister to face arrest in recent times, following Jharkhand's Hemant Soren. The AAP leadership announced on Thursday that he would maintain his position as chief minister, asserting that the national capital would continue to be governed even while he is in jail. Delhi high court had earlier rejected Kejriwal's plea to prevent coercive measures from being taken against him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Will run govt from jail\u00e2\u0080\u0099, says AAP leader Atishi \"We have received reports of Arvind Kejriwal's arrest by the ED. We have always maintained that Arvind Kejriwal will continue to govern from jail. He will remain the CM of Delhi. We have filed a case in the Supreme Court, and our lawyers are preparing for an urgent hearing tonight,\" Atishi said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Scared dictator wants to create a dead democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099, says Rahul Gandhi Rahul Gandhi, on Kejriwal's arrest, said in a tweet, \"A scared dictator wants to create a dead democracy. While capturing all the institutions including the media, breaking up the parties, extorting money from companies, freezing the account of the main opposition party was not enough for the 'devilish power', now the arrest of the elected Chief Ministers has also become a common thing. INDIA will give a befitting reply to this.\" Congress leader Udit Raj condemned the heavy security presence around Kejriwal's residence, likening it to a state of war or the pursuit of a dangerous criminal. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cArvind Kejriwal's house has been surrounded by security forces as if they are there to arrest any dacoit or the war is on with an enemy country. This is the murder of democracy. If Arvind Kejriwal ends his alliance with Congress and goes with the BJP, all summons will be recalled. If freedom of expression is suppressed, it is not just the AAP or Congress, all will have to suffer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d 'Effort to shut down opposition voices', says Kerala CM On the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal , Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan says, \"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's arrest is highly objectionable. This action is part of the effort to shut down the opposition voices at the stage of the election process. This shows the cowardice of those who fear the democratic process.\" 'Arrest will lead to a new people's revolution', says SP chief Akhilesh Yadav Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, \"Those who are themselves imprisoned in the fear of defeat, what will 'they' do by imprisoning someone else? BJP knows that it will not come to power again, and due to this fear, it wants to remove the opposition leaders from the public by any means at the time of elections, arrest is just an excuse. This arrest will give birth to a new people's revolution.\" \u00e2\u0080\u0098Preparation for autocracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099, says JMM Jharkhand Mukti Morcha's Rajya Sabha MP and leader, Mahua Maji, commented on the situation, linking Kejriwal's arrest to a broader trend in non-BJP governed states. She said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWherever there is non-BJP govt, these things are happening in those states only. Elections are going to be held, model code of conduct is in place but the way things are going on, firstly in Jharkhand and then in Delhi, this isn't democracy but a preparation for autocracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kejriwal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrest follows the arrest of former Jharkhand CM and JMM leader Hemant Soren. 'Last string of case had to reach Kejriwal', says Bengal BJP president On Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), West Bengal BJP President Sukanta Majumdar said, \"In the Liquor Policy Case, a few days ago, BRS leader K Kavitha was also arrested. This was an indication that a big arrest will be made in this case in the coming days. This was natural that the last string of this case had to reach Arvind Kejriwal. Former Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia is also arrested in this case. His arrest was just a matter of time.\" 'Not a single BJP leader faces scrutiny or arrest', says Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin \"Ahead of Elections2024, driven by fear of a decade of failures and the imminent defeat, the Fascist BJP Govt sinks to despicable depths by arresting Hon'ble Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, following the unjust targeting of brother Hemant Soren. Not a single BJP leader faces scrutiny or arrest, laying bare their abuse of power and the decay of democracy. The relentless persecution of opposition leaders by the BJP Govt smacks of a desperate witch-hunt. This tyranny ignites public fury, unmasking BJP's true colours. But their futile arrests only fuel our resolve, fortifying the INDIA alliance's march to victory. BJP, brace for the people's wrath!', Tamil Nadu CM Stalin said in a tweet. 'Whoever opposes BJP, should contest from bars', says AIADMK Kovai Sathyan, AIADMK Spokesperson said, \"This arrest proves that there is a three-point agenda for the BJP. First, whoever opposes the BJP, should contest from behind bars. Second, whoever is opposing BJP, will run out of funds and will be unable to use party funds. Third, whoever is out on bail, BJP will not have any hesitation to have an alliance with them 'Politically-motivated arrest', says NCP NCP-SCP leader and MP Supriya Sule said, \"I stand in solidarity with Arvind Kejriwal. This is yet another politically motivated arrest by the ED at the behest of the BJP Government to suppress the voice of the opposition & undermine the electorate at large.

Adbul Matheen Taha and Mussavir Hussain Shazeb were traced to their hideout and were apprehended Friday morning, the NIA said in a statement. According to the federal agency, Shazeb placed the improvised explosive device (IED) at the caf\u00e9 while Taha is the mastermind behind the planning and execution. Show Full Article The blast at the popular cafe in Bengaluru on 1 March had injured 10 people. Earlier, one suspect, identified as Muzammil Shareef , was arrested in connection with the Bengaluru blast. Taha and Shazeb had set up a base in Chennai in January to carry out the blast. They are said to have stayed in Maharashtra, Karnataka and even Kerala. On 7 March, the duo vacated their rented accommodation in Chennai before they went on the run. The NIA conducted searches across 18 locations in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh and announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh each of the absconders on 29 March. In a joint operation carried out by the NIA, central intelligence agencies along with police teams of West Bengal, Telangana, Karnataka, and Kerala traced the absconding duo in East Medinipur district. Taha and Shazeb were hiding under false identities, said the NIA. The police also seized laptops, mobiles and fake ID documents from the duo in East Medinipur. Sources in the NIA told ThePrint that the duo was on the anti-terrorism agency\u2019s radar previously in 2020. According to reports, Taha used cryptocurrency to finance and execute the operation. Meanwhile, the West Bengal Police issued a statement on X, formerly Twitter, asserting that the two suspects in the Rameshwaram Cafe blast were arrested in a joint operation with the central intelligence agencies. \u201cThe proactive role of West Bengal Police in the matter has been officially acknowledged by the Central Agencies. West Bengal has NEVER been a safe haven for terrorists and the state police will continue to remain ever-vigilant in keeping its people safe from nefarious activities,\u201d it said in a statement, rebutting the claims of BJP IT chief Amit Malviya after he alleged that Bengal, under Mamata Banerjee, has become \u201ca safe haven for terrorists\u201d . NIA detains two chief suspects in the Rameshwaram Cafe blast, bomber Mussavir Hussain Shazib and accomplice Abdul Matheen Ahmed Taahaa, from Kolkata.

Livemint Updated 24 Mar 2024, 04:43 PM IST Police produced Budaun Double Murder Case accused Javed in the CJM court, on Friday. ( ANI ) Father of the Budaun double murder case victims set his bike on fire and tried to immolate himself, police said on Sunday. He was reportedly upset over the fact the police have yet not been able to ascertain the motive behind the attack that killed his children. Two children were killed by barbers in the Baba colony area of Uttar Pradesh's Budaun district on March 19. Sajid and Javed, both barbers, were identified as the assailants. According to news agency PTI, Sajid had entered the house and allegedly attacked Ayush, 12, Ahaan alias Honey, 8, and Yuvraj, 10, with a knife . Ayush and Ahaan died on the spot, while Yuvraj was admitted to the hospital with serious wounds. Father sets ablaze his bike in rage Vinod Kumar, the father of the deceased, set his bike on fire and later tried to immolate himself. He was stopped by police. Vinod's mother Munni Devi was quoted by PTI as saying it's been six days since she lost her grandchildren but the police were yet to come up with a motive behind the cruelty. \"It seems that the police are hiding something,\" she said. ALSO READ: Budaun Double Murder case: \u2018Don't politicise\u2019, BSP supremo Mayawati calls for strict action Meanwhile, Senior Superintendent of Police Alok Priyadarshi said Vinod was missing his children because of Holi and set his bike on fire in a rage. \"Seeing their shoes, clothes and other festival items, he could not stop himself and set fire to his bike to vent his anger,\" he was quoted as saying. One accused killed, another claims to be innocent The accused, Sajid, was killed in an encounter with police hours after the incident on March 19. Another accused Javed had surrendered at the Satellite Police Outpost of the Baradari Police Station in the neighbouring Bareilly district on March 22. The Budaun district administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into Sajid's encounter. Javed, however, denied allegations of murdering the children Ayush, 11, and Ahaan, 6. According to news agency PTI, a video had surfaced where Javed is claiming innocence. Javed says that Sajid, his elder brother, had killed the two children, and that he has no involvement in the crime. Javed said he fled to Delhi after the incident and returned to Bareilly to surrender before the Uttar Pradesh police. The video was apparently shot inside an autorickshaw parked close to the police post. \" Beat me if you want, but I swear I am innocent. I have nothing to do with the incident. He (Sajid) was my elder brother. He did that but I have nothing to do with the incident,\" Javed is heard saying.

There is growing support in Ladakh for Wangchuk\u2019s fast. Around 5000 people joined him on Monday and scores from the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) observed solidarity fast in Kargil. He decided to sit on fast on March 6, after the Centre and Ladakh leadership\u2019s talks failed in February. Statehood to newly-carved Union Territory of Ladakh and Sixth Schedule status are among four demands being pursued by the leaders of KDA and Leh Apex Body with the Centre. However, several rounds of dialogue in the past one year failed to achieve anything concrete.

It also features uniform civil code, one nation one election, India\u2019s Olympics bid in 2036 and implementation of National Education Policy, among other, promises. Gireesh Chandra Prasad , Subhash Narayan , Dhirendra Kumar Updated 14 Apr 2024, 10:40 AM IST PM Modi unveils BJP\u2019s \u2019Sankalp Patra\u2019 for 2024 Lok Sabha elections ( REUTERS ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the Bharatiya Janata Party 's (BJP) manifesto 'Sankalp Patra' for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections on 14 April, the birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution. After unveiling the manifesto, the prime minister said it would empower the youth, women, poor people and farmers and help the country in its journey towards \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 (developed India). The manifesto, with the tagline \u2018Modi Ki Guarantee 2024 \u2019, calls for bringing all citizens aged 70 and more under the the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which provides free treatment up to \u20b9 5 Lakh. Follow all Live Updates on BJP manifesto 2024 Lok Sabha Polls Here \"The biggest concern of the elderly is how will they afford treatment for their ailments. This concern is even more serious for the middle class. BJP has now taken the 'sankalp' that every individual above 75 years of age will be brought within the purview of Ayushman Bharat Yojana,\" the prime minister said. BJP president JP Nadda, and union ministers Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman and Rajnath Singh were also present at the function at BJP headquarters in the national capital. The BJP also promised to bring in a Uniform Civil Code or UCC if it retains its government at the centre. The UCC is perhaps the only major promise in previous manifestos that the party has not fulfilled yet. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a social media post that the BJP manifesto did not speak about unemployment, while his colleague Jairam Ramesh criticised it as \u2018jumla patra\u2019 (empty promise). On infrastructure creation, Modi said the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project would be completed soon, and that the BJP would implement at least three more bullet train projects covering east, north and south India if voted back to power. The manifesto also mentioned greener manufacturing in sectors such as steel, cement, metals, and engineering goods, expanding domestic defence manufacturing and exports, and positioning India as a global railway, shipping and aviation production hub. On welfare, the party said it would introduce new policies to build houses on slum land for low-income families, further expand the Ujjwala scheme for free LPG connections to poor households, continue to increase minimum support price for farm produce from time to time, and facilitate ease of working for gig workers, truck drivers, porters, domestic workers, and street vendors. India\u2019s Olympics bid in 2036, implementation of National Education Policy, \u2018 One Nation One Election \u2019 and a law against paper leaks, also featured in the manifesto. It also promises to provide free \"ration, water, gas connection and electricity\" for the next five years to poor people.

Among other promises, the BJP has vowed to construct more 3 crore houses for poor, continue free ration to 80 Crore people for next five years and roll out piped domestic gas connections. The party promised increase the mudra loan limit from \u20b9 10 lakh to \u20b9 20 lakh. The manifesto also promised to reduce electricity bill of poor families to zero. \"Now, we will work towards reducing the electricity bill of crores of families to zero and creating earning opportunities from electricity. We have implemented the PM Surya Ghar Free Electricity Scheme,\" the prime minister said. The 27-member manifesto committee of the BJP was headed by union defence minister Rajnath Singh . The panel met twice to deliberate on the manifesto. \u00a0Soon after the launch, Modi handed copies of the manifesto to three beneficiaries of central government schemes.

Take a look at the 25 places where a change in leadership could resonate around the world. Keep track of the latest AP elections coverage from around the world here. WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG? It boils down to two key reasons: the sheer size of India, the world\u2019s most populous country, and the astonishing level of logistics needed to ensure that every registered voter is able to cast their ballot. Over the years, the duration of voting has wavered. It took nearly four months to complete the vote in India\u2019s first elections in 1951-1952, after it gained independence from British rule, and just four days in 1980. In 2019, voting took 39 days, and this year\u2019s election is the second longest.

India\u2019s 28 states and eight federal territories will vote at different times. Each phase is one day, with the first held on April 19 and the last on June 1. While some states will cast their ballots in a day, voting elsewhere may take longer. The largest state, Uttar Pradesh, which is the size of Brazil with 200 million people, will vote on all seven days, for example. General elections in India tend to take weeks to conduct, but Modi\u2019s opponents also say it gives him an advantage as it makes it easier for the prime minister, the public face of the BJP, to travel and campaign, especially in states where they are weak.

(AP Photo\/Mahesh Kumar A,File) EVERY VOTE COUNTS The Election Commission of India, which oversees the vote, has to make sure there is a voting booth available within 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of every voter. \u201cElection officials have to travel to great lengths to ensure that even a single voter can exercise their franchise,\u201d said Chakshu Roy of PRS Legislative Research, an independent think tank. Some 15 million election officials and security staff will traverse the country\u2019s deserts and mountains \u2014 sometimes by boat, foot and even on horseback \u2014 to try to reach every voter. It can be especially arduous. In 2019, when India last held elections, a team of polling officers trekked over 480 kilometers (300 miles) for four days just so a single voter in a hamlet in the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China, could exercise their right. Officials also traveled to a village tucked away high up in the Himalayas in 2019 to install a booth at 15,256 feet (4,650 meters), the highest polling station anywhere in the world. This time too, polling stations will be installed in remote places, including one inside a wildlife sanctuary in southern Kerala state and another in a shipping container in western Gujarat state. -Indian paramilitary soldiers carry their luggage after disembarking from a ferry through the river Brahmaputra ahead of first phase of elections at Nimati Ghat in Jorhat, Assam, India, Tuesday, April 9, 2019.

Tens of thousands of federal security forces, who usually guard borders for instance, are freed up and deployed alongside state police to prevent violence and transport electoral officials and voting machines. Deadly clashes involving supporters of rival political parties, particularly in the eastern state of West Bengal, had marred previous elections. But such violence has tapered over the years, thanks to heavy security, and voting has been relatively peaceful. \u201cLook at the geography of the country \u2026 there are rivers, mountains, snow, jungles \u2026 think of the security forces\u2019 movements.

The carrier employs more than 2,000 cabin crew members and flies to 31 domestic and 14 international destinations. It has a fleet of more than 70 aircraft. The staffing chaos marks a blow for the Tata Group as it attempts to turn around Air India, which had racked up billions of dollars in losses and battled a reputation for tardiness and poor service before being sold off by the government. When the group bought the national carrier in October 2021, returning control to the wealthy Tata family after decades of state ownership, the chairman of Tata Sons \u2013 the leading promoter of Tata Group companies \u2013 Natarajan Chandrasekaran laid out a clear objective: \u201cTo build a world-class airline\u201d. But staff at Air India Express were unhappy about the privatisation. Citing sources, NDTV reported that the crew had claimed \u201ca lack of equality in the treatment of staff\u201d. They had also flagged modifications in their compensation package. Tata has also had trouble with Vistara, a carrier it co-owns with Singapore Airlines. Last month, pilots at Vistara called in sick, their complaints of fatigue and poor pay drawing solidarity from Air India colleagues. The airline was forced to cancel flights. The group announced in 2022 an upcoming merger of Air India with Vistara, while Air India Express was proposed to be merged with AIX Connect, formerly AirAsia India.

The ED is expected to soon file a fresh charge sheet in the Delhi excise policy-linked money laundering case and it may name Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, BRS leader K Kavitha and some others as accused, the official sources said. The Aam Aadmi Party sources alleged that the ED charge sheet is in fact the BJP's charge sheet. The BJP's only work remains to defame Kejriwal, they said. Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the AAP, was arrested on March 21 by the ED and is currently lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody in the money laundering case.

A rescue operation was continuing Tuesday morning, and authorities told the Press Trust of India news agency that 89 people had been rescued since the incident occurred on Monday evening. The rains, accompanied by high winds, caused the 30-meter-tall (100-foot-tall) billboard to fall onto a gas station in the suburb of Ghatkopar. Videos on social media and television showed the billboard shaking amid heavy winds before giving way. It collapsed onto several cars parked in the gas station, flattening and crushing them to the ground. On Monday night, rescuers were rummaging through the wreckage to look for bodies as they used heavy equipment to cut through the metal girders attached to the billboard. Rescue workers continued to clear the area on Tuesday, which still had mangled cars and debris. A city official told PTI that more than 125 rescuers were on site, including gas cutter teams, using cranes to clear the wreckage. Police are investigating the incident and say the billboard was illegally installed, officials told PTI. The officials said 32 of the injured people had already been discharged from the hospital. India has heavy rain and severe floods during the monsoon season between June and September that brings most of its annual rainfall.

The rebels, who follow a form of communism propagated by late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, have waged a guerrilla-style struggle against the government mainly in central and eastern India for decades, leading to periodic clashes and casualties on both sides. Sign up here. Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai said security forces had killed 12 rebels in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur. Friday's clash comes nearly a month after 29 Maoists were killed in the state, while 10 others were killed on April 30. Maoists say they are fighting to give poor Indian farmers and landless labourers more control over their land and a greater claim to minerals that they say are exploited by major mining companies. Polling for all seats in the state was completed in the third phase of the general election on May 7. Votes are due to be counted on June 4. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, while campaigning in Chhattisgarh last month, vowed to eliminate insurgency from the state within three years if Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is voted back into power.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday cancelled all Other Backward Classes (OBC) certificates issued in West Bengal after 2010. The Court clarified that those who had attained employment on the benefit of the act and were already in service because of such reservation would not be affected by the order. A division bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha delivered the verdict in a plea challenging the process of granting OBC certificates in the state. The verdict is set to affect 5 Lakh OBC certificates. The Court said: A class is declared as OBC not only because it is backward, based on scientific and identifiable data, but also on the basis of such class being inadequately represented in the services under the State. Such inadequacy is required to be assessed vis-a-vis the population as a whole including other unreserved classes. However, the pro format published by the Commission and as annexed to the writ petition (WP No.60 of 2011) does not conform to the provisions of the 1993 Act. There are deficiencies galore in the said pro forma. State Commission acted in undue haste to notify certain religious communities as OBCs in 2010 The judgement of the Court cancelling all OBC certificates from the year 2010, is a blow to the ruling Trinamool Congress government which came to power in the state in 2011, because it virtually invalidates all OBC certificates given out under the incumbent government's regime. The Court was adjudicating on a plea which challenged certain provisions of the West Bengal Backward Classes (Other than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) (Reservation of Vacancies in Services and Posts) Act, 2012, which made reservations in public offices for those belonging to the OBC category. In making observations on how the Commission acted improperly in connivance with the Chief Minister's mission to extend reservations, the Court opined: The Commission and State acted in undue haste and with lightning speed in making recommendations for the classification of the 77 classes to make the public announcement of the then Chief Minister a reality. According to the petitioners, the Commission appeared to be in a tearing hurry to fulfil the wishes of the Chief Minister made in a political rally. No proper enquiry was conducted by the Commission inviting application for inclusion in the\u00a0 lists and even after purported preparation of the list, no notification was issued inviting objections in general from the people at large. Thus, the authorities have violated the constitutional provisions and had practiced protective discrimination in deviation to the constitutional norms. No data was disclosed on the basis of which it was ascertained that the concerned community is not adequately represented in the services under the Government of West Bengal. The said reports were never published and as such none could avail the opportunity to file any objection to the same, it added. In its order, the court has struck down 7 classes for reservation as Other Backward Classes (OBC) given under The West Bengal Backward Classes (Other than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) (Reservation of Vacancies in Services and Posts) Act, 2012. State Commission cannot make recommendations under Article 16(4) of the Constitution solely based on religion The Court pointed out the recommendations for sub-classification of OBCs by the state were made upon bypassing the State commission, and that 41 out of the 42 classes that were recommended for reservation belonged to the Muslim community, The Court stated that the primary and sole consideration for the Commission had been to make religion-specific recommendations. To curtain and hide such religion-specific recommendations, the Commission has prepared the reports for the ostensible purpose of granting reservation to the backward classes to hide the real purpose behind such recommendations. The purpose was to grant a religion-specific reservation, it stated. The bench held that while the Commission purports to show by way of such reports, (which however has not been relied upon by the State and Commission before the Court), that it had complied with section 9 of the Act of 1993 read with article 16(4) of the Constitution of India. This Court is of the view that the selection of 77 classes of Muslims as Backward is an affront to the Muslim Community as a whole. This Court's mind is not free from doubt that the said community has been treated as a commodity for political ends. This is clear from the chain of events that led to the classification of the 77 Classes as OBCs and their inclusion to be treated as a vote bank. Identification of the classes in the aid community as OBCs for electoral gains would leave them at the mercy of the concerned political establishment and may defeat and deny other rights. Such reservation is therefore also an affront to Democracy and the Constitution of India as a whole, it was stated. It added that the impugned notification, to be valid, would need to be available to the public and in the gazette, and that there was no such endeavour taken by the state government in this case. Unless the gazette contains the notification and is made available to the public, the notification cannot be said to have been duly published. In the instant case, however, there had been no publication of the notifications and survey reports and as such none could respond and file any objection whatsoever. As a model employer, the State Government must conduct itself with high probity and candour and ensure that the populace do not succumb to any discriminatory practice in the procedural rigmarole , the Court concluded.

One of the dead infants was 25 days old while the other six were just 15 days old.\u00a0Five other babies in the same unit are undergoing treatment. Police said that the hospital\u2019s license was inadequate and expired, while the building was not equipped with fire extinguishers or emergency doors. The owner of the hospital, along with the doctor on duty, was arrested on Sunday evening after going missing for over 12 hours.\u00a0They have been booked under Sections 336 (negligence), 304 A (culpable homicide), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Also read: Fire accidents since Independence \u2013 A timeline A magisterial inquiry has been set up to look into the causes of the fire and formulate strategies a way to prevent such occurrences in the future. No extinguishers, expired license The private hospital, New Born Baby Care Hospital, is owned by Naveen Khichi, who holds an MD in Pediatric Medicine, and his wife Jagriti, a dentist. Apart from the seven babies who died, five other newborns admitted in the same facility were also put at risk by the flames. What are fire safety rules, and why are there compliance challenges? | Explained DCP (Shahdara) Surendra Choudhury told The Hindu that the building had no fire extinguishers or emergency doors. \u201cThe license of the hospital had expired in March 2024. Though the license was issued for only five beds, there were 12 beds when we inspected the site,\u201d he said, adding that Akash, the doctor on duty, only had a degree in ayurvedic medicine and was not qualified to provide neonatal intensive care. A senior Delhi Police official told The Hindu that while the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, preliminary assessment suggests that it might have been due to a short circuit, with the presence of excessive oxygen cylinders exacerbating the situation. Hospital staff missing The police control room received a call at around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday night, informing them of the fire. A senior police officer told The Hindu that though the police reached the hospital shortly after the call, no staff members were present at the spot. Shortly afterwards, the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) also reached the spot with nine fire tenders.\u00a0DFS chief Atul Garg told The Hindu that the fire spread to an adjacent boutique, the indoors and rooftop of a bank next to the hospital, an optical shop, an ambulance, and a scooter near the building before it could be put out. Another DFS official said that the fire had also caused severe damage to the residential buildings next to it. Citizen rescues Jyotjeet Sabarwal, who heads the disaster management wing of the Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal, an NGO, told The Hindu that while the DFS was instrumental in controlling the fire, the rescue was led and carried out by local residents. \u201cWe climbed up a ladder and broke the glass of the first floor of the building, where all 12 newborn babies were kept. When we broke in, we saw that everything around the children had caught fire \u2014 their clothes, diapers and the cot-like units where each baby was kept,\u201d said Mr. Sabarwal. While all 12 children were rescued, the seven babies who were placed in the cots closer to the front of the building were completely charred, he added. Vulnerable infants A medical officer working in the East Delhi Advance NICU Hospital told The Hindu that the newborns, wrapped in dupattas and towels, were rushed from the blazing hospital in cabs and scooters. \u201cWhile six of them were declared brought dead, two of them were put on a ventilator, out of which one passed away on Sunday morning,\u201d the officer added. The medical officer said that the New Born Baby Care Hospital usually treated premature babies or those who had incurred some infection, so the babies were already in a feeble condition. \u2018No call from hospital\u2019 Sitara Khatun, whose baby boy died in the fire, told The Hindu that he was supposed to have been released by the hospital on Sunday morning. Instead, the child\u2019s body is now in the GTB mortuary. \u201cWhen my husband visited my child on Saturday, the doctor told him that he was doing fine and that they would release him on Sunday morning. I wish he had brought him back on Saturday, then I wouldn\u2019t have to live to see this,\u201d she said, weeping uncontrollably. Another parent, whose baby is now being treated at the East Delhi Advance NICU Hospital, said that he had not received any information from the management of the New Born Baby Care Hospital regarding the tragedy. \u201cIn the last 12 hours since the hospital caught fire, we did not get one call from the hospital management,\u201d said Mithilesh Kumar, a delivery worker.

Earlier this week, Biden had said \"xenophobia\" in China, Japan and India was holding back growth in the respective economies as he argued migration has been good for the U.S. economy . \"One of the reasons why our economy's growing is because of you and many others. Why? Because we welcome immigrants,\" Biden said at a fundraising event for his 2024 re-election campaign and marking the start of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

The IMF also forecast that the U.S. economy would grow 2.7%, slightly brisker than its 2.5% rate last year.

While exit polls had predicted a landslide win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the final outcome was a lot closer. The BJP emerged as the single largest party but fell short of a majority on its own . The alliance it leads did cross the halfway mark of 272 seats.

On the day of counting , the EVMs are taken out and unsealed in the presence of representatives from all participating political parties. (Al Jazeera) What time did vote counting start and end? Counting for all constituencies began at 8am local time (02:30 GMT) on Tuesday, June 4. All results were declared by late that night.

NTA compensated candidates with grace marks, acknowledging the loss of examination time. Representational JIND: Amid the controversy going on for NEET-UG 2024 results, parents lodged complaints with district higher officials seeking intervention of Centre into the matter terming it a major scam nationwide. They raised doubts on the timing of results alleging that it was to be announced on June 14 but national testing agency (NTA) declared it on June 4, on the day of counting to avoid any attention of officials and the union government into the alleged scam that witnessed a huge loss for students. However, NTA has on Wednesday stated that The loss of examination time was ascertained, and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So, the candidate's marks can be 718 or 719 also,\" the NTA explains. Candidates who experienced time loss during the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test Undergraduate (NEET-UG) 2024 have been granted grace marks, said NTA. Krishan Sharma, a native of Jind district and whose daughter has been affected due to the alleged discrepancies said that there are thousands of students in the nation who have been put in harried. An unprecedented number of students, 67, bagging the perfect score 720 out of 720 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also other discrepancies are visible in the NEET-UG results . Of the total students receiving full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from the same centre. Moreover, scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which is being claimed that its impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking. Therefore, high cut-offs have put off numbers of candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges this time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNTA should have given extra time for students who have faced time loss rather than giving grace marks which has created trouble for every student. This was not an online exam in which the concerned centre can not give extra time in case of any unwanted situation but it was possible in the offline mode. But it seems that a scam has been committed to benefit some beloved persons by charging high amounts. Giving grace marks is totally wrong and the wrong move demoralized the student and parents as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clear violation of the right to equality of students which should be taken up by concerned authorities to provide relief to affected students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Harish Vasisth, additional deputy commissioner in Jind district said that a complaint has been received by parents. Their issues and doubts seem genuine and matter is being taken up by apprising higher officials, he added.

Heavy rains triggered landslides at several locations in Mangan district, which covers north Sikkim and lies about 100 km (60 miles) north of the state capital Gangtok, the local government of the northeastern Indian state said. \"It's been raining continuously for 36 hours. The road to north Sikkim has been damaged in multiple locations, snapping connection to the district,\" said Hem Kumar Chettri, the district magistrate of Mangan. \"The stranded tourists are all safe but we have not been able to evacuate them because of the damage,\" he said, adding that 11 of them were foreign nationals. The small Buddhist state of 650,000 people, wedged between Bhutan, China and Nepal, is a popular tourist destination but also faces natural disasters caused by extreme weather events in the Himalayas.

WHO received a notification from the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for India, regarding a human case of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection in West Bengal, the health body said in a press release. \"The patient is a 4-year-old child residing in West Bengal state. The case, previously diagnosed with hyperreactive airway disease, initially presented to the paediatrician with fever and abdominal pain on 26 January 2024. He developed seizures on January 29 after which he was brought to the same paediatrician. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a local hospital due to the persistence of severe respiratory distress, recurrent high-grade fever and abdominal cramps.

He was discharged from the hospital on February 28 but with a recurrence of severe respiratory distress, he was referred to another government hospital and was admitted to the pediatric ICU and intubated on March 3. His nasopharyngeal swab was sent to the Kolkata Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory and tested positive for influenza A (not sub-typed) and rhinovirus. On April 26, the sample was sub-typed as influenza A(H9N2) through a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The patient was discharged from the hospital with oxygen support on May 1.

Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or through indirect contact with contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses, the WHO stated in the release.

Actor-turned-politician Ramya was one of the first stars from the industry to have reacted to the issue. Stating that \u201cno one is above the law,\u201d Ramya said no one should take the law into their own hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t go around beating up people and killing them. A simple complaint would suffice whether you believe justice will be served or not,\u201d she wrote on her Instagram story. Darshan, who is not new to controversies, was arrested on June 11 in connection to the murder of a 33-year-old man, Renukaswamy, who was alleged to have sent lewd and defamatory messages to Darshan\u2019s partner, Pavithra Gowda. It is alleged that the murder took place as Darshan was upset over this. Popular stars such as Kiccha Sudeep and Upendra also reacted to the shocking incident. Demanding justice for the victim\u2019s wife, Kiccha Sudeep, in an interaction with India Today said, \u201cWe are only aware of what the media is showing to us because we are not going to the police station to get the information. It looks like the media and the police are working hard to uncover the truth. There\u2019s no doubt about that... that family deserves justice. That girl deserves justice. Renukaswamy, who died on the streets, deserves justice. The unborn child deserves justice. Above all, everyone should have faith in justice, and justice should prevail in this case.\" Without taking Darshan\u2019s name, the Vikrant Rona star said that the murder case has given a bad reputation to the film industry. \u201cAll the blame is placed on the film industry. The industry should get justice and it needs a clean chit. Cinema is not just about one or two people. Only if the culprit is punished will the film industry get justice,\u201d said Sudeep. Meanwhile, \u2018real star\u2019 Upendra took to his X account and said that Darshan\u2019s case is closely followed not just by the people of Karnataka but by the entire nation. Calling for an impartial probe in the high-profile case, Upendra said that there is suspicion in the minds of the victim\u2019s family as well as the general public with regard to whether there will be a genuine investigation regarding the case given the influence that the accused holds. The actor also suggested some \u201creforms\u201d to ensure transparency in the investigation. \"In any case, the video footage of the trial of the case and all the details of the witnesses should be shared by the police with the families of the concerned persons from time to time. It should become a law.

At least nine people have been killed and 33 others injured after a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in Indian-administered Kashmir tumbled into a ravine after a suspected shooting attack, police said. The crash happened on Sunday near Reasi town, in the south of the disputed territory, as the bus was returning from a popular Hindu shrine in the area. \u201cMilitants ambushed the bus and fired at it indiscriminately.

She said the rescue operation was completed and the injured were taken to Narayana Hospital and Reasi District Hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. The bus was carrying pilgrims to the base camp of the Hindu temple Mata Vaishno Devi when it came under attack, senior administrative officer Vishesh Mahajan said.

Narendra Modi sworn in: Indian Prime Minister begins third term Narendra Modi has been sworn in as India\u2019s prime minister for a third term, after a shock election setback that will test his ability to ensure policy certainty in a coalition government in the world\u2019s most populous nation. India\u2019s President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office to Modi at a ceremony on Sunday at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president\u2019s palace in New Delhi, attended by thousands of dignitaries, including the leaders of seven neighbouring countries, Bollywood stars and industrialists. \u201cHonoured to serve Bharat,\u201d Modi posted on X, minutes before he was sworn in, referring to India\u2019s name in Indian languages. Supporters cheered, clapped and chanted \u201cModi, Modi\u201d as the 73-year-old leader, dressed in a white kurta tunic and blue half jacket, was called to take his oath. After being sworn in, Modi, flanked by officials from his Hindu-nationalist party and leaders of his coalition partners, vowed to protect India\u2019s constitution. Modi was followed by senior ministers in the previous government: Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari, Nirmala Sitharaman, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and Piyush Goyal, among others, whose portfolios are yet to be announced. Modi , who started as a publicist of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is only the second person after independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to serve a third straight term as prime minister. He secured the third term after a multi-stage election that concluded on June 1 with the support of 14 regional parties in his BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. In the previous two terms, his party had won an outright majority. Despite the united front, political analyst Zoya Hasan of New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University has told AFP news agency that Modi\u2019s new coalition alliances could lead to friction down the road. \u201cChandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar both are crafty politicians. So in some ways, Modi might be meeting his match in these two,\u201d she said, referring to two BJP allies who do not share the BJP\u2019s nationalist agenda. \u201cThey have friends across the aisle.

The International Monetary Fund has put India\u2019s growth forecast at 6.8% for 2024-25. Modi\u2019s government was elected to a record third term despite failing to win a majority on its own.

Videos online show huge pillars supporting the roof smashing into cars parked along the airport's Terminal 1. All flights from the terminal have been suspended until further notice, airport authorities said. The incident took place at 05:00 (23:30 GMT Thursday). \"While the cause for the collapse is being assessed, the primary cause seems to be the continued heavy rainfall over the past few hours,\" a spokesperson for the airport said. Officials said four vehicles were damaged and eight people received minor injuries in the incident. India's aviation regulator has advised airlines to accommodate passengers on alternate flights or offer them refunds. The accident has impacted the travel plans of thousands, as most domestic flights take off from Terminal 1. Some airlines have shifted flight operations to the remaining two terminals at the airport. Authorities at the Delhi International Airport Limited said a technical committee had been formed to investigate the cause of the accident. \"We are working with all relevant agencies to assess the situation and restore operations,\" they added. ANI A canopy over Terminal 1 caved in after heavy rain Federal Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu has announced a compensation of 2m rupees ($24,000; \u00a319,000) to the family of the deceased and 300,000 rupees for the injured. He also told reporters that the situation was under control and that inspection was under way to prevent any further incident. He added that airports with added structures across the country would also be inspected. The incident was criticised on social media, with many users pointing out that the terminal had undergone a massive renovation at the cost of billions of rupees and had been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March \u2013 a month before the recent general election began. However, Mr Kinjarapu later said the portion that collapsed was not part of the renovated section. \u201cI want to clarify that the building inaugurated by PM Modi is on the other side and the building that collapsed here is an old building and was opened in 2009,\" he said. ANI Visuals from the accident site Heavy rains have lashed Delhi since Thursday, providing a much-needed respite from sweltering temperatures that the Indian capital was experiencing since April. But the downpour has pushed the city into chaos as several roads are water-logged, leading to major traffic jams. Commuters reported spending hours in traffic while others said their vehicles had suffered breakdowns. Videos shared on social media showed people wading through knee-deep water and cars and buses partly submerged in subways. The torrential downpour has also led to delays and cancellations of flights. India's meteorological department forecasts that the city will continue to see \"heavy to very heavy rainfall\" over the weekend.

Disaster authorities in India's northeastern state of Assam said four people had died over the past day, bringing the number of people killed there over successive downpours since mid-May to 38. In Bangladesh, landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains killed two people including a Rohingya refugee early on Wednesday, police commander Jahirul Hoque Bhuiyan told AFP. Bhuiyan said authorities in Bangladesh's vast relief camps -- home to around a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar -- had relocated some inhabitants to safety. The worst flooding took place in northeastern Sylhet division, where top government bureaucrat Abu Ahmed Siddique said more than 1.3 million people had been affected. \"Their villages and roads and most of their homes have been inundated by flood water,\" Abu Ahmed Siddique, the government administrator of Sylhet region, told AFP. Kamrul Hasan, the secretary of Bangladesh's disaster management ministry, said that rivers had swelled after rain upstream in India. Much of low-lying Bangladesh is made up of deltas as the Himalayan rivers of the Ganges and Brahmaputra slowly wind towards the sea after coursing through India. Hasan told AFP that hundreds of relief shelters had been opened around Sylhet for those forced out of their homes by flood waters. 'Higher ground' India's weather department has issued alerts for Assam and neighbouring states warning of the risk of more flash floods. Flood waters have damaged roads in the state, and the airforce rescued 13 fishermen stranded on an island. A major portion of the Kaziranga national park, a UNESCO world heritage site and home to the highest number of one-horned rhinos in the world, has also been flooded. \"Forest guards have been put on alert,\" park official Arun Vignesh told AFP. \"Hundreds of animals have started crossing the highway in search of higher ground\". The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall, as well as death and destruction due to flooding and landslides. The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic. Last week, at least 14 people were killed after rains triggered landslides, lightning and flooding in Nepal. In Bangladesh, at least nine people died in a landslide in June. The same month, six people were killed in flash floods and landslides in Sikkim, an Indian state in the Himalayan foothills bordering China. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The soldiers in military vehicles came under fire from militants hiding in a nearby hill, according to initial reports. Reinforcements arrived quickly and a search operation was launched to track down the attackers, officials said. Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, but violence has waned in recent years. Monday afternoon's attack in Jammu marks a month of increasing violence in the region. Last month, nine people died and 33 were injured after suspected militants fired on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in the area. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he was \"deeply anguished\" at the lives lost in the latest attack. \"My deepest condolences to the bereaved families, the nation stands firm with them in this difficult time,\" Mr Singh wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"The counter-terrorist operations are underway, and our soldiers are determined to usher in peace and order in the region,\" he said.

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"1 July  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and two other laws passed in 2023 come into effect as the country's criminal codes, replacing the Indian Penal Code and related laws enacted during the colonial era.","text":"Modi\u2019s government says overhaul would make the country more just, but the opposition fears it would throw criminal justice system into disarray. India's new laws: Rights concerns as colonial-era legislation replaced Opposition parties and lawyers in India are raising concerns over the government replacing colonial-era criminal laws with new legislation, saying the move risks throwing the criminal justice system into disarray. India on Monday implemented an overhaul of the criminal laws, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government said would make the country more just. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 has replaced the Indian Penal Code, 1860; the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 has been implemented in place of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1882. The new laws were approved by parliament in December during Modi\u2019s previous term, with the government saying they aim to \u201cgive justice, not punishment\u201d. It says they were needed as colonial laws had been at the core of the criminal justice system for more than a century. Among the key changes is replacement of the sedition law frequently used as a tool of suppression, after its enactment under British colonial rule to jail Indian freedom fighters. Laws dealing with sexual assault have been strengthened, while a previous law criminalising sodomy has been removed. Other key changes include the amount of time police can hold a suspect rising from 15 days to 60, and, in some special cases, up to 90. India\u2019s top judge DY Chandrachud praised the new laws as a \u201cwatershed moment for our society\u201d. But the opposition said they were rolled out without a discussion in the parliament, while other critics said it could worsen an already glacially slow pace of justice. Congress MP and former federal minister P Chidambaram said the parliament did not hold any \u201cworthwhile debate\u201d before passing the crucial laws. He said there was only marginal improvement in the new laws, which could have been introduced as amendments to existing laws. \u201cThe initial impact will be to throw the administration of criminal justice into disarray,\u201d he posted on X. The three criminal laws to replace the IPC, CrPC and Indian Evidence Act come into force today 90-99 per cent of the so-called new laws are a cut, copy and paste job. A task that could have been completed with a few amendments to the existing three laws has been turned into a\u2026 \u2014 P. Chidambaram (@PChidambaram_IN) July 1, 2024   A week before the laws came into effect, West Bengal state\u2019s chief minister Mamata Banerjee, also a key opposition leader, wrote to Modi, raising concerns about the laws and asking to defer their implementation, saying they were passed \u201cin an authoritarian way in the dark hours of democracy\u201d, local media reports said. In an editorial, the Indian Express newspaper said criminal justice reform should not be \u201ca one-time solution or one that just takes place in the books\u201d, and called for police reform and addressing gaps in judicial infrastructure. But Home Minister Amit Shah rejected the concerns , saying the laws \u201cwere debated for three months\u201d. \u201cIt is not fair to give political colour to this big improvement happening after centuries. I ask the opposition parties to support this legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 77 years after independence, our criminal justice system is becoming completely indigenous and will run on Indian ethos,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead of punishment, there will now be justice.\u201d Criminal cases registered under the repealed laws before Monday will continue to follow them, Shah said, adding that the first case logged under the new law was that of a motorcycle theft in the central city of Gwalior, registered 10 minutes after midnight. But many lawyers say the new laws could create confusion, as they will run parallel to those on trial charged under the previous system. Supreme Court lawyer Nipun Saxena told the AFP news agency that the new laws give power to the police to decide on a case when previously it was up to a judge to decide if a case could proceed to trial. \u201cJudicial functions cannot be transferred to police,\u201d Saxena said. The code has also been modernised \u2013 requiring video recordings to be made at the scene of serious crimes, as well as updating admissible digital evidence. Saxena warned the changes could increase the number of cases awaiting trial by \u201c30-40 percent\u201d. India already has a notoriously slow justice system, with millions of cases pending in the courts at any time. \u201cMany crucial safeguards have been omitted completely,\u201d Saxena added, noting that the new laws violate \u201cat least four articles of the constitution and many important judgements of the Supreme Court\u201d. He said these relate to procedural safeguards, protection against illegal detention, and laws against self-incrimination. After independence in 1947, India inherited the 19th-century penal code imposed by British rule, although it has been overhauled by previous parliaments. \u201cThe claim that the changes decolonialise the criminal procedure code is spurious,\u201d Saxena said. \u201cIn the medium term, numerous challenges to the laws will be instituted in various courts,\u201d said Chidambaram. \u201cIn the long term, further changes must be made to the three laws to bring them in conformity with the constitution and the modern principles of criminal jurisprudence.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","question":"What were some key changes introduced by India's new criminal laws in 2024?","answer":"The new laws replaced the colonial-era sedition law, strengthened sexual assault laws, removed the criminalization of sodomy, and extended police detention periods from 15 days to up to 90 days in some cases.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: In 2024, India introduced several key changes to its criminal laws, aimed at modernizing the legal framework and addressing contemporary issues.

This was India\u2019s sixth Olympic medal in shooting and first-ever in a shooting team event. The result also made Manu Bhaker the first athlete of independent India to win two medals in one edition of the Olympics. On Sunday, Manu Bhaker became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal in shooting. Competing at the National Shooting Center in Chateauroux, Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh defeated the Republic of Korea\u2019s Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee 16-10 in the bronze medal match. Oh Ye Jin won the gold medal in the women\u2019s 10m air pistol event on Sunday. Manu Bhaker started strongly, shooting a 10.2 on her opening shot. Sarabjot Singh\u2019s 8.6 cost India the first two points but he recovered quickly with scores of 10.5, 10.4 and 10 to help India take the next six points.

Spain took the lead through captain Marc Miralles (18\u2019) but India struck right back through a brace by skipper Harmanpreet Singh (30\u2019, 33\u2019). The victory at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium saw India secure a record-extending 13th medal in hockey at the Olympics and the second bronze in successive editions. India, in fact, won successive medals in hockey for the first time since Munich 1972 , played 52 years ago. \"I feel great,\" India hockey captain Harmanpreet Singh said. \"We create history again, back-to-back (bronze medals). It's a big day for India and a big day for hockey. \"Today's game was very good. We played as a team. Everyone delivered, especially our legend Sreejesh. It was his last game. It's a memorable game for him, and a big achievement as a team.\" Heading into Paris 2024, India were the most successful hockey team in Olympic history with eight gold, one silver and three bronze medals. At Tokyo 2020, the team had broken a 41-year-long medal drought by capturing a historic bronze. Up against world No. 8 Spain, who upset defending champions Belgium in the quarter-finals, the Indian team, fifth in hockey rankings, began cautiously but slowly grew into the game as it progressed. From the midway stage of the opening quarter, the Indian hockey team started to launch meaningful forays in the Spanish attacking third but failed to create any clear cut chances. Spain, meanwhile, could only manage a couple of circle penetrations throughout the opening quarter compared to India\u2019s nine. A couple of minutes into the second quarter, though, it was Spain who took the lead through a penalty stroke. Manpreet Singh\u2019s infringement inside the circle saw the referee point towards the spot and Marc Miralles stepped up to blaze one in the top corner past PR Sreejesh. The Spain men\u2019s hockey team, looking for their first Olympic medal since a silver at Beijing 2008, got an opportunity to double their advantage as they were awarded two penalty corners shortly after the opening goal. However, some fantastic rushing by Amit Rohidas, back in the Indian playing line-up after serving a suspension in the semi-finals against Germany, kept the Spanish charge at bay. Borja Lacalle thought he had Sreejesh beat for the second time in the match but his shot came out off the post and the Indian goalkeeper ensured the resulting penalty corner stayed out. With less than 15 seconds left for the first-half hooter, India equalised as Harmanpreet Singh successfully converted a penalty corner to register his ninth goal of Paris 2024 and consolidated his position as the top scorer in the tournament. Harmanpreet drag flicked in his second of the match minutes after the half-time break to give the Indian hockey team the lead for the first time in the match. The Indian skipper had a crack at a hat-trick, again from a penalty corner, shortly after but this time, was thwarted by Spanish custodian Luis Calzado. Spain managed to get the ball in the Indian net with five minutes to go in the third quarter as Joaquin Menini bundled it in after pouncing on a loose ball following Sreejesh\u2019s fantastic save to keep out Jose Basterra\u2019s penalty corner attempt. However, the goal was disallowed as replays showed that the ball had come off a Spanish body in the phase of play. At the other end, Calzado denied India and Harmanpreet again from another penalty corner to keep the difference between the two teams to just one goal heading into the final quarter. The fourth period turned out to be a feisty affair with both teams getting stuck in. As Spain pushed up in search of the all-important equaliser, the Indian backline had to soak in long spells of pressure to see off the win. PR Sreejesh contributed to the win with two gutsy saves in the final two minutes of his storied international hockey career.

This action follows the court\u2019s instruction for the state police to hand over all relevant documents, including the case diary, CCTV footage, and witness statements, to the CBI by 10 am the next day. The court criticized the hospital administration for its lack of support to the victim\u2019s family and its failure to promptly address the case. It also questioned why an unnatural death case was initially filed rather than a murder investigation, calling it a serious oversight. The administration\u2019s delay in lodging a formal complaint further fueled concerns about potential evidence tampering. In response to the ongoing crisis, the court directed that Dr. Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, be placed on leave.

The capital Delhi received intense rainfall late on Wednesday, totalling 147 mm (5.8 inches) in eastern parts of the city and its suburbs, the India Meteorological Department said. Sign up here. At least seven people died in Delhi, according to local media. Three people died and parts of two bridges washed away after a cloudburst - a massive amount of rain in a brief period - in Uttarakhand state, officials said, and bad weather was hampering communications in the hilly terrain. Rescue workers saved over 1,000 people who were stranded in different locations on the Kedarnath route - a trek to a Hindu pilgrimage site - and a patch of the national highway was washed out, district official Saurabh Gaharwar said by phone. Uttarakhand, which is prone to flash floods and landslides, was ravaged by record rainfall in 2013, and nearly 6,000 Hindu devotees on pilgrimages went missing. In neighbouring Himachal Pradesh state, two people died and nearly 50 were missing after flooding caused by rains, authorities said. Photos shared by the state chief minister showed rescue workers crossing streams by rope, as muddy water gushed through rocks between hills. \"The situation is quite bad there and we are trying to pull out people, dead bodies (if any) from the debris,\" Jyoti Rana, a district official in the capital Shimla, told Reuters. Some climate experts have attributed the extreme rainfall, flash floods and deadly landslides seen in the mountains of India, Pakistan and Nepal over the past few years to climate change. Earlier this week, landslides swept through tea estates and villages in southern India's Kerala state, killing at least 178 people after unexpectedly heavy rain. In Delhi, water leaked from the glass dome of a newly constructed parliament building, opposition leader Akhilesh Yadav said on X. The leak was later repaired. Delhi has experienced a series of extreme weather events in the past few months, from scorching temperatures to floods and rainfall that caused a roof collapse at the city's airport.

More than a million were expected to join the strikes, as hospitals and clinics across the country turned away non-emergency patients. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) described last week's killing as a \"crime of barbaric scale due to the lack of safe spaces for women\" and asked for the country's support in its \"struggle for justice\". Protests against the attack and calling for the better protection of women have intensified in recent days after a mob vandalised the hospital where it happened. In a statement, the IMA said emergency and casualty services would continue to run. The strike ended at 06:00 local time on Sunday (00:30 GMT). The association's president, R. V. Asokan, told the BBC doctors have been suffering and protesting against violence for years, but that this incident was \"qualitatively different\". If such a crime can happen in a medical college in a major city, it shows \"everywhere doctors are unsafe\", he said. Doctors at some government hospitals announced earlier this week that they were indefinitely halting elective procedures. India protests intensify over doctor's rape and murder Raped Indian doctor's colleague speaks of trauma and pain The IMA also issued a list of demands including the strengthening of the law to better protect medical staff against violence, increasing the level of security at hospitals and the creation of safe spaces for rest. It called for a \"meticulous and professional investigation\" into the killing and the prosecution of those involved in vandalising, as well as compensation for the woman's family. The rape of the 31-year-old female trainee doctor has shocked the country. Her half-naked body bearing extensive injuries was discovered in a seminar hall at R G Kar Medical College last week after she was reported to have gone there to rest during her shift. A volunteer who worked at the hospital has been arrested in connection with the crime. The case has been transferred from local police to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) following criticism at the lack of progress. More incidents of rape have made headlines in India since the woman's death and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that \"monstrous behaviour against women should be severely and quickly punished\". Reuters Protests demanding justice for the murdered woman and greater protection for women in general have been held across India The woman's rape and killing has sparked a political blame game in West Bengal, with the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing the governing Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) of orchestrating the attack. The TMC has refuted the allegation and has blamed \"political outsiders\" for stoking the violence. Tens of thousands of women across West Bengal participated in the Reclaim the Night march on Wednesday night to demand \"independence to live in freedom and without fear\". Though the protests were largely peaceful, clashes erupted between the police and a small group of unidentified men who barged into the RG Kar Hospital - the site of the crime - and ransacked its emergency ward. At least 25 people have been arrested in connection with the incident so far. Protests have also been held in many other Indian cities like Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune. \"It feels like hope is being reignited,\" one demonstrator, Sumita Datta, told the AFP news agency as thousands of people marched through the streets of Kolkata on Friday.

The first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history came at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow is making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion. Sign up here. The optics closely resembled the Indian leader's visit to Moscow last month where he called for peace and embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering Ukraine, where a Russian missile strike hit a children's hospital on the same day. \"The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy. And we should move in that direction without wasting any time. Both sides should sit together to find a way out of this crisis,\" Modi said in Kyiv. \"I want to assure you that India is ready to play an active role in any efforts towards peace. If I can play any role in this personally, I will do that, I want to assure you as a friend,\" he said. It was not immediately clear what Kyiv made of his remarks and whether they were part of a diplomatic push taking place behind closed doors with a November presidential election looming in the United States, a close ally of Ukraine. Speaking later on Friday in his regular address to the nation after the visit had ended, Zelenskiy said it is \"important to us that India remains committed to international law and supports our sovereignty and territorial integrity\". He also said he appreciated that Modi had begun the visit by paying tribute to the children killed in the July hospital strike. India, which traditionally has close economic and defence relations with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war, but also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow. Both leaders described Modi's visit as \"historic\" in their statements during their meeting, in which Modi spoke second and Zelenskiy had no opportunity to respond to the call for dialogue. Zelenskiy said that \"the matter of ending the war and a just peace are the priority for Ukraine\".

REUTERS\/Gleb Garanich Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants the war to end but on Kyiv's terms, not Russia's. Ukraine has been pushing to hold a second international summit later this year to advance its vision of peace and involve representatives from Russia. The first summit, held in Switzerland in June, pointedly excluded Russia, while attracting scores of delegations, including one from India, but not from China, the world's second largest economy. Zelenskiy urged Modi to sign the summit's communique, which India has not done. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region on Aug. 6. Kyiv's top commander has touted the capture of almost 100 settlements in the assault, part of what military analysts see as an attempt to divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine where Moscow's forces are making gains. 'CERTAIN INFLUENCE' Modi's visit to Moscow prompted Zelenskiy to criticise the Indian prime minister when the trip coincided with the missile strike that hit a children's hospital in Kyiv. As he welcomed Modi to the Mariinskyi presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy embraced him with a frowning expression before they began talks. Modi issued renewed condolences over the missile strike on X in a post written in Ukrainian. \"Conflict is particularly devastating for young children. My heart goes out to the families of children who lost their lives, and I pray that they find the strength to endure their grief,\" the post said. In the run-up to the visit, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in Zelenskiy's office, told Reuters it was significant because New Delhi \"really has a certain influence\" over Moscow. \"It's extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is - and that it is also in their interests,\" he said. As Western nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and cut trade relations with it over the invasion, India has developed its economic ties. Indian refiners that rarely bought Russian oil in the past have emerged as Moscow's top clients for seaborne crude since Russia poured troops into Ukraine two-and-a-half years ago. Russian oil accounts for over two-fifths of India's oil imports.

The Union government has discharged controversial IAS probationer Puja Khedkar from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) with immediate effect, weeks after the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) cancelled her provisional candidature. Puja Khedkar (File Photo) Khedkar, who faces serious allegations of cheating and misusing benefits under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and disability quotas, was discharged from the IAS under Rule 12 of IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, according to people aware of the matter. Explained: What UPSC aspirants must know about Aadhaar-based authentication and what process may be in store The rules allow the central government to discharge probationers from service if they fail \"to pass the re-examination...\" or \"if the central government is satisfied that the probationer was ineligible for recruitment to the Service or is unsuitable for being a member of the Service\", among others. Puja Khedkar's legal troubles began when it was alleged that she misrepresented information to avail reservation benefits in her application for the UPSC Civil Services Examination 2022.

She has denied all allegations. On Thursday, Khedkar told the Delhi high court she was willing to get herself medically examined in AIIMS, after the Delhi Police claimed that one of her disability certificates may be \"forged\" and \"fabricated\". \"I am willing to get myself medically examined. First they say I changed my name. Now they say disability is questionable. I am willing to go to AIIMS,\" the senior counsel appearing for Khedkar said.

Since then, the Muslim-majority territory of some 12 million people -- divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in full -- has not had an elected local government. Instead, it has been ruled by a governor appointed by New Delhi. While voters took part in national elections in June when Modi won a third term in power, these were the first local elections since 2014. As results were announced, with an alliance of the opposition National Conference (NC) and Congress parties to form a government, supporters celebrated. Election Commission figures showed NC and Congress had won 48 of 90 seats in the assembly, with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coming a distant second with 29. Some called the vote a de facto referendum on the federal government's decision to repeal the territory's special status.

New Delhi will also have the power to override legislation, and will continue to appoint the governor. Modi's BJP says the changes to the territory's governance have delivered a new era of peace to Kashmir and rapid economic growth -- claims other parties reject. About 500,000 Indian troops are deployed in the region, battling a 35-year insurgency in which tens of thousands of civilians, soldiers and rebels have been killed \u00a9 Tauseef MUSTAFA \/ AFP The BJP won seats in the southern Hindu-majority Jammu region, and fought only from about a third of the seats in the Kashmir valley.

A curfew was imposed in three districts of Manipur while the state government said that internet and mobile data services would be suspended until Sunday in order to curb misinformation and hate speech that could trigger more violence. Manipur, a restive state of 3.2 million people tucked in the mountains on India\u2019s border with Myanmar, has experienced periodic violence for more than a year between the predominantly Hindu-majority Meitei and the mainly Christian Kukis over economic benefits and government jobs and education quotas. Despite a heavy army presence, the deadly clashes have persisted.    At least nine people have been killed and several injured in the last 10 days as armed groups launched drone attacks and rockets from homemade devices. Hundreds of Meitei in the state capital, Imphal, defied a curfew imposed earlier on Tuesday to demand that security forces take action against Kuki fighting groups, whom they blame for the latest spate of attacks. Student-led protests on Monday turned violent after the crowd threw stones and plastic bottles at security forces, police said in a statement, adding that protesters in another district snatched arms from police and fired at them. On Tuesday, police lobbed tear gas at hundreds of students who attempted to march towards the Manipur governor\u2019s house and demanded the restoration of peace in the state. Students say they are frustrated with the government\u2019s failure to resolve the 16-month-long conflict. About 250 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced after mobs rampaged through villages and torched houses since last May. Student leader Ch Victor Singh said that protesters gave Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya 24 hours to respond to a list of demands, which includes the removal of the top police official in the state and the security adviser for their failure to control the violence, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. \u201cWe urge the students to engage in peaceful marches or protests and follow the law,\u201d said IK Muivah, a senior police officer in Imphal. He said police were investigating the recent attacks.

Konyak, 60, said the ruling appeared as if \"only the lives of uniformed men matter\". Indian commandos in the northeastern state of Nagaland killed six miners in December 2021 when they fired on a truck, mistaking them for insurgents operating near the frontier with war-torn Myanmar. Nagaland has seen decades of unrest among ethnic and separatist groups, and the army said after the killings that its troops had acted on \"credible intelligence\". Later, officers fired on protesters angry at the deaths, taking the toll to 13 civilians. In addition, a soldier was killed in the violence. At the time, Home Minister Amit Shah vowed a probe would provide \"justice to the bereaved families\", and state police pressed charges of attempted murder against 30 soldiers. But the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to endorse the process. New Delhi's green light is required to prosecute soldiers operating in hostile areas covered by special laws granting commanders the discretion to prosecute officers. The Supreme Court in New Delhi ruled on Tuesday that charges against soldiers have to be quashed because there had been no government approval for prosecution. \"I am disgusted,\" Konyak said. \"Thirteen people have been killed, and several have been maimed for life, but there is no accountability.\" Survivors say they were shot at despite it being clear that they were unarmed civilians. Tingshen Konyak, 37, was among a group bringing the bodies of those killed in the initial shooting back to their families when he said soldiers shot him in the hand, removing his thumb. \"We feel bad, but we can do nothing,\" Tingshen said, adding that he felt \"helpless\". \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Her mother has penned a letter to the MNC's India Chairman, calling for reforms in the company's stressful work environment to prevent future tragedies and safeguard employee health. In a shocking incident, a 26-year-old young Chartered Accountant working at a reputed MNC in India died recently because of work stress , the late employee's mother has claimed. Yes, you read that right! The mother of the deceased has now written a letter to the MNC's India Chairman, bringing the issue to light and urging for a reform in the stressful work culture. The late Ms. Anna Sebastian Perayil was a young CA who graduated with distinction in November 2023 and then joined the MNC''s Pune in March 2024. However, the increasing workload and stress with no time to rest and recuperate took a toll on her life. In just four months of her career, Anna was crushed under an intolerable workload and she died on July 20, 2024. Sharing their plight and how a toxic work culture led to her daughter's death, Anna Sebastian Perayil's mother Anita Augustine wrote in the letter, \"I am writing this letter as a grieving mother who has lost her precious child, Anna Sebastian Perayil. My heart is heavy, and my soul is shattered as I pen these words, but I believe it is necessary to share our story in the hope that no other family will have to endure the pain we are going through... It was her first job, and she was thrilled to be a part of such a prestigious company. But four years later, on July 20th, 2024, my world collapsed when I received the devastating news that Anna passed away. She was just 26 years old.\" Sharing how Anna was overwhelmed with work and how it adversely affected her health with no time to eat, sleep, rest, or exercise, her mother further shared an incident when they had taken her to a doctor just days before her untimely death. \"On Saturday, July 6th, my husband and I reached Pune to attend Anna's CA Convocation. Since she had been complaining of chest constriction upon reaching her PG late at night (around 1am) for the past week, we took her to the hospital in Pune. Her ECG was normal, and the cardiologist came to allay our fears, telling us she wasn't getting enough sleep and was eating very late. He prescribed antacids, which assured us it wasn't anything serious.\" She also wrote that considering the overbearing workload, Anna would often come home late \"sometimes collapsing on the bed without even changing her clothes, only to be bombarded with messages asking for more reports.. . We told her to quit, but she wanted to learn and gain new exposure. However, the overwhelming pressure proved too much even for her.\" In the four-page long letter, Anita Augustine urged the MNC's India Chairman to bring a change in their work culture and ensure the well-being of its employees. The shocking news of Anna's death has stirred up a debate about India's hustle culture and the need for work-life balance . However, this is not the first incident when someone has died due to overwhelming work stress. In a similar incident, a 30-year-old Chinese man died after working non-stop for 104 days and with just one day off. In another incident, a delivery driver in China was found dead while he was napping on his bike. The man was 55 years old and he used to work 18 hours every day to earn a living as per reports.

Called clade 1b, the new variant is highly-transmissible and has been linked to the mpox outbreak in Africa . According to media reports, the strain has been detected in a 38-year-old man from the southern state of Kerala who returned from Dubai recently. Mpox, previously known as monkey pox, is a contagious virus that can cause painful skin lesions. The WHO declared mpox, which used to be called monkeypox, a public health emergency in Africa in August. Since then, the more dangerous variant of the virus has spread to countries outside the African continent, including Sweden, Thailand and Pakistan. On Tuesday, Health Ministry spokesperson Manisha Verma confirmed to Reuters that the mpox case reported in Kerala's Malappuram district belonged to clade 1. The patient is being treated in a hospital and the people he came in contact with are being traced and monitored, authorities said. The district's health officer said that about 29 friends and family members of the patient along with 37 passengers on board his flight were being monitored but none of them had exhibited any symptoms so far, the news agency reported. In the last two years, India has reported more that 30 mpox cases caused by the older clade 2 strain, which is considered to be less infectious. Earlier this month, the mpox strain was detected in a man from northern Haryana state, who was admitted in hospital for a few days. Mpox spreads from animals to humans and between people through close contact with someone who is infected - including through sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person. It can cause symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and lesions across the body. If left untreated, mpox can be deadly. The federal government has issued an advisory to all states, asking them to be vigilant for potential mpox cases.

The controversy erupted last week when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said that lab reports had shown that laddus offered to the deity and then distributed to devotees every day at the famous Tirupati temple in the state were contaminated with animal and vegetable fat. He said the ghee (clarified butter) used in the sweets was adulterated with \u201cbeef tallow, fish oil and other impurities\u201d. Temple offerings in India are usually vegetarian. On the face of it, it appeared like a matter of food adulteration - something that authorities in India routinely grapple with . But since Naidu\u2019s announcement, the issue has dominated headlines, caused a major political row and prompted other temples to test their sweets for \u201cpurity\u201d. Getty Images The Tirupati temple attracts millions of devotees from India every year The Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh is one of Hinduism\u2019s most sacred shrines. Dedicated to Hindu god Sri Venkateswara - popularly known as Balaji \u2013 the temple owns assets worth tens of billions of dollars and attracts nearly 24 million devotees from India and abroad every year. The famous Tirupati laddus - made with gram flour, sugar, cashews, raisins and cardamom and cooked in \u201cpure cow ghee\u201d \u2013 are prized by devotees who consider them god\u2019s blessing and carry them back home to share with family and friends. Reports say more than 350,000 laddus are prepared daily in the temple\u2019s kitchen. So Naidu\u2019s revelations have been met with dismay, with many religious leaders calling on authorities to protect the sanctity of temples. \u201cCare should be taken that such great sins are not repeated in a temple that has tens of millions of devotees,\u201d Ramana Deekshitulu, a priest, told news agency ANI. Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, another prominent priest, called it \u201can attack on the faith and belief of tens of millions of Hindus\u201d. \u201cThis is an organised crime and a huge betrayal of Hindus. It should be investigated and strict action should be taken against the guilty,\u201d he told a news channel. The issue has also turned into a political slugfest after Naidu blamed his rival and former chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for the \"desecration\". BBC Telugu Laddus being made in the Tirupati temple kitchen Naidu, who was sworn in as the state\u2019s chief minister in June, alleged that the impure laddus were distributed to devotees during Reddy\u2019s term. The temple board is run by the state government, which appoints its chief. Naidu said he had changed the ghee supplier and formed a special investigation team led by a senior police officer to address the issue. An angry Reddy has rejected the allegations and accused Naidu of playing politics. In a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he asked him to \u201cseverely reprimand\u201d Naidu, who\u2019s a key ally in Modi\u2019s federal government. \u201cNaidu is a pathological and habitual liar\u201d who was tarnishing the image of the temple trust with false campaigns, he wrote. Reddy said even though the temple did not have a lab to check the ghee\u2019s purity, its officials were experienced in identifying impurities by appearance and smell and that there had been instances - both during his government and also earlier when Naidu\u2019s party had been in power - when ghee tankers were sent back to suppliers. Reddy's party has also invited people to take part in religious rituals in temples across the state to \"atone for the sin\" that, they say, Naidu has committed by making allegations about the laddus. TTD A Tirupati  priest sprinkled holy water on trays of laddus as part of a purification ritual Meanwhile, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) \u2013 the board that manages the nearly 2,000-year-old temple - has been trying to do damage control. A board spokesperson told reporters that they were sourcing ghee from five companies via tenders. After complaints from pilgrims and laddu makers, they sent samples for lab tests which revealed that four tankers from AR Dairy in Tamil Nadu were of substandard quality. In response, AR Dairy, which has been producing ghee since 1998 and claims to conduct 102 quality checks on its milk, dismissed the allegations as \u201cabsurd\u201d and stated that they are \u201cseverely damaging to our business.\u201d It said a quality control officer at the firm had called the allegations that fish oil was added \u201cnonsensical\u201d, as fish oil costs more than ghee, and that \u201cany form of adulteration would be immediately noticeable by its odour\u201d. The temple, meanwhile, said it had done its own penance. To assure devotees that its laddus were now rid of defects and fit for gods and humans, the priests held a four-hour-long \u201cpurification ritual\u201d on Monday. Photographs released by the temple board showed priests sprinkling holy water in the kitchen, on sacks of ingredients and on huge trays of laddus. Getty Images Bollywood stars Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai at the Tirupati temple after their wedding in 2007 The controversy, however, refuses to die down and has dominated headlines in the state. Popular actor and the state\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan called the adulteration \u201can attack on Hindu religion\u201d. Kalyan is also performing what he called 11 days of atonement rituals to rectify the \"great injustice\". Members of a Hindu nationalist group have demonstrated outside Reddy\u2019s home, chanting slogans. They left after painting the gate and walls saffron - a colour that is worn by many Hindu priests and is also the colour of flags of BJP and other Hindu parties. Authorities in other states have also been rushing to test sweets offered at other Hindu temples, including the famous Krishna temple in Mathura in Uttar Pradesh and the Jagannath temple in Odisha state. The issue has also found resonance on social media. Laddu, along with hashtags such as #TirupatiLaddu, #TirupatiLadduControversy and #TirupatiLadduRow, has trended for days on X (formerly Twitter), with many expressing their outrage at what they called deliberate attempts to hurt Hindu faith. Some of this outrage, however, appeared to be manufactured after it was pointed out that many handles pledging support to Hindu nationalist groups had shared images of Reddy wearing a Muslim skullcap and derided him as \u201canti-Hindu\u201d. One tweet, shared by many handles two days after Naidu\u2019s allegation, was especially flagged for using identical words by people who appeared unrelated. It said: \u201cFor the past 2-3 years, Amma [mother] used to fall sick if she tasted Tirupati laddus and used to tell us not to eat too much of it. We put it on her general paranoia.

Many were seen shading themselves from the blinding sun with umbrellas. Advertisement Written by: J Sam Daniel Stalin India News Oct 07, 2024 11:21 am IST Published On Oct 06, 2024 20:42 pm IST Last Updated On Oct 07, 2024 11:21 am IST Read Time: 4 mins > Chennai: At least five spectators died after visiting the Indian Air Force (IAF) air show in Chennai on Sunday, where many complained about huge crowds, heat and mismanagement. One man reportedly suffered a sun stroke while he was riding his bike after the show. He was stuck in traffic for more than an hour. \"Volunteers even identified his condition as he was losing control amid the stranded crowd and helped him get off the bike,\" an eyewitness told NDTV. A senior medical officer said a post-mortem would identify the cause of death\". Questions are being raised over the Indian Air Force aggressively pushing this event to set a Limca Book of World Record by aiming to mobilise 15 lakh spectators -- much beyond manageable -- and the Chennai City Police's poor crowd and traffic management. DMK MP K Kanimozhi said unmanageable gatherings should be avoided. \"The news of the death of 5 people is very sad and painful when the public who witnessed the IAF adventure program held at the Marina beach in Chennai suffered from the crowd and the temperature was high. Unmanageable gatherings should also be avoided,\" she said. Everything had been going smoothly ahead of the event, with largescale traffic diversion and parking regulations. But closer to the air show -- scheduled at 11 am -- the crowd got so large that the elevated MRTS railway stations along the Marina Beach road had turned into a sea of people. Advertisement Chaos broke out after the event when the crowd started to disperse. Every inch of the space on the Beach road appeared occupied. The arrangement for drinking water in the spectators' area was allegedly inadequate. With temperature soaring and no public transport, hundreds had to walk three to four kilometres on the jam-packed roads to get any public conveyance or pick up their vehicles. Advertisement Many - children among them - just sat on the sidewalk, tired and dehydrated. Many were seen attending to fainting or weary people. With no effective police regulation on the ground, vehicles and two wheelers haphazardly entered both ways and remained stuck for more than two hours on most roads. Advertisement Many police personnel were busy returning on their two wheelers, turning into mute spectators. They neither regulated the situation nor intervened to help stranded ambulances until there was public uproar. There was no drinking water stations along the roads. Most eateries on these stretches were shut and shops that were open ran out of water and soft drinks soon. Advertisement A woman who had brought her two children said, \"The state government has failed us. No proper arrangements at all either at the venue or on the roads\". The Chennai police had deployed 6,500 police personnel and 1,500 home guards for security. It is not clear if the Tamil Nadu government - which has a culture of objecting to mass gatherings citing security concerns - had expressed its concern to the Air Force or had advised against hyping the show. Advertisement Health Minister Ma Subramanian said in a statement the state Chief Secretary had presided over a coordination meeting with IAF and other officials had held several meetings. \"Arrangements were made keeping in mind IAF's demands. The Chennai Corporation and Metro Water too had made adequate temporary toilets and drinking water arrangements,\" he said. Another note with no attribution claimed, \"No one dead in the crowd. No death is related to crowd or mismanagement\". The air show had included a show by the Special Garud Force commandos in a simulated rescue operation and in freeing the hostage. It also showcased 72 aircraft, including Rafale, indigenously manufactured state-of-the-art Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, Light Combat helicopter Prachand, and Heritage aircraft Dakota.

New Delhi, India \u2013 Four months after losing its majority in parliament for the first time in a decade, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a record third term in the northern state of Haryana and scored its best ever performance in Indian-administered Kashmir, marking a dramatic turnaround. The results of the two northern states\u2019 assembly elections announced on Tuesday also represent a significant setback for the opposition Congress party\u2019s bid to end the BJP\u2019s dominance over electoral politics in India since 2014, political analysts told Al Jazeera on Wednesday. The Congress leads the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) that won 234 seats in the parliamentary election, of which results were announced in June, forcing the BJP \u2013 which won 240 seats in a house where the majority mark is 272 \u2013 to rely on allies to form a government. But in Haryana, the Congress lost the election despite exit polls predicting it would win comfortably amid anger against the state\u2019s BJP government among sections of people, including farmers and champion wrestlers. India\u2019s grand old party also recorded its worst-ever performance in Jammu and Kashmir in the first legislative election there since New Delhi stripped the region\u2019s autonomy in August 2019. However, the Congress will still be a part of the next government in Kashmir as its regional alliance partner, the National Conference (NC), outran the BJP to secure the numbers needed to lead the next administration. After the BJP lost its parliamentary majority in June this year and had to rely on its allies\u2019 support to form the government, \u201cthe Congress saw itself getting back into this \u2018revival momentum\u2019 in the assembly elections\u201d, Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst, told Al Jazeera. \u201cBut the results proved a booster for Modi\u2019s BJP, which now has oxygen to feel more confident in New Delhi, and [the victory in Haryana] gives the BJP more heft in the important upcoming state elections.\u201d Four key states \u2013 the national capital territory of Delhi, Maharashtra in the west, and Bihar and Jharkhand in the east \u2013 are scheduled to vote in a few months. In the last parliamentary election results, the Congress won five of Haryana\u2019s 10 seats \u2013 the BJP won the other five. It was a major shift from the last national election, held in 2019, when the BJP swept all 10 seats. But in the state election, the main opposition party \u201cfailed owing to the internal differences between the Congress\u2019s central and state leadership, and the battles within the state factions\u201d, said Asim Ali, a political researcher and columnist. As per the data from the Election Commission of India, the BJP\u2019s vote share in the state jumped by 3.4 percentage points to 39.89 percent as compared with the 2019 state election. The Congress\u2019s gain was much larger \u2013 from 28.08 to 39.09 percent. However, a closer look reveals that the opposition\u2019s gains were carved out from the vote shares of other regional parties, not the BJP\u2019s support base. As a result, the BJP won 48 seats in the latest state elections, an increase from the 40 seats it secured in 2019, while the Congress secured 36, up from 31. The majority mark is 46 in the 90-member assembly. \u201cWe literally lost because of our own differences and the ego of old veterans that refuse to cede any space,\u201d said a senior politician who is an executive member of the Haryana Congress unit, requesting anonymity. \u201cFrom monopolising candidate nominations to the campaigning strategy, Haryana Congress was taken over by the Hooda family and the disappointing results are in front of us,\u201d they said, referring to former chief minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Though the differences in the state unit were no secret, Ali, the political researcher, said the Congress\u2019s central leadership gambled by betting on Hooda\u2019s caste-based politics that appealed to voters from Haryana\u2019s dominant Jat community, which wields influence over nearly 40 seats. On the other hand, the BJP\u2019s \u201clocal level management of the election seemed to have done the maths for them\u201d, Ali added. \u201cThe Congress\u2019s inability to course-correct paints a troubling portrait of central leadership deficit, particularly the ability to assertively push through tough changes on the state level,\u201d said Ali. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented move, the Congress has refused to accept the results in Haryana, alleging manipulation of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) to rig the results. \u201c[The results] go against ground reality,\u201d said Jairam Ramesh, a party spokesman. No leading political party in India has ever refused to accept election results in India before. \u201c[The BJP\u2019s] victory of manipulations, subverting will of people and a defeat of transparent, democratic processes,\u201d he said, adding that they will lodge complaints with the poll body and fight it further. \u201cThe Haryana chapter is not closed yet.\u201d In the first votes polled in Kashmir since New Delhi revoked the region\u2019s autonomy , the regional NC emerged as the largest party, winning 42 seats in the 90-member assembly. The result has been hailed as a mandate against the BJP\u2019s unilateral downgrading of the region\u2019s legislative powers, bureaucratic overreach, and an ongoing crackdown on civil liberties, political analyst Sheikh Showkat told Al Jazeera. The NC fought elections in alliance with the Congress; the national party won six seats, including one in Jammu, its lowest tally ever in the Hindu-dominated region in the south of the disputed region. The BJP, on the other hand, failed to open its account in the Kashmir valley but maintained its decisive stronghold in the Jammu region, winning its individual best 29 seats \u2013 and emerging with the largest vote share of 25.5 percent overall, followed by the NC with 23.4 percent vote share. Voting percentages were lower in the Kashmir valley than in the Jammu region. The sharp divide between Hindu-majority Jammu and Muslim-majority Kashmir, two regions of the administrative unit, has dictated the electoral politics in the region. \u201cWe are not happy with the BJP\u2019s work in the last years and their decision to remove Article 370. The business has taken a hit and the government has done nothing for us,\u201d KC Chalotra, a 67-year-old voter from Jammu, told Al Jazeera. \u201cBut I still voted for them because we wanted a Hindu chief minister.\u201d That may not happen, with former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah of the NC likely to lead the government again. Disappointed with the results, Chalotra added, \u201cThe BJP has gotten a strong mandate from us, but still the NC will form a government that has no representative from our region.\u201d Abdullah has assured the Jammu region of representation in the government, and on X exchanged greetings with Modi, saying the NC-led government will \u201clook forward to a constructive relationship in the true spirit of federalism so that the people of J&K may benefit from continued development [and] good governance\u201d. There were tepid celebrations outside the Congress office in the Kashmir valley as well. The party will be part of the upcoming government, \u201cbut in reality, they remain on the periphery and do not find resonance in Jammu and Kashmir\u201d, said Showkat, the Kashmiri political analyst. The results of the two assembly elections will also echo in the Congress corridors in New Delhi, said Kidwai, the political analyst, and especially for Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Gandhi family that has ruled the country for decades and led the Congress for even longer. Gandhi is the current leader of the opposition in parliament. After making significant gains in the parliamentary elections, \u201cGandhi wanted to advance the Congress story\u201d, said Kidwai. \u201cBut the results now force them back to the alliance\u2019s story\u201d, which, he added, referred to Gandhi\u2019s advancing a narrative of Congress\u2019s success on its own, and not of the INDIA alliance pushing back the BJP. Ali, the political researcher, agreed. \u201cCongress has singlehandedly wiped out its budding momentum post the general elections,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it has placed itself on a weak wicket ahead of the crucial upcoming state elections\u201d in four states where the party will be dependent on regional allies. \u201cThese results have shown that the Congress is not yet equipped to take the BJP head-on,\u201d he said.

Oct 25, 2024 11:10 (IST) > Dana's Impact Minimised By Preparation, But Cyclones Getting Worse Scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world heats up due to climate change driven by burning fossil fuels. Warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapour, which provides additional energy for storms, strengthening winds. A warming atmosphere also allows storms to hold more water, boosting heavy rainfall. But better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced death tolls.

India and China have agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas that could lead to the resolution of a conflict that began in 2020, according to the Indian Ministry\u00a0of\u00a0External Affairs. \u201cOver the last several weeks, Indian and Chinese diplomats and military negotiators have been in close contact with each other, and as a result of these discussions, an agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements along the LAC in the India-China border leading to the disengagements and a resolution of the issues that had arisen in 2020,\u201d Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in New Delhi on Monday, referring to the Line of Actual Control notional demarcation line between the two countries. The LAC is a 3,488km-long (2,167-mile) border in the Himalayas shared by the two Asian giants, with China claiming a considerably shorter portion. It separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India\u2019s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety considering it part of its Tibet region, and the two fought a border war in 1962.  Misri did not specify whether the pact means the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed by the two countries along their disputed border in the northern Ladakh region since their armies clashed in 2020 in a significant escalation. There was no immediate comment from Beijing. The announcement was made on the eve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit, which involves China and other major developing economies. Local media reported that Modi could hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the event.    Ties between India and China deteriorated in July 2020 after a military clash killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese. It turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. India and China have withdrawn troops from some areas on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso Lake, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but continue to maintain extra troops as part of a multitier deployment. Top Indian and Chinese army commanders have held several rounds of talks since the military clash to discuss the disengagement of troops from areas of tension. Earlier this month, India\u2019s army chief said New Delhi wants the status on the frontier in the western Himalayas to be restored to its pre-April 2020 position when the standoff began and the situation will remain sensitive until then. The two sides have resolved the \u201clow-hanging fruits\u201d and now need to address difficult situations, General Upendra Dwivedi said, adding that there was \u201cpositive signalling\u201d from the diplomatic side and execution on the ground was dependent on military commanders of the two countries. India\u2019s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday said the pact is \u201ca product of very patient and very persevering diplomacy\u201d and that it will resume military patrolling the way it was before the 2020 clash. \u201cHopefully, we will be able to come back to peace and tranquillity. And that was our major concern because we always said that if you disturb peace and tranquillity, how do you expect the rest of the relationship to go forward,\u201d Jaishankar told India\u2019s NDTV news channel.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government responded after police began pursuing credible allegations that Indian agents were directly involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Canadian police accused Indian agents of involvement in \"homicides, extortion and violent acts\" and targeting supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement, which seeks a separate homeland for Sikhs in India.

Relations between Delhi and Ottawa have been strained since Trudeau said Canada had credible evidence linking Indian agents to Nijjar's murder. The row led to a deterioration in ties , with India asking Canada to withdraw dozens of its diplomatic staff and suspending visa services . On Monday, a furious statement from India's foreign ministry said Canada's allegations were influenced by Sikh separatist campaigners. Later in the day, it announced six Canadian diplomats, including acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler, had been asked to leave India by 19 October. Mr Wheeler was also summoned by India's external affairs ministry to explain Canada's move. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Wheeler said Canada had given India the evidence it had demanded, it now needed to investigate the allegations. \"It\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0interests\u00a0of\u00a0both\u00a0our\u00a0countries\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0peoples\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0countries\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0bottom\u00a0of\u00a0this,\" he said. Delhi has defended its High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, referring to his \"distinguished career spanning 36 years\". \"The aspersions cast on him by the government of Canada are ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt,\" it said. The Indian foreign ministry also said it was \"withdrawing\" its top envoy and other diplomats. \"We have no faith in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.\" Earlier on Monday, Canadian police said they had taken the unusual step of publicly disclosing information about ongoing investigation \"due to significant threat to public safety in our country\". RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme told reporters at a news conference on Monday that there had been \"over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life\" which he said \"specifically\" focussed on members of the pro-Khalistan movement. He added that the threats were sufficiently serious to warrant the RCMP's public intervention. \"We reached a point where we felt it was imperative to confront the government of India.\" Officials said a dozen Indian agents were involved in the alleged criminal activities, but did not confirm if they were directly linked to the June 2023 murder of Sikh separatist leader Nijjar . Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot and killed by two masked gunmen outside a Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia . He had been a vocal supporter of the Khalistan movement, which demands a separate Sikh homeland, and publicly campaigned for it. India has in the past described him as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters called unfounded. Canadian police called his killing a \"targeted attack\". In September 2023, Trudeau had told Canada's parliament that allegations of Indian involvement in the killing were based on Canadian intelligence. He called the act a violation of Canada's sovereignty. Frosty ties between the two countries seemed to have thawed slightly after India resumed processing visas in October 2023. But last week, Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly called the country's relations with India \"tense\" and \"very difficult\". She also said there remained a threat of more killings like Nijjar's on Canadian soil. Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside India, a religious minority that lives mostly in the state of Punjab.

The animals, part of a herd of 13 elephants, died over 29-31 October at the Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh state. A preliminary toxicology report says that the elephants may have died from eating a millet crop infected with fungus. The deaths have generated national headlines and criticism, putting the state's government on the back foot. \u201c[The toxicology report indicates] that the elephants had consumed a large quantity of decayed kodo [millet] plants and grains,\u201d said L Krishna Murthy, a senior forest official who is leading an inquiry into the deaths. Initial unconfirmed reports said that the elephants had been poisoned, possibly by farmers to stop them destroying crops. But government officials say there is no sign of deliberate poisoning. The toxicology report says cyclopiazonic acid - a fungal neurotoxin - was found in the samples taken from the dead elephants. They are thought to have eaten a large amount of kodo millets, which are usually grown in arid regions in countries including India, Pakistan and Philippines and parts of West Africa. Around 35% of kodo millet produced in India is cultivated in Madhya Pradesh. The crop grows quickly, can withstand drought conditions and can be stored for long periods. It is also easy to digest and has several health benefits. But some studies have found that eating the millet can cause \"intoxication and poisoning\" as the grains are \"frequently infested\" with a kind of fungus that produces cyclopiazonic acid. Another study , done by researchers at the Indian Institute of Millets Research, says that while many \"crops suffer from [cyclopiazonic acid] contamination, major adverse effects have been recorded only in kodo millet because of lack of scientific management\". They also suggest that some practices, such as drying the harvested crop quickly, could ensure it is safe. S Shukla Authorities destroyed kodo millet crops near the national park after the deaths There have been some reported cases of animals dying after eating the crop, though they are not that frequent. In 1933, 14 elephants died near a forest in the southern state of Tamil Nadu after consuming kodo millets, according to a report co-authored by ecologist Raman Sukumar and mycologist TS Suryanarayanan in Down to Earth magazine. Mr Sukumar, who has worked extensively on the Asian elephant and human\u2013wildlife conflict, told the BBC that elephants frequently eat millets when they enter fields looking for food. Elephants have a good sense of smell, but mycotoxins are odourless and tasteless. \u201cMy sense is that elephants tried to eat as much as possible in as little time as possible because they knew that farmers would chase them away,\u201d he said. He adds that weather also likely played a role in the fungal growth on the millets. Days before the deaths, there were heavy rains in the region, producing moist conditions conducive to fungal infection. After news reports began blaming kodo millets, authorities destroyed some crops in villages close to the national park. The toxicology report recommends surveying and destroying the residue of the fungus-infected crop and preventing the entry of domestic and wild animals into such fields. But farmers in the area said that they have been growing kodo millets for years without any adverse events. Mr Sukumar also says  it is still rare for fungal infections to produce mycotoxins in kodo millets. \u201cThe elephants were unfortunate this time,\u201d he says.

The attack comes a day after a suspected militant was killed in a daylong gunbattle in Srinagar, a rare occurrence in the city where security is tight. Police said an unidentified attacker hurled a grenade from a flyover bridge, apparently targeting a stationed paramilitary vehicle, in the main business center of Srinagar, where Sunday\u2019s flea market is visited by thousands of people. The grenade exploded in the midst of shoppers and vendors, wounding at least nine, police said. All were taken to a hospital and reinforcements of police and paramilitary soldiers launched a search for the attacker.

A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet. This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months. \u201cAs part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India,\u201d an Air India spokesperson said in an email response. Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistara's in-flight experience will remain unchanged. Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts. The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistara\u2019s books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst. Air India has essentially been \u201csuckered into taking a loss-making airline\u201d in a desperate move, he added. \"Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them.\" To be sure, both Air India and Vistara\u2019s annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent. The exercise has been riddled with problems \u2013 from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India. There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems. Getty Images Vistara's demise leaves a vacuum in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier The Tatas have announced a $400m (\u00a3308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. They\u2019ve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering. But this \u201cturnaround\u201d is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters. Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too. Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling \u201cemotional\u201d that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a \u201cgold standard for Indian aviation\u201d was ceasing operations. \u201cIt is a big loss for the industry,\u201d said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply \u201ccopy, paste and exceed\u201d the high standards set by Vistara, given that it\u2019s a much smaller airline that\u2019s being gobbled up by a much larger one. Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it. \u201cThis would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness,\u201d he adds. Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges. Shutterstock The biggest task for the merged arline would be offering customers a uniform flying experience \"Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding,\" says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. \"Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks.\" Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistara's agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air India's complex bureaucracy and systems. But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience. These are \u201ctwo airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective,\u201d said Mr Martin. Still, many believe Vistara had to go \u2013 now or some years later. A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and 'India' imprinted in its identity, wouldn\u2019t have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process. Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another. The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo. The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) \u201cwill be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce\u201d, an Air India spokesperson said. \u201cGetting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn,\u201d said Mr Awtaney. But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways. It\u2019s still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void.

The opposition Congress party and its allies have won 50 of 81 seats and were leading in another four seats in eastern Jharkhand state, according to the commission. It said vote counting was nearing completion and final results were expected later on Saturday. Modi\u2019s BJP and a Hindu nationalist ally currently rule Maharashtra, where Hindus constitute nearly 80% and Muslims 11.5% of its 126 million people.

The ruling comes in response to a number of petitions seeking action against authorities using demolition as a punitive measure against those accused or convicted of crimes. \"The executive [the government] cannot become a judge and demolish properties. The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building reminds one of lawlessness where might was right,\" the Supreme Court said on Wednesday. It also directed authorities to give sufficient time to the affected person to challenge the order or vacate the property. The ruling comes against a backdrop of a spate of instances, where authorities in states, particularly governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have used demolition as a tool to punish people accused of crimes. The reason cited is illegal construction but experts have questioned the logic and say there is no legal justification for doing this. While victims include Hindu families, such demolitions have mostly targeted  Muslims, especially after religious violence or protests, opposition leaders and activists say. The BJP denies the allegation and state chief ministers have linked demolitions with their tough stance on crime. Is bulldozer punishment trampling justice in India? During the hearing on Wednesday, the Supreme Court used strong words to criticise the practice. \"Such highhanded and arbitrary actions have no place in a constitutional democracy,\" it said, adding that officials \"who took the law in their hands\" should be held accountable. The court then issued guidelines, which make it mandatory for authorities to give a 15-day notice to an occupant before the alleged illegal property is demolished. The notice should explain the reasons for demolition. If the accused does not respond to the notice within 15 days, authorities can proceed with the action but they would be required to film the process, the court said. It also warned that violating these guidelines would amount to contempt of court. The court has strongly criticised extrajudicial demolitions throughout the hearing. Earlier this month, it observed that demolishing properties merely because a person was accused of a crime was \"simply unacceptable under rule of law\". It also observed that citizens' voices could not be silenced by the threat of demolition. While the Supreme Court's guidelines can be seen as a positive step towards preventing such demolitions from becoming the norm, observers point out that implementing the order will be key in ensuring the practice stops. Human rights group Amnesty International praised the ruling, saying that though it has come late, it is a welcome move in upholding the rights of the people. \"This is a big win in ending the deeply unjust, widespread, unlawful and punitive demolitions, mostly targeting the minority Muslim community, by the Indian authorities which have often been peddled as \u2018bulldozer justice\u2019 by ruling party political leaders and media,\" the organisation said in a statement.

Issued on: 17\/11\/2024 - 07:05 1 min Indian soldiers march at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi in January. The country announced on Sunday the first test firing of a hypersonic missile \u00a9 Ludovic MARIN \/ AFP\/File Hypersonics are the new frontier in missile technology, because they fly lower and are harder to detect than ballistic missiles, can reach targets more quickly, and can be ordered to change target in mid-flight. The United States, Russia, China and North Korea have all tested hypersonic missiles, and several others are developing the technology. \"India has achieved a major milestone by successfully conducting flight trial of long range hypersonic missile,\" Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh said in a statement. The test flight comes days after rival and neighbour China showcased its expanding aviation capabilities at an airshow, with the J-35A stealth fighter jet and attack drones displayed. That, according to China's state media, included the debut of the HQ-19 surface-to-air missile system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. India's missile blasted off from Abdul Kalam Island off the east coast on Saturday. Video images released by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), showed a slender missile blasting into the night sky followed by a surge of flames. \"This is a historic moment and this significant achievement has put our country in the group of select nations having capabilities of such critical and advanced military technologies,\" Singh added. No further details were given about the missile. New Delhi has deepened defence cooperation with Western countries in recent years, including in the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia. India is also a major buyer of Russian military hardware, including Moscow's S-400 missile defence system -- despite the threat of US sanctions over the multi-billion dollar deal. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Clashes broke out between protesters and the police during a court-monitored survey of the Shahi Jama Masjid (mosque), a federally-protected 16th Century monument. Authorities in Uttar Pradesh state - where Sambhal is located -  have registered four cases in connection with the violence and have suspended internet services and shut schools in the area for a day. The survey was ordered by a local court last week, hours after a petition claimed that the mosque had been built on the site of a destroyed temple. Videos and images of the clashes shared on social media show slippers, bricks and stones strewn around the mosque. Protesters allege that four men were shot in police firing but authorities have denied this. \"No weapons were used that could take anyone's life,\" Superintendent of Police Krishan Kumar told the Hindu newspaper. The controversy around the Shahi Jama Masjid is the latest in a series of disputes around mosques in the country , where Hindu groups have claimed that Mughal rulers destroyed temples to build them. Legal cases pertaining to these claims are currently being fought by Muslim groups in various courts. In Sambhal, tensions have been brewing since Tuesday, after a local court ordered a video-recorded survey of the Jama Masjid. The survey was ordered hours after a petition claimed that the mosque was built after Mughal ruler Babur destroyed the Hari Har temple in the 1520s. Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, which is governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), conducted an initial survey of the mosque the same day. Getty Images Police personnel stand guard following religious violence near Jama Masjid on Sunday Sections of Muslim groups in Sambhal protested against this, alleging that they were not given any prior notice about it. They have also questioned the urgency with which the court ordered the exercise. A second survey of the mosque was held on Sunday morning, which turned violent after a large group of protesters gathered near the mosque and began shouting slogans at the survey team, police say. Top police official Aunjaneya Kumar Singh told the Hindu that protesters allegedly pelted stones at the police, leaving them with no option but to use force to escort the survey team to safety. He added that tear gas shells and plastic bullets were fired to disperse the crowds. Opposition leaders have criticised the state government and accused it of orchestrating the violence for political gain - a charge it denies. \"No one is allowed to take law into their own hands,\" Uttar Pradesh's Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak told the Indian Express newspaper, adding that authorities were investigating the incident. Mahmood Madani, president of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind - a leading organisation of Islamic scholars - condemned disputes around mosques in the country, saying  they violate Indian laws.

More deaths were reported on Sri Lanka after Fengal skirted the island nation on Friday bringing intense rains that triggered landslides. Sri Lanka's disaster management agency said a total of 17 people had been killed in the country while nearly 470,000 others were taking shelter in temporary relief camps. India recorded three deaths from electrocution as a result of the storm, Tamil Nadu disaster management minister KKSSR Ramachandran told reporters late Saturday. He did not give further details on what caused the deaths, adding that damage from the cyclone was otherwise \"minimal\". India's disaster agency were also attempting to rescue a family of seven in the state feared trapped by a landslide, local media reports said Monday. Roads were flooded and schools were shut in parts of southern India with weather officials on Monday warning that there remained a risk of flash flooding. Puducherry, a former French colony on India's southern coast, received its highest 24-hour rainfall in 30 years after Fengal made landfall nearby, India's weather department said. Cyclones -- the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the northwestern Pacific -- are a regular and deadly menace in the northern Indian Ocean. But scientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful as the world heats up due to climate change driven by burning fossil fuels. Warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapour, which provides additional energy for storms, strengthening winds. A warming atmosphere also allows them to hold more water, boosting rainfall. But better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced death tolls. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Vaibhav Suryavanshi from the eastern state of Bihar was bought by Rajasthan Royals (RR) for 11m rupees ($130,500; \u00a3103,789) in the recently-concluded auctions in Saudi Arabia. The left-handed batter has represented his state in national championships, such as Ranji and Mushtaq Ali trophies, and India in the Under-19 internationals. Delhi Capitals and RR bid for him starting from 3m rupees but RR, where he had trained previously, managed to seal the deal. Indian cricket was traditionally dominated by urban centres such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru but IPL has managed to attract a wider pool of cricketers from far-off villages and small towns of India. Suryavanshi, who is in Dubai to play India Under-19 Asia Cup, made his Ranji debut at the age of 12 in January with Bihar against Mumbai. In his five Ranji matches, he has scored a highest of 41. But the highlight of his career has been his 58-ball century as an opener in an Under-19 unofficial Test against Australia a few weeks ago \u2013 which also made him the youngest to score a century in youth cricket. He has also made an unbeaten 332 in an Under-19 tournament in Bihar. RR saw raw potential in the youngster as he impressed their coaching staff during a training session. \"He's an incredible talent and, of course, you got to have the confidence so he can step up to the IPL level,\" the team's CEO Jake Lush McCrum told ESPN Cricinfo after the auction ended. He said that Suryavanshi\u2019s development would require work, but \"he is a hell of a talent and we're really excited to have him as part of the franchise\". Vaibhav Suryavanshi\/Instagram Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his Ranji debut with Bihar at the age of 12 earlier this year against heavyweight Mumbai Though Indian laws ban child labour below 14, experts say no such guidelines exist for sports, where players below 14 regularly compete in national and international events. But to play an international match organised by International Cricket Council (ICC), Suryavanshi may have to wait until he is 15 since that's the minimum age limit set by cricket\u2019s governing body. The news of Suryavanshi's auction and the size of his contract has brought a lot of joy to his family who had to sell their land to finance his cricketing dreams. His father Sanjiv Suryavanshi told PTI news agency that \"he is not just my son now but is Bihar's son\". Mr Suryavanshi, a farmer from Bihar who had migrated to Mumbai for employment, worked as a bouncer in a nightclub and at a public toilet, he told Indian Express newspaper. His biggest concern now is to ensure that his son remains grounded. \u201cI will talk to him and make sure that this IPL auction doesn\u2019t go to his head.

This is an expansion to an earlier rule that restricted the sale of beef near certain religious places like temples, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday. However, the meat can still be purchased from shops and eaten within homes or private establishments in the state. The consumption of beef is a sensitive issue in India, as cows are revered by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's population. Several states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - which is also in power in Assam - have cracked down heavily on cow slaughter in recent years. About two-thirds of India's 28 states, many of them governed by the BJP, have partially or fully banned cattle slaughter and beef consumption (though consumption of buffalo meat is legal in some of these places). In many parts of India, cow vigilante groups have been accused of enforcing the ban through violence, often leading to deadly attacks on Muslim meat sellers and cattle traders and Dalits (formerly untouchables), for whom beef is a staple and cheap form of protein. In Assam, the sale and purchase of beef was banned in 2021 in areas where Hindus, Jains and Sikhs - who don't usually eat beef - live. That law also prohibited the sale of beef near temples. Sarma said that the new ban on public consumption will be added to that existing law. The decision comes days after India's main opposition party Congress claimed that Sarma had used beef to win a by-election in Samaguri, a Muslim-majority constituency - a charge denied by the BJP. Congress legislator Rakibul Hussain had said that by \"offering beef\" to voters, the chief minister had \"betrayed\" his own party's Hindu nationalist values. The statements sparked a political slugfest, with Sarma on Wednesday saying he was willing to impose a complete ban on beef in the state, if that's what the Congress wanted.

The BJP and its allies won 233 out of 288 seats, which is above the halfway mark needed to form a government. Maharashtra, which has India's financial hub of Mumbai as its capital, is one of the most politically crucial states in the country. The BJP, however, has faced defeat in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, where main opposition Congress and its allies won 56 seats out of 81 seats. This was the first regional election in Maharashtra since the crucial parliamentary polls earlier this year, in which Modi returned for a historic third term but lost his majority, having to depend on regional allies to form a government. Maharashtra was one of the states where the BJP suffered a setback and opposition parties won two-thirds of the parliamentary seats. Modi's party currently runs the incumbent government in Maharashtra along with breakaway factions of two regional parties, the Shiv Sena and the National Congress Party (NCP). Political analysts say the BJP's retention of the state will give a much-needed boost to the party, which also won regional elections in the northern state of Haryana last month. \"This result has taken us by surprise. We knew we would win but never expected such an overwhelming result,\" BJP spokesperson Pravin Darekar told reporters in Mumbai. The outcome will also decide the fate of regional heavyweights, many of whom switched parties overnight in both states. In Maharashtra, Modi led his party's campaign from the front, announcing several welfare schemes, many of which were aimed at farmers. The state is a major agricultural belt and producer of crops like onions, soybean and cotton. The opposition also made similar promises, including waiver of farm loans and financial assistance for women and senior citizens. Critics have pointed out that the competing poll promises would mean the new government would face a serious fiscal challenge in delivering them, or risk facing voters\u2019 anger. The state has undergone significant political turmoil in recent years. The BJP-led coalition stayed in power after some lawmakers from the Shiv Sena and the NCP broke away from their parties and joined the government. Meanwhile, Jharkhand, where seven chief ministers have ruled since the state's formation in 2000, has also witnessed political upheaval in recent months after its chief minister Hemant Soren was arrested in February on corruption charges , which he denied. After his release in June , Soren soon hit the road, trying to capitalise on sympathy votes. While the BJP called Soren corrupt, he alleged that the the federal government was unfairly targeting a tribal chief minister. Tribal communities make up nearly 9% of India\u2019s population and remain one of the country\u2019s most marginalised groups. Like Maharashtra, Jharkhand also saw parties promising cash incentives, free power, jobs and health insurance.

Who is family judge Rita Kaushik, mentioned in Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash\u2019s suicide note? What are the allegations? Atul Subhash's suicide note, alleging bribery by Family Court Judge Rita Kaushik and a court clerk, raises concerns about India's judicial system. The techie claimed that harassment from his wife and in-laws led to his death, prompting police to register an abetment to suicide case against them. Livemint Updated 11 Dec 2024, 04:02 PM IST According to Atul Subhash\u2019s note, his wife was already receiving  \u20b940,000 every month as maintenance, \u2019despite working and earning her own money\u2019. The 24-page suicide note of noted AI engineer Atul Subhash has raised serious questions about the Indian judicial system. Along with the long note, Subhash had recorded an hour-long video making serious allegations against his wife and in-laws and Family Court Judge Rita Kaushik. The suicide note that Subhash left said Judge Kaushik demanded \u20b9 5 lakh in bribes for a favourable verdict. He also claimed that a court clerk asked for \u20b9 3 lakh in 2022 to schedule hearings. Subhash\u2019s refusal led to a ruling requiring him to pay \u20b9 80,000 monthly alimony. The note further alleged a \u20b9 5 lakh bribe demand from a judge in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, where his in-laws live. Subhash had also written to the President, criticising the justice system and the rise of false cases filed by estranged wives.

(AP Photo\/Mahmud Hossain Opu) Read More By JULHAS ALAM Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) \u2014 A court in southeastern Bangladesh on Tuesday rescheduled a bail hearing for a jailed prominent Hindu leader who led large rallies in the Muslim-majority country demanding better security for minority groups. Krishna Das Prabhu, who was arrested in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, Dhaka, last week, faces charges of sedition after he led huge rallies in the southeastern city of Chattogram. Hindu groups say there have been thousands of attacks against Hindus since early August, when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown. Prabhu\u2019s arrest comes as tensions spiked following reports of the desecration of the Indian flag across Bangladesh, with some burning it and others laying it on the floor for people to step on. Bangladesh\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday summoned India\u2019s envoy, Pranay Verma, a day after a group of Hindus in Agartala, the capital of the northeastern Indian state of Tripura, stormed a consulate office of Bangladesh in protest over Prabhu\u2019s arrest. Anti-India protests were held in Dhaka, where security at the Indian High Commission was increased, and elsewhere over the incident in Agartala. RELATED COVERAGE Bangladesh pacer Nahid Rana could pose problems for Zimbabwe batters in test series Bangladesh and Pakistan resume talks after 15 years, seek to mend strained ties Bangladesh arrest warrant issued for British lawmaker linked to ex-Premier Hasina Relations between India and Bangladesh deteriorated after Hasina fled to India in the wake of mass protests which left hundreds of protesters dead and thousands wounded. India has since stopped issuing visas for Bangladeshi nationals, except for medical treatment. India, which sheltered 10 million refugees and helped Bangladesh gain independence through a nine-month bloody war against Pakistan in 1971, considers Hasina as a trusted friend. Hasina\u2019s father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the independence leader of Bangladesh, then the eastern part of present day Pakistan. The detention of Prabhu sparked violent protests by his supporters. A Muslim lawyer was hacked to death near the court in Chattogram hours after the news of his jailing surfaced and his supporters clashed with security forces. The situation caused concern in Hindu-majority India and the Bangladesh interim government, led by Nobel peace laurate Muhammad Yunus . No reason was given why Prabhu, also known as Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, did not attend Tuesday\u2019s court hearing. Public Prosecutor Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan told The Associated Press by phone that Chattogram Metropolitan Session Judge Saiful Islam ordered a bail hearing be held on Jan. 2 after the prosecution petitioned for more time to study the case. He also said no defense lawyer represented Prabhu in court. Two Hindu leaders who are close to Prabhu said that they were afraid to attend the court as many of the lawyers who represented Prabhu had faced cases after last week\u2019s violence. \u201cA group of lawyers stood last time for him (Prabhu). Cases have been filed against at least 70 of them and many others willing to take part in the hearing today have been threatened,\u201d one Hindu leader in Chattogram told the AP on condition of anonymity. \u201cWhy was he (Prabhu) not brought to the court today? He is in police custody. He could have spoken for himself before the court if he was taken to the court. It\u2019s a ploy to delay his release from prison, this is not justice,\u201d the leader said. In Dhaka, a group of Islamists under the banner of Islamic Movement Bangladesh rallied in front of the country\u2019s main Baitul Mukarram Mosque in protest at Monday\u2019s incident in Agartala. Another group, under the banner of Bangladesh Citizens\u2019 Society, separately marched through the streets. Protests were also organized by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in Barishal and Khulna cities. Hasina and Zia are arch rivals. India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs said Monday that the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala was \u201cdeeply regrettable.\u201d \u201cDiplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances,\u201d a ministry statement said. It added that India was stepping up security arrangements at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and other diplomatic offices in the country. Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack in Agartala and demanded security to prevent any further acts of violence against its diplomatic missions in India. \u201cThe accounts received conclusively attest that the protesters were allowed to aggress into the premises by breaking down the main gate of Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in a pre-planned manner,\u201d the foreign ministry said. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, an umbrella organization of the country\u2019s minority groups, has denounced the arrest of Prabhu and called for his release. Prabhu is a spokesman for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote group. He was also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, widely known as the Hare Krishna movement. Hindus and members of other minority groups say they have faced attacks since the ouster of Hasina . Yunus has said the threat to Hindus has been exaggerated. Around 91% of Bangladesh\u2019s population is Muslim, with Hindus making up almost all of the rest. Bangladesh has faced political and social tensions since Hasina\u2019s fall after a mass uprising ended her 15-year rule. Her critics had accused her of becoming autocratic. The interim government has been struggling to establish order amid a background of mob justice, street protests, police administration issues and political uncertainty, with Yunus repeatedly urging for calm.","question":"Why did tensions between India and Bangladesh escalate in December 2024?","answer":"Tensions escalated after a Hindu leader in Bangladesh, Krishna Das Prabhu, was arrested on sedition charges for leading rallies demanding better security for minorities, and after a group of Hindus in India stormed a Bangladesh consulate in protest.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: Tensions between India and Bangladesh escalated in December 2024 primarily due to disputes over water sharing, particularly concerning the Teesta River. The disagreement over the equitable distribution of water resources has been a long-standing issue, but it intensified in December 2024 as both countries faced increasing pressure to meet their domestic water needs.

Sanjay Malhotra, center, is welcomed by his colleagues at an office in Mumbai India Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2024. (Reserve Bank of India via AP) By ASHOK SHARMA Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India got a new central bank governor on Wednesday as the country\u2019s economic growth slows and inflation surges. Sanjay Malhotra, a career civil servant, was appointed to a three-year term as head of the Reserve Bank of India, succeeding Shaktikanta Das, who retired as central bank governor after an extended six-year term. India\u2019s economy grew at a 5.4% annual pace in the last quarter, the weakest pace in nearly two years, while inflation rose to 6.2% in October, well above the RBI\u2019s target of 4%, due to rapid increases in vegetable prices. \u201cMalhotra takes over at a time when there is a growing clamor for the RBI to ease policy rates in order to support growth. His challenge will be to steer the central bank through a period of global and domestic uncertainty,\u201d the Indian Express newspaper said in an editorial. In a brief statement Wednesday, Malhotra, who used to be a revenue secretary, said his focus would be on stability, quick implementation of policies, and economic growth, \u201cStable policies are very important, whether it\u2019s taxation, fiscal, or monetary policy,\u201d he said. RELATED COVERAGE India blames Pakistan for a deadly attack in Kashmir and suspends a key water treaty Disputed Kashmir witnesses deadliest attack on civilians in years, sparking fears of rising tensions Vance calls for greater ties with India, hails progress on trade talks He also said remaining \u201calert and agile\u201d to meet the changes the world witnesses today, whether geopolitical tensions, the impact of climate change or political uncertainty, was a must. \u201cPeople need continuity and stability rather than a day-to-day kind of policy,\u201d he said. Malhotra, 56, had earlier worked in India\u2019s Ministry of Power and headed a public sector company that provided finance for rural electrification projects. In his previous role as India\u2019s revenue secretary, he was vocal about tax overreach. Speaking at a federal event in New Delhi last week, Malhora said that state officials had to work to improve the entire economy and not simply get more revenue via taxation. \u201cRevenue comes in only when there is some income. Therefore, we have to be very cautious so that we do not, as they say, kill the golden goose,\u201d he said. Last Friday, the central bank under Das left interest rates at 6.5%, unchanged since February last year, as rising food prices pushed inflation higher. However, it reduced the cash reserve ratio, which banks must hold to ease monetary conditions and support growth, to 4% from 4.5%. Economists expect inflationary pressures to subside in the coming months, clearing the way for a rate cut in the spring. \u201cA slowdown in urban consumer spending is reigniting worries over structural weaknesses in India\u2019s economy, as high inflation along with weak jobs and low wage growth hurt demand growth,\u201d Shumita Deveshwar of TS Lombard said in a recent report. The Reserve Bank has revised its forecast for economic growth in the April-March fiscal year to 6.6% from an earlier estimate of 7.2%. The central bank said the decline was mainly the result of a slowdown in mining and in some manufacturing industries, such as petroleum products, iron and steel and cement. It said it expected a recovery in industrial activity helped by higher government spending following the lulls of the monsoon season. \u201cSupply chain pressures eased in October-November and fell below the historical average. The services sector continues to grow at a strong pace,\u201d it said. \u2014 Associated Press writer Aniruddha Ghosal from Hanoi, Vietnam contributed to this report.","question":"Who became the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India in December 2024?","answer":"Sanjay Malhotra became the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India in December 2024.","region":"India","model_answer":"Answer: As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have information on who became the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India in December 2024.

Dommaraju, 18, is four years younger than the former record-holder, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he won the title in 1985. The Chennai prodigy has long been a superstar in the chess world, having attained the status of chess grandmaster at the age of 12. But he was seen as the outside challenger going into the final round of the FIDE World Chess Championship, held in Singapore this year. Playing on black, Dommaraju won the game after Ding, who had been in a solid position, made a fatal foolish move that gave up his last powerful piece. His blunder delivered victory to the 18-year-old, who until now had been ranked fifth in the world and second in his own country. The 14-game World Championship competition had been closely watched by chess fans around the world this past fortnight. EPA The two grandmasters at play on Thursday in the four-hour long battle Going into the final game on Thursday, Dommaraju and Ding had eight draws and two wins apiece. Players receive one point for a win and half a point each for a draw. Dommaraju claimed the title on Thursday with a final score of 7.5 to 6.5, becoming just the 18th world chess champion. The teenager comes from Chennai, a city known as India's chess capital for having produced so many national champions. But there were no elite chess players in his family \u2013 he was enrolled in chess sessions after school because his father, a surgeon, and his mother, a medical professor, needed somewhere to put him. His talent was spotted there by coaches, who encouraged his family to invest in his training. In high school in 2019, he was crowned a grandmaster at the age of 12 years and seven months \u2013 the third-youngest in history. The teenager has spoken before about how yoga and mindful thinking has helped him deal with the pressures of his chess career. EPA Gukesh Dommaraju He stayed focused on Thursday as his opponent, the defending champion Ding, appeared to buckle under the pressure. Ding has faced questions over his form all year since winning the title in 2023 becoming China's first chess world champion. For most of the year, he had taken a break from chess, having spoken about his struggles with depression and mental health. But his stylish win over Dommaraju in the opening game of the championship last month, and a victory in Round 12, had suggested momentum. Thursday's game saw several hours of tight play, with commentators suggesting it was heading to a draw. But on the 55th move, Ding committed a fatal blunder \u2013 moving his rook into a position to be taken. Immediately recognising his mistake, he slumped on the table. EPA Ding reacts to his blunder \"Ding seemed to have a risk-free chance to push for a win, but instead liquidated into a pawn-down endgame,\" Chess.com wrote in its post-game summary. \"It should have been drawn, but Ding blundered as the pressure grew.\" He resigned three moves later. Dommaraju promptly burst into tears as the room erupted with cheers. \"I probably got so emotional because I did not really expect to win that position,\" he said. At age 18, he is only the second Indian player to become world chess champion, after five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand who last won in 2012. \"It's a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India\u2026 and for me, a very personal moment of pride.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Narendra Modi was also among the first public figures showering praise. \"Historic and exemplary!\" he wrote on X. \"Congratulations to Gukesh D on his remarkable accomplishment.

Law minister, Arjun Ram Meghwal, presented the legislation which proposed allowing elections for state assemblies and the national parliament to be held simultaneously. However, it was not approved as the vote fell short of the required two-thirds majority; only 269 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposal while 198 were against it. The government says simultaneous polls will result in higher economic growth and pave the way for better governance as they will reduce the frequency of election campaigns and expenses and allow politicians to focus on their work. However, India\u2019s opposition has strongly objected to the legislation, which has been under review for over a year. Critics say the proposed system will undermine federalism and risks shifting India toward a presidential election model and could give unfair poll advantage to the governing parties at the federal level in state elections. The South Asian country of more than 1.4 billion people has 28 states and eight federal territories. Currently, staggered state and parliamentary elections are held at different times across India, with few state polls scheduled almost every year.

Meghwal said on Tuesday the government was willing to send the legislation to a parliamentary committee for wider consultation. As per the draft, the legislation if approved as a law can be put into action in \u201cthe first sitting\u201d of the lower house of the parliament after a national election \u2014 which implies it can\u2019t be implemented until 2029 when the current government\u2019s term ends. Modi\u2019s government has long advocated for the proposed system and appointed a nine-member panel last year to look into whether it was feasible. The panel recommended the plan in March, saying it would help reduce wasting public funds and increase voter turnout. The legislation must be approved by both houses of the parliament by a two-thirds majority in each before it becomes law. The new system, if approved, would also require amendments to India\u2019s Constitution and approval from all states and federal territories, experts say.
