The timing means the leadership race will be six weeks longer than it was in 2011, when Clark won. Article content Article content Article content Candidates widely considered to be contemplating a leadership bid include MLAs Mike Bernier, Todd Stone, Andrew Wilkinson, Mike de Jong and Michael Lee, as well as South Surrey-White Rock MP Dianne Watts. None have officially announced their intention to run for the leadership, but Bernier, Stone and Wilkinson said Tuesday that they\u2019ll decide in the coming weeks.

Article content Candidates will have a Dec. 29 entry deadline, and have to pay $60,000 in various fees ($50,000 of which will be non-refundable). Each candidate will have a $600,000 spending limit, up from $450,000 in the 2011 leadership race. Article content \u201cThe way they\u2019ve adjusted the limits is more than fair for anyone who is running,\u201d said Bernier, who added he\u2019s encouraged by the overall rule changes. \u201cIf you cannot run a leadership race for under $600,000, I would say there\u2019s a problem with how you are running your campaign.\u201d Article content In another change from 2011 candidates won\u2019t be able to exempt personal expenses as defined under the Election Act from their spending cap. The party said that exemption caused considerable confusion in the last race, and so was eliminated. Article content Article content \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, it\u2019s very clean,\u201d Stone said of the cap. \u201cThe cap in and of itself will allow for a level playing field that ensures each campaign can run a provincial and professional campaign without that campaign being over the top.\u201d Article content Wilkinson said he thinks the rules are \u201cquite reasonable.\u201d Article content \u201cIt seems the party has done its best to address concerns about the duration of the race, the amount of money that can be spent by candidates and most importantly about the integrity of the voting system,\u201d he said. Article content Perhaps the biggest change in the race will be how Liberal members have their identities authorized to vote. In 2011, the party mailed personal identification numbers (PINs) to members, but then faced harsh criticism from candidates after thousands of members, from mainly rural ridings, failed to get their PINs before voting opened. Article content \u201cI\u2019m glad they learned from some mistakes from last time,\u201d said Bernier. Article content There were also concerns raised in 2011 about PINs being obtained in bulk to cast votes, though the party says that allegation was never substantiated.

But he said he\u2019s pleased to see the party considering new technological solutions. Article content The Liberals have retained the weighted vote system from the 2011 race, which gives all ridings in the province 100 points to award to a candidate.

Canada continues to struggle to address this country's most urgent human rights issues: UN chief commissioner Janice Dickson \u00b7 The Canadian Press \u00b7 Posted: May 11, 2018 5:11 PM EDT | Last Updated: May 11, 2018 Marlene Jack, left, hugs Gladys Radek after testifying. Jack credits Radek with giving her the strength to speak publicly about her missing sister, Doreen Jack. (Darryl Dyck\/Canadian Press) Social Sharing Members of the United Nations Human Rights Council are urging Canada to improve its treatment of Indigenous people, in particular women and girls. Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould represented Canada in Geneva for the UN's third Universal Periodic Review of human rights. Wilson-Raybould says she heard the council's message \"loudly and clearly,\" including the need to support the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and addressing the over-representation of Aboriginal women behind bars. \"We know this is a challenge we're facing, it needs to be addressed in a fundamental way,\" she said Friday in a telephone interview from Geneva. 'Do something': Liberals faced angry backlash over Colten Boushie case 'We are all impatient': Trudeau promises First Nations leaders fundamental change The review, first established in 2008, sees the council review the human rights records of all UN members and make recommendations for improvement. Canada has taken part in two reviews, in 2009 and in 2013, although 2018 marks the first time that a federal minister has led a delegation for the presentation. Wilson-Raybould said she welcomes the feedback \u2014 and while Canada has made important gains, a great deal more work remains. Minister touts progress, not perfection The government is still considering whether it will grant the missing and murdered women inquiry a two-year extension, which commissioners requested in March. The decision will come \"in the near future\", she said. \"We will ensure Indigenous survivors and family members will be heard by the commission and that we will complete the work of the national inquiry in a way that allows those voices to be heard, commemorates lived experiences of Indigenous women and gets at the root causes of why the situation exists in the first place,\" Wilson-Raybould said. In a speech to the council, she highlighted the government's launch of the inquiry, its work in eliminating boil-water advisories in First Nations communities and its intention to implement the 94 recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. She also raised the government's plan to work with First Nations, Inuit and Metis people on a recognition and rights framework, which she said builds on the government's reconciliation efforts. The struggle continues Wilson-Raybould said she is reviewing the Criminal Code and that the government is working on pay equity legislation. She reminded the council of Trudeau's apology to those in the LGBTQ2 community harmed by past federal legislation. The review confirmed however that Canada is still \"failing millions of Canadians by denying them an equal chance to succeed and thrive,\" said Marie-Claude Landry, chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. 'We are truly sorry': Trudeau exonerates Tsilhqot'in chiefs hanged in 1864 Ottawa vows to eliminate tuberculosis in Inuit communities by 2030 \"The recommendations in this third UPR are not a surprise to anyone,\" she said. \"For the most part, they are largely the same as those presented to Canada in 2013. This latest review is evidence that, despite best efforts at all levels of government, Canada continues to struggle to address this country's most urgent human rights issues.\" Landry credited the government for putting human rights back on the agenda and cited the prioritization of women's equality, reconciliation, homelessness and LGBTQ2 rights as examples. Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that Canada is \"not perfect\" and that there's room for improvement. \"Hearing from our peers is an opportunity to take recommendations and do what we can to improve.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices \u00b7 About CBC News Corrections and clarifications \u00b7 Submit a news tip \u00b7 Report error Related Stories 'Do something': Liberals faced angry backlash over Colten Boushie case 'We are all impatient': Trudeau promises First Nations leaders fundamental change 'We are truly sorry': Trudeau exonerates Tsilhqot'in chiefs hanged in 1864 Ottawa vows to eliminate tuberculosis in Inuit communities by 2030","question":"What did the United Nations Human Rights Council urge Canada to improve regarding Indigenous people in May 2018?","answer":"The United Nations Human Rights Council urged Canada to improve its treatment of Indigenous people, particularly women and girls.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: The United Nations Human Rights Council urged Canada to improve the living conditions of Indigenous people, address issues such as violence against Indigenous women and girls, ensure access to clean drinking water, and take further steps toward reconciliation and the protection of Indigenous rights in May 2018.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer includes additional details not mentioned in the expected answer, such as addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls, ensuring access to clean drinking water, and steps toward reconciliation and protection of Indigenous rights.

With eight teams from as far south as Argentina competing in the FIBA boys under-18 Americas championships, bouncing basketballs will abound in the multi-use downtown arena. They will be dribbling up and down a new court that could cost Canada Basketball up to $200,000, passed in bounds by future Olympians and NBA players and, for the host Canadians, swishing through the net, hopefully at a pace-setting rate for the first time in the tournament\u2019s 28-year history. Canada\u2019s success internationally in a sport developed by a Canadian, albeit at a YMCA in Springsfield, Mass., is definitely on the upswing. Master of ceremonies Rod Mawhood pointed out Canada followed up three third-place finishes in a row with back-to-back silver medals. \u201cThree bronze medal finishes, then back-to-back silvers \u2013 we\u2019re due for gold next year, on this court!\u201d St. Catharines topped a short list of Brampton, Winnipeg and Vancouver after Federation International de Basketball, the sport\u2019s world governing body, awarded Canada the right to host the biennial tournament for the first time. \u201cOfficial FIBA hosting is a strategic priority for us, so we\u2019ve been working on this for about a year and a half,\u201d Canada Basketball president and chief executive officer Michele O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cI just went to FIBA, and I went in ahead of the game, and said \u2018Listen, we\u2019re prepared, we\u2019re ready to do this and we need to confirm it right away so we can build our plan.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Keefe, a Welland native who played basketball at Bishop's University after graduating from Welland Centennial Secondary School, said Meridian Centre tipped the scales in favour of St. Catharines when the time came to select a venue, as did Brock University. \u201cI think we\u2019re likely to use the dorms for residences for the athletes and the fact they are so close together.\u201d Plans to close off St. Paul Street East between the Meridian Centre bridges for a street festival on the final day of the June 11-17 tournament also impressed the selection committee of which O\u2019Keefe was not a part. \u201cI think it\u2019s such a self-contained little area.\u201d Niagara\u2019s \u201cbasketball history\u201d also was a factor in landing a tournament that has been played in the U.S. on three occasions and in Argentina twice. \u201cThe Niagara Sport Commission and the City of St. Catharines did a great job of building and leveraging the history of basketball down here in Niagara,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt just seemed like a perfect fit.\u201d A top-three finish at the under-18s would qualify Canada to compete in the 2019 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, but Canada Basketball\u2019s goals aren\u2019t all that so short term nor limited to the court. O\u2019Keefe and one-time Olympian Mike Meeks, manager of men\u2019s youth player development, both see hoops at the grassroots level in Niagara benefiting from a legacy of improved coaching, officiating and calibre of play. Meeks said the opportunity to see some of the best of up-and-coming basketball players in the world can\u2019t help but leave a lasting impression on the next generation. \u201cAn event like this puts it in front of kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be kids sitting there watching who may be playing more soccer at one point or more baseball. They are going to come to this event and say \u2018Hey, why not basketball.\u2019\u201d \u201cI started really focusing on basketball at about eighth grade, and the rest is history,\u201d said Meeks, who played for the Canadian men\u2019s team that lost to France in the championship quarter-finals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. \u201cEvents like this, on your home soil, just shows the level which the community is willing to go to for the sport.\u201d Home-court advantage will be a \u201chuge\u201d factor in Canada\u2019s favour when action gets underway at Meridian Centre. Meeks, speaking from experience, said there can be a \u201cnight-and-day difference\u201d between their facilities at home and some of the gyms they practise in when travelling abroad for international tournaments. Culture shock can also throw players off their games, giving visiting teams more to deal with than the X\u2019s and O\u2019s of executing plays on the court. \u201cWe have to know what the weather is going to be like, the food \u2014 sometimes they don\u2019t want to eat the food that\u2019s provided \u2014 and not having the comfort of their peers and family and friends to lean on when they meet with some adversity,\u201d Meeks said. Pelham Panthers Basketball Association president Brian Bleich echoed Meeks\u2019 comments about the importance of home-court advantage at international tournaments. Bleich found playing for Canada at the world junior championships in 1987 in Rome difficult especially after the team prepared for worlds by playing in Bangkok, Thailand. \u201cWe\u2019re playing in hot, humid conditions at a different elevation, and not used to it, and you\u2019ve got to train for that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re 12 guys on a bench and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s your fans. And there\u2019s going to 10, 12,000 people in the seats.\u201d Unlike globetrotting players nowadays, Bleich\u2019s heyday in international hoops was long before Skype. \u201cI was 17 at the time,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was back in the \u201880s, there was nothing, there was no phone. I didn\u2019t have contact with my family for almost three months.\u201d St. Catharines city council showed its support for the bid in a unanimous vote last December to waive $64,000 in rental fees and related costs for use of the city-owned downtown arena. Sendzik thanked previous councillors who had the foresight to build \u201cthis kind of facility in our community so we can host the Scotties, we can host the word under-18 women\u2019s championships.\u201d \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have this facility, we wouldn\u2019t have this event here today,\u201d he said. Sendzik praised the Niagara Sport Commission and the company managing day-to-day operations at Meridian Centre for putting on a \u201cgreat show\u201d when Canada Basketball toured the site. \u201cThese are the individuals that are really doing the heavy lifting to ensure that when Basketball Canada comes in here, they just don\u2019t see the Meridian Centre, they see all that we have to offer, all the way down St. Paul Street,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see the volunteers and the support that we have.\u201d The mayor also acknowledged the many club teams in the region in his remarks. bfranke@postmedia.com \u201c","question":"Where was the 2018 FIBA Under-18 Americas Championship held?","answer":"The 2018 FIBA Under-18 Americas Championship was held in St. Catharines, Ontario.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer 'St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada' matches the expected answer 'St. Catharines, Ontario' in terms of the location.

The city\u2019s emergency services said there was a sharp increase in calls since a heat wave began last week. Credit... Eva Hambach\/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images By Dan Bilefsky July 5, 2018 MONTREAL \u2014 Thirty-three people have died in Quebec from one of the worst heat waves to hit eastern and central Canada in decades, the authorities said on Thursday, underscoring the vulnerability of elderly, ill and poor people during the hot summer months. Dr. David Kaiser, the senior physician at Montreal\u2019s public health agency, said that most of those who had died from the heat in Montreal were 65 or older, had histories of health problems or mental illness and had been living without air-conditioning. He said that disadvantaged people who had chronic illnesses or were living alone were particularly vulnerable. \u201cWhile we are an advanced industrialized economy, these deaths reflect that there are serious social inequalities,\u201d he said, adding that many wealthy countries the world over had been hit by heat waves associated with climate change. Public health authorities in Quebec have made a concerted effort to improve the reporting of heat-related deaths. They have set up a special liaison program with hospitals and emergency rooms to monitor heat-related illnesses and mortality, Dr. Kaiser said, which may explain why the number of deaths seems high compared to elsewhere in the nation. On Thursday, as temperatures in Montreal rose to 93 degrees \u2014 23 degrees above the average daily temperature for July \u2014 local residents sought refuge in park fountains or remained inside in air-conditioned homes or offices. Some elderly residents canceled appointments and stayed at home, eager to avoid the stifling heat outside. Home appliance stores have been mobbed in recent days, with residents trying to buy air-conditioners, only to discover that all the units are sold out. At a sprawling Home Depot store in central Montreal, about 20 shoppers were seen fighting this week over the last remaining air- conditioner. \u201cIt\u2019s survival of the fittest,\u201d said Victor Perchet, who managed to get it.

It will take effect on October 17.","text":"Politics Canada just legalized marijuana. That has big implications for US drug policy. It\u2019s the second country in the world to legalize pot, following Uruguay. by German Lopez Updated Jun 21, 2018, 2:44 PM UTC Facebook Link Marijuana smoke lingers in front of Parliament Hill during a 4\/20 rally in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Lars Hagberg\/AFP\/Getty Images Canada has become the first wealthy nation in the world to fully legalize marijuana . The Senate approved Bill C-45 , also known as the Cannabis Act, on Tuesday. The measure was already approved by the House of Commons, so the Senate\u2019s approval means it\u2019s now set to become law. The measure legalizes marijuana possession, home growing, and sales for adults. The federal government will oversee remaining criminal sanctions (for, say, selling to minors) and the licensing of producers, while provincial governments will manage sales, distribution, and related regulations \u2014 as such, provinces will be able to impose tougher rules, such as raising the minimum age. The statute largely follows recommendations made by a federal task force on marijuana legalization. The law will go into effect on October 17, with at least some sales beginning on that date, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said . None of this may seem too shocking in the US, where already nine states have legalized marijuana for recreational use and 29 states have allowed it for medicinal purposes. What sets Canada apart, though, is it\u2019s doing this as a country. Previously, the South American nation of Uruguay was the only one that legally allowed marijuana for recreational purposes. Canada, like the US, is part of international drug treaties that explicitly ban legalizing marijuana. Although activists have been pushing to change these treaties for years, they have failed so far \u2014 and that means Canada will be, in effect, in violation of international law in moving to legalize. (The US argues it\u2019s still in accordance with the treaties because federal law still technically prohibits cannabis, even though some states have legalized it.) For Canada\u2019s ruling party, this fulfills a major campaign promise. When Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party was elected in 2015, one of the main promises he ran on was to legalize marijuana. \u201cWe will legalize, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana,\u201d the Liberal Party declared on its campaign website. \u201cCanada\u2019s current system of marijuana prohibition does not work. It does not prevent young people from using marijuana and too many Canadians end up with criminal records for possessing small amounts of the drug.\u201d But the process languished as Trudeau and his allies waited for a federal task force\u2019s recommendations and as the Senate debated several provisions in the bill. In moving forward, the Canadian government is now walking a fine line: It\u2019s hoping to legalize marijuana to clamp down on the black market for cannabis and provide a safe outlet for adults, but it\u2019s risking making pot more accessible to kids and people with drug use disorders. It is taking a bold step against outdated international drug laws, but it could upset countries like Russia, China, and even the US that have historically adopted a stricter view of the treaties. And while Canadian lawmakers may feel marijuana legalization is right for their country, there\u2019s a risk that legal Canadian pot will spill over to the US \u2014 perhaps causing tensions with Canada\u2019s neighbor and one of its closest allies. Whether Canada is successful in its legalization attempts will depend on how it strikes a balance between these concerns. And depending on how it pulls this off, it may provide a model to other countries interested in legalization \u2014 including the US. The risks and benefits of legalization For Canada, marijuana legalization has been a balancing act from the start. On one hand, marijuana prohibition has a lot of costs. In Canada, tens of thousands of people are arrested for marijuana offenses each year, ripping communities and families apart as people are thrown in jail or prison and gain criminal records. Enforcement of these laws also costs money, while legalizing and taxing marijuana could bring in extra revenue \u2014 although typically not that much, based on Colorado\u2019s experience , where marijuana taxes make up less than 1 percent of the general budget. The black market for marijuana fuels violence around the world \u2014 not only can it lead to conflicts and violence within Canada, but the money from illegally produced and sold pot often goes back to drug cartels that then use that money to carry out brutal violence, including murders , beheadings , kidnappings , and torture . Legalization shifts marijuana out of the illicit, potentially violent market toward a legal one that can produce legitimate jobs. Legalization carries risks too. It could lead to more use and misuse by making pot cheaper and more available. Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert at New York University\u2019s Marron Institute, estimates that in the long term a legal marijuana joint will cost no more to make than, say, a tea bag \u2014 since both products come from plants that are fairly easy to grow. It would also be available to anyone (of legal age) in retail outlets after legalization \u2014 meaning it would no longer require a shady or secretive meeting with a drug dealer. Those are benefits for people who use marijuana without problems, to be sure, but easier access could also pose a risk for people who can\u2019t control their cannabis consumption. Although marijuana isn\u2019t very dangerous compared to some drugs, it does carry some risks: dependence and overuse , accidents, nondeadly overdoses that lead to mental anguish and anxiety, and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes . Still, it\u2019s never been definitively linked to any serious ailments \u2014 not deadly overdoses, lung disease , or schizophrenia . And it\u2019s much less likely \u2014 around one-tenth so, based on data for fatal car crashes \u2014 to cause deadly accidents compared to alcohol, which is legal. Among the risks, drug policy experts emphasize the risk of overuse and addiction. As Jon Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University, has told me, \u201cAt some level, we know that spending more than half of your waking hours intoxicated for years and years on end is not increasing the likelihood that you\u2019ll win a Pulitzer Prize or discover the cure for cancer.\u201d A balancing act To this end, Canada is striking a balance unlike that of the US\u2019s legalization experiments so far. So far in the US, the eight states that have legalized pot sales have done so with a model similar to alcohol. (Vermont has only legalized possession, not retail sales.) Basically, they\u2019re setting up their systems to allow a for-profit pot industry to flourish, similar to the alcohol industry. Drug policy experts, however, often point to the alcohol industry as a warning , not something to be admired and followed for other drugs. For decades, big alcohol has successfully lobbied lawmakers to block tax increases and regulations on alcohol, all while marketing its product as fun and sexy in television programs, such as the Super Bowl, that are viewed by millions of Americans, including children. Meanwhile, excessive drinking is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US. If marijuana companies are able to act like the tobacco and alcohol industries have in the past, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll convince more Americans to try or even regularly use marijuana, and some of the heaviest users may use more of the drug. And as these companies increase their profits, they\u2019ll be able to influence lawmakers in a way that could stifle regulations or other policies that curtail cannabis misuse. All of that will likely prove bad for public health (although likely not as bad as alcohol, since alcohol is simply more dangerous ). There are policies that can curtail this, some of which Canada\u2019s plan will allow. For example, Canada\u2019s measure restricts marketing and advertising. In the US, this is generally more difficult because the First Amendment protects commercial free speech. (Tobacco marketing is largely prohibited due to a massive legal settlement .) But in Canada, the restrictions could stop marijuana companies from marketing their product in a way that targets, say, children or people who already heavily use cannabis. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Caulkins previously told me . For public health purposes, \u201cevery serious researcher around the world thinks it\u2019s a very good idea to restrict advertising of tobacco, alcohol, any dependence-inducing substance.\u201d Canada\u2019s bill also lets provinces entirely handle the distribution and sales of marijuana \u2014 up to letting provincial governments directly manage and staff all pot stores by themselves. While state-run liquor stores aren\u2019t unheard of in the US when it comes to alcohol, it\u2019s widely seen as risky in America with marijuana: Since cannabis is illegal at the federal level, asking state employees to run marijuana shops would effectively ask them to violate federal law. But since Canada is legalizing marijuana nationwide in one go, it can do this \u2014 and several provinces are expected to take up this option. The promise of government-run marijuana shops is that they could be better for public health. In short, government agencies that run shops are generally going to be more mindful of public health and safety, while private companies are only going to be interested in maximizing sales, even if that means making prices very low or selling to minors and people with drug use disorders. Previous research found that states that maintained a government-operated monopoly for alcohol kept prices higher, reduced youth access, and reduced overall levels of use \u2014 all benefits to public health. Again, this is about balancing the risks and benefits of legalization: Maybe legalization is the better approach on net compared to prohibition, but that doesn\u2019t mean that for-profit, private companies have to be given free rein over the market. This isn\u2019t important just to Canada. If Canada shows that these policies \u2014 and the many other quirks that will make it different to the US \u2014 are the right approach to legalization, it could provide a legalization model to the rest of the world that\u2019s very different from what America has done so far. Canada\u2019s legalization bill could violate international treaties From the 1960s through the \u201980s, much of the world, including the US and Canada, signed on to three major international drug policy treaties: the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 , the Convention on Psychotropic Drugs of 1971 , and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 . Combined, the treaties require participants to limit and even prohibit the possession, use, trade, and distribution of drugs outside of medical and scientific purposes, and work together to stop international drug trafficking. There is some debate about whether these treaties stop countries from decriminalizing marijuana \u2014 when criminal penalties are repealed but civil ones remain in place \u2014 and legalizing medical marijuana. But one thing the treaties are absolutely clear on is that illicit drugs aren\u2019t to be allowed for recreational use and certainly not for recreational sales. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Canada has now moved to allow. Canada\u2019s decision to legalize pot is the most high-profile rebuke of the international treaties since they were signed \u2014 since Canada is a relatively large developed country and is fairly active in the international arena. In theory, Canada could face diplomatic backlash by legalizing pot. But it\u2019s unclear who would lead such an effort, given that the US, the de facto enforcer of the treaties over the past few decades, is currently allowing states to legalize pot without federal interference. There\u2019s one way Canada could get around the treaty problem. In the early 2010s, Bolivia moved to allow coca leaf chewing, which was banned from the treaties. To get around this, the country effectively withdrew from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and then rejoined with a \u201creservation\u201d allowing the use of coca leaves within its own borders. The move could have been blocked by one-third of the parties to the treaty \u2014 which would amount to more than 60 nations \u2014 but only 15 joined in opposition. Canada could use a similar process \u2014 of withdrawing and then rejoining with a reservation for legal pot \u2014 to meet its treaty obligations. It could also follow Uruguay, which has essentially refused to acknowledge that legalization violates the treaties. Despite warnings from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, no one has taken significant action against Uruguay for its decision. As for the US, it claims to respect the drug treaties, despite some states\u2019 move to legalize marijuana, with a clever argument : It\u2019s true that multiple states have legalized pot, but the federal government still considers marijuana illegal, so the nation is still technically in line, even if a few states are not. Canada could not try this route if it legalizes nationwide. If Canada pulls this off, it could provide a model for other countries to relax their drug laws \u2014 and particularly their marijuana laws \u2014 without violating international treaty obligations or, at the very least, without getting punished for disobeying the treaties. Such a move would come at a very crucial time in international drug policy: After the UN\u2019s special session on drugs in 2016 , drug policy reformers are putting more pressure to reform the global drug control regime. Canadian legalization gives these reformers an opening by showing that if the treaties aren\u2019t changed, they may soon be rendered meaningless as countries move ahead with their own reforms anyway \u2014 even if it puts them in violation of international drug law. And that could open up the rest of the world to legalizing pot. It\u2019s not just, then, that Canada is changing its own drug laws. Canada\u2019s steps \u2014 from its rebuke of international drug treaties to how it will regulate cannabis \u2014 could affect the future of marijuana policy worldwide.

This move removes 98% tariffs on goods between Canada and the E.U.","text":"Ceta: EU and Canada sign long-delayed free trade deal Published 30 October 2016 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the trade deal was \"good news for Canada's middle class\" The European Union and Canada have signed a long-delayed landmark trade deal, following weeks of uncertainty due to opposition in Belgium. The deal was signed in Brussels by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and top EU officials. The signing ceremony initially planned for Thursday had been cancelled after Belgium's Wallonia region vetoed the agreement. All 28 EU states approved the deal on Friday when consensus was reached. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, known as Ceta, required all EU member states to endorse it. The deal removes 99% of tariffs - and officials hope it will generate an increase in trade worth $12bn (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac10.9bn; \u00c2\u00a39.8bn) a year. What is Ceta? Is Ceta a good model for Brexit? The deal was due to be signed at 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT), but was postponed after Mr Trudeau's plane had to turn back to Ottawa airport after experiencing \"mechanical issues\" shortly after take-off. After the agreement was finally signed several hours later, Mr Trudeau said: \"Canadians and Europeans share the understanding that in order for real and meaningful economic growth, we need to create more good, well-paying jobs for our citizens. \"Progressive trade agreements like the one signed today, will do just that.\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker referred to \"a new chapter\" in relations between the EU and Canada, which would open new opportunities \"more than half-a-billion people on both sides of the Atlantic\". Love in the air... and lessons for Brexit? By Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe correspondent Justin Trudeau had a happy smile on his face today. Relief? Delight? A bit of both. A handshake for European Council President Donald Tusk, representing the EU's 28 member states, came with a hug, and from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a kiss on both cheeks. Love was in the air between the EU and Canada after a rocky few days. Canada has a new economic opening to 500 million Europeans. The EU believes this proves it can do big trade pacts which are good for its citizens. Are there lessons for Brexit? Jean-Claude Juncker said he didn't believe so. But there are some observations to be made. Ceta was approached with goodwill on all sides. Still it took seven years. Ceta is about removing trade barriers. Brexit may discuss which ones to put up. If the UK limits the movement of people, will the EU seek to do the same? And what other barriers may come, too? And will political parties and leaders around Europe now follow the Walloons and bargain hard over Brexit, too? Seven years of negotiations were left hanging in the balance after Belgium's French-speaking region of Wallonia demanded stronger safeguards on labour, environmental and consumer standards. It also wanted more protection for Walloon farmers, who would face new competition from Canadian imports. Image source, AFP Image caption, Protests have dogged the trade talks throughout Image source, EPA Image caption, Belgium finally signed the deal on Saturday On Thursday, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said that after marathon talks they had agreed on an addendum to the deal which addressed regional concerns. Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, which currently holds the EU presidency, said the final approval of the deal was \"a milestone in the EU's trade policy\". Complications over the Ceta agreement had raised fresh concerns about future UK negotiations with the EU on a Brexit trade deal. Mr Tusk had warned that the delays and wrangling were further damaging EU credibility following Britain's vote to leave the bloc.

Elizabeth Wettlaufer, 49, is accused of killing five women and three men in the Ontario towns of Woodstock and London between 2007 and 2014. The dead ranged in age from 75 to 96. \"The victims were administered a drug,\" Woodstock Police Chief William Renton told a televised news conference, declining to give further details. Wettlaufer appeared in court on Tuesday and was remanded in custody. The criminal case is the largest in Ontario since 2006, when five men were charged with murdering eight biker gang members. They were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Renton said officers began probing the deaths in September after receiving a tip. \"We are confident at this time that all of the victims have been identified,\" he said. The Canadian Association of Retired Persons said it was shocked by the tragic nature of the alleged crime.

However, there's residual gas we have to look at,\" he said. \"Nobody outside the perimeter prior to the explosion is allowed back into the perimeter for the purposes of securing the area.\" Beckett said the limited access to the outer perimeter will be reassessed on Wednesday morning. He said\u00a0Toronto's Heavy Urban Search and Rescue team arrived Tuesday night\u00a0to help officials go through homes still considered unstable.\u00a0The team is\u00a0trained to locate, remove and provide medical attention for\u00a0people who might be trapped in collapsed buildings. It is currently doing an assessment of the site. Beckett said fire officials have yet to begin their investigation into the cause, with the focus on stabilizing the site. \"We definitely have collapsed homes and unstable homes,\" Beckett said. \"There is definitely extensive damage to the area.\" Tim Beckett, chief of Mississauga Fire and Emergency Services, said work is continuing to stabilize the scene, but 'we can't tell you any cause' of the blast. (CBC) \u200bThe air quality in the area has been determined to be okay, he said. \"We anticipate this will be a prolonged exercise. From here on in, it's just going to be a slow process that our crews will continue to work on.\" Power outages for dozens of homes A reception area has been set up at\u00a0Burnhamthorpe\u00a0Community Centre, which was scheduled to stay open Tuesday night. Residents are urged to register with the centre if they need any supportive services after the explosion. \"We will be there to welcome you and make sure that you have at least a dry place to stay,\"\u00a0Beckett\u00a0said. Const. Paolo Carretta of the Peel Regional Police said it's not known when residents currently out of their homes will be allowed to return. \"As soon as we have a time, we'll be sure to let everybody know. In the meantime, we're asking any affected residents to please attend the community centre,\" he said. Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said gas and power have been cut off to 58 homes in the area, and she urged residents to stay with family and friends if possible. She said six homes\u00a0received moderate to heavy damage. \"It may last more than one night,\" she said. Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said 58 homes have had gas and power cut off in the area near the explosion. (CBC) Belma Colakovic, who lives in a townhouse complex known as Hickory Village, about 10 houses away from where the explosion occurred, said she was at a nearby Tim Hortons when she felt the blast. \"All of a sudden we feel the ground shake and the windows move and the doors open and close. At first we thought it was a really bad earthquake, and then we looked up outside, and we saw that there was a huge cloud of smoke everywhere,\" Colakovic said. On her walk home, the roads were blocked by police. \"There was just wood on the street \u2026 scattered all over the place,\" she said.

The injured were all treated\u00a0on the Toronto Paramedic Bus. Police are asking people to avoid the area near Dixie Road and\u00a0Rathburn\u00a0Road East. The evacuated area is from Eastgate Parkway to the North, Rathburn Road East to the South, Golden Orchard Drive to the West and Dixie Road to the East. A photo taken by a Mississauga resident from his apartment building shows some of the damage. (@m_fullerton\/Twitter) Area residents have been sharing photos and video of the explosion scene on social media. Garrett Brazzier was driving east on Rathburn Road East crossing over Hickory Drive when he stopped at the light at Dixie and Rathburn. \"I heard a loud bang, like a super-loud bang. It sounded like a bomb went off, almost. I looked in my rearview mirror and there was debris flying everywhere. There was a huge dust cloud,\" he said.

Article content Article content Mulcair, who less than a year ago appeared to be well-positioned to become Canada\u2019s first NDP prime minister, received just 48 per cent support from delegates at the NDP convention in Edmonton. Article content Article content However, Mulcair \u2014 who addressed the convention shortly after the results were announced \u2014 said he would stay on as leader until a successor is chosen.

Article content \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s important is that we leave here united,\u201d a calm, resigned-looking Mulcair told delegates. \u201cThe person who replaces me must have the absolute and complete support of 100 per cent of the members of the NDP.\u201d Article content Article content Article content He thanked his wife and the delegates, and urged the party to come together around his successor, whomever that turns out to be. Article content \u201cWe will always be the party that dreams no small dreams,\u201d Mulcair said. \u201cWe will always be the party that thinks about the little guy.\u201d Article content Article content A bare-minimum 50 per cent plus one vote would have been necessary for Mulcair to stay on, let alone have anywhere near enough support for a confident mandate \u2014 a threshold some had pegged at closer to 70 per cent.

Article content The result left the cavernous convention floor in a stunned silence. Mulcair was backstage as the result was announced. Article content The decision \u2014 a far worse result for Mulcair than even his fiercest detractors might have expected \u2014 was the culmination of a festering dispute over the NDP\u2019s future direction in the wake of last year\u2019s devastating election loss. Article content Less than six months ago, the party was badly outflanked by the Liberals in last October\u2019s federal election and reduced to third-place status in the House of Commons. Article content The party began the campaign as the official Opposition and appeared poised to make a run at forming Canada\u2019s first NDP government, only to collapse over the course of a historically long campaign and end up losing more than half its seats.

Article content Prior to the vote, Mulcair made one last pitch to the New Democrat faithful to allow him to stay on as leader, urging rank-and-file members to stand with him. Article content He said he has accepted the blame for the mistakes of last year\u2019s disappointing election campaign, but insisted he is re-energized, reinspired and re-engaged after six months of meeting grassroots supporters. Article content \u201cWe made mistakes that cost us a victory in October, and for that I take responsibility,\u201d Mulcair said. \u201cI share your deep disappointment in the election results. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve held unvarnished debrief sessions across the country \u2014 to understand what went wrong, what mistakes were made, and how we can apply those lessons going forward.\u201d Article content It was a largely familiar speech, one that included echoes of many of Mulcair\u2019s public comments in the months since the election, and steered largely clear of some of the sore spots that have endangered his status as leader. Article content In particular, Mulcair made no mention of the so-called \u201cLeap Manifesto,\u201d a proposed policy pivot from the left-most factions of the party who want to see the NDP embrace some more drastic measures to combat climate change and aboriginal issues, among others. Article content Article content Prior to Mulcair\u2019s speech, delegates voted to adopt a motion to debate the manifesto\u2019s ideas and proposals, which include: \u2022 Moving away from fossil fuels so that Canada gets 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable resources within 20 years and is entirely weaned off fossil fuels by 2050; \u2022 No new infrastructure projects aimed at increasing extraction of non-renewable resources, including pipelines; \u2022 An end to all trade deals \u201cthat interfere with our attempts to rebuild local economies, regulate corporations and stop damaging extractive projects\u201d; \u2022 Expand low-carbon sectors of the economy, such as caregiving, teaching, social work, the arts and public-interest media; \u2022 Ending fossil fuel subsidies, imposing financial transaction taxes, increasing resource royalties, hiking taxes on corporations and the wealthy, introducing a progressive carbon tax, and cutting military spending. Article content Billing himself as a hard-nosed political fighter, Mulcair said only New Democrats will continue to battle against income inequality, because the Liberals and the Conservatives are too loyal to their corporate backers and the status quo. Article content Article content Last year alone, Canada\u2019s big banks made a record $35 billion in profits, and handed out $12 billion in bonuses to their executives, all while cutting thousands of Canadian jobs, he said. Article content \u201cWe don\u2019t accept that,\u201d Mulcair said. \u201cLiberals and Conservatives will tell you that this is just the way things are. They will say this is the inevitable outcome of market forces, that nothing can be done.\u201d \u201cWell, allow me to be blunt: This is complete and utter BS.\u201d Article content The rift within the NDP over Mulcair\u2019s leadership was evident during his speech, as some supporters jumped to their feet to applaud and express their support, while others on the convention floor stayed stone-faced and seated. Article content By the end, however, he at least earned a standing ovation for his efforts. Article content \u201cIf you keep standing with me, then together, we will never stop fighting,\u201d Mulcair said as his speech built to a crescendo, the applause building around him. Article content \u201cSo \u2014 stand with me\u2026. Stand if you want to fight to grow our party and strengthen our movement\u2026. Stand if you want to unite progressives in Quebec with those in the rest of the country\u2026. Stand if you want to fight to build a country that generations of New Democrats, young and old, have dreamed of and organized for.\u201d Article content \u201cA Canada that is loving, hopeful and optimistic. Where everyone belongs, everyone matters, and no one is left behind.\u201d Article content When it was over, Mulcair was swarmed by supporters, and appeared close to tears as he moved into the crowd. Article content Over the 24 hours leading up to the speech, the efforts intensified among those who wanted to see Mulcair ousted for failing to effectively communicate the NDP\u2019s vision to voters. The embattled leader also faced muted but undeniable criticism from within his own caucus. Article content Mulcair said the federal Liberal budget proves that when it comes to child care and health care, the principle of universality \u2014 the cherished legacy of party founder Tommy Douglas \u2014 is in peril. Article content \u201cTommy\u2019s vision is under threat like never before,\u201d he said. Creeping privatization and a Liberal budget that doubles down on Stephen Harper\u2019s health care cuts threaten the quality of health services in Canada. Let there be no doubt: Together, we will fight like hell to protect universal health care, because there is nothing more universal to New Democrats.\u201c Article content Article content And he renewed a push for electoral reform, saying that the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau has already started to back away from its promise to end the current first-past-the-post system, which he says effectively discounted some nine million votes in October. Article content \u201cOf course, Conservatives believe the unfair status quo is just fine. Liberals, on the other hand, promised change, but they are already starting to backtrack on that as well,\u201d he said. Article content \u201cMy friends, the next few months will be critical in the fight for proportional representation. We have to stay strong and united to lead this fight together.\u201d Article content An internal political post-mortem of the election results blamed the disaster on a decision to offer cautious change instead of the sharp change promised by the Liberals and a failure to prepare for campaign challenges.

Privacy Notice Business Target Canada workers feel left in the dark as stores close Share on Facebook Share on X Share by Email Sophia Harris             -             CBC News Posted: January 23, 2015 Last Updated: January 23, 2015 Employees of Target's 133 Canadian stores are being offered 16 weeks pay during the wind-down. But some are unhappy with the way they are being treated during their final days with the company. (Geoff Robins\/Reuters) When Target invaded Canada and started hiring thousands of new staff, workers flocked to the beloved American retail giant. They were eager to be part of something fresh. But some believe their journey is now closing on\u00a0a very sour note, saying\u00a0Target has missed the mark on employee compensation and communication. When Sarah first started working at an Ontario Target store almost two years ago, she was brimming with excitement. \"We thought, this is it, we\u2019re the bee's\u00a0knees, we\u2019re setting up a store that\u2019s going to\u00a0take over.\" Sarah is not her real name. She wants that withheld, she says, because \"we\u2019ve been told as a team that we\u2019re not to speak to the press or we could be terminated early.\"\u00a0Target spokesman\u00a0Eric Hausman said in an emailed statement that it\u2019s standard practice that media only deal with the company\u2019s public relations department. ADVERTISEMENT Breaking news: you\u2019re out of work Sarah believes her bright beginning at Target has deteriorated into the darkest of endings. The team floor member first learned Target Canada was doomed,\u00a0not from her employer,\u00a0but from the television news in the staff lunch room. \"Within half an hour of it being on the news, we had [customers] coming in going, 'When\u2019s it all going liquidation, when\u2019s the sales start?\u2019 Like, whoa, we just found out half an hour ago we\u2019re losing our jobs. Let us wrap our head around that.\" Sarah says it wasn\u2019t until at least an hour after learning the news that management started informing employees that Target was closing its 133 Canadian stores and letting go\u00a0its approximately 17,600 workers. Target closes all 133 stores in Canada, gets creditor protection Target store closures: What will happen to 17,600 employees Target\u2019s Hausman told CBC News that it broke the news to workers at about the same time it released details to the media. Uncertain future \"That day was probably a day I\u2019ll never forget,\" says Sarah. \"You couldn\u2019t go anywhere without seeing a team member absolutely in tears or in shambles, [saying] what am I going to do now?\" You couldn\u2019t go anywhere without seeing a team member absolutely in tears. \u2014\u00a0Anonymous Target employee \"We live in a city where unemployment is skyrocketing. There\u2019s no jobs here. So everybody is panicking,\" adds the single mother. ADVERTISEMENT Sarah\u2019s colleague, Rachel -- again not her real name -- is also the sole breadwinner in her family. When she started working at Target almost two\u00a0years ago, she was close to declaring bankruptcy. \"What's going to happen?\" she asks. \"Am I going to end up not being able to pay my rent and not being being able to feed my kid?\" It\u2019s not severance Target is providing all eligible team members at least 16 weeks of pay starting on January 25th. But both Rachel and Sarah feel the deal is unfair. That\u2019s because some workers may have to work the entire time to get that money and others won\u2019t while the stores wind down operations. The law firm, Koskie Minsky LLP, is representing Target employees in the insolvency. In a webinar (online seminar), it informs workers, \"You will likely be required to report to work for a number of weeks (and in some cases all) of your notice period.\" But it also notes that eligible employees who work fewer than their normal hours during the final weeks will still get paid. \"That\u2019s the sad part, we\u2019re begging to be laid off\u00a0first,\" says Sarah. \"If we work the full 16 weeks, it\u2019s\u00a0'Thank you very much for your hard work, goodbye.\u2019 We get nothing. So it\u2019s not severance I\u2019m getting. It\u2019s a paycheque.\" Target's Hausman\u00a0told CBC News that there is no severance because\u00a0Target\u00a0Canada is\u00a0insolvent. The company has applied for creditor protection and\u00a0created an employee trust, providing workers with a\u00a0guaranteed minimum 16 weeks pay. ADVERTISEMENT Hausman\u00a0said\u00a0it\u2019s a good deal, stating:\u00a0\"I\u2019d encourage you to look at how others are talking about this Trust. I have seen others quoted [in the media] as calling this set-up unprecedented for a [Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act] proceeding.\" He gave no details why it should be considered \"unprecedented.\" Labour expert\u00a0Maurice Mazerolle believes the trust deal is \"as good as it gets\" for Target workers given the complex situation. But he says he understands why it would breed employee resentment because some will have to work until the bitter end and others won\u2019t. \"Do you really want to create this,\u00a0kind of indirectly,\u00a0two-tiered system?\" he asks. The Ryerson University professor suggests Target should consider extra compensation for those who remain on the job: \"Give them a bonus or something at the end of this in order to thank them for soldiering on when others weren\u2019t.\" No clear message Both Sarah and Rachel also complain that\u00a0since the bad news broke on Jan.\u00a015, Target hasn\u2019t been upfront about what its ill-fated employees can expect during the final weeks on the job. \"We\u2019re all just so scared,\" says Rachel. \"We need to know what is happening, when are the liquidators coming, what is going to be the process with that, are we losing half the staff? And if so, is it going to be by volunteer? Is it random picking?\" We\u2019re all just so scared \u2014\u00a0Anonymous Target employee \"It\u2019s very tight-lipped,\" adds Sarah. \"I don\u2019t feel they\u2019re providing me with information. If anything, It\u2019s kind of like team members have to eavesdrop on the management\u2019s conversations.\" ADVERTISEMENT In response, Target\u2019s Hausman said, \"In terms of communications, leaders have messages for their teams and all team members have opportunities to ask any questions they may have during this difficult period.\" Life after Target? Both Sarah and Rachel must now figure out their futures. Rachel wants out of the retail business. Sarah says she and many of her colleagues can\u2019t see past their present troubles. She says they want details about what their job will entail in the next 16 weeks and if they\u2019ll even be working. \"We want answers before we can even comprehend what we can do in the future,\" she says.

The boys died in an early-morning fire Wednesday in a two-storey farmhouse in southern Manitoba, despite the efforts of their parents and older brother to save them. The fire started about 12:30 a.m. in the Froese family\u2019s home near Kane, a hamlet about 20 kilometres west of Morris on Highway 23. FACEBOOK PHOTO\nFour brothers (from left) Timmy, 12, Danny, 10, Henry, 9, and Bobby Froese, 15  died in an overnight fire in a two-storey farmhouse in rural southern Manitoba, despite the efforts of their parents and older brother to save them. Surrounded by family, Beverley Eberhardt briefly described the grandsons she lost. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful boys, very close,\u201d said Eberhardt, from Winkler. \u201cThey\u2019re together all the time.\u201d \u201cBobby loved reading. Timmy loved computers and his phone, and he was the hunter. He loved hunting with his dad,\u201d she said. \u201cHenry was a little bit shy, much closer to his mom. Danny was the hyper one. You couldn\u2019t keep him down.\u201d Doralee Eberhardt, 34, was alone with seven of her eight children when the fire started. Her partner, Jake Froese, and the couple\u2019s oldest son, Steven, 18, who were working a late shift at a plant in Winkler, arrived home to find the home engulfed in flames. Doralee and three younger children \u2014 an eight-year-old girl, her five-year-old sister and two-year-old brother \u2014 escaped and were outside when the father and son arrived. After calling the local volunteer fire department, Jake tried to get inside but was turned back by the intense heat and smoke. The four boys sleeping on the second floor could not be saved. Family members identified them as Bobby, 15, Timmy, 12, Danny, 10, and Henry, 9. Beverley said Jake and Steven tried using a ladder to rescue the kids, but flames shooting out the windows drove them back. \u201c(Jake) tried to get them out. He was going through the window, but he couldn\u2019t wake them. The smoke and flames blew him right down,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s at (Health Sciences Centre). I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing.\u201d Doralee and Jake suffered from smoke inhalation and were transported to hospital in Winnipeg. The surviving children were taken to a neighbour\u2019s home. Beverley said there is great concern for Jake\u2019s health, but her daughter didn\u2019t suffer serious injuries. \u201cPhysically, my daughter is OK, but mentally she isn\u2019t good,\u201d she said. Jake\u2019s cousin, Susan Ryman, later said by telephone from Winkler she understood he was \u201cnow out of his coma and able to speak.\u201d \u2018Bobby loved reading. Timmy loved computers and his phone,  and he was the hunter. He loved hunting with his dad\u2019 \u2018Henry was a little bit shy, much closer to his mom.  Danny was the hyper one. You couldn\u2019t keep him down\u2019 Beverley said the oldest boy remains in a state of disbelief. \u201cSteven said he just won\u2019t believe his brothers are gone until he actually sees them,\u201d she said. Frank Krahn, president of Tri Koating Inc., the industrial painting firm where Jake and his oldest son work, described the father as a family man and said the thoughts of the company and its employees were with the family. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Provincial fire officials were still on scene late Wednesday afternoon. Bernard Schellenberg, the RM of Morris fire chief based in nearby Rosenort, said crews couldn\u2019t search the home because the fire was out of control. The 20-member crew, arriving with three trucks and a water tanker, was informed four boys were sleeping in rooms on the second floor. \u201cWhen they arrived on scene, the (newer) addition had been fully involved, and the walls had collapsed,\u201d Schellenberg said, adding firefighters helped Doralee, Jake and the younger kids who managed to escape. The tragedy will certainly have a deep impact on the volunteer firefighters. \u201cWhen firefighters deal with a tragedy like this, as tough as we seem to (be), we are aching inside for the family,\u201d Schellenberg said. Grief and crisis counselling has been made available to his volunteer crew. There was nothing left standing at the farmhouse site as it smouldered most of Wednesday. RM of Morris Reeve Ralph Groening said it\u2019s too early to determine what support the family will need and what counselling the firefighters will need in the coming days and weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve already received offers \u2014 there\u2019s a home that\u2019s been offered,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strength of small communities. They\u2019ve been there very quickly. We know the community is willing to provide the support needed to ensure they can, as best as possible, move on with their lives.\u201d BORIS MINKEVICH \/ WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\nAn overnight house fire killed four brothers near the village of Kane, about 20 kilometres west of Morris on Highway 23 Wednesday. Their parents and four other children escaped the fire, but they weren't able to rescue the boys. Red River Valley School Division superintendent Pauline Lafond-Bouchard said crisis response teams were at schools the boys attended in Lowe Farm and Rosenort on Wednesday. The boys were in different grades, said Lafond-Bouchard. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty tragic. We\u2019re just trying to support everyone as much as possible. \u201c(Students and staff) would know the family well,\u201d she said. RM of Morris chief administrative officer Larry Driedger said the community has already come together. The Access Credit Union, which has 17 branches across southern Manitoba, including one in nearby Lowe Farm, has set up a donation account for the family.

Train carrying crude oil derails near Gogama, Ont. \"The rail cars involved are new models, compliant with the latest federal regulations.\u00a0Yet they still failed to prevent this incident,\" Thibeault said in a statement. Five of the oil tankers are in the Makami River, four kilometres outside of Gogama. This is the third CN derailment in northern Ontario in less than a month, (GlennThibeault\/Twitter) \u200bCN Rail has confirmed that five of the 35 tanker cars that derailed are in Makami River, which is part of the Mattagami River System. The train was 94\u00a0cars long and all were tanker cars carrying crude oil from Alberta. Firefighters are working to control the flames and smoke from the burning oil tankers, about four kilometres outside of\u00a0Gogama. This is the third\u00a0CN\u00a0derailment in northern Ontario in less than a month, and the second in the same area. Crews are still working to clean up a similarly fiery derailment near the community just three weeks ago. That prompted Ontario Transportation Minister Steven Del\u00a0Duca\u00a0to say in a statement Sunday that he \"will be contacting Federal Transport Minister Lisa\u00a0Raitt,\u00a0CN\u00a0and\u00a0CP\u00a0this week to reiterate our government's serious concerns with respect to ensuring our railways are safe.\" Raitt responded with a statement saying she is \"very concerned\" with the spate of accidents. \"Should non-compliances be found, the company will face the full force of the law,\" she said. There's no sign that drinking water or air quality near the site of the\u00a0train derailment have been affected, according to\u00a0CN\u00a0Rail's latest update Sunday afternoon. The company\u00a0has launched its emergency response plan, bringing in experts in engineering, operating, environment and dangerous goods. CN\u00a0crews have already started constructing a 460-metre stretch of bypass track to divert around the derailment site. Chief operating officer Jim Vena apologized to local residents for the disruption caused by the derailment, adding that he is heading to the scene. 'Very hard to accept' Rick Duguay, who runs Gogama's general store, woke early\u00a0Saturday\u00a0morning to what he described as a strange banging noise. Duguay has lived in the community his entire life and is accustomed to the sound of trains, but said this sound was different. He's relieved the derailment happened outside of town. \"Luckily it's not right here at the railroad crossing, but it's close enough and very hard to accept the things going on,\" Duguay said. He wants to see changes put in place to make railroads safer, but doesn't think the two recent crashes are enough to prompt change. \"The worry was always there that a train wreck could happen in town ... but I mean, we lived with it all our life.\" Morris Neveau said\u00a0the two derailments so close together have left many in the Mattagami First Nation, just downstream from the recent derailment,\u00a0unnerved. \"It affects our thinking and how we live, you know, because we live in fear, eh?\" 'What can we do now?' Gogama residents spent much of the weekend looking up at the large plume of black smoke looming over the town. CN says indications are that 'the drinking water supply to Gogama Village and the nearby First Nation are not affected at this time.' (@GlennThibeault\/Twitter) Dawn Simoneau, 33, said her two daughters have been asking questions about the derailment. \"Like, 'Are the fish going to be okay?' and they are concerned as well,\" said\u00a0 . Simoneau, a life-long Gogama resident, has lived her entire life with trains rumbling past and an ever-present fear that something might happen. \"This is just always the way it's been. And now ...\u00a0we're thinking, 'What can we do now to make sure this doesn't happen again?'\" The derailment has some residents talking about the Energy East oil pipeline,\u00a0which has faced opposition in other parts of northern Ontario. Nickel Belt New Democrat MP Claude Gravelle said he didn't want to get into that debate while visiting Gogama on Saturday. \"Well, that's a different discussion for a different day, but there certainly are some concerns about pipelines. But there\u00a0are concerns about rail cars. What's the safest? Accidents are accidents.\" The intense heat of the fire has kept investigators away from the site so far, but investigators hope to find some answers Sunday about how much oil was spilled and what caused the derailment.

'Political opportunism' He then asked a rhetorical question, one that has likely been on many minds: why choose his Progressive Conservative government, which has been in power for almost 44 years? \"Every day, in every action, we must earn the trust of Albertans,\" Prentice said. \"I want to be a premier that Albertans can be proud of. I want this to be a party that reflects the values of Albertans.\" Prentice said the coming election will answer one fundamental question. \"Who is being honest with Albertans? And who has a realistic plan to put things right for Albertans?\" NDP Leader Rachel Notley kicked off her campaign by saying Albertans are\u00a0getting the wrong kind of leadership from the PCs.\u00a0Wildrose Leader Brian Jean\u00a0accused Prentice of cynically ignoring his own government's fixed election legislation. Opposition parties slam 'early' election while launching campaigns Liberal Leader David Swann\u00a0said this\u00a0election will be about building and maintaining trust with Martha and Henry's family, the new generation of Albertans who are now driving this province.\u00a0Alberta Party Leader Greg Clark\u00a0called the election \"nothing more than the usual PC political opportunism.\" Official Opposition race The PC party heads into the election holding\u00a070 of Alberta's 87 seats. Many political experts say the real race is for Official Opposition status after the\u00a0Wildrose Party saw its\u00a0caucus reduced\u00a0to\u00a0five seats in December when\u00a0former leader Danielle Smith and eight other MLAs crossed the floor to join the government. Five\u00a0Liberals, four\u00a0NDP\u00a0and\u00a0one independent\u00a0hold\u00a0the balance of\u00a0seats. The PCs have been in power since 1971. Fixed election-date legislation had set the next provincial election to be held no later than the spring of 2016, but an earlier date\u00a0comes as no surprise. Over the past weeks, Prentice has continued to say he needed a mandate to put this year's\u00a0budget into action. Follow along below as CBC reporters tweet live updates on the election call.

(Combat Camera\/DND) Social Sharing The Canadian military conducted its first airstrike on an ISIS target in Syria today, according to the Department of National Defence. Two Canadian CF-18s were involved in the airstrike against an ISIS garrison near Raqqa, Syria, the department said in a release. Raqqa is about 160 kilometres east of the embattled city of Aleppo. The department added that the Canadian Armed Forces aircrew and aircraft have safely returned to base. A total of 10 coalition aircraft, including six from the U.S., took part in the airstrike. The nationality of the two remaining aircraft was not disclosed. ANALYSIS | Is Canada's ISIS mission ready for Syria's moral maze? MPs vote to extend, expand ISIS mission into Syria Syrian airstrikes could help al-Qaeda It follows the Conservative government's decision to extend and expand the Canadian military's contribution to the U.S.-led coalition against the jihadist organization. MPs voted last week to support a government motion to extend Canada's involvement until March 2016 and to expand its role to include bombings over Syria. Most opposition MPs voted against the motion. Although this was the first airstrike in Syria since the mission expansion, the department noted, it was not the first air sortie. Three sorties have taken place since the government's decision to expand the mission. The sorties provide opportunities to assess new areas of operation, the department said. Since last September, only the U.S. and at least three Persian Gulf countries had been bombing in Syria, which has been riven by a brutal four-year\u00a0civil war. None of Canada's Commonwealth allies, including Britain and Australia, are engaged in airstrikes in Syria. The last reported strikes of Canadian jets came on April 4, when they hit targets west of Mosul, in northern Iraq, where extremists had established a roadside bomb-making facility.

Premier Wade MacLauchlan calls long-expected spring election CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Apr 06, 2015 6:34 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 7, 2015 P.E.I. Premier Wade MacLauchlan announces a provincial election for May 4. (CBC) Social Sharing Prince Edward Islanders will go to the polls May 4. Premier Wade MacLauchlan made the announcement at his nomination meeting to represent the district of York-Oyster Bed on Monday night. The Liberal Party heads into the election holding 23 of 27 seats, with three Progressive Conservatives and one Independent holding the balance of the seats.\u00a0The Liberals have governed since 2007. Fixed election-date legislation had set the next provincial election for Oct. 5, but an earlier date\u00a0comes as no surprise. A spring election call was set up when Robert Ghiz announced his resignation as premier in November, pending the selection of a new Liberal leader. MacLauchlan was named leader on Feb. 21 and sworn in as premier two days later. Few expected he would wait until October to attempt to win his own mandate. 4 new party leaders A major theme for the coming campaign is likely to be renewal, as all four parties \u2014 Liberal, Progressive Conservative, New Democrat and Green \u2014 have new leaders. None of the leaders has\u00a0served in the legislature. Progressive Conservative Leader Rob Lantz says his party is ready for the election. (CBC) The Liberals enter the election campaign\u00a0with some prominent members not reoffering , giving them the opportunity to bring in some fresh\u00a0faces in addition to the new leader. The new Progressive Conservative leader is Rob Lantz, who was a popular city councillor in Charlottetown for two terms. The Tories moved up their leadership convention, which had been scheduled for May, and Lantz was elected leader on Feb. 28 ,\u00a0when\u00a0he\u00a0warned the Liberals that his party was election ready. Mike Redmond, the NDP's fifth leader in five elections, is looking to get the party back into the legislature. (Kevin Yarr\/CBC) The Tory leadership convention was its most successful ever, with almost 3,000 votes cast. The Tory campaign effectively started when Lantz was named leader, and government accountability has emerged as a key theme. Lantz has already promised a royal commission on accountability in government that would focus on controversial aspects of the Robert\u00a0Ghiz government: the provincial nominee program, the e-gaming venture, and the lending and write-off practices of government. Greens and NDP While either the Liberals or Progressive Conservatives will almost certainly form government after the election, the Greens and the NDP are hoping for representation in the\u00a0legislature. Green Party Leader Peter Bevan-Baker has been vocal in the weeks leading up to the election call. (Kevin Yarr\/CBC) The NDP is the only party apart from the Liberals and Tories to have elected a member to the legislature, and that was just once \u2014 Herb Dickieson from 1996-2000. Since that achievement, the party's fortunes have faded considerably. In the last three elections, the NDP\u00a0has failed to gather more than 3.2 per cent of the popular vote. Under new leader Mike Redmond , the NDP has\u00a0attracted a lot of attention. In early 2013, public opinion polls suggested the NDP had the support of one in four voters , well ahead of what the Progressive Conservatives were polling at the time. Numbers have slipped for the NDP since then, and Redmond will face a challenge to win his seat. The Green Party has been active over\u00a0the last few weeks. Leader Peter Bevan-Baker has been vocal in commenting on issues, and the party has already released its platform . How the unproven four leaders perform over the next few weeks will likely play a significant role in\u00a0their parties' fortunes on voting day.

Photograph by: Bradley Karp\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, MyMcMurray.com A mother trying to kill bed bugs in her Fort McMurray apartment used an imported pesticide that fatally poisoned her infant and left her other children critically ill. The substance used in the apartment was a pellet form of phosphine, an agricultural pesticide that is strictly controlled in Canada and requires special training to use. When exposed to the air, the pellets react with moisture and release phosphine gas, said James Kehrer, a toxicologist at the University of Alberta. As a gas, it\u2019s often used to fumigate large batches of grain. \u201cIt will kill the bed bugs, but it\u2019s nasty stuff,\u201d said Kehrer. \u201cChildren are more susceptible to these things ... It should only be used by a professional.\u201d The pellets were mainly spread around one bedroom, but fire crews detected the substance throughout the unit, said Brad Grainger, deputy chief of operations for the Fort McMurray fire department. \u201cIt\u2019s airborne, but it\u2019s low to the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can imagine children crawling on the ground.\u201d Crews found readings of 4.0 parts per million in the bedroom. It\u2019s immediately lethal at 50 parts per million, but can be harmful at 1.0 parts per million after just 15 minutes, he said: \u201cThere was significant exposure.\u201d The family brought the bottle of phosphine pellets to the hospital when the children fell ill. Authorities were able to contact the woman\u2019s family in Pakistan to check what the substance was, and then test further to confirm the contents. The mother used a pesticide to fumigate her apartment last Tuesday that she brought back from Pakistan during a recent trip, said her sister, Shazia Yarkhan. The woman\u2019s five children started showing signs of illness Saturday night. They all vomited and one of them had diarrhea, Yarkhan said. On Sunday morning, their mother took them to the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre. One of the children, an eight-month-old, died in hospital that afternoon. Wood Buffalo RCMP said two children, ages two and six, were taken to the Stollery Children\u2019s Hospital in Edmonton by air ambulance on Sunday. The other two children, ages four and seven, remained in hospital Monday in Fort McMurray. All the children were reported to be in critical condition. \u201cShe says she can\u2019t talk now because she is very upset,\u201d Yarkhan said of her sister, who is in hospital in Fort McMurray under observation. The father is in Edmonton with the other children. Their names will not be released at the family\u2019s request, police said. RCMP spokesman Cpl. George Cameron said the incident appears accidental. Police received a call shortly after 3 p.m. Sunday from firefighters who requested help evacuating the main floor of a four-storey apartment building at 81 Fraser Ave. Tenants were allowed to return to their apartments at around 6:30 p.m. Sunday after air quality tests determined there was no threat to the rest of the building. Phosphine was also implicated in the 2012 deaths of two Quebec sisters, Audrey and Noemi Belanger, in Thailand. Days after they arrived at a popular tourist destination, a maid found the sisters dead in their hotel room. In January 2014, a family in Jerusalem was poisoned from phosphine after a section of their apartment was fumigated for pests, and two young children died from the poisoning.

All three suffered critical injuries in the crash but are expected to survive. A spokesperson with Toronto Pearson confirmed 18 people had been injured in the crash of the 76 passengers and four crew on board. Seventeen people were transported to hospital right after the crash, while the last person was transported after the others. There were 22 Canadians on board, while the rest were multinational.

Delta Airlines says the flight, operated by Endeavor Air, using a Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR aircraft, was involved in a single-aircraft accident at the airport. Endeavor is a subsidiary of Delta based out of Minneapolis.

Flint said three runways are currently in operation, and the two others will be closed for an investigation. \u201cWe do expect that there will be some operational impact and some delays at the airport over the next few days while the two runways remain closed for the investigation, and we will be sharing information periodically for those traveling to continue to look at our website and be in touch with your respective carrier as well,\u201d shared Flint.

There were no further conversations with the Delta flight until the tower confirmed at 2:12 p.m. that a plane had crashed, with air controllers quickly redirecting traffic to accommodate the crash scene.

Tanner Fox, 24, was sentenced on Tuesday by a British Columbia Supreme Court judge. Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty in October to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022. Lopez will be sentenced on Friday. The sentencing came after an emotional morning, in which Malik's relatives begged Fox to reveal who hired him to carry out the murder. \"We plead with you to reveal the names of the people who hired you,\" said Malik's daughter-in-law Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, according to reporters inside the New Westminster courtroom. The two men entered their guilty pleas on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder. Malik was shot several times in his car outside his family business in Surrey, in the Canadian province of British Columbia, on the morning of 14 July 2022. Police found a burnt-out vehicle nearby. Prosecutor Matthew Stacey told the court that Fox and Lopez planned a \"deliberate killing\" of Malik. \"They were financially compensated for killing him,\" he added. The killing happened more than a decade after Malik was acquitted in the devastating double bomb attack - Canada's deadliest terrorist attack in history. On 23 June 1985, Air India flight 182 from Canada to India blew up off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens visiting relatives in India. About the same time, a second bomb exploded prematurely in Japan, killing two baggage handlers The bombings - widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion - remain Canada's deadliest terror attack. Following a two-year trial, Malik and his co-accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings, after a judge ruled that testimony against them was not credible. According to the agreed statement of facts, Fox and Lopez were contracted to kill Malik, but the evidence did not establish who had hired them. Malik's family has urged them to co-operate with police to bring to justice whoever had directed the killing. In her testimony to court on Tuesday, Malik's daughter-in-law said the lack of answers has left the family afraid for their safety. \"This fear and anxiety comes from not knowing who hired you,\" she told Fox. \"Are we next?\" According to Fox's lawyer, the 24-year-old was born in Thailand and was adopted at age three by parents in Abbotsford, British Columbia. \"It's impossible to say where he went awry, went wrong in his youth that took him to this horrible offence,\" lawyer Richard Fowler has said. In court, Fox stood up to apologise for his actions. \"I'm sorry for all the pain and hurt that I've caused,\" he said.

Doug Ford, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, said the 25% tariffs threatened by Trump would devastate Canada\u2019s economy and cost Ontario thousands of jobs. \u201cThe people of our province, like people across Canada, are facing unprecedented times,\u201d Ford said in Windsor, Ont. \u201cI am asking the people of Ontario for their trust. I\u2019m asking (...) for a strong, stable, four-year mandate to do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\u201d The move would send Ontarians to the polls on Feb. 27, more than a year before the June 2026 fixed election date. Ford already has a large majority government, with 79 of the 124 seats in the Ontario legislature. Trump has threatened to introduce tariffs on Canadian goods starting Saturday. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt , told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that the plan was \u201cstill on the books\u201d for that day. \u201cThis is a game to the president,\u201d said Ford, who is the equivalent of a U.S. state governor. \u201cHe seeks to divide and conquer.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Canada\u2019s oldest company to liquidate all but 6 stores starting Monday With Trump\u2019s zigzag actions on trade, March came in like a lion and won\u2019t be going out like a lamb Don\u2019t click on those road toll texts. Officials issue warnings about the smishing scam Ford said the provincial government is prepared to spend \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d to protect jobs and the economy of Ontario, Canada\u2019s manufacturing and automobile hub. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight these tariffs with every tool in our toolbox,\u201d he said. Ford has said there would be a dollar-for-dollar tariff retaliation on American goods entering Canada. He has also said that if Trump applies tariffs, he will instruct Ontario\u2019s liquor control board to pull all American-made alcohol from shelves. Trump has said that Canada can avoid tariffs if it becomes the 51st state and he has incorrectly claimed that the U.S. has a $200 billion deficit with its major trading partner. Opposition parties accuse Ford of calling an early election before any potential charges emerge from a police investigation into his now-scrapped plan to develop lands under environmental protection. Elections Ontario, the independent office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario responsible for the administration of provincial elections and referendums, said Wednesday the election will cost about $189 million Canadian dollars ($131 million). That money, said Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, would be better spent on health care and affordable housing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a necessary election,\u201d Crombie told a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cHe is trying to cling to power.\u201d Daniel Beland, a political science professor at Montreal\u2019s McGill University, said Ford is taking \u201ca calculated risk.\u201d \u201cThe opposition is divided between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party, which is very likely to allow him to stay in power, at least if he runs an effective campaign,\u201d said Beland. The Ontario election is being held at the same time as the federal Liberal Party is selecting a new leader to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who announced his resignation Jan. 6 . Trudeau will remain prime minister until a new Liberal Party leader is chosen on March 9. The next Liberal leader could be the shortest-tenured prime minister in the country\u2019s history. All three opposition parties have vowed to bring down the Liberals\u2019 minority government in a no-confidence vote after parliament resumes on March 24 which would trigger a spring election. \u201cWe need a strong leadership that is prepared to do whatever lies ahead despite the chaos we now see in Ottawa,\u201d said Ford. \u201cTrump\u2019s threats are not going away at a time when the federal government has left Canada drifting, exposed and vulnerable.

Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March. That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on Jan. 20 when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy. \"I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process,\" Trudeau said. \"This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election.\" To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered. Polls show the Liberals will badly lose to the official opposition Conservatives in an election that must be held by late October, regardless of who the leader is. Parliament was due to resume on Jan. 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March. But if Parliament does not return until March 24, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.

But calls for him to step aside have soared since last month, when he tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending. Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of \"political gimmicks\" rather than focusing on what was best for the country. The Conservatives are led by Pierre Poilievre, a career politician who rose to prominence in early 2022 when he supported truck drivers who took over the centre of Ottawa as part of a protest against Covid-19 vaccine mandates.

After last-minute calls with Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to reinforce his country's border with the US to clamp down on migration and the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl. Earlier, Trump made a deal with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. She agreed to reinforce the northern border with troops. In return the US would limit the flow of guns into Mexico. But a US tariff of 10% on Chinese imports has come into effect, after a deadline of 00:01 EST (05:00 GMT) on Tuesday passed. Shortly after, Beijing announced it was imposing retaliatory tariffs on a raft of American products, including 15% on coal and liquefied natural gas and 10% on crude oil and agricultural machinery. Trump earlier said he planned to speak on the phone to his Chinese counterpart soon. He described the 10% import taxes as the \"opening salvo\" and said they could become \"very, very substantial\" if no agreement is made. Monday's breakthrough with Canada and Mexico came as they prepared retaliatory tariffs on American goods. After two phone calls on Monday, Trump and Trudeau posted on social media that they had reached a temporary agreement on securing the border that would avoid tariffs for at least 30 days. Both leaders portrayed the plan as a win. \"As president, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome,\" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. Watch: US anthem booed at basketball and hockey games in Canada Trudeau said Canada was implementing a $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) border plan that included nearly 10,000 frontline workers and more resources to halt the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic drug 50 times stronger than heroin, which Trump has cited as a major concern. The prime minister also said Canada would appoint a \"fentanyl czar\" and launch a joint strike force with the US to combat crime, fentanyl and money laundering. Much of the border security plan had already been announced by Canada in December. It includes enhanced co-ordination with US law enforcement, increased information sharing, limiting traffic at the border, and the deployment of drones and Black Hawk helicopters for surveillance. The news came just hours after Trump paused a separate tariff on Mexican goods in exchange for that country sending 10,000 National Guard troops to its border with the US. President Sheinbaum broke the news on X, writing she had had a \"good conversation with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty\" with her US counterpart. Trump described his phone conversation with the Mexican leader as \"very friendly\". In 2019, Mexico's government agreed to send 15,000 soldiers to its northern frontier to avoid tariffs from the first Trump administration. The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war - what comes next? Who won and lost as Trump's trade war is delayed - for now What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them? Trump has framed tariffs as a tool for growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. \"Tariffs for us, nobody can compete with us because we're the pot of gold,\" he said on Monday afternoon. \"But if we don't keep winning and keep doing well, we won't be the pot of gold.\" Economists, however, have warned that tit-for-tat tariffs could raise prices for a wide range of products, including cars, lumber, steel, food and alcohol. Items had already been removed from some shelves, and stock markets lurched downwards on Monday before recovering slightly with the announcement that tariffs had been suspended. Reuters Andrew Furey, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, acknowledged that the 30 days had brought some relief, but warned Canadians that a trade war still loomed. He told the BBC he looked forward to using \"the calm Canadian diplomatic approach to try to resolve any future tariffs\", but cautioned against further \"chaotic\" actions from the US president. \"We're left as Canadians feeling a bit confused by this attack from our closest friend, our largest trading partner, our ally, family,\" Furey said. Getty Images The premier of Ontario - Canada's most populous province, which makes up about 38% of the country's GDP - welcomed the pause and said he would suspend plans for retaliatory measures. Premier Doug Ford wrote on X: \"Make no mistake, Canada and Ontario continue to stare down the threat of tariffs. \"Whether it's tomorrow, in a month or a year from now... President Trump will continue to use the threat of tariffs to get what he wants.\" On Sunday, Trump indicated the 27-nation European Union would be his next target for tariffs, without providing further details. The American president suggested that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared much duties.

India has denied those allegations. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar\u2019s killing and are awaiting trial. Russia, Pakistan and Iran are also considered foreign interference threats in Canada. Ronald Au-Yeung, a fellow with the political science department at the University of Notre Dame, said the rules surrounding Canadian federal elections are strong, but added that the report failed to adequately address the threat of foreign interference when political parties select their candidates. He explains that foreign governments can purchase memberships during a nomination race to help prevent its critics from receiving a party\u2019s nomination to run for government. In the report, Hogue encouraged parties to adopt \u201cmore stringent rules who is entitled to vote in nomination and leadership contests.\u201d The report includes seven volumes and lays out 51 recommendations for the federal government, nearly half of which she says should be considered before the next election. The report comes as Canada\u2019s Liberal Party is selecting a new leader to replace Trudeau who announced his resignation Jan. 6 .

Hogue said the Canadian Security Intelligence Service should clearly flag reports it views as particularly relevant for senior decision-makers. There is a recommendation for the government to create an entity to monitor online information for misinformation and disinformation that could impact the democratic process. The report also calls on Ottawa to develop a comprehensive foreign interference strategy, encourage political party leaders to obtain top secret-level security clearances, and consider creating a new agency to monitor online spaces for misinformation and disinformation.

The Trump administration said tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants into the US, but they potentially risk substantial price increases for American consumers across an array of common goods from avocados to sneakers to cars. Hours later, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will impose retaliatory tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced \u201cfar-reaching\u201d retaliatory levies. China\u2019s commerce ministry said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and \u201ctake corresponding countermeasures,\u201d without elaborating. The tariffs, and subsequent retaliation, risk igniting a trade war that could significantly damage the economies of the targeted countries and the United States. In anticipation, Trump\u2019s executive action includes a clause that allows the president to expand the tariffs if a country imposes new tariffs on the United States. The new policy represents a reversal of virtually duty-free trade among the three North American nations that\u2019s existed for several years \u2014 and an expansion of a frosty trade war between China and the United States that has escalated over the past two administrations. President Donald Trump speaks as he signs an executive order in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, on Friday. Carlos Barria\/Reuters Related live-story Trump announces new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China As Trump has repeatedly promised over the past several months, the tariffs will amount to a significant 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States. The tariffs will have no exemptions, and the executive action Trump signed Saturday will close the so-called de minimis loophole that had allowed shipments of $800 or less to come into the United States tax-free \u2014 a key provision used by many American small businesses but also Chinese e-commerce companies such as Shein and Temu. Trump administration officials said the loophole prevented customs officials from properly inspecting those packages. Although Trump administration officials said Saturday the tariffs were designed to stop the flow of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants, they gave no specific benchmark for the new import taxes to be lifted \u2014 other than the cessation of the drugs and undocumented immigrants coming into the country. Notably, the tariffs included an important carve-out \u2014 the tariff on Canadian energy products will be 10%. Many Americans rely on Canadian energy products, including oil, electricity and natural gas, for fuel and home heating. The cost of those items could rise when the tariffs hit. To put the tariffs in place, Trump in his executive action declared a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as \u201cIEEPA,\u201d which authorizes a president to unilaterally manage imports during a national emergency. The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 am ET. \u201cToday, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China,\u201d Trump said in a message posted to Truth Social on Saturday. He said he used the IEEPA \u201cbecause of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all.\u201d Igniting a potential trade war The tariffs  could lead to potentially much higher costs, disrupted supply chains and the loss of jobs. In a call with reporters Saturday, a Trump administration official said any retaliation from Mexico, China or Canada would likely result in even higher tariffs for that country. Even Trump acknowledged the potential for adverse consequences on American consumers. \u201cThere could be some temporary, short-term disruption, and people will understand that,\u201d Trump said Friday when pressed by reporters on the cost of tariffs being passed on to importers and, by extension, consumers. \u201cBut the tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong \u2014 and we\u2019re going to treat other countries very fairly.\u201d Hours after Trump\u2019s action, Trudeau announced retaliatory 25% tariffs on US goods, that will be \u201cfar-reaching and include everyday items,\u201d making good on his promise that Canada would retaliate forcefully and swiftly if the United States imposed levies. The country\u2019s trade representatives met with Trump administration officials as recently as Friday in an attempt to stave off the tariffs. \u201cTonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% trade tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods,\u201d the Canadian leader said in a news conference Saturday night. \u201cThis will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion of American products in 21 days\u2019 time, to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.\u201d Affected items will include American alcohol, produce, clothing, shoes, household appliances, furniture, materials such as lumber, and \u201cmuch more,\u201d Trudeau said. Avocados and bananas from Mexico are displayed at a grocery store in San Francisco on Thursday. David Paul Morris\/Bloomberg\/Getty Images Related article Here\u2019s what will get more expensive from Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum also struck a defiant tone Saturday. \u201cWhen we negotiate with other nations, when we talk with other nations, [it is] always with our heads held high, never bowing our heads,\u201d Sheinbaum said, speaking in Chicoloapan de Ju\u00e1rez, east of the country\u2019s capital. \u201cI instruct the Secretary of Economy to implement plan B that we have been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico\u2019s interests,\u201d Sheinbaum said later in a post on X. It is not clear exactly what the retaliatory tariffs involve. A White House fact sheet on the tariffs said Mexican drug trafficking organizations have an \u201cintolerable alliance\u201d with the country\u2019s government, accusing the government of providing a \u201csafe haven\u201d to cartels. Sheinbaum strongly denied \u201chaving alliances with criminal organizations,\u201d calling the accusation \u201cslander.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said the imposition of tariffs \u201cseriously violates\u201d World Trade Organization rules. \u201cChina will file a complaint with the WTO, and will take corresponding countermeasures to resolutely defend its rights,\u201d it said. It is not clear what the measures will be. Beijing\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said tariffs are \u201cnot constructive\u201d and will only \u201cundermine\u201d work by both nations to combat narcotics. China \u201cprovides support to the US on the issue of fentanyl\u201d but ultimately, \u201cfentanyl is America\u2019s problem,\u201d the ministry said. Tariffs are one of the few policies Trump has consistently supported for decades, a rare through-line from his days as a New York developer to his time in public office (another is immigration). As a candidate, he swore he\u2019d use tariffs \u2014 \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d \u2014 to wield US leverage abroad. But tariffs are unpopular among mainstream economists, who largely agree they cause inflation. That\u2019s because importers \u2014 not the countries exporting the goods \u2014 pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices. New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything \u2014 from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food. Businesses lash out at Trump\u2019s tariff plan Corporations and business groups were apoplectic about the tariffs Saturday. The US Chamber of Commerce slammed the levies, warning they will raise consumer prices. In a statement, the powerful business group acknowledged that Trump is right to focus on securing the border and to fight the illicit flow of fentanyl. \u201cBut the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won\u2019t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains,\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president and head of international at the chamber. \u201cThe Chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\u201d The National Association of Manufacturers said the tariffs would hurt American factories and their employees. \u201cThe ripple effects will be severe, particularly for small and medium-sized manufacturers that lack the flexibility and capital to rapidly find alternative suppliers or absorb skyrocketing energy costs,\u201d said NAM CEO Jay Timmons. \u201cThese businesses\u2014employing millions of American workers\u2014will face significant disruptions. Ultimately, manufacturers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, undermining our ability to sell our products at a competitive price and putting American jobs at risk.\u201d The Distilled Spirits Council of the US, the Mexican Chamber of the Tequila Industry and Spirits Canada said in a joint statement shared with CNN on Saturday that they are \u201cdeeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries.\u201d Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to US Department of Agriculture data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits. President Donald Trump speaks to members of the press as he and first lady Melania Trump prepare to depart the White House aboard Marine One on January 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura\/Getty Images Related article With stiff tariffs he promised now in place, Trump opens a new trade war The energy industry was unsatisfied with the reduced tariffs on Canadian oil, gas and electricity. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents Big Oil and natural gas companies, said in a statement that it wanted to be fully left out of the tariffs. It noted fuel prices would rise on the $14.4 billion of oil and natural gas imported each year from Canada. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Trump administration on full exclusions that protect energy affordability for consumers, expand the nation\u2019s energy advantage and support American jobs,\u201d American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. NEMA, which represents the electricity industry, urged the Trump administration to take a more cautious approach to tariffs, noting the electricity and the electronics industries make up a large chunk of America\u2019s imported and exported goods. Western Growers, which represents farmers, said the tariffs would hurt America\u2019s food producers. \u201cWhile we appreciate the border security issues apparently motivating the Trump Administration, rival growers of specialty crops outside of the U.S. will move quickly to seize the new business opportunities created by these tariffs to sell into the Canadian, Mexican and Chinese marketplaces,\u201d its CEO Dave Puglia said in a statement. Consumer advocacy groups also warned Trump\u2019s plans would raise costs for Americans. \u201cTariffs are a tax increase on American households and manufacturers,\u201d National Taxpayers Union President Pete Sepp said in a statement. And new Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin came out swinging in a statement, offering an early preview of how his party intends to message more aggressively against Trump on kitchen table issues: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about Donald Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy: Trump isn\u2019t going to make corporate billionaires pay for these tariffs \u2013 working families and small businesses will. He\u2019s using American workers as pawns in his petty political games,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIf a president promised that they\u2019d help my family get by, and then they did this, I\u2019d be pretty pissed off. So, you should be pissed off.\u201d Why those countries? Key trading partners Mexico, China and Canada are the United States\u2019 three largest trade partners. And in 2023, Mexico overtook China as the top nation exporting goods to the US, marking the first time in two decades China was not the top-ranking exporter. Tariffs the first Trump administration put in place, which Joe Biden\u2019s administration largely maintained, have negatively impacted the amount of goods the US imports from China. Mexican and Canadian goods have been imported in the US virtually duty-free as a result of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated with America\u2019s bordering nations during his first administration. Tractor trailers wait in line at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, on the US-Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Carlos Moreno\/Bloomberg\/Getty Images Related article Trump just gave his clearest picture yet of what new tariffs could look like Mexico maintained that top position last year as well, exporting $467 billion worth of goods to the US, followed by China and Canada, which exported $401 billion and $377 billion worth of goods, respectively. That\u2019s according to Commerce Department figures from last year through November, the most recent month of available data. Collectively, the three countries accounted for 42% of the nearly $3 trillion worth of goods the US imported worldwide last year. Canada was the top country the US exported goods to last year, valued at $322 billion, followed by Mexico and China, which received $309 billion and $131 billion worth of goods from the US, respectively. US exports to the three countries accounted for over 40% of the $1.9 trillion worth of goods the US exported globally last year. That means Americans could pay a lot more for a wide range of goods. For instance, the US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, according to Commerce Department data. Both are likely to get more expensive almost immediately after any new tariffs that impact Mexican car exports to the US. Automakers have operated as if Canada, Mexico and the United States were one unified market for decades, moving vehicles and parts across borders as they assemble vehicles. Even cars assembled at US auto plants all have parts that come from both Mexico and Canada, and vehicles assembled in those two countries have parts that come from US factories. Canada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group. Gas, fresh produce, consumer electronics \u2014 some of the top goods the US imports from Mexico, China and Canada \u2014 could also be set to get more expensive with blanket tariffs.

The federal government announced its own high-speed rail line at a news conference in Montreal on Wednesday. (Claude Paris\/The Associated Press) Social Sharing The Liberal government launched a six-year, $3.9-billion design and development plan\u00a0Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says will eventually\u00a0connect Quebec City and Toronto with a high-speed rail line. \"Today I'm announcing the launch of Alto, the largest infrastructure project in Canadian history,\" Trudeau said from Montreal.\u00a0\"A reliable, efficient, high-speed rail network will be a game-changer for Canadians.\" Trudeau said the new rail network will run all-electric trains along 1,000\u00a0kilometres of track, reaching\u00a0speeds of up to 300\u00a0km\/hour, with stops in Toronto, Peterborough, Ottawa, Montreal, Laval, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res\u00a0and Quebec City. A government statement\u00a0said the project will stimulate\u00a0the economy, \"boosting GDP by up to $35\u00a0billion annually, creating over\u00a051,000 good-paying jobs during construction.\" Trudeau said that once built,\u00a0the new high-speed rail network\u00a0will take passengers from Montreal to Toronto in three hours \u2014 about half the time it takes to drive and at double the speed of Via Rail's current trains. Federal government going ahead with high-speed rail between Quebec City and Toronto Could new rail line be 'costly boondoggle' or economic boon for Toronto? Liberals announce plans for new 'high frequency' rail lines from Toronto to Quebec City Construction on the new line will not begin until the design phase is done, which could take four to five years.\u00a0Funds are to be allocated at the end of that time period, so it's possible a future government could modify or cancel the project. Last month, Trudeau announced he would be stepping down as prime minister. The race to succeed him is in full swing, with a new Liberal leader and prime minister set to be selected by March 9. An election is expected in the spring. Watch\u00a0|\u00a0'This is real now': Trudeau says high-speed rail is coming to Canada: 'This is real now': Trudeau says high-speed rail is coming to Canada 2 months ago Duration 2:20 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking from Montreal on Wednesday, announced a plan for a 1,000 km high-speed rail network connecting Quebec City and Toronto \u2014 and took a question about what makes this announcement different after decades of discussion about the possibility of a high-speed rail corridor in the densely populated region. \"High-speed rail in this country was always going to be a project that would take long enough to build that it would cover multiple governments \u2026 from municipal to provincial to federal,\" Trudeau said. \"Obviously, future governments will make their determinations about how they invest.\u00a0But this investment in Canadians, which starts right now, is going to be very difficult to turn back on,\" he added. Contract with consortium yet to be signed Trudeau said the consortium Cadence \u2014 made up of\u00a0CDPQ Infra, AtkinsR\u00e9alis, Keolis, SYSTRA, SNCF Voyageurs and Air Canada \u2014\u00a0was selected to build the line. The group\u00a0was only informed in the last 24 hours that their bid was the best of the three submitted, according to sources that spoke to Radio-Canada. Transport Minister Anita Anand\u00a0said that Alto, the Crown corporation created to oversee the project, and Cadence will be signing a contract \"in the coming weeks\" that will outline the first-phase design work, such as where track will be laid and where stations will be built. A government statement said the initial development stage funding will be spread over six years starting this year, but Anand and Trudeau said in Montreal Wednesday that the design stage of the project might only last four to five years. Martin Imbleau, Alto's president and CEO, said the long lead\u00a0time is necessary to ensure the project will not encounter problems when construction begins. \"We're going to take our time, properly develop the project, look at the different phases and in four or five years, we'll know what we're building,\" Imbleau said. WATCH |\u00a0What Canadian high speed rail could look like: What Canadian high speed rail could look like 6 months ago Duration 2:33 The time it takes to travel from one city to another could be cut in half, which could have a massive effect on how many people travel, and even where people live. But some say the costs associated with the federal government\u2019s plan may keep high-speed rail in Canada out of reach. As Radio-Canada first reported in October, the Liberal government had opted for a high-speed train rather than a slower high-frequency train project to transport passengers between Quebec City and Toronto. A government statement said \"Canada's investment in the co-development phase of the project represents $3.9\u00a0billion over six years, starting in 2024-25,\" in addition to the $371.8\u00a0million announced in the budget. Transport Canada initially estimated that the cost of a high-speed rail link between the two cities could be as high as $80 billion. Conservatives, Carney, Freeland react CBC News asked the Conservatives if they would support the project's completion should they form the next government, but they did not provide a direct answer. Conservative MP Philip Lawrence, the party's transport critic, dismissed the announcement as little more than a photo-op. \"The prime minister will be gone in two weeks. The minister of transport will not be seeking re-election. Today's announcement is a lame duck statement from a lame duck government,\" Lawrence said in a statement. \"Today's announcement is yet another promise with no details that will take years and $3.9 billion on planning and bureaucracy, without laying a single piece of track,\" he said. High-speed train pushed by Quebec, Ontario Ontario's dream of a bullet train may have died a quiet death Ontario budget 2018 Liberals' $11B pledge for high speed rail highlights long list of major infrastructure promises Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney welcomed the news on Wednesday, saying a new high-speed rail network could bring large economic benefits. \"This has all the potential to be the type of project, a public-private partnership, that the country needs,\" Carney said at a news conference in Scarborough, Ont. He added that if he becomes\u00a0the Liberal leader, he would \"ensure that the project going ahead benefits all Canadians.\" Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, another candidate for the Liberal leadership, also backed the project. \"I think it's a great project. I think we need to be building more infrastructure. We need to have more connections between the cities in our country. This is a great investment in Canada's economy, in Canadian people,\" she said. A history of toying with high-speed rail Canada is the only G7 country without some form of high-speed rail, although the idea has been studied for decades. A joint Ontario, Quebec and federal government study completed in 1995 found that the idea of running trains between Quebec City and Windsor was feasible if they were at least 300 km\/h and the private sector assumed half the cost and all the risk. In 2008, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and Quebec Premier Jean Charest agreed to conduct another study of the project. When that study suggested it could cost more than $21 billion , however, enthusiasm waned. In 2017, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne announced plans to build a high-speed rail network between Toronto and London by 2025, but that was axed when Doug Ford took office. Clarifications The headline on this story was updated from an earlier version that referred to a \"six-year, $3.9B plan\" for high-speed rail. In fact, that describes only the design and development phase and does not include construction.

Instead, the Canadian team stood at the blue line, arm in arm, player and coach, wearing their championship hats while the maple leaf flag was lowered behind the 4 Nations Face-Off trophy and the national anthem reverberated across the Americans\u2019 home ice. The fans who remained, many of them in their red Team Canada jerseys, sang along. Connor McDavid scored at 8:18 of overtime to give Canada a 3-2 victory over the United States on Thursday night as the North American rivals turned what had been a tune-up for the 2026 Olympics into a geopolitical brawl over anthems and annexation as much as international hockey supremacy. Or, to put it another way: It was the 51st U.S. state 3, Canada\u2019s 11th province 2. AP AUDIO: Connor McDavid scores in OT to give Canada 3-2 win over United States in 4 Nations Face-Off final Canada avenged last week\u2019s loss to the United States with an overtime win on Thursday to claim the 4 Nations Face-Off. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. \u201cYou can\u2019t take our country \u2014 and you can\u2019t take our game,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X in a cross-border callback to President Donald Trump\u2019s chatter about turning one of the United States\u2019 closest allies into the 51st state. \u201dA lot of stuff going on with Canada and the USA right now, and us playing against each other was kind of a perfect storm for our sport,\u201d said Nathan MacKinnon, who was selected the MVP of the new tournament with four goals in four games. \u201cIt was much more popular than even we would have imagined. It was getting so much attention from our whole continent.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Czech leaders condemn Russian threats against NHL great Dominik Hasek Wild\u2019s top line more than the Golden Knights can handle through first 2 games Kaprizov\u2019s 3-point game leads the Wild to a 5-2 win over the Golden Knights, tying the series Jordan Binnington stopped 31 shots \u2014 including the last 20 in a row \u2014 on the same ice where he helped the St. Louis Blues win the Stanley Cup as a rookie five years ago. MacKinnon and Sam Bennett also scored for Canada, which made it 2-2 in the second period and then played a scoreless third. After a flurry of saves by Binnington early in the overtime, Canada gained a faceoff in the U.S. zone and Mitch Marner got the puck along the boards before popping it into the center to McDavid for the winner. The Canadians poured over the boards to celebrate, shook hands with the vanquished Americans, and then took turns skating with the never-before-awarded trophy. \u201cJust to see the reaction. Just to know what it means to us. I know it\u2019s just a quick tournament, and it\u2019s not an Olympic gold medal or anything like that, but it means the world to our group, as you can see,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cI hope (the new fans) love it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great game, it\u2019s a great sport and I hope we put on a good show these last couple days and gained some fans, ultimately. You can\u2019t ask for a better show than that.\u201d Brady Tkachuk and Jake Sanderson scored for the Americans, and Connor Hellebuyck stopped 22 shots in regulation and three more in OT. The U.S. has lost all but one game against Canada in best-on-best international play dating to the preliminaries of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; the lone victory was in the 4 Nations round-robin, a game so good it turned Thursday\u2019s sequel into one of the most anticipated international hockey events in decades . \u201cI think guys that are at home watching this, I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re wanting a piece of it,\u201d U.S. forward Dylan Larkin said. \u201cThis grew the game really well, but I hope it pushes guys to want a piece of this and then the next generation that got to watch this, they\u2019re going to watch the Olympics next year and hopefully there\u2019s a different outcome.\u201d The already ripe rivalry between the two North American hockey powers took on an added intensity during the tournament following Trump\u2019s tariff threats and talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Trump called the American team Thursday morning to wish it well, then turned to Truth Social to take a poke at \u201cGovernor Trudeau.\u201d The political backdrop combined with the quality of the round-robin game, which the United States won 3-1 on Saturday, to bring the atmosphere of a Stanley Cup Final or Olympic gold medal game to the TD Garden. Fans in their team jerseys waved flags , shouted for their countrymen and continued the ritual booing of the opposing national anthem that has become an nightly undercard for a tournament that returned the NHL\u2019s stars to the international scene after missing the last two Winter Games. The pregame hype video was a callback to the 1980 Olympics, when the undermanned U.S. team upset the powerful Soviet machine in the midst of the Cold War. \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d Olympic hero and honorary U.S. captain Mike Eruzione wore a Johnny Gaudreau jersey to honor the memory of former Boston College and Calgary Flames star who was killed by a drunk driver while bicycling in New Jersey at his sister\u2019s wedding last summer.

(Paul Daly\/The Canadian Press) Andrew Furey \u2014 the 14th premier of Newfoundland and Labrador \u2014 has announced his resignation. The move came as a shock on Tuesday afternoon, as Furey addressed the media and his supporters on short notice, immediately following a caucus meeting at Confederation Building in St. John's. The province has been abuzz with rumblings of a forthcoming election for weeks. Instead, the premier announced he'd be returning to his job as an orthopedic surgeon. \"It has been a wild and unexpected journey, right from the start to bring us here to today, to the finish,\" he said. \"It is with a heart full of pride and hard-earned confidence in the future of Newfoundland and Labrador, that I must now move on.\" He finished his address with tears in his eyes, saying: \"God bless the beautiful people of this province, and God guard thee Newfoundland and Labrador.\" He then walked off the stage to his wife and kids, wrapping them in his arms. The premier was tight-lipped with his decision, with even his deputy premier Siobhan Coady saying she found out just before his announcement. Furey embraced his family following his resignation speech. (Paul Daly\/The Canadian Press) Decision comes after Furey crosses off major goal His resignation comes three months after securing a memorandum of understanding with Quebec on a new deal for hydroelectric power flowing from Churchill Falls in Labrador. The memorandum of understanding would see the controversial 1969 contract torn up and replaced 16 years early. Furey and Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault say the new agreement would provide $200 billion in value to each province over its lifetime. WATCH | Andrew Furey steps down as premier of Newfoundland and Labrador: FULL SPEECH | Andrew Furey announces his resignation as N.L. premier 2 months ago Duration 11:08 In an unexpected move, the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador announced Tuesday afternoon that he is stepping down. Andrew Furey cited improvements to health care and child care programs, support for Ukraine and his role in repatriating the Unknown Soldier as some of his career highlights Furey referred to the accomplishment on Tuesday as \"history made and past wrongs rewritten,\" and called it a \"rock solid foundation for our province moving forward.\" He also made reference to \"blind sides\" \u2014 such as the adversity of the pandemic, the financial woes of the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, and the potential trade war with the U.S. In recent months, Furey has been on the front lines of that fight, making several trips south of the border with other Canadian premiers. After meetings earlier this month, Furey told reporters that President Donald Trump's officials informed them the president was \"very serious\" about his 51st state comments. \"We're looking at four years of erratic, crazy, bonkers behaviour by the president of the United States,\" Furey said on Tuesday. \"This is going to be a pervasive problem for Canadians for the next four years.\" Furey said the province's natural resources put it in an optimal position for economic uncertainty and a trade war with Canada's closest ally. Decision made with family in mind After departing the stage and hugging members of his family and caucus, both Andrew and Allison Furey spoke to a crowd of reporters. \"It was the balance of family, combined with the electoral timing rules and what I felt was best for the stability of the province,\" he said. The province's fixed election laws mean voters must head to the polls in October or November \u2014 depending on the timing of a federal election \u2014 at the latest. The province also has a rule stating there has to be an election within one year of a governing party changing leaders.

Furey confirmed he will stay on until a new Liberal leader has been chosen. He said he will not be running in the upcoming federal election. 'We've enjoyed every second of this' Furey's tenure as premier wasn't all roses. He ascended to the role in August of 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. He faced scrutiny over the decision to call an election in the spring of 2021, which was blindsided by an outbreak of COVID-19 cases that caused voting to be delayed. Furey said he made the decision after conversations with his wife, Dr. Allison Furey, around the Valentine's Day weekend. (Paul Daly\/The Canadian Press) Even as the pressures of the pandemic relented, Furey was in charge of a health-care system in a state of permanent crisis. There was controversy with the province's reliance on travel nurses, a fisheries protest that disrupted a provincial budget last year and a fishing trip with a billionaire that resulted in a conflict of interest probe \u2014 he was ultimately cleared of conflicts in the latter case. On the bright side, Furey pointed to the MOU with Quebec, a multi-billion dollar rate mitigation deal with the federal government, and the repatriation of an unknown soldier from France as his favourite accomplishments. \"We've enjoyed every second of this,\" he told reporters. Allison Furey told reporters\u00a0how proud she was of her husband over the past five years. \"I think the province knows Andrew as somebody who gives 150 per cent, and he's done that for the last five years in this role as premier,\" she said. \"I'm feeling a little bit of relief, a little bit of sadness and nostalgia. I think our future is bright. I think he's left this place in a better spot than he found it, and we're very proud of him.\" Quebec Premier Francois Legault and Andrew Furey, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador shake hands after signing a memorandum of understanding during an announcement in St. John's on Dec. 12. (Paul Daly\/The Canadian Press) Furey also received a message of support from the Quebec premier immediately following his announcement. The two formed an unlikely friendship during their time as premiers, setting aside decades of bad blood between the neighbouring\u00a0provinces. \"I will remember for the rest of my life what we accomplished together in reaching a new agreement on the Churchill Falls power plant, its expansion and on the new Gull Island power plant,\" Legault wrote on social media.\u00a0\"With this historic agreement, we have transformed the relationship between Quebec and Newfoundland, making it one of the strongest relationships in the country.\" What's next? Furey will stay on as premier until a new leader is selected \u2014 a process\u00a0deputy premier Siobhan Coady says remains without timelines, since nobody knew this decision was coming. His resignation comes at a tricky time for the party, as there were questions about whether or not a number of senior caucus members \u2014 Coady included \u2014 would be seeking re-election. When asked if she would consider a run, Coady said she hadn't had a chance to think about it. \"I haven't even spoken to my husband since this announcement,\" she said with a chuckle. \"Let me take a few days, obviously. I think there will be a lot of people who will think about this over the next number of days. There are a lot of leaders in our caucus and a lot of leaders in the community who might want to step up as well.\" Download our free CBC News app to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

Pat King, 47, was found guilty in November of five criminal charges including mischief and disobeying a court order. He faced up to 10 years in prison. In its ruling Wednesday, an Ontario Superior Court judge gave King nine months credit for time already spent in custody before and during his trial. On top of the house arrest, he will have to complete 100 hours of community service at a food bank or men\u2019s shelter. Two other organizers, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, are awaiting the outcomes of their trials. The February 2022 protests, dubbed the Freedom Convoy, were sparked by a Canadian government vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government.

Just after midnight, Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.

It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. In an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, \u201cthey\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\u201d Trump also acknowledged there could be \u201ca little disturbance\u201d from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market\u2019s sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation. \u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days. \u201cToday the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said. President Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them. Later in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico \u201cin the middle,\u201d with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. Lutnick told Fox Business Network that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise. RELATED COVERAGE Here are some goods in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China China slaps extra tariffs of up to 15% on imports of major US farm exports and adds trade limits \u201cI think he\u2019s going to figure out, you do more, and I\u2019ll meet you in the middle in some way,\u201d Lutnick said. A Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford\u2019s press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he\u2019ll go harder. The official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau\u2019s \u201cvery dumb\u201d comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal.

(Adrian Wyld \/The Canadian Press via AP) A senior Canadian official said Trudeau told the premiers of Canada\u2019s provinces that he hopes to speak to Trump on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump\u2019s trade war. AP AUDIO: Trump\u2019s trade war draws swift retaliation as Mexico, Canada and China impose tariffs on the US AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s blistering rejection of the Trump tariffs. China indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down. \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X. The president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient. Import taxes are \u201ca very powerful weapon that politicians haven\u2019t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re using them.\u201d Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday\u2019s hikes will lift America\u2019s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new era for sure.\u201d As the trade disputes escalated, stocks racked up more losses Tuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next.

(Ethan Cairns \/The Canadian Press via AP) During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs only after lengthy investigations \u2014 into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. But by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, \u201che can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,\u2019\u2019 House said. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic.\u201d Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs. \u201cPresidents don\u2019t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cAbusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn\u2019t leadership \u2014 it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Even some Republican senators raised alarms. \u201cMaine and Canada\u2019s economy are integrated,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state\u2019s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. Truck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he\u2019s done for decades. Like many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. \u201cThings could change drastically,\u201d Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S. Alan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump\u2019s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States. \u201cNobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,\u201d Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn\u2019t find enough workers in the United States.

(AP Photo\/Paul Sancya, File) U.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada. Sales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. \u201cThey\u2019re putting that 25% on studs.\u2019' Builders will strain to stay within their budgets. After years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada\u2019s crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold. \u201cThat hurts,\u201d he said. At his small distillery \u201cevery single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.\u201d Bard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky\u2019s Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin. The China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be \u201ccrippling,\u201d as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.

Conservatives say MLA Brodie mocked abuse victims, oust her from caucus The move comes after Brodie publicly mocked, belittled testimony from former residential school students Lauren Collins Mar 7, 2025 1:04 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Conservative Party of B.C. Leader John Rustad says Vancouver-Quilchena MLA Dallas Brodie has been kicked out of his party's caucus. (Wolf Depner\/News Staff) Listen to this article 00:03:32 Conservative Party of B.C. Leader John Rustad says Vancouver-Quilchena MLA Dallas Brodie has been removed\u00a0from his party's caucus, and will not be welcome to return. The move comes after Brodie challenged the caucus to \"fire her\" and asked Conservative MLAs to have a vote on removing her on Thursday (March 6), according to a release from the Conservatives Friday. Brodie reportedly walked out of the caucus room. Rustad said her removal is a \"result of her decision to publicly mock and belittle testimony from former residential school students, including by mimicking individuals recounting stories of abuses \u2014 including child sex abuse.\" \"Horrible things happened to vulnerable children at Residential Schools \u2014 including pedophiles preying on children; at Kamloops Indian Residential School, Gerald Mathieu Moran was charged and convicted by Canadian courts with several dozen sex crimes he committed against children while working there,\" Rustad said. \"In a recent podcast appearance, Dallas Brodie uses a mocking, child-like voice to belittle testimony from former residential school students, saying things like 'my grandmother\u2019s truth'\u00a0and 'my truth, your truth'\u00a0in a child-like \u2018whining\u2019 voice.\" Rustad said he believes strongly in free speech, \"however, using your stature and platform as an MLA to mock testimony from victims alleging abuse, including sex abuse, is where I draw the line.\" However, Rustad drew the line at denouncing Brodie's comments around burials and grave sites at former residential school sites. He said her removal is about an elected MLA using her position of authority to mock testimony of survivors of abuse, including child sex abuse. \"I want to be clear \u2014 this has nothing to do with whether or not there are undiscovered remains at Kamloops Indian Residential School, where it is objectively true that no new bodies have been found.\" Brodie first posted to X on Feb. 22 as the party's then-attorney general critic claiming \"apparent mistreatment\" of a lawyer who is suing his own law society for libel after having asked the society to reword training materials around residential schools. In her posts, she said \"the confirmed number of child burials at the\u00a0former Kamloops Indian Residential School site is zero ...\u00a0No one should be afraid of the truth. Not lawyers, their governing bodies, or anyone else.\" Brodie refused to take down the post and posted her letter to Attorney General Niki Sharma on March 4. She came under fire from her Conservative colleague and house leader, Chilliwack-Cultus Lake MLA A'Aliya Warbus, who posted to X in the days after to: \"Inform yourself, get the latest facts, research AND talk to survivors.\u00a0Questioning the narratives of people who lived and survived these atrocities, is nothing but harmful and taking us backward in reconciliation.\" The Conservative Party of B.C. will be taking over Brodie's files, \"including advocating to ensure the Law Society of BC uses accurate language in training materials, and does not unduly agitate against its members,\" Rustad said. \"The privilege, and platform, of being a Conservative MLA comes with an expectation and responsibility to do the right thing \u2014 mocking former residential school students giving testimony, including testimony about child sex abuse by pedophiles, is beyond the pale.\u201d Breaking News You Need To Know Sign up for a free account today and start receiving our exclusive newsletters.

Social Sharing Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his Progressive Conservatives cruised to their third straight majority government Thursday, after a snap winter election fought amid the spectre of U.S. tariffs. The win secured\u00a0Ford's place in the annals of the province's political history: it was the first time since 1959 in Ontario that a party leader has won three consecutive majorities. Get all the results from the 2025 Ontario election When Ford triggered the $189-million election he asked\u00a0voters for \"the largest mandate in Ontario's history\"\u00a0to combat continued economic threats\u00a0from U.S. President Donald Trump. On that front, it was a bittersweet night for Ford and his PCs, who are likely to return to Queen's Park with roughly the same number of seats after a campaign his rivals called a cynical and unnecessary\u00a0power play. With two ridings going to automatic recounts because they were within a 25 vote margin, the PCs were on track for 80 seats\u00a0\u2014 just one more than they had when the legislature dissolved in January and three fewer than the party picked up in its 2022 majority win. Nonetheless, Ford struck an optimistic tone in an address to supporters at his election night headquarters in Etobicoke. \"This election, we asked the people for a mandate. A\u00a0 strong mandate that outlives and outlasts the Trump administration. A mandate to do whatever it takes to protect Ontario. Well friends, the people have spoken. They're ready to stand up for Canada,\" Ford continued. \"Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region. Donald Trump doesn't know what we know. He is underestimating us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people, the Canadian spirit,\" he said. WATCH | Ford says he'll take on tariffs: 'We have made history,' says Doug Ford in victory speech 2 months ago Duration 4:28 Speaking to supporters after winning a historic third majority, Doug Ford underscored his commitment to doing \"whatever it takes to protect Ontario\" from the threat of U.S. tariffs. NDP returns as Official Opposition The Ontario NDP secured enough seats to remain as the province's Official Opposition with Leader Marit Stiles at the helm, albeit with a slightly\u00a0reduced caucus at Queen's Park. The New Democrats were likely to win 27 seats, one fewer than they held at dissolution. Public polling throughout the campaign consistently suggested the NDP\u00a0could lose as much as half their caucus or more, so Thursday's outcome was relatively positive for the party. \"The results aren't everything that we hoped for,\" Stiles told supporters in Toronto. \"Our job is to hold this government to account, and that is the job we're going to do, with our usual fight and our determination, but also with love and hope and optimism,\" she added. Stiles also said she would work with Ford in Ontario's response to looming U.S. tariffs. \"I really do want to offer him any possible help that we can provide in the face of the threat of Donald Trump. The threat is real and I deeply believe we can overcome it with a strong Team Ontario and a strong Team Canada approach.\" WATCH | Stiles says she will help fight tariffs: Stiles vows to help Ford in fight against U.S. tariffs 2 months ago Duration 1:48 While acknowledging that supporters \"might be disappointed\" with the Ontario election results, NDP Leader Marit Stiles congratulated Doug Ford on his victory and promised to hold his government to account on key issues like affordability and health care. The New Democrats were able to fend off the PCs in a number of key ridings in the Windsor, London and Niagara areas, as well as in the north. NDP incumbent Jennifer French also kept her seat in Oshawa, the only one of 30 Greater Toronto Area ridings the PCs didn't win in 2022. As of Friday morning, the PCs had only managed to flip two seats from the NDP: Algoma\u2013Manitoulin and Hamilton Mountain. Everything that happened on election night in Ontario Crombie falls in Mississauga, but Ford's rivals rack up wins in Toronto The PCs\u00a0also made a strong push in Haldimand-Norfolk, where Bobbi Ann Brady was running for re-election as an independent, but she resoundingly defeated the party for a second time. Crombie fails to win\u00a0seat Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie was unable to win in Mississauga East\u2013Cooksville, losing to PC Silvia Gualtieri. Crombie was a three-term mayor of Mississauga and former federal Liberal MP. When she was elected to lead the party in December 2023, Crombie vowed to flip every PC seat in Peel Region. The PCs held all five Brampton seats and looked set to win five of six Mississauga ridings. The sixth, Mississauga\u2013Erin Mills, was going to a recount, though the PCs led\u00a0on election night. The Liberals successfully flipped\u00a0five seats elsewhere, three in Toronto, one in the 905 region\u00a0and another\u00a0in the Ottawa area. Four of those gains came from the PCs and one from the New Democrats. They will return to Queen's Park with a caucus of 14, up from the nine seats they previously held. That means the Liberals\u00a0surpassed the benchmark of 12 seats to regain\u00a0official party status for the first time since 2018. Party status\u00a0comes with increased financial resources, debate time and roles at Queen's Park. In a speech to supporters, Crombie was defiant, saying she intends to stay on as the party's leader. \"I know tonight isn't exactly the result we were looking for, but you should be very, very proud of what we did tonight. People counted us out. They said the Ontario Liberal Party was dead. Ha. Tonight, you proved them wrong,\" she said. WATCH | Crombie says she intends to stay on as leader: Crombie reacts to Ontario election loss 2 months ago Duration 3:49 While acknowledging the election results weren't what the party had hoped for, Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie celebrated regaining official\u00a0party status and vowed to hold Ford accountable as premier. The Liberals also managed to increase their provincewide vote share\u00a0to nearly 30 per cent, surpassing the NDP by more than 11 per cent. NDP support, however, was more concentrated in specific ridings.

The two Ontario Green MPPs will do our job to hold your government accountable. We will do it as the unofficial official opposition,\" Schreiner said. \"And I also want to be clear at the same time, we're ready to work across party lines to put people before politics and deliver for the people of Ontario and the people of our communities.\" The Greens were unable to flip Parry Sound\u2013Muskoka, where they poured considerable\u00a0resources trying to unseat PC incumbent Graydon Smith, who will represent the northern riding once again. Voter turnout was a lingering concern given the winter weather, with some regions of the province under weather advisories throughout election day. Elections Ontario projected turnout to be 45.4 per cent, with 99.93 per cent of polls reporting\u00a0as of Friday morning. That's up\u00a0slightly from 2022's 44 per cent, the lowest-ever turnout in Ontario's history. Official voter turnout numbers are expected early next week, Elections Ontario said in an email to CBC Toronto. Ford campaigned on tariff fight Ford's election call came as he was enjoying national attention as one of the faces of Canada's response to the looming shadow of Trump's economic policy. Often sporting a \"Canada is Not for Sale\" hat, Ford campaigned almost singularly on the pitch that he is the only provincial party leader who could navigate four years of economic chaos. The PC election platform included roughly $40 billion in new spending promises, nearly half of it geared toward staving off potentially devastating consequences of tariffs on key industries. Highly unusual for a provincial election race, Ford left the country for two anti-tariff trips to Washington, D.C., during the four-week campaign. And despite declining any one-on-one interviews with media in Ontario, Ford also appeared semi-regularly on American cable news programs. Ford greets workers during a campaign event in Oldcastle, Ont., just outside Windsor, on Feb. 26, 2025. (Dax Melmer\/The Canadian Press) The PCs used the backdrop of economic uncertainty to expand on its strategy of targeting traditionally working class voters and tradespeople. Throughout the contest, Ford kept a relentless focus on the economy and jobs, often pivoting to the subject even when asked about other issues. Ford\u00a0also spent considerable time campaigning in NDP-held ridings, though those efforts fell short of flipping several key seats from the New Democrats. London and area riding results for Ontario's 2025 election Video NDP's Lisa Gretzky wins in Windsor West, spoiling Ford's bid to turn region blue Perhaps the splashiest campaign\u00a0pitch Ford made was a promise\u00a0to build a tunnel under Highway 401. He has not offered up any ballpark cost estimates for such a massive project, and a feasibility study Ford said he ordered last year is not complete, but he said it will get built regardless. Experts have said the mega project\u00a0would\u00a0cost between $60 billion and $100 billion. Ford's opponents argued he cynically used the tariff threat as a pretext for a costly election, in part because the PCs already had a considerable majority and more than a year left in their mandate. Ford first publicly mused about the possibility of an early vote last May, six months before Trump threatened to impose tariffs. The NDP, Liberal and Green leaders also repeatedly alleged Ford was attempting to pre-empt the results of an ongoing criminal investigation by the RCMP into his government's Greenbelt scandal. They also tried, albeit with limited success, to turn the focus of the campaign to Ford's record on issues like health care, housing and education. About 2.5 million Ontarians don't have a family doctor, emergency room wait times are at record highs and hallway health care is a persistent problem. Despite a promise from the PCs during the last election to build 1.5 million new homes by 2031, housing starts in the province have essentially stalled out. Meanwhile, Ontario's school repair backlog is nearly $13 billion. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Lucas Powers Senior Writer Lucas Powers is a Toronto-based reporter and writer.

The list includes Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel and La Nueva Familia Michoacana, and was announced a day after the U.S. government formally designated eight Latin American organized crime groups as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d \u201cThe measures will help keep fentanyl off Canadian streets and from entering the United States,\u201d McGuinty told a news conference. The announcement was Canada\u2019s latest response to U.S. President Donald Trump \u2018s claim that the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigration into the U.S. were behind his threats of imposing a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with the exception of 10% on energy. Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4. U.S. border patrol statistics show that less than 1% of all fentanyl seized is found at the northern border. But Canadian officials have expressed a willingness to do more to combat the deadly synthetic opioid.

The designation effectively freezes a group\u2019s assets and property. \u201cBanks and brokerages will freeze these entities\u2019 assets, which can then be the subject of seizure, restraint or forfeiture,\u201d said McGuinty. It is also an offense to knowingly participate in, or contribute to, any activity of a listed terrorist group. The listing process begins with intelligence reports that indicate whether an organization has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity. McGuinty said listing a group as a terrorist entity follows a rigorous process that \u201cmust meet a legal threshold.\u201d If the public safety minister believes that threshold has been met, the minister may recommend to the federal cabinet that the organization be added to the list. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the RCMP has intelligence indicating that crime cartels operate in Canada. \u201cThere\u2019s also strong intelligence that Canadians have actually moved to Mexico and South America to facilitate the transport of certain commodities into Canada,\u201d Duheme said. Canada recently appointed Kevin Brosseau , a former member of the RCMP and a former national security and intelligence adviser, as its fentanyl czar to help stop drugs entering the U.S. The Canadian government has also announced it is spending $1.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$910 million) on increased border security, including new helicopters, technology and personnel.","question":"Which Latin American criminal organizations did Canada designate as terrorist entities in February 2025?","answer":"Canada designated the Sinaloa Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Carteles Unidos, the C\u00e1rtel del Noreste, the Gulf Cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana Organization, Tren de Aragua, and MS-13 as terrorist organizations.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: In February 2025, Canada designated the Mexican criminal organizations the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel as terrorist entities.","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer only mentions two of the criminal organizations designated as terrorist entities by Canada in February 2025, while the expected answer lists eight.

{"year":"2025","month":"03","event_desc":"Twelve people are injured in a shooting at a bar in Scarborough, Ontario.","text":"Three suspects at large after 12 injured in Toronto pub shooting 8 March 2025 Share Save Mallory Moench BBC News Share Save Getty Images Toronto police said three men had entered the pub and opened fire Three suspects are still at large after 12 people were injured in a shooting at a pub in Toronto, police in the Canadian city say. The shooting took place at 22:39 on Friday local time (03:39 GMT Saturday) near  Scarborough city centre in eastern Toronto. Authorities said six people suffered bullet wounds and others were hurt by flying or broken glass. The injuries were not life-threatening, they said. Toronto police said the three men, armed with an assault rifle and handguns, had entered the pub and \"opened fire indiscriminately\". A motive \"right now remains unclear and we're chasing down all leads\", said Police Supt Paul MacIntyre. \"This was a brazen and reckless act of violence that's really shaken our community and the city itself,\" he added. Police said they were deploying all available resources to find the suspects. Earlier, they said that one suspect, wearing a black balaclava, had been seen fleeing the scene in a silver car. The victims ranged in age from 20s to mid-50, according to police. \"I'm happy to report, by the grace of God, that there have been no fatalities,\" Supt MacIntyre said, which he called \"extremely lucky.\" He said he and other officers were \"horrified\" by video of the shooting. \"These guys just looked at the crowd and opened fire. It was horrible.\" Glass walls were shattered and there was \"blood all over the floor\", including in the basement, where some people ran to hide before police arrived, he said. Mayor Olivia Chow expressed deep concern over the mass shooting, telling reporters on Saturday that she was \"deeply troubled\" by the incident. \"It is troubling because of the magnitude of the shooting and the number of people hurt,\" Mayor Chow said. She said that police have been actively investigating the case throughout the night and into the morning. Ontario Premier Doug Ford also condemned the violence, stating in an X post on Saturday that he fully supports the Toronto Police Service in their search for the suspects. The number of those injured in this incident is high compared to other shootings in the area in 2024. Last year, eight people were injured and two killed in shootings and firearm discharges in the police division where Friday's incident occurred, the department's data shows. In Toronto, which has a three million population, 43 people were killed in shootings last year. Canada has a lower rate of firearm homicides than its neighbour the US, with 0.6 per 100,000 people compared to 4.5 per 100,000, according to 2021 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The reversal came six hours after Trump announced his plan to double import duties on the Canadian metals in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday afternoon that he was pausing that surcharge following discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Navarro was asked on CNBC's \" Closing Bell: Overtime \" if the developments meant that \"we're not going to see 50% tariffs come tomorrow.\" Navarro replied, \"Correct.\" Lutnick \"did a beautiful job negotiating that,\" he said. Ford's threat to add a surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota came in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. The premier earlier in the day had vowed to keep his countermeasures on the U.S. in place, warning, \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.\" But he and Lutnick had a \"productive conversation\" later in the day, and they agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss a \"renewed\" trilateral trade agreement, according to a joint statement from the two men. Trump's new trade threats The moves marked the latest twists in an escalating and increasingly unpredictable trade war between the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday morning, Trump threw gas on the smoldering conflict with a Truth Social post announcing the new tariffs, while also repeating his calls for Canada to be absorbed into the U.S. as the \"Fifty First State.\" Trump said he was imposing the latest tariffs in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. That move by Ford was itself issued in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. \"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on \"Electricity\" coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. \"This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,\" he wrote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losses after Trump's announcement, falling more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. Markets were already reeling from the impact of Trump's tariffs and broader fears of a recession. Minutes after Trump's announcement, Ford said he would keep his countermeasure on U.S. energy in place. \"We will not back down. We will be relentless,\" Ford said on MSNBC. \"I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs, and it's unacceptable.\" In an interview on CNBC's \" Money Movers \" later Tuesday morning, Ford said he would be willing to shut off his province's energy supply to the U.S. if Trump \"continues to hurt Canadian families.\" \"I won't hesitate to do that,\" Ford said, adding, \"that's the last thing I want to do.\" Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in early February, before delaying them for one month and then reimposing them \u2014 and then partially delaying them again.

No one else.\" A senior administration official told CNBC at the time that Trump had not signed the formal paperwork to raise tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum, but that the order was \"in the works.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity\u00a0to discuss the president's thinking, said Trump's escalation was intended to \"lay down the gauntlet\" in response to Ford's action. watch now VIDEO 2:22 02:22 Trump raises Canadian steel, aluminum tariffs to 50% in retaliation for Ontario energy duties Squawk on the Street Separately in the Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump demanded that Canada \"immediately drop\" an \"Anti-American Farmer Tariff\" on certain U.S. dairy products. He also warned that he \"will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.\" \"This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,\" Trump wrote. The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war .

(Sean Kilpatrick\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Liberals will choose their next leader \u2014 and Canada's next prime minister \u2014 on March 9, the party said in a media\u00a0release on Thursday night. After a frenzy of formal and informal meetings this week following Justin Trudeau's decision to step down as prime minister, the Liberal Party's national council decided on the date Thursday night. The party is also setting the entry fee for potential candidates at $350,000\u00a0\u2014 a significant jump from the $75,000 fee set by the party for the previous leadership race. Candidates will have to declare their intention to run and pay the entry fee by Jan. 23. People can register with the party to vote in the leadership\u00a0race up until Jan. 27. Changes to who can vote The party is limiting who can vote to Canadian citizens and permanent residents. As the Liberals did during their last leadership race in 2013, they're allowing people 14 years of age or older to vote. Unlike general elections where the voting age is 18, parties can set their own age restrictions. The Conservatives allowed people 16 years or older to vote during their last leadership contest in 2022. Previously, non-Canadian residents were allowed to vote in Liberal Party riding nomination and leadership contests, which have been called a \"gateway\" for foreign interference . A growing contingent of Liberal MPs have urged the party executive to heed those warnings.

All of them were dual citizens and their identities have been withheld, Canada's foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canada urged Ottawa to \"stop making irresponsible remarks\", as pundits feared a further downturn in relations between the countries after years of strain. China's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had acted \"in accordance with the law\", while the embassy said there was \"solid and sufficient\" evidence for their crimes. Beijing had \"fully guaranteed the rights and interests of the Canadian nationals concerned\", the embassy said, urging Canada to respect \"China's judicial sovereignty\". China does not recognise dual citizenship and takes a tough stance on drug crimes. However, it's rare for the death penalty to be carried out on foreigners. Joly said she had been following the cases \"very closely\" for months and had tried with other officials, including former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to stop the executions. In a statement to Canadian media, Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said Canada had \"repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere\". China imposes the death penalty on serious crimes including those related to drugs, corruption and espionage. While the number of executions are kept secret, human rights groups believe China has one of the highest execution rates in the world. \"These shocking and inhumane executions of Canadian citizens by Chinese authorities should be a wake-up call for Canada,\" said Ketty Nivyabandi, from Amnesty International Canada. \"We are devastated for the families of the victims, and we hold them in our hearts as they try to process the unimaginable. \"Our thoughts also go to the loved ones of Canadian citizens whom China is holding on death row or whose whereabouts in the Chinese prison system are unknown.\" In 2019, Canadian national Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was sentenced to death in China for drug smuggling, in a high-profile case condemned by the Canadian government. He was not among the Canadians who were executed. \"We'll continue to not only strongly condemn but also ask for leniency for other Canadians that are facing similar situations,\" Joly said on Wednesday. Relations between Canada and China have been icy since 2018, after Canada detained a Chinese telecom executive, Meng Wanzhou, on a US extradition request. China arrested two Canadians shortly afterwards, both of whom have now been released. In 2023, Canadian media released reports, many based on leaked intelligence, about detailed claims of Chinese meddling in the country's federal elections. China denied the reports, calling them \"baseless and defamatory\".

Carney, 59, takes on the role as Canada is locked in a potentially catastrophic trade war with the US , long its closest ally and largest trading partner. Last week Donald Trump announced a 25% tax on all Canadian goods, with a carveout for the automotive and energy sectors. The tariffs have the power to push Canada\u2019s fragile economy in a recession. \u201cAmerica is not Canada . And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,\u201d Carney told supporters, laying bare the existential crisis that has outraged Canadians, riven the longstanding relationship with the US, and promises to be the overarching theme in his tenure as prime minister. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\u201d Carney said. \u201cSo the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win.\u201d Before the announcement, the outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau , electrified the crowd by telling Liberals he was \u201cdamn proud\u201d of his government\u2019s legacy. View image in fullscreen Before the announcement, Trudeau said he was \u2018damn proud\u2019 of his government\u2019s legacy. Photograph: Blair Gable\/Reuters But he warned of dangerous time for the country. \u201cThis is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,\u201d he told supporters. He also drew on the \u201celbows up\u201d rallying cry to intense applause \u2013 a phrase from ice hockey legend Gordie Howe popularised in recent weeks after threats from Trump to annex Canada. It is unclear when Carney, who was governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, will assume office. Trudeau and the new Liberal leader are expected to hold conversations in the coming days to determine the outgoing prime minister\u2019s final day in office. With 85.9% of the vote, Carney beat the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the former government house leader Karina Gould and the former member of parliament Frank Baylis. Carney has followed an unusual path to power : he will be only the second Canadian prime minister with no concrete links to parliament at the time of his appointment, including no seat in the House of Commons. While no rule bars this, convention suggests Carney will need to quickly announce plans to run for a federal seat. He will also be the first Liberal prime minister from western Canada, a valuable identity in a country that is politically divided along geographical lines. Carney spent much of his campaign pitching himself as an outsider, despite years-long ties to the Liberal party, including serving as an economic adviser to Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister. His definitive victory, foreshadowed by fundraising success and a spate of key endorsements from senior cabinet members with vast organising networks, could energise the incumbent Liberals. In recent weeks, the party has reversed its political freefall, sharply rebounding to such a degree that a previously expected Conservative majority in the next general election looks increasingly unlikely. Polls The shift in the polls has been so dramatic that pollsters have struggled to find any historical precedent. In a leaked memo, the leftwing federal New Democratic party recently warned its members Carney would probably call a snap election within days of winning the leadership race, capitalising on his rising popularity and depriving the opposition parties the rich political optics of bringing down the Liberal government through a vote of non-confidence to force an election. The move in the polls is, in part, explained by repeated threats by Trump to annex Canada. In polling, Carney is widely viewed as the most trusted federal leader to navigate the current trade crisis because of his extensive economic background. \u201cMy government will keep the tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,\u201d said Carney. Carney also attacked the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, the current frontrunner if an election were held soon, calling him a \u201ccareer politician\u201d who was running a deeply divisive campaign. \u201cDivision doesn\u2019t win in a tariff war,\u201d Carney said. Canada\u2019s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chance Read more But in recent weeks, several fumbles have underlined the challenges in moving from the corporate world to politics. Carney has waffled over his role at the investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, when it moved its headquarters from Toronto to New York \u2013 a politically sensitive issue given recent pressure from the US on businesses to uproot and move south. His attempts to clarify the issue prompted the Globe and Mail\u2019s editorial board to praise him as a \u201cfast learner in the art of prevarication and hairsplitting\u201d. He has promised to put his substantial assets, believed to be valued at more than C$30m (\u00a316m), into a blind trust immediately. Speaking before the new leader was announced, former prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien said Trump had united Canadians \u201clike never before\u201d and jokingly called on him to receive the country\u2019s highest honours as thanks. \u201cFrom one old guy to another old guy. Stop this nonsense. Canada will never join the United States,\u201d he said to raucous cheers. \u201cNo one will starve us into submission because Canada is and will remain the best country in the world. Vive le Canada!\u201d This article was amended on 10 March 2025. An earlier version said Mark Carney will be only the second prime minister in Canadian history without a seat in the House of Commons. A handful of others have been appointed in such circumstances, but Carney will be only the second with no formal ties to parliament, including a Commons seat, at the time of their appointment.

Tamara Lich and Chris Barber were key figures and organizers in the massive protest that saw hundreds of vehicles and thousands of people occupy downtown Ottawa and insist they would stay until COVID-19 public health mandates were eliminated. The February 2022 protests, dubbed the Freedom Convoy, were sparked by a Canadian government vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government. In finding the two guilty of mischief, Ontario Court Justice Heather Perkins-McVey said the evidence shows that the two routinely encouraged people to join or remain at the protest, despite knowing the adverse effect it was having on downtown residents and businesses.

Perkins-McVey found Lich and Barber not guilty of intimidation, counselling someone to commit intimidation, obstructing police and counselling someone to obstruct police. Barber also was found guilty of counselling to disobey a court order for telling people to ignore an injunction issued by a judge directing convoy participants to stop honking their truck horns in downtown Ottawa. The truckers\u2019 convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant honking of horns and music from parties. Truckers also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest. Trudeau\u2019s government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada.

Iain Rankin is elected on second ballot.","text":"Nova Scotia Iain Rankin will be next premier of Nova Scotia Iain Rankin will be the next premier of Nova Scotia. Rankin was elected following a vote by Nova Scotia Liberal Party delegates, with the results announced Saturday night during a virtual convention. Rankin tops fellow former cabinet ministers Labi Kousoulis and Randy Delorey Michael Gorman \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Feb 06, 2021 4:25 PM EST | Last Updated: February 7, 2021 Iain Rankin addresses supporters after winning the leadership of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party at a virtual convention in Halifax on Saturday. (The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Iain Rankin will be the next premier of Nova Scotia. Rankin was elected following a vote by Nova Scotia Liberal Party delegates, with the results announced Saturday night during a virtual convention. He defeated fellow former cabinet ministers Randy Delorey and\u00a0Labi Kousoulis. Delorey was dropped following the first ballot after earning the fewest points. About 97 per cent of the 8,100 delegates cast a ranked ballot. \"It's a monumental task and I'm up for it,\" Rankin told reporters. He instantly becomes leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party and is now premier-designate. Stephen McNeil remains premier of the province until Rankin and his cabinet are sworn in, likely in a few weeks, although Rankin could not say for sure when he expected an event to take place. Plans for a greener economy At 37, Rankin was the youngest of the three candidates\u00a0and he positioned himself as a candidate for generational change. Much of his policy was\u00a0framed around the environment, with Rankin pledging to form an economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic rooted in green policies. He believes that resonated with voters. \"Obviously, younger people want to see action on a number of files that I spoke to, but the Liberal Party has always been a pragmatic party and one that really valued social progress,\" he said. Rankin said that won't come at the expense of good fiscal management; now, he said, it will\u00a0be done through a green lens. Rankin has pledged to get the province off coal and increase the use of renewable energy sooner than commitments established by McNeil's government, and make Nova Scotia the first province in the country to be net carbon neutral. He has\u00a0also promised to implement the recommendations of the Lahey Report on\u00a0forestry practices, which would see a drastic reduction in clear-cutting. A premier for everyone He dismissed suggestions that he was particularly different than McNeil, whom he said\u00a0\"has shown more political courage than any\u00a0premier in our history.\" Instead, Rankin\u00a0said his plans are simply an evolution of things McNeil started and reflect things people want now, including confronting systemic racism. \"[People]\u00a0want to see action on climate change. They want to see us continuing down the path of\u00a0righting historic wrongs,\" Rankin said.\u00a0\"[McNeil] believes in those things, too, and I'm just proposing that we start taking those steps forward together and the party, I think, by and large, wants to see action in those areas.\" Rankin, left, accompanied by his wife, Mary, addresses supporters after winning the leadership of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party at a virtual convention in Halifax on Saturday. (The Canadian Press) During his acceptance speech, Rankin acknowledged it was Liberal delegates who put him in the position to become the next premier and he pledged to be a voice for everyone. \"Whether you're a union member or a business owner, whether you live in downtown Halifax or in a rural community, whether you work in an office or on the land or on the sea, or you are a student or are retired, I'll be calling on your skills, your experience and your expertise to guide our decisions,\" he said. Next steps Rankin inherits a province with a low\u00a0COVID-19 case rate but a massive deficit as a result of the pandemic. With mass vaccinations not expected before the fall and the province's vital tourism sector already bracing for another down year, Rankin has acknowledged that efforts to tackle the deficit must take a backseat to keeping as many small businesses above water as possible. He said his top\u00a0priority would be meeting with Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang to discuss the province's pandemic response. Rankin pledged to follow McNeil's example of allowing the advice of Public Health, not politics, to take precedence in making decisions. He also plans to speak with Kousoulis and Delorey\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0to discuss what role each will take in his cabinet, as well as opposition leaders to see what areas of common ground there are ahead of the spring sitting of the legislature. Between then and now, a budget and throne\u00a0speech also have to be finalized. McNeil says goodbye Rankin declined to discuss his transition plans, but said more news on that would be coming soon. Bringing Kousoulis onside will be particularly important as the party works to achieve a unified front ahead of the next provincial election. On the second ballot, Rankin received 52.4 per cent of the points to Kousoulis's 47.6 per cent. Saturday's event also included a tribute video to McNeil's time as leader of the party and premier. He announced last summer that he would be stepping down and not re-offering in the next election. During his own address to the convention, McNeil talked about the importance of party members coming together quickly following the result and said the next 48 hours would be crucial. \"We've never been in a better position to grow, to take off, to launch,\" McNeil said.

The report, which was to be released early next week, painted a damning picture of Julie Payette\u2019s leadership and had raised concerns among senior government figures over her ability to continue in the vice-regal role. Picked by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau , in 2017, Payette, 57, is the representative of Queen Elizabeth II as head of state \u2013 a largely ceremonial position. Until Thursday, however, no governor general in Canada had ever been forced to resign. Payette\u2019s unprecedented departure from the job follows previous allegations that she bullied staff at her official residence at Rideau Hall and on foreign trips. \u201cTensions have arisen at Rideau Hall over the past few months and for that, I am sorry,\u201d Payette said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cFor the good of the country and of our democratic institutions, I have come to the conclusion that a new governorgeneral should be appointed. Canadians deserve stability in these uncertain times.\u201d Last July, a number of anonymous staff told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation they were berated by Payette to the point of tears. Others said that she would call their work \u201cshit\u201d and order them out of her office. Trudeau accused of attempting to cover up scandal by proroguing parliament Read more Weeks later, the privy council office, which manages Canada\u2019s federal bureaucracy and reports to the prime minister, opened an investigation, hiring an independent consulting firm. \u201cHarassment has no place in any professional workplace,\u201d a spokesperson for the privy council office said in a statement at the time. \u201cIt is a public service priority to advance efforts to more effectively prevent and resolve issues of harassment.\u201d Payette, a former astronaut and scientist, also faced criticism after hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent renovating Rideau Hall, including installing a private staircase to ensure the governor general\u2019s privacy. Acknowledging growing controversy, Trudeau defended Payette in September and dismissed speculation that he would ask her to step down. \u201cWe have an excellent governor general right now and I think, on top of the Covid crisis, nobody\u2019s looking at any constitutional crises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have put in place a process to review some of the working conditions at Rideau Hall, but that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re contemplating right now, going further than that.\u201d As part of its report, the firm spoke with dozens of current and former employees. The report was recently completed and sent to the privy council. Payette\u2019s top staffer and close friend Assunta Di Lorenzo has also resigned following allegations that she, too, harassed employees. Citing the \u201cproblems\u201d with Trudeau\u2019s selection of Payette \u2013 and the political realities of a minority parliament \u2013 opposition leader, Erin O\u2019Toole, called on Trudeau to meet with party leaders to discuss selecting the next governor general. \u201cIn the case of Ms Payette, there was clearly no due diligence. The prime minister didn\u2019t determine if she was really appropriate for the job \u2013 and the result was a disaster,\u201d said Dr Michael Jackson, president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s been very disappointing \u2026 I would urge the prime minister to take a sober second thought. There\u2019s no need to rush.\u201d Even with speculation of an upcoming election \u2013 which requires the governor general to dissolve parliament \u2013 acting governor general Richard Wagner, chief justice of Canada\u2019s supreme court, has the same powers. While the events have left Ottawa reeling, Jackson is hopeful Payette\u2019s resignation will help Canadians better understand the role. \u201cWe often take it for granted, especially because we\u2019ve had a string of good governor generals,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cBut like democracy, it\u2019s fragile.

Liberals flirt with majority territory as spring election rumours swirl The shuffle also comes amid questions over the possibility of a spring election.

According to new polling done by Ipsos exclusively for Global News, the Liberal handling of the pandemic so far has them flirting with \u2014 but not yet firmly within \u2014 possible majority territory. That comes as Conservative support drops, particularly in the key electoral background of Ontario. The Ipsos numbers have the Liberals at 36 per cent support among decided voters nationally \u2014 up from 35 per cent in December \u2014 and the Conservatives dropping to 29 per cent support.

(Andrew Vaughan\/Canadian Press) Social Sharing Conservative delegates at the party's policy convention have voted to reject adding green-friendly statements to the policy book \u2014 including a line that would have stated the party believes\u00a0\"climate change is real\" and is \"willing to act.\" The Portneuf\u2014Jacques\u2014Cartier riding in Quebec, which proposed the policy change, also asked delegates to recognize that \"Canadian businesses classified as highly polluting need to take more responsibility\" and \"reduce their GHG emissions.\" The policy proposal\u00a0also included a call to support \"innovation in green technologies\" so that Canada can become \"a world-class leader\" in an emerging industry. Delegates issued a rebuke to climate-minded Conservatives and\u00a0rejected the policy shift\u00a0by a margin of 54 per cent to 46. In fact, it was one of only four policy proposals or modifications on a list of 50 pitched by electoral riding associations (EDAs)\u00a0that were voted down\u00a0by the delegates. While delegates from each of the Atlantic provinces\u00a0and Quebec embraced the \"climate change is real\" proposal \u2014 70 per cent of delegates from New Brunswick and Quebec were onside with it\u00a0\u2014 those from every other province and the territories voted against the change. In B.C., the \"no\" side had just a two-point edge, while the vote was much more lopsided in Saskatchewan (73 per cent against), the territories (69 per cent opposed), Alberta (62 per cent opposed) and Ontario (58 per cent opposed). A double majority of delegates \u2014 a majority of delegates overall and the majority of delegates in the majority of provinces \u2014 must agree to an official policy change. The clear rejection came hours after Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole urged party members to embrace change or risk losing again to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals in the next election. O'Toole said\u0000\u00a0if party members are\u00a0serious about winning, they must embrace new ideas \u2014\u00a0even if they\u00a0go\u00a0against\u00a0party orthodoxy. O'Toole told delegates the party \"cannot ignore the reality of climate change\" and that the debate \"is over.\" \"We must also recognize that Canadians expect us to have a real plan for the environment. We need to boldly reclaim the environment as an area where Conservatives are leaders,\" he said. O'Toole also said he doesn't want Conservative candidates to be branded as \"climate change deniers\" in the next election campaign.

During a question-and-answer session with delegates today, O'Toole was asked about members\u00a0rejecting calls for a more forceful approach to climate action. One delegate, Moshe Appel, said the failure to adopt the policy proposal\u00a0could hurt the party's standing with voters. O'Toole said he won't\u00a0be dissuaded\u00a0from addressing the problem of climate change. \"Climate change is real. We will have a serious and comprehensive plan,\" he said. \"It's important to me as a father of young children, as a member of Parliament. Fighting climate change is important to the Conservative Party.\" O'Toole did, however, vow to scrap the national carbon tax \u2014 he said\u00a0it's \"unfair for working families\" \u2014 while promising to make \"big emitters\" pay. The party's national campaign manager, Fred DeLorey, also tweeted that, despite the vote, \"the debate is over and we need a real plan that works, not Trudeau's carbon tax.\" While delegates rejected the \"climate change is real\" proposal, the \"policy document already has a section on climate change,\" DeLorey said. \"Akin to us needing to say 'water is wet.'\" (The policy book does state that \"in order to have a strong economy and maintain good health, Canada must have strong, coordinated and achievable environmental policies.\") Speaking to CBC News, Appel, a resident of Vancouver Island, said that while he's happy to hear O'Toole say he's serious about the environment,\u00a0he's \"very frustrated\" and \"very disappointed\" with other members who wouldn't endorse a \"coherent policy.\" While he supports\u00a0Canada's \"ethical oil\" and some natural resource\u00a0development, Appel said he thinks the world must embrace the Paris climate accord and drive down emissions to avoid\u00a0catastrophic consequences. \"People don't want to hear these conspiracy theories. They don't want to hear these problems with proven science, which is what climate change is,\" he said. \"It's definitely something we have to address.\" During the Q&A, O'Toole\u00a0also faced a number of questions from delegates about how a government led by him would revitalize the oil and gas sector, which has been hurt by low commodity prices and constrained pipeline capacity for the last half-decade.

Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said the Liberal government has \"mocked\" Western Canadians and passed divisive environmental legislation. (Jeff McIntosh\/The Canadian Press) \"Our resource economy is the best in the world. We should be supporting it and exporting,\" he said. \"We need to get our resources to market.\" He said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00a0has \"mocked\" resource workers while passing environmental legislation that has fuelled Western Canadian alienation. 'Buzzwords' There was a fierce debate over the proposed\u00a0green policy shift during the policy convention\u00a0Friday, with a clear split in the party ranks over how far the Conservatives should go. Some delegates\u00a0embraced a shift in posture, saying\u00a0they want\u00a0Canada to adopt green\u00a0technology while still supporting extractive industries like the oil and gas sector. Others called the proposal an unnecessary gesture\u00a0to appease climate\u00a0activists. \"I'm not sure why it's necessary for the Conservative Party to declare climate change is real,\" one delegate from Scarborough-Centre said. \"The way this section is worded befuddles the issue and may cost us some support. Conservatives need to lead with clarity, focus and intelligent solutions, not buzzwords.\" Conservatives\u00a0debate\u00a0whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention Another delegate, from Perth\u2014Wellington in Ontario, said environmental policy should not be focused on driving down greenhouse gas emissions. \"It's not the only pollutant that we have to worry about,\" he said. \"I'm opposed to this amendment because\u00a0it unfairly centres on greenhouse gas emissions.\" Justin Jones, a resident\u00a0of northeastern B.C.\u00a0who also spoke in favour of the resolution during the debate, said many in the party are concerned about climate change \u2014 and this vote will only solidify the impression\u00a0that all Conservatives are climate skeptics. \"I think one of the biggest misconceptions out there is that the Conservatives don't care about the environment. I'm 30 years old, I have kids, I want the world to continue to be prosperous and the environment to not be affected,\" he told\u00a0CBC News \u2014\u00a0adding he supports Canadian oil and gas projects,\u00a0which he said adhere to high environmental standards. \"I think the wording in that policy addition just caused a big misunderstanding. It wasn't the greatest.\u00a0It's already evident that the party does recognize climate change.\" But he conceded the resolution vote may haunt\u00a0O'Toole as he tries to shift the Conservative message on climate change. \"I believe it's going to be a real issue any time Erin is going to speak in support of protecting our environment,\" Jones said. \"He's got a battle ahead of him because, maybe, some misinterpreted or the words were taken out of context. The media focuses on the issues we're divided on.\" Delegates also reject medical assistance in dying Delegates also rejected a modification to the policy book that would have changed the party's stance on medical assistance in dying \u2014 swapping\u00a0the statement that the party would not support any legislation\u00a0that would \"legalize euthanasia or assisted suicide\" for one that says it\u00a0would oppose \"the extension of euthanasia and assisted suicide\" to minors and people living with \"psychological suffering.\" By a 55-45\u00a0vote, delegates voted to keep the status quo. This policy modification may have been rejected because delegates also voted for a similarly\u00a0worded resolution that reaffirms the party \"opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide\" and will stand against any expansions of the current law. The federal government recently extended access to medical assistance in dying with Bill C-7 . Delegates also voted down proposals that would have scrubbed a Conservative policy position backing a national missing persons' registry. They also voted to maintain their stance on section\u00a013 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Erin O'Toole says Conservatives must change or risk losing again to Trudeau That section \u2014 which is\u00a0no longer in force, having been\u00a0repealed by a Conservative private member's bill in 2014 \u2014\u00a0prohibited online communications which were \"likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt\" on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, such as race, national or ethic origin, colour or religion. Complainants could bring their cases to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. This section of the act was loathed by free speech advocates, who said it went too far in policing online content. Walied Soliman \u2014\u00a0O'Toole's\u00a0fundraising\u00a0director\u00a0in the leadership race and\u00a0chair of Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the country's largest law firms\u00a0\u2014 said Saturday the party needs to grow its base and \"speak to more Canadians\" if it wants to win the next election. He said the membership needs to hear O'Toole's call for renewal. Soliman said the party can only win if it recaptures crucial battleground ridings like those in the suburbs around Toronto \u2014 and O'Toole's call for a policy shift will help in that effort. \"That doesn't mean we dilute who we are \u2014 we should never do that,\"\u00a0he said. \"Our membership has to listen to Erin's speech over and over again and realize we have to grow this tent.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR John Paul Tasker Senior reporter J.P.

(Nationalist.ca) Social Sharing The RCMP have charged the leader of the Canadian Nationalist Party after he posted\u00a0an allegedly anti-Semitic video on YouTube. Travis Patron, 29, of Redvers, Sask., has been charged with wilful promotion of hate in connection with\u00a0a video titled Beware the Parasitic Tribe. The video refers\u00a0to \"inside manipulators\" who infiltrate the media and the central bank. The RCMP began investigating after the video was flagged by the Canadian Anti-Hate Network in June 2019. Since then, police have received four additional reports of new videos and flyers issued by Patron. Police are still investigating those reports. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center had raised alarms about Patron's videos, stating that the language he\u00a0was using was dangerous and hateful. \"He's promoting some of the most vile and dangerous anti-Semitic tropes in history,\" said Jaime Kirzner-Roberts, director of policy with the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center. Kirzner-Roberts said Patron \"refers to Jews as parasites. He accuses Jews of being invaders, of controlling the media, the\u00a0banking system.\" Human rights group files hate-speech complaint against Canadian Nationalist Party leader Canadian Nationalist Party Leader Travis Patron charged after 2 women attacked in Regina \"He has called for the removal of Jews from Canada. This is ethnic cleansing he is calling for, it's a crime against humanity,\" she\u00a0said. \"We are pleased the RCMP have finally decided to lay charges against Mr. Patron.\" Kirzner-Roberts said she hopes the charges will send a message. \"If you promote hatred or genocide against Jews or any other people in our country, you will face justice.\" She said\u00a0there is \"unparalleled growth of anti-Semitic\u00a0hate online\" and that\u00a0there is evidence of \"escalating numbers of hate crimes being committed\u00a0against the Jewish community.\" Patron appears in court via phone Patron was arrested by the RCMP on Monday and made his first court appearance on Tuesday via telephone at the provincial court in Weyburn, Sask. He appeared in a Regina court on Wednesday afternoon, also via telephone. His next court appearance will be on April 14 in the town of Carlyle, Sask. Patron posed a question to Provincial Court Judge James Rybchuk on Wednesday. \"I am respectfully asking if charges have been formally laid and if so under what authority. Your administration does not have the authority to proceed on these matters,\" Patron told the court. \"I feel otherwise,\" Rybchuk said. Evan Balgord is executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, which filed the complaint against Patron in 2019. He says the charges should have been laid sooner. Taking '601 days to lay charges for this offence ... is far too many,' he says. (Skype) The executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, Evan Balgord, said the charges should have come sooner. Taking \"601 days to lay charges for this offence ... is far too many,\" he said. \"We have rang the bell at every level. It is past time he's charged.\" Balgord's group filed the criminal complaint against Patron. He alleged that\u00a0since then, Patron has continued to promote hate. \"It's about time he's rotting in a jail cell.\" Criminal charges don't affect party's status Patron founded the Canadian Nationalist Party in\u00a02017, and it became an officially registered party in 2019. A spokesperson for Elections Canada said a party's status is not affected if its leader is charged or convicted of a crime. However, a person who is incarcerated cannot run for office. Balgord called it the first \"Neo-Nazi party\" in Canada since the 1930s and said being a registered\u00a0party gives Patron access to donations and voter information. \"It means that, in part, federal public funds were going to support his party as part of a contribution rebate program. It also means Elections Canada handed him a copy of the voters' list, which means Travis Patron had access to\u00a0the name, address and date of birth of every Canadian.\" The president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) commended the RCMP for \"responding to Travis Patron's use of social media to promote hate against Jewish Canadians.\" Far-right group accused of white nationalism closer to party status \u2014 and increased scrutiny \"Patron's lengthy rant about 'swindlers,'\u00a0'snakes'\u00a0and 'inside manipulators'\u00a0\u2014 as well as a subsequent reference to Jews and 'the synagogue of Satan'\u00a0\u2014 make his anti-Semitic agenda crystal clear,\" Shimon Koffler\u00a0Fogel said. Fogel said the CIJA and others reached out to Saskatchewan's justice minister last July \"urging him\" to provide the required consent for Patron's prosecution. Meanwhile, Patron is facing a separate charge of assault causing bodily harm . He is scheduled to\u00a0appear in court in Regina next month. And on Feb.\u00a09, Patron lost an appeal against the City of Saskatoon. He\u00a0argued that he should be able to represent the Canadian Nationalist Party in court. The party now owes the city $1,500. Corrections A previous version of this story said the Canadian Nationalist Party had official party status in Canada. It does not.

(Canadian Press\/Sean Kilpatrick) Social Sharing Canada's national statistics agency says it's ready to conduct the 2021 census next month despite concerns about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the coming months. Census director general Geoff Bowlby\u00a0told\u00a0CBC News\u00a0the fact that several provinces are tightening public health restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 case numbers\u00a0won't change Statistics Canada's approach. \"We planned for this reality. We planned right from the start to operate within the confines of a pandemic ...\u00a0before vaccinations were widespread and before the pandemic has turned the corner,\" said Bowlby. \"That's why we have the safe protocols in place \u2014\u00a0no visits inside the house, masks, limiting the number of visits at the door by making greater use of the internet, by making greater use of ... telephone calls.\" The agency says it has a plan in place for a \"contactless\" census to protect the health and safety of both census staff and those participating. All staff collecting\u00a0census information\u00a0in\u00a0person are expected to follow\u00a0the relevant public health guidance by observing\u00a0physical distancing, staying outdoors and using\u00a0personal protective equipment. Census Day is May 11 Starting May 3, Canadians\u00a0will receive documents in the mail from Statistics Canada\u00a0containing instructions on how to fill out the long-form and short-form questionnaires. The agency said it expects nine out of 10 households to complete the census online or by phone \u2014\u00a0the same percentage\u00a0as in 2016. The remaining 10 per cent will be contacted by phone first to remind them to fill out the forms. Those who fail to complete the survey after being contacted by phone might\u00a0receive an in-person visit from a census enumerator beginning in late May or June. That\u00a0enumerator will be under\u00a0strict instructions to wear a mask, stay two metres distant\u00a0and only conduct interviews outside. \"Our health and safety folks working with public health authorities say that that is still the safe way to go,\" said Bowlby. The census collects demographic information on the Canadian population. The data are\u00a0then used by governments, businesses, associations, community organizations and others for research and to make evidence-based decisions at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. Census day is May 11 this year. A winter ice road in 2015 near Shoal Lake, Manitoba.

Concerns about low response rate Bowlby said he worries the unique circumstances of the pandemic might lead to a low response rate.\u00a0He said the goal is to match the 2016 response\u00a0rate of 98.3 per cent, and that anything less than 98 per cent could compromise the quality of the data. \"We have ways to make up for that as we process the data \u2026 But there's a limit to those techniques and we need to make sure that those data are high quality,\" said Bowlby. \"The census data are so important to be used for important financial transfers between the federal government and the provincial and territorial governments.

It also includes new questions aimed at learning how people commute to work using public transportation and why Canadians work part-time or seasonally. Bowlby said some of the data collected this year\u00a0will give an indication of how the pandemic has reshaped society and transformed individual behaviour. \"All of this information will really provide a really rich portrait of Canada when we release it in February of 2022, when the first estimates of the census come out,\" said Bowlby. \"There's going to be more data available for Canadians than ever before.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices \u00b7 About CBC News Corrections and clarifications \u00b7 Submit a news tip \u00b7 Report error Related Stories StatsCan plans 'contactless' census for 2021 in response to COVID-19 StatsCan undertakes hiring spree ahead of 'contact-free' census Statistics Canada celebrates 'best census since 1666' Statistics Canada loses, mishandles hundreds of sensitive census, employment files StatsCan planning to ask gender questions in 'pilot' census \u2014 and answering is mandatory Add some \u201cgood\u201d to your morning and evening.

There is mounting evidence that the third wave of COVID-19 incidence is declining, yet variants of concern (VOCs) continue to present public health challenges in Canada. The emergence of VOCs has sparked debate on how to effectively control their impacts on the Canadian population. Provincial and territorial governments have implemented a wide range of policy measures to protect residents against community transmission of COVID-19, but research examining the specific impact of policy countermeasures on the VOCs in Canada is needed. Our study objective was to identify provinces with disproportionate prevalence of VOCs relative to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in provinces and territories in Canada. We analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors, summarized in 3 measures: (1) strength of public health countermeasures (stringency index), (2) the extent to which people moved about outside their homes (mobility index), and (3) the proportion of the provincial or territorial population that was fully vaccinated (vaccine uptake). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index, and full vaccine uptake. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the prevalence of VOCs (Alpha, or B.1.1.7; Beta, or B.1.351; Gamma, or P.1; and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) across the clusters. We identified 3 clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures. Cluster 1 consisted of the 3 Canadian territories and was characterized by a higher degree of vaccine deployment and fewer countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and the Atlantic region) was typified by lower levels of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster, which consisted of provinces in the Pacific region, Central Canada, and the Prairies, exhibited moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures. The overall and variant-specific prevalences were significantly different across the clusters. This \u201cup to the point\u201d analysis found that implementation of COVID-19 public health measures, including the mass vaccination of populations, is key to controlling VOC prevalence rates in Canada. As of June 15, 2021, the third wave of COVID-19 in Canada is declining, and those provinces and territories that had implemented more comprehensive public health measures showed lower VOC prevalence. Public health authorities and governments need to continue to communicate the importance of sociobehavioural preventive measures, even as populations in Canada continue to receive their primary and booster doses of vaccines. Keywords: COVID-19, variants of concern, stringency index, mobility index, vaccination coverage, machine learning, Canada The devastating impacts of COVID-19 cannot be overemphasized. With an estimated 423 million cases and 6 million deaths (as of February 21, 2022) worldwide [ 1 ], the pandemic is one of the worst in human history. In Canada alone, about 3.2 million people, representing 8.4% of residents, have been infected with COVID-19 [ 2 ]. Canada\u2019s case fatality rate for COVID-19 is 1.1% (ie, 36,000 deaths) [ 2 ]. At the time our analyses were performed (June 15, 2021, when the third wave was waning), there were 3 forces in \u201ctension\u201d: vaccine uptake, newly emerging variants of COVID-19, and calls to \u201cre-open the economy.\u201d Since then, the emergence and spread of additional variants of concern (VOCs) and the expansion of vaccination campaigns have changed the complexion of the pandemic. Variants, as expected, have added complexity to the nature of COVID-19. At the same time, following a slow start to vaccination rollouts, vaccine uptake has been increasing in Canada, and many provinces and territories, who are largely responsible for vaccination and public health policy in Canada\u2019s decentralized federation, have become eager to relax public health countermeasures. However, public health experts remain uneasy about variant-led surges and outbreaks and are calling for the reapplication of some measures. As of February 21, 2022, 5 phylogenetic VOCs declared by the World Health Organization are being tracked in Canada. The Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants, first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, India, and South Africa, respectively, are spreading in Canada and the rest of the world [ 3 ]. Canada confirmed its first cases of the Alpha variant in a couple from Toronto who had contact with a traveler from the United Kingdom on December 26, 2020 [ 3 ]. The Beta variant was first reported in Alberta on January 8, 2021 [ 3 ]. The Gamma variant was first confirmed in Ontario in an international traveler from Brazil on February 8, 2021 [ 3 ]. On April 4, 2021, the Delta variant was first reported in British Columbia [ 3 ]. The latest variant (Omicron) was first detected in Ontario from 2 travelers from Nigeria on November 28, 2021 [ 3 ]. Although much still remains to be learned about the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and sequalae of these 5 VOCs, using the data available at the time of analysis, we sought to understand the spread of VOCs in Canada and how they might be held in check by vaccine uptake and public health countermeasures. Although lab-based research and modeling have shown the need to combine public health countermeasures with vaccination to achieve epidemic control [ 4 , 5 ], there has been a paucity of population-level studies to assess the effects of nonpharmaceutical public health measures on VOCs. In a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission in New York City, public countermeasures such as mask wearing and social distancing were shown to have immediate impact on the epidemic [ 5 ]. The synergistic effects of vaccination and public countermeasures in reducing new COVID-19 cases cannot be overemphasized [ 5 ]. Alpha and Delta variants are more transmissible than the initial strains of the virus, but the Gamma, Beta, and Delta variants hugely impact vaccine effectiveness. A major concern is the continuous genetic evolution of the virus, which complicates reopening plans across Canada. Although studies are underway to determine the degree of virulence of Omicron variants, it is believed that a subvariant known as BA.2 is more contagious than its predecessor, BA.1, and currently dominating in Canada [ 6 ]. This \u201cup to the point\u201d analysis of VOCs in Canada (ie, during the downward trajectory of the third wave) examines (1) clustering patterns of COVID-19 mitigation efforts and (2) cluster differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 VOCs in Canada. In doing so, it aimed to provide insights into the differences in the subnational responses to inform ongoing policy and public health interventions at the provincial and territorial levels of government. This analysis centered on publicly available data with no identifiable information about the people studied. Therefore, research ethics board approval was not required for this study. We analyzed provincial- and territorial-level data on COVID-19 VOCs in Canada along with data on COVID-19 mitigating strategies from publicly available data sources. Our outcome variable\u2014prevalence of VOCs by type and total\u2014was estimated as the proportion of cases with VOC per 1 million population as of June 15, 2021. The cumulative number of VOC cases for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants was extracted from a COVID-19 VOC tracker in Canada [ 7 ]. Populations at risk were predefined as the first quarter, 2021, provincial population estimates obtained from Statistics Canada [ 8 ]. Our independent variables\u2014vaccine uptake (the percentage of each provincial or territorial population fully vaccinated against COVID-19), policy response (stringency index\u2014see the following paragraphs for more details), and behavioral changes (mobility index) were mapped with the VOC prevalence outcome. These mitigating factors were selected based on growing evidence that uptake of primary series of vaccination (2 doses) [ 9 - 15 ], reduction in human mobility [ 16 - 18 ], and social distancing policies [ 19 , 20 ] are effective in curtailing community transmission of COVID-19. During the study period, 3 COVID-19 vaccines (ie, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) were authorized and in use in vaccination campaigns in Canada. Full vaccination coverage rates were retrieved from the COVID-19 Tracker Canada [ 21 ]. As opposed to first dose (ie, partial immunization) rates, full vaccination (2 doses) rates were analyzed in this study because complete vaccination is widely believed to offer greater protection than partial vaccination in slowing down COVID-19 transmission, hospitalizations, disease sequalae, and fatalities [ 22 ]. The stringency index is a composite score generated by the researchers at the University of Oxford to document how the governments\u2019 coronavirus responses are changing around the world and over time. The metric is an additive score of 9 indicators (ie, school and workplace closures, restrictions on public transport, cancellation of public events and gatherings, stay-at-home policies, travel restrictions, public information campaigns, testing policies, contact tracing, and masking), measured on an ordinal scale, and rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. The lowest possible score is 0 (mildest), and the highest score is 100 (strictest). The policy index was publicly available at the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) website [ 23 ]. The constituent variables used in generating the stringency index are summarized in Multimedia Appendix 1 . It should be noted that the stringency index is not a measure of effectiveness of government policies in response to COVID-19 but rather a measure of the degree to which and the comprehensiveness of governmental response. To account for the changing patterns of COVID-19 containment policies, average stringency indices for the period of January 1, 2021, to June 15, 2021 were reported. To assess individuals\u2019 compliance with government stringency measures (especially reduction in human movement to slow the spread of the virus), we obtained mobility reports from Google LLC [ 24 ]. Recent infodemiological and infoveillance studies [ 25 - 29 ] have utilized mobility reports from Google [ 24 ] to observe changes in the movement of people to places designed as high risk based on relative frequency, time, and duration of visits during the pandemic. The technical details of data aggregation and anonymization procedures have been fully described by Aktay et al [ 30 ]. Through Google Map\u2019s location history feature, daily anonymized data on people\u2019s movement to places such as retail and recreation, grocery stores and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas were collected from smartphones and compared to the baseline 5-week prepandemic period (January 3, 2020, to February 6, 2020). Due to privacy issues, Google could not provide information on the inter- or intraprovincial and territorial movement [ 30 ]. Also, in a bid to ensure additional privacy protections, a metric for a given place is discarded when the counts of the opted-in Google users are less than 100 people or the geographical area is less than 30 km 2 [ 30 ]. As deemed useful by public health researchers to make critical decisions about COVID-19, the Google community mobility reports help provide insights into how busy certain places are and, thus, the extent to which individuals are engaging in social distancing [ 30 ]. To determine mobility patterns across the provinces and territories, we estimated the average number of visits to each category of place (eg, park or workplace) between January 1, 2021, and June 15, 2021. The average of the mobility patterns across the entire study period was estimated to account for changes in movement due to weather and holidays, as well as any within-province variations of public health countermeasures. Using the first component of principal component analysis (PCA), the dimensions of the 6 variables that measured changes in movement of people relative to the pre-COVID era were reduced with the singular value decomposition method and z-score transformation (ie, mean of 0 and variance of 1). The first component (interpreted as the mobility index) explained 60% of the total variance, and its eigenvalue was 3.60. The first component had positive loadings on residential areas (0.47) and parks (0.36), but negative loadings on workplace (\u20130.5), transit stations (\u20130.49), grocery stores (\u20130.11), and retail or recreational centers (\u20130.39). For each variable, a positive loading suggests a higher mobility index, and negative loading indicates a lower mobility index. Descriptive statistics were generated. We conducted a spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning) to detect clusters of spatial (dis)similarities in COVID-19 mitigating factors in GeoDa version 1.18 software [ 31 ]. Furthermore, we determined differences in prevalence of VOCs across the clusters. A symmetrical distance-based weight matrix with an optimal arc distance of 7000 km was generated. After many calibrations, single-linkage clustering with an Euclidean distance function and geometric centroid weight of 1 was considered appropriate and used. A spatial hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the mitigating factors (ie, vaccine uptake, public health countermeasures, and mobility). With the single linkage, intercluster distance was determined by the closest distance between the observations (ie, closest neighbor clustering). The first step was to transform the independent variables using z-score standardization since they were in different scales. Z-score standardization is an important preprocessing step for a machine learning algorithm, which involves rescaling the features to have a normal distribution. Data standardization before PCA has been shown to outperform an unscaled data set [ 32 ]. In an attempt to select the number of clusters that provided the best fit (distinct clustering), we used a stopping rule\u2014the Duda-Hart index. We selected groups with the highest Duda-Hart index (0.6) and lowest pseudo T-squared (4.4). The stopping rule corresponds to the 3 clusters reported. The Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-population rank test was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of VOCs among the clusters using Stata version 17.0 software [ 33 ]. A rank-based nonparametric test was used because the sample size is small (ie, 11 provinces and territories). Post hoc pairwise (posteriori) comparisons of the clusters were performed with the Dunn test; false detection rates were minimized by using Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. The statistical significance was set at 2-sided P <.05. To visualize the relationships between the prevalence of VOCs, vaccine uptake, and countermeasures, bivariate choropleth maps were generated in QGIS version 3.12.1 software [ 34 ]. The bivariate maps were based on a quantile classification (ie, tertile); see Figures 1 - 3 . As shown, the 3x3 2D color palette density becomes progressively darker as it moves from lower to higher tertiles and highlights the differences in relative position of features. The tertile classification is based on the sample distribution. We report the observed value ranges for each tertile classification.  Association between variants of concern and 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Canada as of June 15, 2021.  Association between variants of concern and mobility index in Canada as of June 15, 2021. Table 1 shows the distribution of COVID-19 VOCs in Canada. As of June 15, 2021, when our analysis was performed, 4 VOCs (Alpha, B.1.1.7; Beta, B.1.351; Gamma, P.1; and Delta, B.1.617.2) had been identified, for a prevalence of 6157.5 per 1 million population and 16.7% of all cases. Nova Scotia reported the lowest, at 89.9 per 1 million population, to Alberta the highest, at 10,848.1 per 1 million population. At 91.4% of all VOCs, the Alpha variant was the predominant strain in Canada. The Gamma variant accounted for 6.5%, Beta variant for 0.8%, and Delta variant for 0.8% of the mutant strains. Although Alberta and Ontario had a higher prevalence of the Alpha variant, lower prevalence of this strain was observed in Yukon and Nova Scotia. The prevalence of the Beta variant was highest in Ontario, followed by Quebec. The Gamma and Delta variants were more common in British Columbia and Alberta. Geographic-specific distribution of COVID-19 variants of concern in Canada, June 15, 2021 (per 1,000,000 population). Compared with the baseline (January 3, 2020-February 6, 2020), mobility related to home or residential areas increased by 12.7% between January 1, 2021, and June 15, 2021, among Canadians. On average, movement of people to parks and outdoor spaces increased by 38.8%; however, in Prince Edward Island, it decreased (average trend=\u201345%). Overall, mobility related to visits to grocery or pharmacy stores decreased by 4.6% across Canada but increased in Nova Scotia (by 2.6%), British Columbia (2.5%), and Saskatchewan (1.9%). Across Canada, movement related to public transport stations decreased by 56.5%, retail and recreational centers by 29.4%, and workplaces by 31.3%. The average national stringency index for COVID-19 was 73.6% (lowest in Yukon at 47.2% and highest in Ontario at 90.7%). The Canadian population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 was 13.8% (lowest in Newfoundland and Labrador at 5.7% and highest in Yukon at 61.6%). Cluster analysis with the single-linkage method identified 3 cluster profiles of VOC prevalence, vaccine uptake, public health countermeasures, and mobility among Canadian provinces or territories (see Table 2 ). The clusters were significantly different from one another in their average prevalence of COVID-19 variant cases and variant-specific prevalence, vaccine uptake, and public health countermeasures (see Table 2 ). Multimedia Appendix 2 shows the frequency distribution of the variables after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for post hoc pairwise comparisons. Characteristics of clusters from spatial hierarchical clustering analysis of mitigating factors. a YT: Yukon. b NT: Northwest Territories. c NU: Nunavut. d NB: New Brunswick. e NL: Newfoundland and Labrador. f NS: Nova Scotia. g PE: Prince Edward Island. h QC: Quebec. i AB: Alberta. j BC: British Columbia. k MB: Manitoba. l ON: Ontario. m SK: Saskatchewan. n Intercluster differences assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test. o Analyses of the differences in vaccine coverage, stringency index, and mobility index across the clusters were not conducted because they contributed to the cluster analysis. Probabilistic assessment of the differences of these 3 variables across the clusters, therefore, was inappropriate. Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut\u2014the first cluster\u2014had a moderate prevalence of VOCs, high vaccine uptake (fully vaccinated), and low countermeasures. The 4 Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec\u2014the second cluster\u2014had a low prevalence of VOCs, low vaccine uptake (fully vaccinated), moderate mobility, and moderate countermeasures. The 4 western provinces, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, along with Ontario\u2014the third cluster\u2014showed a high prevalence of VOCs, moderate vaccine uptake, high mobility, and high countermeasures. Compared with the other clusters, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon were characterized by a moderate prevalence of aggregated VOCs and the Alpha variant (533 per 1 million population) and the Gamma variant (22 per 1 million population). It is important to note that the Beta and Delta variants had not been identified in the 3 territories of cluster 1. In addition, cluster 1 had the highest proportion of Canadians who had received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines (58.5%), lowest mobility index (\u20132.1), and lowest stringency index (58.5%). Compared with the other clusters, cluster 2 was characterized by the lowest prevalence of aggregated VOCs (237 per 1 million population), the Alpha variant (230 per 1 million population), and the Gamma variant (1 per 1 million population). However, it had relatively moderate levels of the Beta (12 per 1 million population) and Delta (2 per 1 million population) variants. In addition, cluster 2 had the lowest full vaccination coverage rates (10.5%), a moderate mobility index (0.4), and a moderate stringency index (68.6%). Compared with the other clusters, cluster 3 had the highest prevalence of VOCs (5461 per 1 million population) and variant-specific prevalences\u2014Alpha (5200 per 1 million population), Beta (33 per 1 million population), Gamma (280 per 1 million population), and Delta (73 per 1 million population). Also, cluster 3 had moderate fully vaccinated coverage rates (15.9%), the highest mobility index (1.3), and the highest stringency index (71.6%). Figure 1 shows the distribution of VOCs and the proportion of Canadians who received the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine by province. Provinces shown in the darkest color (towards the top right in the legend in map) have relatively high VOC prevalences and high vaccination rates; those in the lightest color (bottom left) have low VOC prevalences and low vaccination rates. Of all provinces and territories, Alberta was classified as having a marginally higher vaccine rate and high VOC prevalence: 18.9% of people fully vaccinated and VOC prevalence of 10,848 per 1 million population. Ontario (9919 per 1 million population), Saskatchewan (5461 per 1 million population), and Manitoba (4598 per 1 million population) had the high prevalences of VOCs and relatively moderate vaccine uptake rates (Ontario: 13.8%; Manitoba: 15.9%; and Saskatchewan: 18%). At the opposite end, meaning low VOC prevalences and low vaccine rates, the Atlantic provinces with low VOC prevalences and low vaccine rates were Nova Scotia (VOC prevalence of 90 per 1 million population and 5.6% vaccine rate), Prince Edward Island (175 per 1 million population and 10.9%), New Brunswick (237 per 1 million population and 10.5%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (374 per 1 million population and 5.7%). Qu\u00e9bec and British Columbia had moderate VOC prevalences and vaccine uptake rates (Quebec, VOC prevalence of 900 per 1 million population and vaccine rate of 11.9%, and British Columbia, VOC prevalence of 3626 per 1 million population and vaccine rate of 12.8%). Yukon had a low prevalence of VOCs (190 per 1 million population) and high vaccine rate (41.6%), followed by the Northwest Territories (1706 per 1 million population and 58.53%) and Nunavut (533 per 1 million population and 40.4%). Figure 2 shows the relationship between the prevalence of VOCs and government stringency measures to curb COVID-19. The provinces of Ontario and Manitoba showed higher prevalences of VOCs (9919 and 4598 per 1 million population, respectively) and high scores on the stringency index\u2014Ontario: 90.7% and Manitoba: 75.9%. Saskatchewan recorded a higher prevalence of VOCs (5461 per 1 million population) and lower stringency (57.9%). Alberta had a high prevalence of VOCs (10,848 per 1 million population) and moderate stringency (68.5%).  Association between variants of concerns and stringency measures in Canada as of June 15, 2021. The province of Quebec had a moderate level of VOC prevalence (900 per 1 million population) with high stringency (73.2%). British Columbia and Northwest Territories had moderate prevalences of VOCs (3626 per 1 million population and 1706 per 1 million population, respectively) and moderate levels of stringency\u2014British Columbia: 64.8% and Northwest Territories: 64.8%. At the low end of VOC prevalence, Yukon, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick had lower stringency\u2014Yukon: 47.2%; Prince Edward Island: 58.3%; and New Brunswick: 58.3%. Nova Scotia reported a lower prevalence of VOCs (90 per 1 million population) and relatively higher stringency (81.5%), and Newfoundland and Labrador had a lower prevalence of VOCs, at 374 per 1 million population, and moderate stringency, at 71.8%. Figure 3 presents the association between the prevalence of VOCs and changes in movement of people in relation to the beginning of the pandemic (mobility index). Among the provinces reporting higher VOC prevalences, populations in Ontario and Alberta showed higher mobility indices\u2014Ontario: 3.0 and Alberta: 1.3. In this higher-prevalence VOC group, Manitoba and Saskatchewan populations had moderate mobility indices\u20141.2 and 0.2, respectively. Among the provinces and territories reporting moderate VOC prevalences, Quebec and British Columbia recorded higher mobility indices\u2014Quebec: 2.1 and British Columbia: 1.3\u2014while Northwest Territories (\u20131.0) and Nunavut (\u20133.2) had lower mobility indices. Two of the 4 Atlantic provinces, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon recorded low VOC prevalences and low mobility indices\u2014Prince Edward Island at \u20132.7, Newfoundland and Labrador at \u20131.0, and Yukon at \u20132.1. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick recorded low prevalences of VOCs and moderate mobility, at 0.7 and 0.4, respectively. This study shows markedly elevated prevalence of COVID-19 VOCs in Canada and wide geographical variation across the provinces and territories. We observed that the provinces in cluster 3\u2014the Pacific region, Central Canada, and the Prairie provinces\u2014were hot spots of VOCs as determined by the highest cluster-level prevalence of aggregated and variant-specific VOCs. We also observed that there was \u201cnorth-south\u201d disparity between the territories and the provinces in the prevalence of variant-specific VOCs, vaccine coverage, and public health countermeasures. As with most COVID-19 research, this study sought to understand the disease as it is unfolding: specifically, COVID-19 VOCs in Canadian provinces and territories. By June 15, 2021, the daily new case rates in all Canadian provinces and territories were declining, indicating the resolution phase of the third wave of the epidemic curve. Many provinces set in motion plans to relax public health countermeasures, relying on vaccination rates as the criterion for reopening. At the same time, however, there was since-validated concern that the VOCs, in particular the Delta variant, could trigger widespread outbreaks, especially among the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Across Canadian provinces and territories, we have shown a pattern of VOC spread, vaccine uptake (both doses), and policy countermeasures that can be profiled in 3 clusters. The first cluster, comprising all 3 Canadian territories, is characterized by moderate VOC prevalence, higher degree of vaccine uptake, and lesser degree of governmental countermeasures. The second cluster, comprising the Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, along with the province of Quebec, is characterized by low VOC prevalence, low vaccine uptake, and moderate stringency of countermeasures. The third cluster, comprising Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, is characterized by high prevalence of VOCs, moderate vaccine uptake, and more stringent countermeasures. Strikingly, intercluster disparity in the prevalence of VOCs is more evident for cluster 3, making the provinces in that group VOC hot spots. As governments across Canada continue to enact plans for easing public health countermeasures, there is concern that provinces and territories need to have much higher rates of vaccination with both primary and booster doses. Although per capita case rates are declining across Canada, there has been a recent increase in the highly transmissible VOCs, Delta and Omicron, in provinces [ 35 , 36 ]. These recent regional outbreaks were seen mostly among unvaccinated people [ 37 ]. As Canadian health officials strive to get as many people vaccinated within the shortest time possible, policy countermeasures may need to be further calibrated depending on the local spread of VOCs and vaccine hesitancy and refusals [ 38 , 39 ]. There have been several alarms raised that the B.A2 subtype of Omicron variant could become dominant if an insufficient proportion of the population did not complete the full COVID-19 primary vaccination regimen and receive booster doses [ 13 ]. In a past study conducted in Scotland, the first dose was shown not to confer complete immunity against the emerging variants versus the Alpha variant; however, full vaccination (2 doses) combined with booster shots improves immune effectiveness [ 38 ]. Our present study confirms that, in the postvaccine period in Canada (ie, December 2020), vaccination coverage rates are uneven across the country. At least three strains of VOC with different transmission risks and responses to COVID-19 vaccines were concomitantly identified in more than half of the provinces. Like in the United States [ 15 ], in the first quarter of 2021, the dominant variant in Canada was the Alpha variant. According to Davies et al [ 14 ], the Alpha variant had a high reproductive number (43%-90%). However, a more worrying observation during the study period was the identification of 2 highly virulent variants (Beta and Delta) in 77% of the provinces. Due to the key mutations at E484K and K417N receptor-binding sites of the spike proteins for Beta [ 10 - 13 ] and L452R receptors for Delta [ 40 ], both variants are capable of escaping recognition by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), thus evading both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Also, T478K is not well recognized as responsible for immune evasion for Delta variants and may, like N501Y, be more relevant for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding; however, additional mutations at K417N have been reported for the Delta variant [ 41 ]. Given the relatively high prevalence of the Gamma variant in some provinces or territories (ie, British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Yukon), the Gamma variant also evades the immune system (but less so than the Beta variant) through a significant change in an nAb epitope (E484K and K417T). This observation has far-reaching consequences on health outcomes and prolongation of the epidemic due to new infections. Considering the high prevalence of Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants in some provinces (ie, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), stakeholders should continue to emphasize 2-dose vaccine uptake combined with booster shots and maintenance of public health countermeasures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Although the structural and operational barriers to vaccination (eg, vaccine stock shortages, long wait times, and vaccine refusal or hesitancy) need to be tackled, people must be adequately sensitized to complete the second and booster doses to offer full population protection against the VOCs (especially Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron), thereby reducing future risk of new variants. The discordance between VOC prevalence and stringency measures warrants cautious interpretation. Our analysis could not show whether the relaxation of countermeasures in the territories of Canada was informed by declining COVID-19 cases and progressive vaccine rollout, or vice versa. This inverse relationship, which is quite possible, means the timing of implementation of polices in relation to the changing epidemiological contexts of the pandemic is important. The degree of social compliance with government stringency measures might also depend on seasonality effects. Stringency measures may reduce COVID-19 incidence not only directly, for example, by reducing mobility, exposure, and public circulation but also indirectly through weather on mobility patterns [ 18 , 42 ]. Although we attempted to reduce the effect of weather by taking the average of mobility indices from January 2021 to June 2021, there might be some residual effects because of the varying daily temperatures across the provinces and territories. In our study, we observed low mobility index and stringency index in the territories, in contrast to the provinces. At the time of conducting this study, no comprehensive time series data were easily available for Canada. Further investigation with time series will shed more light on the observed phenomenon. However, we could establish that successful immunization campaigns and reducing human mobility in the territories in northern Canada have played a role in lowering VOC cases. Fast tracking second-dose vaccination not only is key to return to normalcy but also has been shown in previous studies [ 14 , 43 ] to curtail transmission of COVID-19 variants. Our results noted some spatial outliers (ie, discordant areas) for the relationship between the selected public health measures and VOCs in Ontario and in the Canadian Prairie provinces. To optimize public health impacts, these provinces need to revisit some of their approaches and reprioritize specific interventions. It is also noteworthy to further examine the intraprovincial variations between the public health measures and patterns of VOCs for the spatial outliers. The novelty of this study is that no known published study has described spatial clusters based on VOCs, vaccination coverage, and public health measures for Canadian jurisdictions. Overall, this study contributes to the current information needs to guide stakeholders on preventive measures to curtail VOCs during subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, evidence from this study could serve as a comparison point for informing interventions for future variant-driven outbreaks and surges. Also, the bivariate choropleth map eased readability of spatial patterns, compared with proportional symbol maps. This study has some limitations. The recommendations for administration of different vaccine products (eg, messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]\u2013based, viral vector\u2013based) have been quite fluid in Canada; we have not taken into consideration the spatial associations between different vaccine products and VOCs. Further research is needed to specifically assess the geographical patterns of vaccine products and VOCs, especially for the Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. As mentioned, this is an ongoing information need, rather than a one-time project. The biggest limitation, however, is the time lag and the uneven testing, detecting, and sequencing efforts to identify VOCs in Canada. Whole genomic sequencing (WGS) efforts to identify VOCs by large volumes are currently lagging in Canada. Also, there is selection bias of the samples that are sent for sequencing. The provinces and territories have different criteria for sending samples for sequencing, which could delay detection and bias the proportion of VOCs associated with the Beta and Gamma variants. For example, in Ontario, the WGS was triggered from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing for E48K. The samples with the E48K mutations were prioritized for WGS. However, in May 2021, the WGS algorithm changed to randomly selected sampling of 10% positives, with the proportion then increasing to 50% and now to all positives. This calls for new and rapid detection methods for VOCs even as Canada continues to fully vaccinate its populations. Also, there is possibility of systematic bias in the Google mobility index being underestimated among people without smartphones, who opted-out of the Google\u2019s location history feature, or who had poor internet connection (especially in the territories). Due to how the mobility patterns were captured by Google LLC\u2014geographical jurisdiction\u2014it is challenging to delineate international travels and interprovincial and territorial mobility. This study found that COVID-19 VOCs in Canadian provinces and territories, to date, show discernible geographical clustering patterns: The territories recorded low VOC prevalences, Atlantic provinces and Quebec recorded moderate VOC prevalences, and the Western provinces and Ontario recorded high VOC prevalences. A fuller picture of VOC emerges when its prevalence is correlated with the proportions of populations having received 2 doses of vaccines, governmental countermeasures, and mobility. The implementation of COVID-19 public health measures including mass full vaccination of populations are key to controlling VOC prevalence rates in Canada. Surveillance of VOCs should continue across Canada, while accelerating the rollout of second and booster doses of vaccines. Achieving a balance in relation to lifting and relaxation of public health countermeasures and full-dose vaccine coverage is prudent to preempt any VOC-driven COVID-19 surges.

(Sylvain Roy Roussel\/CBC) Social Sharing The Quebec government has tabled a bill to tighten the province's language laws, seeking to change the Canadian Constitution to add clauses defining Quebec as a nation with its official and common language being French. That's one part of a sweeping new bill that, if passed, would become the most stringent law to bolster the status of the French language in Quebec since Bill 101 passed in 1977. Much of the 100-page bill is aimed\u00a0at increasing the use of French in public and workplaces after a series of studies indicated French is on the decline, particularly in Montreal. \"French will always be vulnerable because of Quebec's situation in North America,'' Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault told reporters Thursday, alongside\u00a0Simon Jolin-Barrette, the province's minister responsible for the French language. \"In that sense, each generation that passes has a responsibility for the survival of our language, and now it's our turn.\" The bill, called Bill 96, includes the following proposed measures: Adding clauses to the Canadian Constitution, saying Quebec is a nation and that its official and common language is French. Applying Bill 101 to businesses with 25-49 employees\u00a0and federal workplaces. Forcing all commercial signage that includes non-French-language trademarks to include a \"predominant\" amount of French on all sign.

Provincially appointed judges will not be required to be bilingual. Requiring that all provincial communication with immigrants is in French, starting six months after they arrive in Quebec. WATCH | Quebec seeks to change Canadian Constitution with new language bill: Quebec tables sweeping new French-language bill 4 years ago Duration 2:04 The Quebec government is hoping to bolster the use of French in the province through a sweeping new bill which would affect students, businesses  and new immigrants among many others. Invoking the notwithstanding clause The new bill pre-emptively\u00a0invokes the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to protect it from legal challenges. The notwithstanding clause, officially called Section 33,\u00a0allows provincial or federal authorities to override certain sections of the charter for a period of five years. \"The notwithstanding clause is a legitimate tool that balances between individual rights and collective rights,\" Legault\u00a0said. Canada's notwithstanding clause \u2014 what's that again? \"We have the right and we have a duty to use the notwithstanding clause when the basis of our existence as a francophone people on the American continent is at stake.\" This is the second time Legault's government has used the notwithstanding clause. The CAQ government used it to shield its law barring some civil servants from wearing religious symbols, known as Bill 21, from legal challenges. As far as changing the Constitution, the CAQ government believes\u00a0other provinces will not need to be consulted because it involves amending\u00a0a matter within Quebec's constitution.

The province will, however, need permission from Ottawa. \"We are aware of the bill tabled by the Government of Quebec and will study its contents carefully,\" Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages M\u00e9lanie Joly\u00a0said in a statement. \"As we stated in our reform document last February, the protection and promotion of French is a priority for our government.

Among political parties, however, the reaction was more positive. In fact, the leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, said he supports aspects of the bill, but feels it doesn't go far enough. \"Unfortunately, the CAQ gave us the absolute minimum.\" The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has called for the Quebec college system, CEGEP, to fall under the purview of Bill 101, which would require the vast majority of students who go to elementary and high school in French to go to a French CEGEP. Quebec's proposed language law shakes English CEGEPs Analysis With Bill 101 reforms, Fran\u00e7ois Legault risks upending Quebec's hard-won linguistic peace Plamondon said he was disappointed that the bill didn't include that measure. \"That\u00a0bill cannot reasonably change the steep decline of the French language in the Montreal region.\" Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade said she was pleased to see so many of her party's proposals made it into the bill, including French-language classes, but she says there's room for improvement and hopes the government will be open to collaboration. As for changing the Constitution, Anglade said she needs to \"better understand what it truly changes.\" Decline of French in Quebec The proposed\u00a0legislation comes after a number of studies from the OQLF\u00a0that found\u00a0the French language is in decline in the province. A 2018 study projected that the percentage of Quebecers who speak French at home will drop from 82 per cent in 2011 to about\u00a075 per cent in 2036. The second study, also completed in 2018, examined language spoken in workplaces. It found that a quarter of Montreal employees surveyed said\u00a0they use French and English equally at work, and only 18.7 per cent said they speak French exclusively at work. Quebec's language laws and identity have long been a source of tension in the province. Bill 101, adopted in 1977 by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9veque's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government, was a bid to bolster and protect the French language in the province.

Although the pope used a wheelchair throughout the trip, it was his first time using one during his traditional in-flight news conference. \u201cI think at my age, with these limitations, I think I have to save my energies a little to serve the church,\u201d or consider stepping aside, he said, adding that it would not be a disaster if he were out of the picture. \u201cYou can change popes.

He also revealed that the Vatican\u2019s secretariat of state had been behind a terse and unsigned document slamming the brakes on a group of progressives within the influential German church who had advocated for priests to marry, for women to become deacons and for same-sex couples to receive the church\u2019s blessing. Francis said that he had said everything he needed to on the matter in a letter years ago, when he said it was a process that should be led by the Holy Spirit rather than policy priorities. The pope had called his visit to Canada a \u201cpilgrimage of penance\u201d that focused on his begging forgiveness for the wrongs perpetrated in church-run residential schools that for generations used Christianity as a blade to separate children from their families. Children in the schools suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Many died, and many languages died, too. Survivors of the schools, their relatives and advocates blame the church for its role in seeking to assimilate those Indigenous cultures and for driving them to the brink of extinction. Francis spent a week fulfilling a demand by Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he travel to the land of the Indigenous and apologize. He did so at the site of one notorious residential school, in Alberta; in Edmonton churches; at a shrine in the pilgrimage site of Lac Ste. Anne; in Quebec City; and to the Inuit in the Arctic Circle. Image Graves in Iqaluit, Nunavut. Children in church-run residential schools suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse.

Anne-Sophie Thill\/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images On the plane, he said he had not used the words cultural genocide only because the technical term had not come to mind. But, he added, \u201cI described the genocide and asked for forgiveness, forgiveness for this \u2018operation.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d he added, \u201cit was genocide.\u201d On Friday, the last day of his visit, the pope spoke to a delegation of Indigenous peoples at the archbishop\u2019s residence in Quebec City, telling them that he had come to Canada \u201cdespite my physical limitations to take further steps forward with you and for you\u201d and \u201cas a brother, to discover firsthand the good and bad fruit borne by members of the local Catholic family in the course of the years.\u201d He then headed farther north than he had ever traveled, to Iqaluit, the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut, a vast area spanning time zones in the Arctic Circle. He met with survivors inside a school, sat outside on a chair covered in sealskin and faced the Arctic Sea as he listened to throat singers and watched drum dancers. \u201cToday, too, in this place, I want to tell you how very sorry I am and to ask for forgiveness for the evil perpetrated by not a few Catholics,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHow evil it is to break the bonds uniting parents and children.\u201d Susie Alainga, 49, an Inuit, watched from the back of the crowd in an orange shirt bearing the words, \u201cEvery Child Matters.\u201d She said that she had attended not so much for the pope, but rather to give support to survivors of abuse, including her sister. She said that the possibility of rescinding any old papal decrees that provided the rationale for spreading Christianity during the colonial era, as many Indigenous people have called for, would mean little to her. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d she said.

His 9-year-old son, Fayez Salman, is in the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. A GoFundMe spokeswoman said the page was the \u201cverified\u201d fundraiser for the family.\n\n\u201cBased on information collected during the course of the investigation, we believe that this was an intentional act and that the victims of this horrific incident were targeted,\u201d London Police Chief Steve Williams told reporters Monday. \u201cWe believe the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetective Superintendent Paul Waight said police Sunday arrested the suspect, Nathaniel Veltman, in a mall parking lot four miles from where the attack occurred \u201cwearing a vest that appeared to be like body armor.\u201d The 20-year-old was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.\n\nPolice are in contact with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about whether terrorism charges should be pursued, Waight said.\n\nLondon Mayor Ed Holder ordered flags outside the city hall to be lowered for three days of mourning.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: This was an act of mass murder, perpetrated against Muslims \u2014 against Londoners \u2014 and rooted in unspeakable hatred,\u201d he said. \u201cThe magnitude of such hatred can make one question who we are as a city, and who we are as Londoners.\u201d\n\nNews of the attack drew condemnation from leaders around the world.

{"year":"2021","month":"06","event_desc":"2021 Western North America heat wave Dozens of people have died amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records.","text":"Canada weather: Dozens dead as heatwave shatters records 30 June 2021 Share Save Share Save Watch: Canadians say the conditions are \"unbearable\" Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records. Police in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions, with heat often a contributing factor. Canada broke its temperature record for a third straight day on Tuesday - 49.6C (121.3F) in Lytton, British Columbia. The US north-west has also seen record highs - and a number of fatalities. Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated. Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwave Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change US President Joe Biden said the heatwave was tied to climate change in a speech on Tuesday as he pitched a plan to update the country's infrastructure network. On Wednesday he is meeting with governors of western US states and fire officials, as the annual North American wildfire season begins. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California to the Arctic territories. Temperatures have been easing in coastal areas but there is not much respite for inland regions. Before Sunday, temperatures in Canada had never passed 45C. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the hottest week the province had ever experienced had led to \"disastrous consequences for families and for communities\". The number of heat-related fatalities is likely to rise as some areas say they have responded to sudden death incidents but have yet to collate the numbers. In Vancouver alone, heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the unexpected deaths of 65 people since Friday. \"I've been a police officer for 15 years and I've never experienced the volume of sudden deaths that have come in in such a short period of time,\" police sergeant Steve Addison said. Three or four a day is the normal number. He said people were arriving at relatives' homes and \"finding them deceased\". Dozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of emergency calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources. British Columbia Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe said 100 more deaths than normal had been reported in the period from Friday to Monday. Allow Twitter content?

Accept and continue The tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver - and not much further south than London - has recorded all of Canada's recent record highs. Resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been \"almost impossible\" to go outside. \"It's been intolerable,\" she told the Globe & Mail newspaper. \"We're trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We're used to the heat, and it's a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47.\" Canada temperature reaches record 49.6C Many homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. One Vancouver resident told AFP news agency that hotels seemed to be sold out, as people flocked there for air-conditioning, adding: \"I've never seen anything like this. I hope it never becomes like this ever again.\" The country's weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba. Jodi Hughes, weather anchor at Global News Calgary, told the BBC that firefighters were extremely concerned at the possibility of wild fires, possibly sparked by thunderstorms that could occur as the weather pattern changes. How to ward off the heat Stay cool. It may sound obvious, but if your body hits 40C (104F) heat-stroke can set in, which requires urgent medical help, as it could lead to loss of consciousness, organ failure, even death. Danger signs include sweat stopping - feeling hot, but dry - and breathing difficulties Food and water. Again obviously, drink water (and avoid diuretics like caffeine) - and don't take your thirst as a guide, as you could still be dehydrating. Food with high water content is good; having to digest heavy meals isn't Stay in the shade. Indoors if you can. Limit travel to cooler parts of the day if possible. Be careful with exercise Clothing. Try to keep covered, but with fabrics like linen and cotton that are more breathable. Wear a hat, preferably with ventilation Cooling methods. If you find air-conditioning eco-unfriendly or don't have it, try fans (maybe with ice cubes in front), gels, face sprays, a cold water bottle, a cool shower. Draw the curtains to cool the room temperature How to look after yourself in hot weather Records fall in western US In the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said. At least a dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon are believed to be linked to the heatwave. A doctor in a Seattle hospital told the Seattle Times the number of patients streaming in with heat stroke was comparable to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Jeremy Hess said some had kidney or heart problems, and one man had third-degree burns from walking on asphalt. Seattle resident Mark Aldham set up a cooling system in his front yard with free snacks and drinks. \"It is super hot here. So my partner and I, we set up some shade that we have from [Nevada festival] Burning Man to help cool off our neighbourhood and keep everyone safe,\" he told Reuters. The heat has been intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter .

Agricultural workers are often now being given the option to start at dawn and finish at noon. But labour contractors say that some stay on to work regardless of the heat. One worker was found dead in a field at the end of his shift at a farm in Oregon. One Seattle resident told AFP that the city felt like a desert: \"Normally... 60, 70 degrees [Farenheit] is a great day - everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts - but this is... ridiculous.\" Amazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.

Article content The coroners service said it has not received any other reports of deaths linked to the fire, but officials have said that some people remain unaccounted for, in large part due to the hasty evacuation of the village on Wednesday night. Article content That evacuation was the subject of criticism earlier Saturday, as the head of the Nlaka\u2019pamux Nation Tribal Council \u2014 of which the Lytton First Nation is a member \u2014 said the government ignored the needs of community members in the early hours of the emergency. Article content Chief Matt Pasco said the tribal council was forced to try to save lives with little to no help from the government. Article content Pasco, who operates a ranch near Ashcroft, north of Lytton, said the first contact he received from the government came 12 hours after evacuations began, and it was regarding his cattle, not about affected community members. Article content Article content \u201cIt was an abysmal attempt at the very thing they\u2019re meant to do,\u201d he said in an interview Saturday. \u201cThey had processes in places for our cattle but none for Nlaka\u2019pamux people.\u201d Article content Article content READ MORE Article content B.C.

It comes after days of calls from local municipal leaders for the province to declare a state of emergency. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said the declaration will help deal with the mass evacuations\u00a0quickly and allow the government to secure accommodation for those people if necessary. Nearly 300 fires were burning across the province on Tuesday, including several that were encroaching on communities that have issued evacuation orders or alerts.

Other experts were quick to point out South Africa\u2019s low rates of vaccination, which currently sit at under 30 per cent of the total population, as well as a lack of evidence suggesting the variant is deadlier than the current dominant strains of the virus.

Alistair Waters\/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account The union representing operating engineers in B.C. says anyone assembling or disassembling a construction crane should have to go through a specific, mandatory certification process because the work is extremely dangerous and often done under tight deadlines. The International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 115, representing people in construction and industrial shops throughout British Columbia and Yukon, made the recommendation Wednesday, two days after a crane collapsed in Kelowna, B.C., killing five people. Four construction workers, as well as another person working in an adjacent building that was crushed when the crane came down on top of it, were killed. The body of the person in the adjacent building was recovered from the rubble Wednesday morning. RCMP, WorkSafeBC and the BC Coroners Service are investigating the accident. Both the police and WorkSafe have declined to speculate on the cause of the accident. The crane was being used in the construction of a 25-storey residential tower in downtown Kelowna. Two of the dead \u2013 Eric and Patrick Stemmer \u2013 were identified on social media as brothers working for Stemmer Construction Ltd., based in Salmon Arm, B.C. A former worker for one of the company\u2019s previous projects called the construction firm a \u201csolid, safe working company.\u201d Chris Manning of Abbotsford, B.C., described Eric as a nice, smart guy and a good leader. Eric was \u201cworking hard all the time, always making sure his guys were busy on top of everything. A solid man,\u201d Mr. Manning texted through Facebook Messenger. Andy Watson, a spokesman for WorkSafeBC, said crane operators in B.C., including those for tower cranes, must have a certificate to operate the structures. But no additional certification is required for assembly or disassembly. Instead, he added in an e-mail, the agency\u2019s requirement is that that work must be done by qualified persons in accordance with the instructions of the crane manufacturer or a professional engineer. But Frank Carr, a spokesman for the IUOE, said the union believes specialized certification is required for crane assembly and dismantling. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous work and it\u2019s highly technical,\u201d said Mr. Carr. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lobbying for mandatory tower crane operator certification and approved safety standards for almost 20 years,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s essential to improve the safety standards.\u201d B.C. Labour Minister Harry Bains said in a statement it would be inappropriate for government to speculate on the cause of the accident while multiple investigations are under way. \u201cOnce we have those findings and understand the cause of this incident, the province will be able to take appropriate action toward ensuring something like this does not happen again,\u201d the statement reads. The union said in a news release the City of Vancouver implemented a number of recommendations from it and BC Crane Safety as part of a pilot project to improve tower crane safety. These include requirements for preassembly and postassembly meetings and checklists, pedestrian and cycling lane closings, and granting permit extensions and additional full days for crane assembly and dismantling to reduce pressure on workers to get the job done under tight timelines. \u201cUnfortunately, this incident, it shows how big of a crash zone or how big of a footprint that is encompassed when a tower crane collapses. Unfortunate for the public to learn this way,\u201d Mr. Carr said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. Part of the process prior to this was to educate the public when they\u2019re walking by these sites, what\u2019s taking place above them and how critical and dangerous it is.\u201d Several GoFoundMe pages have been set up in the past few days.

(Natasha MacDonald-Dupuis\/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Read Story Transcript Emergency department\u00a0physician Raghu\u00a0Venugopal\u00a0stood by himself, in his scrubs,\u00a0outside Toronto General Hospital\u00a0Monday holding up a sign that said \"Protect Hospitals\" in an\u00a0effort to\u00a0counter dozens of\u00a0protesters who are opposed\u00a0to COVID-19 public health measures. Across the country,\u00a0people stood in protest outside hospitals ,\u00a0the result of an effort\u00a0organized by a group called Canadian Frontline Nurses, which was founded by two Ontario nurses who have promoted conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Venugopal's photo spread quickly across social media. He said he felt compelled to take action outside the hospital because so much important health-care work took place inside\u00a0and he wanted to defend his fellow health-care workers, registered nurses in particular. \"I think this is particularly abominable by protesters to do this when nurses are leaving acute care hospitals in droves because the working conditions [are] simply too much for them,\" he told As It Happens host Carol Off while on his way to another hospital emergency room. Here is part of their conversation. Dr. Venugopal, why did you decide to stand outside alone and face down these protesters today? Carol, hospitals are places where people who are injured and who are sick come for care, come for compassion, come for respect, and I honestly thought that to protest at that particular hospital in Toronto today was honestly a defilement of very sacred ground for many patients and for many families and many staff who work and get treated there. There's a photograph of you standing alone in front of Toronto General Hospital with this very simple handmade sign, \"Protect Hospitals.\"\u00a0What kind of reaction did you get from people? There were a lot of patients and staff who said, honestly, thank you. And there was a research student who got me a bottle of water because it's really hot. And most of the protesters were very friendly, [but] it got quite heated, though. And I had to step behind the police line because at some point I really start getting scared. Why, what happened? It's the jeers, it's the nasty tone in the voice, it's when you're the only one standing in a uniform and there are a lot of people, quite hostile, around you. It disgusted me to no end that they would target that particular hospital where I know such good cancer care and transplant care and medical and surgical care is done. - Emergency physician\u00a0Raghu Venogopal And you're wearing your scrubs, you're wearing a mask, you're wearing your stethoscope around your neck. What were some of the things people said or\u00a0... the jeers that made you so uncomfortable? People said things like, \"You're a doctor, tell the truth,\" and I wasn't trying to hide my identity and I wasn't\u00a0trying to hide that I worked there. But the reality is, is that, you know, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or are against mandates or are for them, you know, when they're a patient, honestly, we treat them with respect and dignity and compassion. And I think for the nurses and doctors and respiratory therapists and cleaners who work in our hospital, we ask the public to treat us with dignity and respect as well. And in particular, I just want to signal a group that suffered the most during the pandemic, which is registered nurses. And I think this is particularly abominable by protesters to do this when nurses are leaving acute care hospitals in droves because the working conditions [are] simply too much for them. Venugopal said he thinks many of the protesters are reasonable, but called on government to legislate against protests outside hospitals in order to protect health-care workers. (CBC ) And yet the group ... that calls itself Canadian Frontline Nurses seems to be the one behind organized protests, and these kinds of demonstrations in cities, across the country. What do you say to them? First of all, these are not practicing nurses and these are not practicing health-care professionals. And I think if you need any nurses or doctors who actually see patients, who actually take care of COVID patients, they would say get vaccinated. And if you're not sure about getting vaccinated, ask your doctor for more information. People have a right to protest, but these laws of the land are not written behind the hospital walls. The laws of the land are written by our governments, in our municipal governments and in our federal governments \u2014 in Toronto, for example, at Queen's Park. And I would respectfully ask protesters to go there. But let me be clear, Carol, that honestly, the vast majority of people I meet, which is in the emergency room, are patient, are supportive of vaccine mandates, of their understanding of the science, are asking good questions and know how to make good decisions. And I honestly think that the protesters that we're seeing today and across the country are a tiny minority of Canadians. Protesters linked arms outside of Queen's Park in Toronto for several minutes ahead of the planned demonstrations against COVID-19 measures at hospitals across the country on Monday. (Patrick Morrell\/CBC) But why confront them at all then? I mean, online and [on] Twitter today these past days, the people who were in these protests, who say they're part of them, are not just saying that they're against vaccines, they're threatening violence in some cases, that some of these protesters, if you can follow what they're saying on Twitter, have violent intentions. And so why did you go out to confront them? The hospital chosen in Toronto is a very special place where some of the best medicine and science in this country is done. And it disgusted me to no end that they would target that particular hospital where I know such good cancer care and transplant care and medical and surgical care is done. It disturbed me and I thought the best way to express my opinion would be to very respectfully hold a sign saying, \"We need to protect hospitals.\" And we have a legislative record in this country and in our municipalities of protecting health-care sites. And what I think our municipal leaders and solicitor generals in each province need to do is to look at the laws so that in the future, harassment, intimidation, physical assault, psychological assault of healthcare workers, patients and families is no longer tolerable. And I think the majority of Canadians would feel that's reasonable. You mentioned the legislatures and their responsibilities. The provinces, including Ontario, where you work, they can pass injunction laws, can't they? I mean, they can do something about this. What do you make of the fact that they're not? The people in the hospital are not of any political stripe. And what we have to ask honestly is why is the mayor of Toronto and why is the premier of Ontario acting so slowly? We know clearly that First Nations and Indigenous communities, when they have protested, they have been met by police violence. And the very tepid response by authorities and politicians to this particular group speaks volumes that I don't need to further, you know, articulate. But really what we need is protection of patients and families and decency around health-care institutions. And that's a very simple ask. And I think, again, most people would be in favour of that.

The Lower Kootenay Band says that a search using ground-penetrating radar has located the remains of 182 people. They were in unmarked graves south of the former St. Eugene's Mission Residential School near Cranbrook. Some of the graves were as shallow as three to four feet. \"It is believed that the remains of these 182 souls are from the member Bands of the ktunaxa nation, neighbouring First Nations communities, & the community of aqam,\" the band said in a statement. According to the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia, the first Kootenay or St. Eugene's residential school opened in 1890. It was replaced in 1912. The school was operated through much of its history by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. It is a missionary congregation of the Catholic Church founded in 1816 by a French priest, Saint Eug\u00e8ne de Mazenod. \"An Indian Agent reported in 1935 that, as a result of poor food, overwork, and sickness, he had to force parents to send their children to the school,\" the IRSHDC states on its website. \"Despite a change in the principal, school attendance and runaways were ongoing problems. There were also recurring outbreaks of influenza, mumps, measles, chicken pox, and tuberculosis.\" The federal government took over operations of the residence in 1969\u00a0before closing it the following year. The IRSHDC states that the students came from the following home communities:\u00a0St. Mary's; Lower Kootenay; Tobacco Plains; Lower Similkameen; Similkameen; Okanagan; Inkamoop \/ Inkammoep \/ Inkameep; Termission; Creston; Vernon; Enderby; Comox; Little Shuswap; Upper Nicola; Spallumchene \/ Spallumcheon \/ Sallumchene; North Thompson; Lake Similk.; Neskainlith; Tsartlip; Osoyoos; Penticton; Columbia Lake; Shuswap; Tsartlip; Westbank; Athelmer; Cranbrook; Kamloops; Cardston and Seabird Island. One of the former principals, Rev. G.P. Dunlop, left in 1958 to become the head of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, which was also run by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. On May 27, Kukpi7 (Chief) Rosanne Casimir of the\u00a0Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secwe\u0301pemc Nation disclosed that the remains of 215 Indigenous children had been found on the grounds of the former Kamloops school in unmarked graves. Casimir said at the time that these deaths were \"undocumented\". It's not known when the bodies were buried. That was followed on June 24 by Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme's revelation that 751 unmarked graves were found near the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. It was also operated by the Catholic Church. In the Cranbrook area, local First Nations have converted the former residential school into the St. Eugene Golf Resort & Casino , which includes a 125-room hotel. \"The beautiful Spanish-colonial-styled Resort you see today was once the St. Eugene Mission, a residential school for First Nations youth,\" the website states. \"Today, we employ approximately 250 people and have become an entertainment destination for people across North America.

(Cpl. Justin Dreimanis\/DND-MDN Canada\/Reuters) Social Sharing Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are back on home soil,\u00a0almost three years after they were first detained in China. The two men landed in Calgary shortly before 8 a.m. ET Saturday aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force Challenger aircraft. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00a0and Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau\u00a0were\u00a0at the airport to welcome the two men, who had flown from China along with ambassador Dominic Barton. Trudeau announced Friday evening that the two were out of Chinese airspace, just hours after the extradition case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was dropped. Meng\u00a0reached a deferred prosecution agreement\u00a0with U.S. authorities\u00a0related to fraud charges against her on Friday and landed back in China Saturday morning. Michael Kovrig\u00a0reboarded a plane in Calgary to fly\u00a0on to Toronto, where\u00a0Vina Nadjibulla, his wife\u00a0(separated), and his sister\u00a0Ariana Botha\u00a0spoke\u00a0before he landed. \"There are no words to describe the emotions that have been running through us these last 24 hours.

Their\u00a0detention is widely considered to be a retaliatory action in response to the Huawei executive's arrest. Michael Spavor gives a thumbs up after landing in Calgary Saturday morning. He and Michael Kovrig returned home after being detained in China for nearly three years. (Colin Hall\/CBC) 'Sorry for the inconvenience caused': Meng Chinese authorities had consistently denied that the cases were linked. In a statement Saturday, China's foreign ministry said the charges against Meng were \"purely fabricated.\" \"It has long been a fully proven fact that this is an incident of political persecution against a Chinese citizen, an act designed to hobble Chinese high-tech companies,\" the statement said. Spavor\u00a0was found guilty of spying and sentenced to 11 years in prison and deportation by\u00a0a Chinese court in August. The trial for Kovrig\u00a0concluded in March, but he had not yet been sentenced.

Speaking Friday outside a Vancouver courthouse after her extradition case was dropped, Meng thanked the court and the Canadian government for \"upholding the rule of law.\" \"I'm also grateful to the Canadian people and media friends for your tolerance. Sorry for the inconvenience caused,\" she said. Meng spent her time in Canada under house arrest at her multimillion-dollar home in Vancouver, in stark contrast to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who endured poor conditions in detention and whose legal processes were criticized by Canadian officials.

They arrived in Calgary aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force Challenger on Saturday morning, and Kovrig later flew to Toronto. She noted that Spavor's and Kovrig's detention\u00a0had\u00a0already sent a message to other countries \"that if they cross China, then Beijing will just pick up a couple of their citizens and hold them hostage.\" \"And that's a chilling message for other countries to be receiving today.\" Robertson said Canadians should give significant credit for the release of the men to U.S. President Joe Biden. \"As the prime minister said, this was the top issue in terms of Canada-China relations, but also a top issue in Canada-U.S. relations,\" he said. \"President Biden has delivered now for Justin Trudeau.

L\u2019accident a provoqu\u00e9 un important embouteillage alors que les \u00e9quipes d\u2019urgence se rendaient sur les lieux.

Mayors argue the religious symbol is a heritage object CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Apr 02, 2019 4:30 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 3, 2019 Quebec City Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume says the crucifix hanging in the chambers at Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. (Daniel Coulombe\/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Less than a week after the CAQ government said once its religious neutrality legislation, Bill 21, passes, it will\u00a0remove the crucifix that has hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly for more than eight decades, two major Quebec municipalities\u00a0have announced they will not be following suit. Quebec City and Sherbrooke have both announced the crucifix\u00a0on the wall\u00a0of\u00a0their respective city council chambers will stay put \u2014 unlike in Montreal, where Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante announced last month the crucifix in that city's chamber would be removed. In Quebec City, the debate over whether the crucifix should be removed hasn't come up in the council chambers, the vice-chair\u00a0of the executive committee, Coun. R\u00e9my Normand, said last month. Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume\u00a0said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. POINT\/COUNTERPOINT Should the crucifix in Quebec's National Assembly come down? Labeaume said\u00a0the crucifix in Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. \"I don't like it when people trivialize the past,\" Labeaume said Thursday. \"Believe me, I'm secular. I don't necessarily practise religion.\" In Sherbrooke, elected officials ruled Monday night the crucifix will remain in the chambers of city council chambers and the borough council. (Daniel Mailloux\/Radio-Canada) Sherbrooke city council\u00a0votes Meanwhile, in Sherbrooke, council voted Monday night for the crucifix to remain on the wall of\u00a0city council chambers, as well as borough council chambers. Ten councillors voted to keep the crucifix in the room, and five against. Coun.\u00a0Annie Godbout said the question was met with passionate debate. \"I would have preferred to take the time to see how the debate will unfold in Quebec,\" Godbout said. \"I'm extremely disappointed with how we went about this.\" Sherbrooke Mayor Steve Lussier said he sees the crucifix as a symbol of the past. \"If it stays, for me, it doesn't change anything,\" Lussier said. Crucifix in Montreal council chambers coming down, executive committee says In Montreal, Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante\u00a0said\u00a0the decision to remove the crucifix was\u00a0a recognition of the role of secularism in a democratic institution. The crucifix is an important part of Montreal's heritage and history, but as a symbol, it does not reflect the modern reality of secularism in democratic institutions, Plante said. The cross will be placed in a special museum space at City Hall that will be accessible to all Montrealers, she said. The crucifix that's hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly since 1936 will also find a new home elsewhere in the government building, in the wake\u00a0of the motion promising to remove it that passed on March 28 \u2014\u00a0the same day the controversial religious symbols bill was tabled. Quebec City Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. (Daniel Coulombe\/Radio-Canada) The motion passed easily, although just\u00a0last fall, a newly elected Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault had\u00a0said the crucifix was there to stay \u2014\u00a0describing it not as a religious symbol but a historical one. Quebec government's proposed secularism law would ban public workers from wearing religious symbols Legault said the CAQ government's initiative to take down the crucifix was meant as a sign of good faith to Quebecers who oppose Bill 21 that he is willing to compromise. Other cities' plans Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, in Quebec's Mauricie region, has a cross hanging in the council chambers\u00a0and a crucifix in a side room where the council gathers before public meetings. The council has\u00a0not taken an\u00a0official position on\u00a0moving\u00a0or removing\u00a0the cross and\u00a0crucifix, said city spokesperson\u00a0Cynthia Simard. Gatineau and Saguenay don't have crucifixes in their city council chambers. A spokesperson for Saguenay said the city doesn't want to wade into the controversial debate. In 2015, a Supreme Court ruling forced former Saguenay Mayor Jean Tremblay to stop reciting a Catholic\u00a0prayer\u00a0at the start of city council meetings. At a 2015 news conference, Tremblay invoked the memory of Quebec's religious founders, saying \"we are all children of these people.\" He made reference to\u00a0Quebec's motto, as well \u2014 \"Je me souviens,\" or \"I remember.\" Former Saguenay mayor Jean Tremblay led a battle to retain the recitation of a Catholic prayer before council meetings all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, but lost in April 2015. (CBC) \"We have to stand up for our customs, for our traditions,\" Tremblay said. The legal battle\u00a0surrounded the prayer\u00a0and the presence of the Sacred Heart statue, and not a crucifix, a Saguenay spokesperson said.

{"year":"2019","month":"03","event_desc":"Proceedings of the Senate of Canada were televised for the first time in the chamber's history.","text":"Politics Ready for their closeup: Senate begins broadcasting proceedings for first time For the first time ever, the Senate of Canada's chamber proceedings will be televised. After years of opposition from some members of the Red Chamber \u2014 who said they feared televising debates would undermine their quality \u2014 administrators will flip the switch on Monday. Social Sharing 42 years after the House of Commons began broadcasting, Senate chamber proceedings to be televised John Paul Tasker \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Mar 18, 2019 4:48 PM ET | Last Updated: March 19, 2019 The Senate of Canada building and Senate Chamber are pictured in Ottawa on Monday, Feb. 18, 2019. The Senate will remain in what is Ottawa's Old Train Station during the renovations of the Parliament Hill Centre Block. (Sean Kilpatrick\/The Canadian Press) Starting today, and for the first time ever, the Senate of Canada's chamber proceedings will be televised. The change comes after\u00a0years of opposition from some members of the Red Chamber \u2014 who said they feared televising debates would undermine their quality. While the debates in the\u00a0House of Commons have been beamed into the nation's homes since 1977 , the upper house has been notably camera-shy. In fact, the Senate is believed\u00a0to be the last legislative chamber in the Western world that hasn't televised its proceedings. To date, only people willing to attend Senate proceedings in person, listen to streamed audio or read next-day transcripts\u00a0have been privy to all that goes on in the place. Senator Claude Carignan said the lack of cameras in the chamber has left Canadians with an incomplete understanding of what senators do. (Sean Kilpatrick\/CP) (There have been notable exceptions to the no-camera\u00a0rule for high-profile moments, including\u00a0some of the Senate's debates on assisted dying legislation and cannabis legalization .) Playing to the cameras Some members\u00a0of the Senate have said they\u00a0fear\u00a0bringing in broadcast equipment will change fundamentally\u00a0the nature of debate in a chamber of appointees that was designed to offer \"sober second thought\" on government business. Some senators worry that members of the upper house \u2014 who traditionally\u00a0have carried out their work\u00a0with a minimum of partisan rancour \u2014 will become like so many MPs who prefer playing to the cameras to engaging in serious debate. Conservative Manitoba Sen. Don Plett\u00a0said as much in an interview with the National Post, arguing that the presence of cameras has turned some MPs into actors. \"I would like to believe that it will maybe improve behaviour, and maybe it will,\" he said. \"But my fear is that it will do the opposite, it will make us more flamboyant and it will make us put on shows for the camera.\" Sen. Peter Harder speaks on Parliament Hill. (Justin Tang\/Canadian Press) B.C. Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, the leader (or 'facilitator') of the Independent Senators Group, said that while he thinks broadcasting generally is a good idea \u2014\u00a0and could discourage some of the \" obstructionist activity \" he's seen in the place in recent months \u2014 he fears an increase in \"theatrics\" by some members of the Conservative opposition. Woo\u00a0told CBC News that while sunlight can be the best disinfectant, \"sunlight also encourages people to grandstand, to put on displays of partisan activity. \"If in fact we have senators trying to use broadcasting as a platform for electioneering or partisanship point-scoring, that would become very obvious to the viewers ... and will be very less desirable from my perspective,\" he said. \"It's left to be seen ... We're hoping broadcasting will bring out the best in our efforts to be less partisan and to demonstrate to Canadians that this place is not a mirror of the House of Commons. We are not here to replicate their work\u00a0... (to) mimic the partisan antics in the House. We are a complementary chamber.\" Other members of the Senate say they believe that by broadcasting more of the chamber's work (most Senate committees have been broadcast on the Cable Public Affairs Channel\u00a0\u2014\u00a0CPAC \u2014 and online for some time), they'll be able to do a better job of showing Canadians what senators actually do. Conservative Quebec Sen. Claude Carignan, the former leader of the Conservative party in the Senate, supports the change and endorsed the Senate modernization committee's report on the matter . \"Because the work of the Senate is not televised, unlike the work of its committees, Canadians are misinformed about the concrete action being taken by senators in shaping our country's legislation. Canadians do not see how much discussion and debate occurs regarding bills that will affect them,\" Carignan said. 'Very concerning': Senate watchdog hasn't finished an ethics probe since 2017 Senate rejects calls for outside oversight of expenses Senate proceedings should be televised, committee says \"Broadcasting our proceedings will surely be a new and important step on our journey toward transparency in the Senate and in our efforts to make the public aware of senators' legislative work. The lack of visual exposure gives people the impression that the Senate is outdated.\" Following the Senate expenses scandal, the internal economy subcommittee on communications commissioned a study \u2014\u00a0a \"blueprint\" on how to move forward after years of bad press, while improving its outreach with the media and the public. One of the report's recommendations, ultimately approved by the Senate, was to broadcast\u00a0the chamber's proceedings on TV through an agreement with CPAC\u00a0and on the Senate's own website. And now that the Senate has settled into its new temporary home in the former Ottawa train station while Centre Block undergoes\u00a0a decade-long renovation, senators are now finally ready for their on-camera debut. 'A necessary evil' \"Broadcasting from the chamber is inevitable. It's a\u00a0necessary evil. It compounds the perception that we are a private club, non-transparent and not accountable, if we don't broadcast,\" one unnamed senator told the auditors preparing the communications blueprint report. The report did document some entrenched skepticism. \"I have mixed feelings about TV in the Chamber because, [while] it could contribute to transparency and we do televise committees, in the Chamber \u2026 the leader is the only one rising to speak [in Question Period] and he is \u2026 very scripted. It's not an accurate reflection of the Senate's good work,\" one said. \"I am not in favour of cameras in the Chamber as it will not serve us well. It will damage us because we have duty rosters that say that half of us are in the Chamber at a time, so that's not a good camera shot,\" another senator said. Regular viewers of Commons proceedings will notice some differences if they tune into the Senate. The government's representative in the Senate, Ontario Sen. Peter Harder, fields virtually all of the questions in question period \u2014 a Q&A session that typically isn't quite as long as the one in the Commons. Before the expenses scandal\u00a0and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's reforms, the Senate government leader (or \"representative\") usually was the only member of cabinet who sat in the Senate \u2014 the only one who could speak with ministerial authority on government matters. Harder has taken on the job even though he sits outside cabinet and identifies as a \"non-affiliated\" member of the Senate. Since the reforms, some ministers have appeared before the Senate for special 40-minute \"ministerial question periods.\" Also, senators don't have to address the Speaker when making their remarks or engaging in debate in the chamber; they speak directly to one another for most exchanges. In the Commons, everything must go through the Speaker\u00a0and MPs\u00a0cannot use a member's name. And\u00a0unlike the House, the Senate runs through the order paper in full each day so that any senator can speak to an active issue. This can make for a more time-consuming process.

Mayors argue the religious symbol is a heritage object CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Apr 02, 2019 4:30 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 3, 2019 Quebec City Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume says the crucifix hanging in the chambers at Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. (Daniel Coulombe\/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Less than a week after the CAQ government said once its religious neutrality legislation, Bill 21, passes, it will\u00a0remove the crucifix that has hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly for more than eight decades, two major Quebec municipalities\u00a0have announced they will not be following suit. Quebec City and Sherbrooke have both announced the crucifix\u00a0on the wall\u00a0of\u00a0their respective city council chambers will stay put \u2014 unlike in Montreal, where Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante announced last month the crucifix in that city's chamber would be removed. In Quebec City, the debate over whether the crucifix should be removed hasn't come up in the council chambers, the vice-chair\u00a0of the executive committee, Coun. R\u00e9my Normand, said last month. Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume\u00a0said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. POINT\/COUNTERPOINT Should the crucifix in Quebec's National Assembly come down? Labeaume said\u00a0the crucifix in Quebec City Hall is a heritage object, and he's against the idea of erasing all religious symbols in the name of secularism. \"I don't like it when people trivialize the past,\" Labeaume said Thursday. \"Believe me, I'm secular. I don't necessarily practise religion.\" In Sherbrooke, elected officials ruled Monday night the crucifix will remain in the chambers of city council chambers and the borough council. (Daniel Mailloux\/Radio-Canada) Sherbrooke city council\u00a0votes Meanwhile, in Sherbrooke, council voted Monday night for the crucifix to remain on the wall of\u00a0city council chambers, as well as borough council chambers. Ten councillors voted to keep the crucifix in the room, and five against. Coun.\u00a0Annie Godbout said the question was met with passionate debate. \"I would have preferred to take the time to see how the debate will unfold in Quebec,\" Godbout said. \"I'm extremely disappointed with how we went about this.\" Sherbrooke Mayor Steve Lussier said he sees the crucifix as a symbol of the past. \"If it stays, for me, it doesn't change anything,\" Lussier said. Crucifix in Montreal council chambers coming down, executive committee says In Montreal, Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante\u00a0said\u00a0the decision to remove the crucifix was\u00a0a recognition of the role of secularism in a democratic institution. The crucifix is an important part of Montreal's heritage and history, but as a symbol, it does not reflect the modern reality of secularism in democratic institutions, Plante said. The cross will be placed in a special museum space at City Hall that will be accessible to all Montrealers, she said. The crucifix that's hung above the Speaker's chair in the National Assembly since 1936 will also find a new home elsewhere in the government building, in the wake\u00a0of the motion promising to remove it that passed on March 28 \u2014\u00a0the same day the controversial religious symbols bill was tabled. Quebec City Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume said he's not fully opposed to moving the crucifix, but that for now, it's staying put. (Daniel Coulombe\/Radio-Canada) The motion passed easily, although just\u00a0last fall, a newly elected Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault had\u00a0said the crucifix was there to stay \u2014\u00a0describing it not as a religious symbol but a historical one. Quebec government's proposed secularism law would ban public workers from wearing religious symbols Legault said the CAQ government's initiative to take down the crucifix was meant as a sign of good faith to Quebecers who oppose Bill 21 that he is willing to compromise. Other cities' plans Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, in Quebec's Mauricie region, has a cross hanging in the council chambers\u00a0and a crucifix in a side room where the council gathers before public meetings. The council has\u00a0not taken an\u00a0official position on\u00a0moving\u00a0or removing\u00a0the cross and\u00a0crucifix, said city spokesperson\u00a0Cynthia Simard. Gatineau and Saguenay don't have crucifixes in their city council chambers. A spokesperson for Saguenay said the city doesn't want to wade into the controversial debate. In 2015, a Supreme Court ruling forced former Saguenay Mayor Jean Tremblay to stop reciting a Catholic\u00a0prayer\u00a0at the start of city council meetings. At a 2015 news conference, Tremblay invoked the memory of Quebec's religious founders, saying \"we are all children of these people.\" He made reference to\u00a0Quebec's motto, as well \u2014 \"Je me souviens,\" or \"I remember.\" Former Saguenay mayor Jean Tremblay led a battle to retain the recitation of a Catholic prayer before council meetings all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, but lost in April 2015. (CBC) \"We have to stand up for our customs, for our traditions,\" Tremblay said. The legal battle\u00a0surrounded the prayer\u00a0and the presence of the Sacred Heart statue, and not a crucifix, a Saguenay spokesperson said.

(RCMP) Social Sharing RCMP believe they have found the bodies of B.C. fugitives Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky in northern Manitoba, ending a lengthy cross-Canada search for the suspects in three killings that gripped the world. The remains of two men were found Wednesday at around 10\u00a0a.m local time in dense brush, eight kilometres northeast of where a burnt-out Toyota RAV4, which police believe the two fugitives were driving, was found. The bodies of tourists Chynna Deese and Lucas Fowler, left, were found near Liard Hot Springs, B.C., on July 15. University lecturer Leonard Dyck, right, was found dead four days later near Dease Lake, B.C. (New South Wales Police; University of British Columbia) \"At this time, we believe that these are the bodies of the two suspects wanted in connection with the homicides in British Columbia,\" said Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy, commanding officer of the Manitoba RCMP. Autopsies in Winnipeg on Thursday will determine, conclusively, the identities of the bodies and causes of death, the RCMP said. Police were seen loading caskets onto an RCMP plane in Gillam Wednesday evening. McLeod, 19, and Schmegelsky, whose 19th birthday was Aug. 4, are suspects in three homicides in northern British Columbia. Timeline: How 3 killings in B.C. turned into the cross-Canada pursuit of 2 teenagers The pair were charged July 24 with second-degree murder in the death of botanist Leonard Dyck. The 64-year-old was found dead July 19 at a highway pullout about two kilometres from a burnt-out\u00a0camper truck \u2014\u00a0believed to be driven by\u00a0McLeod and Schmegelsky \u2014\u00a0south of the B.C.'s Stikine River Bridge on Highway 37. The lifelong friends are also suspected of gunning down a young couple, Lucas Fowler, 23, an Australian, and Chynna Deese, 24, an American. Their bodies were found on Alaska Highway, south of Liard Hot Springs, B.C., on July 15. MacLatchy\u00a0said\u00a0she hopes Wednesday's\u00a0announcement\u00a0brings closure. \"I know it has been so very difficult,\" she said. Sheila Deese, the mother of Chynna Deese, declined to speak with CBC\u00a0News about the RCMP's discovery Wednesday, saying she is \"speechless.\" Over the course of 16 days, RCMP scoured more than 11,000 square kilometres in northern Manitoba \u2014 an area about twice the size of P.E.I. \u2014 and logged more than\u00a04,500 hours during the search. The shell of a burnt-out Toyota RAV4 was found near Fox Lake Cree Nation in northern Manitoba. (Billy Beardy) Officers, with help from the military, searched from the air, by boat, underwater, through spongy, wet muskeg and amid dense scrub, teeming with insects. The two men considered themselves survivalists, Schmegelsky's father told Victoria's CHEK News. But locals warned that the remote area was treacherous, home to bears, and impossible for someone without local knowledge to navigate. For nearly two weeks, the key evidence\u00a0tracing the two suspects to the area was a confirmed sighting of the pair on July 22 and the burnt remains of the Toyota SUV, which was found the same day in Fox Lake Cree Nation, on a dead-end road into Manitoba's north. On Wednesday, the RCMP confirmed the vehicle belonged to Dyck. The RCMP scoured more than 11,000 square kilometres in northern Manitoba. (Gilbert Rowan\/CBC) As concerns about the two men spread, places like Sudbury, Ont., and Kapuskasing, Ont., reported alleged sightings. RCMP received more than 1,000 tips. Search crews in Manitoba briefly shifted focus to York Landing, Man., on July 28\u00a0after a volunteer with the Bear Clan reported seeing them near the dump. The tip led nowhere. The hunt spanned four provinces and more than 2,000 kilometres, with the fugitives choosing remote, isolated routes to evade detection. \"This is like travelling from London to Moscow, to put things in perspective,\" said B.C. RCMP\u00a0Assistant Commissioner Kevin Hackett. Hackett called it one of the most unpredictable investigations he's had in recent years. Buggy, boggy and brutal: Area of northern Manitoba search is unforgiving, experts say On July 31, after nine days without a trace of the two men, the RCMP announced they were scaling down the search. But as MacLatchy noted on Wednesday, they didn't stop looking. \"We knew we needed just to find that one piece of evidence,\" she said. Two days later, on Friday, police got a break. A damaged boat and several personal items linked to the fugitives\u00a0were found along the Nelson River which flows north between Gillam and Fox Lake and eventually empties into Hudson Bay. \"Following this discovery, we were at last able to narrow down the search,\" said MacLatchy. The Nelson River flows north from Lake Winnipeg to Hudson Bay, and Gillam is located near its banks. (Angela Johnston\/CBC) Clint Sawchuk, owner of Nelson River Adventures, thinks he might have helped draw RCMP attention to the wide, fast-moving river that powers several hydro-electric dams. He spotted what appeared to be a sleeping bag caught in willows\u00a0and reported it to the RCMP. He believes the Mounties spotted the boat as they flew by helicopter to investigate. \"I'm very happy it's over and they found them,\" he said. Across northern Manitoba, there was a sigh of relief following news of the discovery.\u00a0Throughout the hunt, RCMP had repeatedly warned the public they believed McLeod and Schmegelsky\u00a0were armed and dangerous. Residents had locked doors and travelled in groups while the men were considered at large. A casket is loaded by RCMP into a plane near Gillam, Man. RCMP said Wednesday they believe they have found the bodies of B.C. fugitives Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky near the northern Manitoba community. (Angela Johnston\/CBC) \"[I'm feeling] just a sense of relief for all communities involved in the north here \u2026 knowing that we don't have to be concerned about the presence of these individuals any longer,\" said Dwayne Forman, mayor of Gillam. In Fox Lake Cree Nation, the community where police believe McLeod and Schmegelsky abandoned the RAV4, was\u00a0grateful that the search is over. \"It comes with huge relief to the community of Fox Lake Cree Nation that this ordeal may finally be coming to a conclusion,\" said Chief Walter Spence. John Peters, a resident of Fox Lake Cree Nation, said there are feelings of relief in his community \u2014 but also a sense of sadness. \"I can't speak for anyone else but I feel this ending is tragic,\" he said. \"It will feel nice to get back into the bush, though, without feeling I need to always be on the lookout, that tension will be gone.\" What we know about Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky, targets of national manhunt In Depth Transfixed by tragedy: mystery of alleged 'team killers' captures world's attention Spence and Forman plan to hold community meetings to discuss \"post-traumatic effects\" the search had, said Spence. Meanwhile, RCMP in British Columbia said late Wednesday the investigation is not over. \"We still need to ensure that our investigative findings\u2026 eliminates any other possibilities or suspects,\" said Hackett. Police said it's difficult to guess what may have been the motive behind the three killings \u2014 and it may now be impossible to determine that if the bodies are indeed those of the two men. Corrections An earlier version of this story said Bryer Schmegelsky's birthday was Aug. 5 when in fact, according to a self-published book by his father Alan Schmegelsky, he was born Aug. 4, 2000.

Jacques Boissinot\/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u2019s government passed a ban on some public servants wearing religious symbols in a final vote late Sunday night, enshrining into law a measure decried by opposition parties, minority groups and human-rights observers as an affront to personal liberty. The National Assembly debated Bill 21 under closure in a marathon special weekend session that ended with Mr. Legault\u2019s Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec government forcing passage of the law by a 73-35 vote, with backing of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Earlier Sunday, the CAQ used its majority to push through Bill 9, a law that enables new French-language and values tests that the government says will protect Quebec identity while refocusing immigration on economic interests. The weekend in the legislature was marked by acrimony reflective of the debate that has roiled Quebec for more than 10 years over the place of religious minorities in the province. Some exhausted MNAs cursed at each other, others said they were on the verge of tears at times. At the very last minute Mr. Legault\u2019s government added a provision to allow inspectors to verify the law is being followed. \u201cSecuralism police!\u201d shouted Quebec Liberal member Marc Tanguay in one of the final outbursts of the debate. Another last-minute amendment said the inspector could impose corrective measures and supervision. A final addition said \u201cthe targeted employee could be subject to disciplinary measures for failing to comply.\u201d Bill 21 will ban teachers, police, government lawyers and others in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols such as Muslim head coverings and Sikh turbans. Police officers, provincial jail guards and prosecutors who wear religious symbols are rare in Quebec but the province has dozens of female Muslim teachers. Religiously dressed teachers already on the job will have acquired rights to continue wearing the garments but they will not be able to take a transfer, promotion or new job and wear them. The law will also require people receiving or giving government services to uncover their faces for security purposes or confirming identity \u2013 a measure that mostly affects Muslim women who wear a full-face veil. The law includes the notwithstanding clause to prevent challenges based on religious freedom under Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It also modifies Quebec\u2019s Charter of Rights to reduce religious rights, marking the first time the National Assembly changed the landmark 1975 rights legislation without a consensus. Religious groups and rights lawyers say they will try to strike down the law anyway. The law will most affect Muslim women and the notwithstanding clause cannot be used to shield gender-discrimination cases. Montreal school boards and some municipal leaders have said they will not apply the law. On the weekend, the School of Education at Bishop\u2019s University became the latest group to reject the law, calling it \u201ca dangerous precedent that creates a climate of suspicion, fear and hostility that serves to render the profession of teaching unsafe, and schools less safe, for everyone.\u201d Several opposition members called Sunday a dark day for Quebec. Mr. Legault said he is putting to rest a divisive debate and is acting on the will of the people. His law is popular, particularly among the province\u2019s francophone majority. \u201cThere are collective rights, and Quebeckers have a right to tell the rest of Canada, \u2018This is how we live in Quebec,\u2019\u201d Mr. Legault told reporters. In the shadow of the Bill 21 controversy, Bill 9, the immigration law passed Sunday, is also a source of conflict. The province\u2019s plan to deny residency to immigrants who fail French-language and values tests is in protracted negotiations with Ottawa. The bill is also controversial because it throws out 18,000 applications already filed under the old system. Iranian computer programmer Armin Khodaei first applied to immigrate to Quebec five years ago and spent more than $1,200 for test and application fees, French lessons and postage. His file is now in the dustbin. \u201cI\u2019ve invested a big part of my life into this project, and unfortunately I know now it was the wrong decision,\u201d he said. Mr. Legault says applicants such as Mr. Khodaei can reapply under the new system and will get quicker answers. Mr. Khodaei, 30, says he is moving on to other potential destinations. But unanswered questions remain about Bill 21, which makes Quebec the only jurisdiction in North America with a religion-based dress code. It\u2019s not clear who will decide if a head scarf is a fashion statement or a religious one. Just last week, Mr. Legault was uncertain if a wedding ring might be banned. (He later said it would not be.) The Quebec Liberal Party and Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire were against the law. \u201cWe have been proud of the progress we\u2019ve made on discrimination since we passed our bill of rights unanimously in 1975 to include religious liberty,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne David, the Liberal critic on the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day.\u201d Left-wing separatist Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire MNA and co-spokesperson Sol Zanetti predicted the government will send religious minorities \u201cinto the arms of Canada to defend their rights and freedoms. Mr. Legault says he\u2019s protecting social cohesion; it\u2019s this law that puts social cohesion in peril.\u201d Other hard-line Quebec nationalists said the government did not go far enough to limit religious expression. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois wanted the law to include daycare instructors, a job that is often a first entry point into the work force for immigrant women, including hundreds of Muslims. \u201cThe issue is coherence,\u201d PQ interim leader Pascal B\u00e9rub\u00e9 said. \u201cQuebeckers strongly favour including daycare and private schools.

First Canadian woman to win tourney since Faye Urban in 1969 John Chidley-Hill \u00b7 The Canadian Press \u00b7 Posted: Aug 11, 2019 2:16 PM EDT | Last Updated: August 11, 2019 Bianca Andreescu, 19, kisses the winner's trophy after being declared Rogers Cup champion on Sunday when tennis legend Serena Williams was forced to retire from the match with a reported upper-back injury. Andreescu is the first Canadian woman to win the tourney in 50 years. (Evan Mitsui\/CBC News) Social Sharing As soon as Bianca Andreescu heard that Serena Williams was retiring from their Rogers Cup final, she went to her opponent's bench, took a knee, and started consoling the veteran tennis player. Lost in that moment of empathy was the fact that Andreescu had just become the first Canadian to win the tournament in 50 years. Rogers Cup Bianca Andreescu hailed as 'old soul' in abrupt victory over Serena Williams \"I started tearing up because she was tearing up. It's because I know how she feels,\" said Andreescu on Sunday. \"Injuries really, really suck.\" Andreescu, from Mississauga, Ont., was up 3-1 in the first set at Aviva Centre when Williams called for a medical timeout. Less than a minute later, the chair umpire announced that Williams was retiring from the match, handing Andreescu her second WTA Premier title of the season. WATCH |\u00a0Canadian teen sensation Bianca Andreescu wins her 1st Rogers Cup: Bianca Andreescu consoles Serena Williams after abrupt end to Rogers Cup final 6 years ago Duration 2:14 Bianca Andreescu and Serena Williams shared an emotional embrace after Williams was forced to retire from the Rogers Cup final due to injury.  Andreescu is the first Canadian woman to win the Rogers Cup since Faye Urban in 1969. \"It's not the way I wanted to win, but a win is a win so I'm really happy,\" said Andreescu, who is the first Canadian to win the title since Faye Urban of Windsor, Ont., beat Vancouver's Vicki Berner in 1969. The tournament was still played on clay courts and called the Canadian Open when Urban won. Williams was impressed with the 19-year-old Andreescu's class in that shared moment on the bench, calling her a \"great sportswoman\" and an \"old soul.\" \"She's wiser than her, what is she? Nineteen years old?\" said the 37-year-old Williams, who added that the brief encounter with Andreescu was the highlight of the tournament for her. \"She definitely doesn't seem like a 19-year old in her words, on court and her game, her attitude, her actions.\" Andreescu also won at Indian Wells in March, the beginning of a 17-match win streak, not counting when she has had to retire from matches due to injury herself. She holds victories over seven of the top 10 players in the world this season, including Williams.

Truly an inspiration to players across Canada. Today you showed tennis fans what sportsmanship is all about. &mdash; @JustinTrudeau \"I would say that the win in Indian Wells was \u2014 I mean, it was a hard-fought battle,\" said Andreescu, referring to her three-set win over No. 8 Angelique Kerber. \"So I felt like it was a sweeter victory at the time. \"But (the Rogers Cup) is at home. I've dedicated so much hard work and sweat on that tennis court and in this gym, so this tournament is definitely ten times more special.\" Lou Marsh favourite Andreescu and golfer Brooke Henderson are early front runners for the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's athlete of the year and the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award, The Canadian Press's female athlete of the year honour. Henderson has won two LPGA events this season and has set the all-time record for wins by a Canadian professional golfer. Andreescu has her two titles this season and her world ranking will rise from 27th to 14th on Monday. Her previous high was 22nd.

But if I win that, then it would be awesome. I'm not complaining right now,\" said Andreescu. \"I haven't really thought about anything other than this win. So anything outside of this is a bonus.\" The Rogers Cup was Andreescu's first tournament after a right-shoulder injury sidelined her since the French Open in May. Battle of attrition Andreescu had been on the court more than any other player at this year's Rogers Cup at 10 hours 54 minutes heading into Sunday's final. All that playing took a toll on Andreescu, who needed a medical timeout in her quarterfinal win over world No. 3 Karolina Pliskova to have her groin taped. Both legs were wrapped and taped for her next two matches. Sunday's final lasted only 16 minutes before Williams's medical timeout brought it to a premature end. \"It's not easy for Serena, for sure, to pull out, especially to pull out in a final,\" said Andreescu. \"I know how she feels because I've done that many times in my short career.

Williams said the injury is a recurring back spasm that doesn't affect her ability to walk but makes serves and overhand shots painful. She expected to go to Cincinnati for the next stop on the WTA Tour to test it out ahead of the U.S. Open. \"The most frustrating part is that I've had these awful spasms a lot in my career,\" said Williams. \"And they're incredibly painful, but it goes away after, like, 24, 36, maybe 48 hours, and like clockwork. \"So I do different treatments. I take a day off. But obviously, I didn't have 24 hours or plus to take off (ahead of the Rogers Cup final).\" WATCH | Serena Williams post-match press conference: Serena Williams says she's officially a fan of Bianca Andreescu 6 years ago Duration 5:50 Serena Williams spoke to the media after having to retire from the Rogers Cup final due to injury.

(Ryan Patrick Jones\/CBC) Social Sharing The Northwest Territories' elections agency is stepping up efforts to get young people to the polls this October, in the hopes of improving on a poor showing in the last federal election. A co-ordinated social media campaign, a physical presence at community events, free election swag, and recruiting young people as poll workers and outreach workers are just some of the strategies Elections NWT is undertaking to spread awareness and influence young people to vote. Voting in the N.W.T. is about to become easier The main message the organization wants to send: young people can make a difference. \"We're essentially wanting them to understand that the government is shaping the North and their future, that they should have a hand in shaping the government,\" said Nicole Latour, chief electoral officer of the N.W.T. \"If they all did come out to the polls, they collectively are very influential.\" Young adult turnout low in 2015 The agency has a difficult task ahead of it, as voter turnout among young adults for the 2015 election was extremely low. In a report released in May , Elections NWT\u00a0found that 2,411 people between the ages of 18 and 35 voted, out of a total of 12,042 eligible voters or 20 per cent. Voters in Yellowknife were the biggest no-shows. Out of the seven electoral districts that make up the territorial capital, only 16.7 per cent of young adults came out to vote. Total voter turnout in the territorial election was 44 per cent. Latour said the issue is a lack of awareness among young adults. \"I don't think in the North we've been particularly good about providing the information to young adults,\" said Latour. \"At 16, they know they can get a driver's licence, and at 19\u00a0they know they can get into a licensed establishment, but nobody seems to know that at 18 you become an eligible elector.\" Youth ambassador program Elections NWT wants young people take the lead in promoting awareness, said Nara Dapilos, who is responsible for co-ordinating\u00a0the agency's youth programs. \"It's important that we kind of empower each other as youth \u2026 that we see people our age engaging and voting and participating,\" she said. To that end, Elections NWT is recruiting \"youth engagement ambassadors\" from each community across the N.W.T. to start conversations with young people on social media and at community events about the details of the election: how to register, where and when to vote, and the importance of voting. The youth ambassadors will be in place during the writ period from Sept. 2 until election day on Oct. 1 and will receive a $500 stipend for their efforts. Elections NWT will also hire people between the ages of 18 and 24 to work as poll workers on voting day. Latour said she hopes this will have a ripple effect and they will encourage their friends and family to vote. The agency has also started the\u00a0hashtag\u00a0#TruantNoMore\u00a0in the hopes of spreading awareness on social media. \"'Truant no more' is basically just a statement saying, 'We are going to vote, we are combating absenteeism and we are going to participate,'\" said Dapilos. Beyond engaging youth, Latour\u00a0said recent changes to the electoral process , including the introduction of online voting, a longer voting period, and the launch of a new website, Electorhood \u2014\u00a0a digital platform that allows voters to track the progress of the election in real time \u2014 will help reduce barriers to voting and influence more people of all ages to cast their ballots. Latour says she hopes a public information campaign will drive better voter turnout in the coming territorial election. (Avery Zingel) Northern challenges Jerald Sabin, a politics professor at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke, Que., who studies northern politics, said communities in the North face particular challenges when it comes to electoral participation, from the consensus governance system to demographics. \"The absence of political parties really places a high informational burden on voters to learn about the issues and to learn about where each candidate in their riding stands,\" said Sabin. \"They can be a barrier to people feeling comfortable to vote.\" Elections NWT launches contest to galvanize young voters Sabin said the \"high turnover\" among the settler population in the territory\u00a0is another factor. \"With people moving into Yellowknife, and then moving back out for job opportunities or for education, it means that people haven't put down the roots necessary to participate in the electoral system,\" he said. \"It takes a while to establish yourself in the community, to get engaged in politics, and to become interested in participating.\" Latour believes\u00a0Elections NWT can overcome these challenges. \"The more that [young people] engage their friends and they come out and have discussions amongst themselves and decide who's the best representation for them, the more that they play a role in what happens in the future of the North,\" she said.

{"year":"2020","month":"01","event_desc":"The country confirms its first COVID-19 case in Toronto.","text":"Man who flew to Toronto from China is Canada's first coronavirus case Nicole Thompson, The Canadian Press Published Saturday, January 25, 2020 5:39PM EST Last Updated Sunday, January 26, 2020 7:39PM EST TORONTO - A man in his 50s who travelled to Toronto from China earlier this week has become the first Canadian case of the new coronavirus, health officials said Saturday as they urged calm in the face of an international outbreak. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said the case was considered \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d until the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg finds the same positive results as the tests conducted in Toronto. Still, officials said they were taking all precautions to keep people safe, interviewing all those who were in contact with the man between Wednesday, when he landed in Toronto, and Thursday, when he went to hospital. \u201cThe risk to Ontarians is still low and things are managed and well-controlled,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAs I hoped, the system is operating as it should.\u201d Williams said provincial authorities are also working with their federal counterparts to contact people who sat within a few rows of the man on the plane he took to Toronto, but he noted that even those people shouldn't worry too much. \u201cYou have to be more than just casually walking by someone,\u201d he said. He added that the widely available information about the illness appears to have contributed to the early detection of this case. \u201cThe individual, knowing his responsibility, when feeling unwell, even without having really severe symptoms, was concerned enough and informed prompt enough,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat just tells you that people have knowledge of it, they want to take proper precautions to protect their health and protect their family members and others.\u201d His deputy, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, said the positive test result came in on Saturday afternoon, two days after the patient called 911 to report feeling ill. As of Saturday evening, he was in stable condition in a negative pressure room, which is used in hospitals to contain airborne contaminants. \u201cThe emergency service was aware of his travel history and used full precautions,\u201d she said, noting he had spent time in Wuhan, the virus's epicentre. The news of Canada's first coronavirus patient comes as authorities around the world grapple with the new type of virus, which originated in China but has since spread to Europe and North America. There are more than 1,975 cases so far, including three in France and two in the United States. While 56 people have died of the virus in China - most of the deaths have been older patients - the World Health Organization has not declared the outbreak an international public health emergency. Toronto Mayor John Tory stressed in a statement following news of the city's first coronavirus case that health officials have made it clear the risk continues to remain low. He also praised the city's public health officials for their quick response. \u201cOur front-line health-care workers are the best in the world and have procedures in place to keep people safe,\u201d Tory said. Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu echoed the sentiment in a written statement, saying officials are taking all necessary precautions. \u201cThe Government of Canada has been working closely with provincial and territorial counterparts, and international partners, since China first reported 2019-nCoV cases to ensure that our country is prepared to limit the spread of 2019-nCoV in Canada,\u201d she said. The new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a common cold. But in late 2002, a coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome erupted in southern China, causing a severe pneumonia that rapidly spread to other countries. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, including 44 Canadians. Toronto was hard hit in that outbreak. In 2012, another coronavirus dubbed Middle East respiratory syndrome began sickening people in Saudi Arabia. MERS is still prevalent, causing small numbers of infections each year. The World Health Organization has counted nearly 2,500 cases in the Middle East and beyond, and more than 850 deaths. SARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected visited or worked at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been placed under quarantine since the outbreak. Bustling streets, malls and other public spaces have turned eerily quiet, masks are mandatory in public, and some hospitals have run low on medical supplies. Transportation has also been shut down in roughly a dozen Chinese cities, home to roughly 36 million people. Canadian officials have said such mass quarantines won't happen here, even if there is an outbreak. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12,200 hospitalizations and about 3,500 deaths in Canada yearly. The federal government has beefed up measures at major airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, asking travellers whether they had been to Wuhan in the past 14 days, with a positive response triggering further investigation.

Article content Iran is already facing questions about its investigation. Article content Some of those questions revolved around allegations much of the debris at the crash scene had already been cleared and that the site had not been secured, while others focused on whether Iran would try to evade responsibility if one of its missiles did indeed shoot down the plane. Article content Asked about those fears, Champagne said: \u201cOver the course of the next few days, we will see if they are genuine.\u201d Article content The foreign minister added that the immediate priority is getting Canadian officials into the country as Iran has so far only issued two visas.

Photo by The Canadian Press\/Greg Halinda Joseph Enverga kept hoping the flooding would slow down or even stop as his apartment lights flickered on and off. The 35-year old was prepared for an evacuation of downtown Fort McMurray, Alta., on Sunday afternoon. By dawn on Monday, he looked out his window and saw the reflection of his building in the parking lot that was covered in water. He decided it was time to go. \"In my vehicle, I had my clothes ready, I had my documents ready,\" he says. \"On top of that, I had my slack line ready, I had my bag of my favourite board games ready. 'How much can a person take?' Flooding forces 13,000 from downtown Fort McMurray \"I was telling myself: this is going to be the best evacuation ever.\" Like many Fort McMurray residents, Enverga is no stranger to evacuation orders. He was forced out of his home during a raging wildfire in May 2016 that led to the evacuation of the entire city and destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings. On Tuesday, municipal and provincial officials were keeping a close eye on river levels after a 25-kilometre ice jam caused major flooding and forced nearly 13,000 people from their homes in the downtown. Colleen Walford, a river forecaster with Alberta Environment, said a monitoring flight just before noon Tuesday determined that the ice jam had shortened by about one kilometre and was melting. \"We have nice sunny conditions up in Fort McMurray today. We hope that continues tomorrow and it will continue to deteriorate the ice jam.\" But officials with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo said it remains a critical situation. \"We are not in the home stretch yet,\" Scott Davis, director of emergency management, told reporters. Data shows the Clearwater River was still rising and the Athabasca River had only dropped by about four centimetres. Mayor Don Scott said it has caused the worst flooding in the region in recent memory. \"This is a one-in-100-year flood,\" he said. \"This is something that we haven't seen in this generation. \"And it's actually happening during the COVID-19 pandemic , which is a dual combination of issues.\" A second state of local emergency is in effect on top of one declared last month because of the pandemic. Officials said evacuees are being put up in hotels and work camps where they can have their own space. \"We've gone to individual accommodations,\" said Shane Schreiber, director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency. More than 6,000 people have registered at two evacuation centres and the municipality said that number is expected to grow. Officials also said crews had to rescue more than 220 residents. Enverga, who didn't get an evacuation order, said he ended up getting a ride with a rescue boat after he realized his van wasn't going to make it through the water. \"I was sad that I couldn't take my van,\" he said. \"I couldn't take my slack line, I couldn't take my board games.\" Enverga said he was taken to an evacuation centre then went to stay with friends in another Fort McMurray neighbourhood. Others, including Coun. Jeff Peddle and former provincial politician Brian Jean, said they had to leave their flooded homes. Jean, who lost a home in the 2016 wildfire, said his almost-finished new house was under three metres of water. \"I'm very sad. I'm sad for the people. It started with the wildfires then it went to the economy ... then it went to COVID-19, which was an even bigger economy hit, and now the flood,\" he said. \"How much can a person take?\" Premier Jason Kenney and Environment Minister Jason Nixon took a flight over the city Monday. \"It really is ... devastating to see much of central Fort McMurray flooded just four years after the terrible fires of 2016,\" Kenney said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"To imagine people who have just rebuilt their homes now struggling with those homes being flooded and the adversity of that community after four years of economic trials is just heartbreaking.\" Kenney said another 450 people have been affected by ice jams in the Fort Vermilion area. \"We will be ensuring provincial financial support,\" he added. Earlier in the day, Nixon said the government will work with Wood Buffalo to request Ottawa's support if it's needed. \"At this point, we are satisfied that both the province and the municipality have the situation under control,\" he said. The federal government said earlier Tuesday that it is monitoring the situation in Fort McMurray. \"While no formal requests have been made, our government is ready to help when called upon,\" said an emailed statement from federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair. \u2014 By Colette Derworiz in Edmonton.

The bill did not affect the three Indigenous school boards in Qu\u00e9bec . On Feb. 8 at 3:20 a.m., the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) majority government led by Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault abolished the 60 French and nine English school boards across the province and transformed Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s public and secondary school systems by forcing the adoption of Bill 40 . The CAQ majority used closure to adopt Bill 40 with its 300 clauses , along with 160 last-minute amendments , after a parliamentary session that lasted almost 70 hours . These amendments included the immediate sacking of all 700 French school board commissioners to avoid litigation against the closure of their school boards. The bill also brought in changes to teacher training, forces cities to pay for lands required for new schools and impacts how parents can choose schools. Widespread opposition V\u00e9ronique Hivon, Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois education critic and representative for the riding of Joliette, questions the CAQ\u2019s need to invoke closure during question period, Feb. 7, 2020, at the legislature in Qu\u00e9bec City. THE CANADIAN PRESS\/Jacques Boissinot The CAQ passed Bill 40 despite opposition from the Liberal party, Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, as well as from French- and English-language school boards, teacher unions , advocacy and parent groups, including some who have children with special needs . Opposition parties were frustrated that the CAQ government again used its majority to impose closure to adopt Bill 40. The same tactic was used to impose the law deregulating Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec fees , reducing the number of immigrants accepted in Qu\u00e9bec and to impose adoption of the controversial secularism law that prohibits teachers and other public workers from wearing religious symbols at work. In October, the English Montr\u00e9al School Board filed a legal challenge against the secularism law . When Education Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge tabled Bill 40 last October, he justified the move by saying it would save taxpayers $45 million over the next four years and provide more local school-based governance. In the lead-up to the bill, Roberge alleged that a government investigation showed the English Montr\u00e9al School Board improperly awarded contracts and said he contacted police as a result . He appointed Marlene Jennings, a former Liberal MP, as trustee of the school board . Bill 40 replaced the school boards with French and English service centres whose unpaid members will have little decision-making power other than to adopt Ministry of Education regulations. Anglophones will be allowed to vote for such representatives within English service centres next November. Charter protection of language rights School boards for the English-speaking minority in Qu\u00e9bec should be exempted from Bill 40, argues Joan Fraser, vice-chair of Alliance for the Promotion of Public English-language Education in Qu\u00e9bec and a former senator. Francophones in New Brunswick and Ontario have highlighted their common cause with Qu\u00e9bec anglophones in supporting the maintenance of their hard-fought school boards . The CAQ granted official minority English school boards and their commissioners a 10-month transition period . Bill 101 revisited As a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois francophone and social psychologist, part of my research focus is the study of how dominant language majority groups and their national or regional governments treat their linguistic , ethnic and religious minority populations. Camille Laurin, former Qu\u00e9bec cultural development minister who was the chief architect of Bill 101, briefs reporters in April 1977 at the legislature in Qu\u00e9bec City. The landmark bill was passed in August that year. THE CANADIAN PRESS\/Louise Bidault The recent events harken to another law contributing to the systemic decline of the English school system in Qu\u00e9bec. Bill 40 can be seen as a complement to the Charter of the French Language ( Bill 101 ), adopted by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government in 1977 to increase the status and use of French relative to English in Qu\u00e9bec. The preamble of Bill 101 asserted that its pro-French legislation would be conducted in fairness while being respectful of existing institutions of the English mother tongue population, then constituting 13 per cent of the Qu\u00e9bec population. Despite such assurances, Bill 101 undermined the English primary and secondary school system for the sake of protecting the 80 per cent French mother tongue majority of Qu\u00e9bec. \u2018Rights holders\u2019 schooling To neutralize the power of attraction to English compared to French, Bill 101 banned immigrant, allophone and francophone pupils from accessing English schools. Bill 101 stipulated that anglophone pupils could attend English schools as \u201crights holders\u201d only if one parent had spent most of their primary schooling in English in Qu\u00e9bec, and later in Canada, following a Supreme Court ruling. In 1971, before the adoption of Bill 101, 255,205 pupils were enrolled in English primary and secondary schools in the combined public and private systems of Qu\u00e9bec. By 2018, ministry of education data showed there were only 96,235 pupils left in the English school system representing only 37 per cent of the original 1971 baseline , a drop of 158,970 pupils. Such decline, due to the low birth rates of Qu\u00e9bec anglophones, out-migration and restrictions on access to English schools, forced English school boards to rule on painful school mergers and closures for anglophone pupils and parents. Such closures also had the effect of reducing the number of teachers, administrators and staff employed in such institutions, further contributing to the overall out-migration of Qu\u00e9bec anglophones to the rest of Canada. Bilingual anglophones Education ministry data also shows that as planned in Bill 101, the number of allophones and immigrant pupils studying in the French school system increased to  91 per cent by 2018 (128,361) from only 15 per cent in 1971 (9,652), before Bill 101. These figures attest to the efficiency of Bill 101 in shifting allophone and immigrant pupils from the English to the French school system, thus contributing to the vitality of French in Qu\u00e9bec. Qu\u00e9bec Education Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge responds to reporters\u2019 questions Feb. 7, 2020 at the legislature in Qu\u00e9bec City. THE CANADIAN PRESS\/Jacques Boissinot In July 2019, the education minister forced the transfer of a number of Montr\u00e9al English schools to Montr\u00e9al French school boards dealing with overcrowding, a situation caused by laws banning immigrants and allophones to go to English schools. English school boards contesting such transfers received support from francophone minority advocacy groups in Ontario and New Brunswick . English schools in Qu\u00e9bec provide quality French teaching for their pupils within their French immersion programs. In 2011, 83 per cent of pupils in English primary schools were enrolled in French immersion classes, and at the secondary school level, the figure was 65 per cent. As pointed out in the Qu\u00e9bec government\u2019s 2016 and 2018 reports of the Advisory Board on English Education, English school boards have contributed to the academic strength of Qu\u00e9bec schools and supported the training of highly competent French-English bilingual anglophone pupils . Until now, English school boards represented the last level of governance still controlled by and for the English-speaking communities of Qu\u00e9bec. In Joan Fraser\u2019s words, minority English school boards should be exempted from Bill 40, to echo the path taken \u201c by Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island as well as the Yukon Territory for minority French-language school boards when those jurisdictions changed the governance of their education systems .\u201d Maintaining English school boards in Qu\u00e9bec is rightfully understood as important for legitimizing the maintenance of French school boards across Canada that contribute to Canadian linguistic duality.

The RCMP reported Tuesday afternoon that the death toll in the weekend rampage has increased to 23, including the shooter. The incident is the deadliest in the country's history since the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique massacre in Montreal. Investigators are now trying to comb through at least 16 different crime scenes, five of which included burned-out buildings. These are spread between rural communities such as Portapique, Debert, Milford, Enfield, and Wentworth. Among the confirmed dead are RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the agency. Another RCMP officer, an 11-year veteran, was wounded but is expected to recover. The RCMP is acting on the notion that one man acted alone and investigators confirmed Tuesday afternoon that the 51-year-old suspect was killed by police. Police said they received 911 calls late Saturday evening of an active shooter in the area of Portapique. When officers arrived at the scene they discovered multiple victims inside and outside of the home. Later Sunday morning, police reported that the suspect may have been driving a vehicle that looked like an RCMP cruiser and was wearing what appeared to be an RCMP uniform. It was originally reported that the suspect was taken into custody near Enfield Sunday afternoon. In another development, the RCMP conceded that it did not know why an emergency alert was not sent out during the incident. Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said Tuesday that the RCMP would have been the agency responsible for activating the alert, which operates similar to the alert system in Ontario. ---with files from Ruby Sweeney  A Windsor man found guilty of a fatal crash near Chatham in 2022 has been sentenced to serve jail time.

{"year":"2020","month":"03","event_desc":"Yukon permanently ends Daylight Saving Time.","text":"Home News Yukon government ends seasonal time change Once Yukon springs forward there will be no falling back Stephanie Waddell Mar 6, 2020 12:00 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message The Yukon government announced March 5 the seasonal time changes will end after clocks spring forward this year, meaning the territory will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time year-round. Pictured is an example of summer and winter times throughout Canada (provided British Columbia also ends time changes). (Yukon.ca) There will be no falling back after daylight saving time takes effect March 8. As Yukoners have done for years, on March 8 they will move their clocks forward an hour. Unlike all those previous years though, when fall rolls around there will be no falling back on the clock. The Yukon government announced March 5 the seasonal time changes will end after clocks spring forward this year, meaning the territory will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time year-round. The decision comes after a public survey saw more than 4,800 Yukoners and organizations respond. It marked the highest response rate to any Yukon government online survey, surpassing by 1,500 the online response to potential cannabis legislation in 2017. Along with the survey about seasonal time change, another 35 written and emailed submissions came into the territory on the subject. On the survey, a total of 93 per cent of respondents stated their desire for ending the seasonal time change with 70 per cent of those in favour of ending it with Pacific Daylight Saving Time. \u201cYukoners clearly want to see an end to seasonal time change and we are listening,\u201d Premier Sandy Silver said in a statement. \u201cThe response to this engagement speaks to the importance of this issue for people. Thank you to everyone who took the time to voice an opinion. This helped our government make an informed decision for Yukon.\u201d A number of regions, including British Columbia are looking at remaining on daylight saving time but have yet to make a decision. Yukon Chamber of Commerce president Peter Turner said that the change could add to some confusion for businesses dealing with counterparts in other regions that keep seasonal time changes. At the same time the Yukon government was running its survey, the chamber was asking its members for their thoughts on it. A total of 70 per cent stated a preference to keep the Yukon\u2019s time in sync with whatever route B.C. goes, while 20 per cent wanted to see the Yukon move to Alaska\u2019s time zone and another 10 per cent preferred to keep the Yukon\u2019s time as is. From the chamber\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s best to keep in sync with business partners and for many Yukon businesses that often means those in B.C. That said, Turner also pointed out it appears there\u2019s a growing movement across borders to seriously consider not switching the clocks with the season. For many, it seems outdated. In short, Turner noted, there\u2019s no perfect solution, but it would be helpful if all regions stuck with predictable time zones that don\u2019t change with the seasons.

The governments haven\u2019t said when the partial travel ban will come into effect, but Mr. Trudeau said it would be done \u201cvery quickly.\u201d Travel for tourism and recreation will not be allowed, the Prime Minister said. However, he sought to reassure businesses and individuals that essential travel will continue and supply chains \u201cwill not be affected.\u201d Trudeau unveils $27-billion in aid, $55-billion of tax deferrals in coronavirus response Follow the latest coronavirus news Mr. Trump, though, left the door open to a shutting down of cross-border commerce, saying there would be no restrictions on trade \u201cat this moment.\u201d In response, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said there is \u201cabsolute agreement\u201d to keep the border open and protect the $2.7-billion in daily trade that is \u201cessential to the economies and well-being of both Canadians and Americans.\u201d The new rules are expected to last for at least 30 days. Also under the umbrella of essential travel will be travel for medical reasons and binational military co-operation, Mr. Trump said. Christopher Sands, director of the Canada Institute at Washington\u2019s Wilson Center think tank, said there has never been a border closing between Canada and the U.S. like this before. The closest analogy was on Sept. 11, 2001. In that case, crossings closed for up to 20 minutes and the main problem was the days-long backlog it created. \u201cNow, we\u2019re talking about a restriction that\u2019s border-wide. \u2026 It\u2019s a different order of magnitude.\u201d he said. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said essential workers can take precautions to protect their health. When travelling, \u201cact like you already have it,\u201d she said, and if you do get sick, even with mild symptoms, stay home. On Monday, Canada announced it was closing the border to non-citizens, with the exception of permanent residents, Americans and a few other categories. At the time, Mr. Trudeau said the exception for Americans was made because of the intertwined economies. Mr. Trudeau said the decision was made after negotiations between the two leaders as well as talks between Ms. Freeland, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. British Columbia, which had previously called for the partial ban, and several other provinces welcomed the deal. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce agreed that the exchange of goods needed to continue, and called on Ottawa to keep open lines of communication with businesses. Bruce Heyman, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada, said Mr. Trudeau appeared to have got the best deal possible to fight the pandemic without compromising trade or angering Mr. Trump. \u201dTo be able to thread that needle is difficult and, at least at this point in time, it looks like the Prime Minister has successfully done that,\" Mr. Heyman said. He noted the logistical challenge ahead. Under normal circumstances, about 400,000 people cross at the 120 border crossings each day. Given the wide discretion border guards already have in enforcing the rules, he said, it is possible some points of entry may be easier to get through. Which workers will be considered essential is still a grey area, he said. For example, does a machine repair person qualify if the work is for an essential manufacturer? Those details and the circumstances of people who may have spouses on the other side of the border have not yet been worked out. Daniel Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with clients in both countries, said companies that regularly ship across the border likely will not see significant disruption, thanks to measures adopted after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Three post-9\/11 programs \u2013 Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, Partners in Protection and Free and Secure Trade \u2013 allowed companies to get security clearances and background checks, and register with the governments, showing they have legitimate reasons to cross.","question":"When did Canada and the United States close their border to non-essential travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic?","answer":"March 2020.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: Canada and the United States closed their border to non-essential travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 21, 2020.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer provides a specific date (March 21, 2020) which falls within the expected answer timeframe of March 2020.

Jacques Boissinot\/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account The Quebec government backtracked Thursday on its plan to allow holiday gatherings over four days at Christmas, saying the COVID-19 situation in the province was unlikely to improve enough for them to be safe. Premier Francois Legault announced that in the province\u2019s red zones, which cover the most densely populated areas of the province, multi-household gatherings of up to 10 people will no longer be allowed between Dec. 24 and Dec. 27. \u201cNew cases leads to more hospitalizations, and if we continue in this direction, hospitals will start to overflow,\u201d Legault told a news conference after the province announced 1,470 new COVID-19 infections and 30 more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus. \u201cWith the numbers we have, it\u2019s unrealistic to think we\u2019ll be able to change the situation in time for Christmas.\u201d The Quebec government on Nov. 19 gave the green light to the get-togethers on the condition that people isolate for a week before and a week after. But now the risk has been deemed too high with COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths on the rise and a health system deemed fragile due to a lack of staffing. Legault said 6,600 health-care workers were off the job on sick leave or preventive leave as of Thursday. People living alone in red zones are allowed to have one visitor at a time, something Legault encouraged. \u201cWe can and we must visit them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need us more than ever.\u201d Gatherings will still be permitted in regions that are not at the highest alert level. The premier hinted earlier this week things were looking grim before pulling the plug on Thursday. He said if he had it do over, he wouldn\u2019t have announced the gatherings last month, but he said at the time there was a sincere hope case numbers would decline. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do my best, like I said in French, I\u2019m not perfect,\u201d Legault said. He said Quebec will maintain a longer school break, as planned, with distance learning several days before Christmas for elementary and high school students. Many businesses and schools had altered their schedules to allow for the now nixed gatherings, Legault acknowledged. \u201cCurrently, we are at the worst time of the pandemic, the worst time of the past nine months, so maintaining these measures, I think it can help,\u201d he said. The province has seen COVID-19 cases surge, with more than 1,500 reported on Tuesday. Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec\u2019s director of public health, said community transmission is behind the rising cases. \u201cThe virus is everywhere,\u201d Arruda said, adding that the failure by some to follow public health guidelines is fuelling the spread. The province is battling over 1,200 active outbreaks, with most occurring in workplaces, schools and long-term care and seniors\u2019 residences. Montreal reported the largest number of new cases Thursday, with 373, while the Quebec City, Monteregie and Lanaudiere regions each reported 145 cases or more. Legault said he was confident the vast majority of Quebecers would not disregard his latest edict and gather anyway during the holidays, or travel from red zones to the few regions where gatherings are still permitted. \u201cNobody wants to infect someone else from the same family or some of their friends,\u201d Legault said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have to explain the danger, and when I see the number of deaths in the world in the last few days, I still don\u2019t understand how some people can think that it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d Of the Quebec deaths announced Thursday, 12 occurred in the last 24 hours. Hospitalizations declined by three to 737, while the number of people in intensive care remained unchanged at 99. Quebec has reported 146,532 cases, 7,155 deaths and 126,179 recoveries since the beginning of the pandemic. Canadian authorities are assessing COVID-19 vaccine candidates while trials are underway, speeding up any eventual approval for wide use. But science reporter Ivan Semeniuk says it\u2019s likely high-risk people will be prioritized for receiving any vaccine first, with some possibly getting it as early as the first part of 2021.

The resolution to not play football this season ends a months-long process for the CFL and CFLPA that was at times acrimonious and included a request for financial aid to the federal government by the league due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Canadian Press Ottawa Redblacks helmet\n                    , Getty Images The CFL has cancelled its 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It marks the first year the Grey Cup won't be presented since 1919. The nine-team league announced the move Monday, dashing hopes of a shortened season in the hub city of Winnipeg. \"Our league governors decided today it is in the best long-term interests of the CFL to concentrate on the future,\" commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a statement. \"We are absolutely committed to 2021, to the future of our league and the pursuit of our vision of a bigger, stronger, more global CFL.\" The move comes after the CFL couldn't solve a number of issues in an effort to try to salvage a season. The league was unable to secure financing from the federal government after presenting Ottawa with a $30-million, interest-free loan request Aug. 3 to stage an abbreviated 2020 campaign. News of the deal falling through broke Sunday night. The league had maintained it required government funding to stage a shortened season, despite having a far more stable ownership situation than in previous years. However, Ambrosie has said the league lost more than $20 million last season. \"Even with government funding and a new CBA, our owners and community-held teams would have had to endure significant financial losses to play in 2020,\" Ambrosie said. \"Without it, the losses would be so large that they would really hamper our ability to bounce back strongly next year and beyond. The most important thing is the future of our league.\" The CFL said the federal government suggested the league pursue a commercial loan, which would be partially backed by Ottawa. \"That kind of arrangement would hamper our recovery more than bolster it. On two occasions, in June and again at the beginning of August, the government reached out to us with new indications they might step up and help in a more meaningful way. But at the end of the day, the help we needed to play this year never materialized,\" Ambrosie said. \"This outcome after months of discussions with government officials is disappointing. But we\u2019re focused now on the long-term future and we will continue to work with the federal and provincial governments in that context.\" Approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada also was needed. Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said last Friday he was encouraged by the CFL's plan, but couldn't provide a timeline for a decision the league quickly needed to try to stage a season. With the cancellation, the CFL becomes one of the few major North American pro sports leagues to wipe out play in 2020. Major League Baseball is running a shortened season, while the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer have resumed play. The NFL says it's planning to start its season on time next month. Unlike other major leagues in North America, however, the CFL does not have the luxury of a billion-dollar television contract. While its deal with TSN has become more lucrative over the years, the CFL remains a gate-driven league \u2014 which is a major problem when fans aren't allowed in the stands. CFL officials announced in late July they had chosen Winnipeg as a hub city for a regular season with six games, followed by an eight-team playoffs. No fans were scheduled to be in attendance. But it was contingent on the league securing financial assistance from the federal government, solidifying an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and approving health-and-safety protocols. While the CFL said it could have staged the Grey Cup game after its traditional late November date, time was running thin to get about half the league's players back to Canada, follow quarantine rules, stage training camps and hold a season and playoffs. The CFL also couldn't line up federal funding. In late April, Ambrosie told The Canadian Press the CFL was seeking up to $150 million in federal assistance in the event of a wiped-out season. The league dropped its ask to about $44 million in the summer as it tried to find a way to grapple with next to no revenue. Later, it requested the loan of $30 million. Meanwhile, the league also struggled to mend fences with the CFL Players' Association. Politicians from all major parties criticized the CFL for not having its players involved in its initial financial assistance request. While the players eventually supported the league's second financial assistance proposal, the two sides could not come to terms on an extension of the CBA, though the CFL said it was close to a deal when it called off the season Monday. When the pandemic first hit in March, the CFL had time on its side, with training camps not set to open until May. But as the situation worsened around the world, the CFL had to start postponing camps and, eventually, the start of the regular season in June. Later, the CFL pulled the plug on the Grey Cup game in November in Regina, saying the model would not work without fans. The league hoped at the time to play the Grey Cup in either the city with the best record or the hub city. While the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer adopted hub-city formats to get going and Major League Baseball went with a travel plan, the CFL was left watching all those other leagues begin or resume play this summer. It marks the first time the CFL won't crown a champion since it was founded in 1958. Before that, amateur leagues and other circuits competed for the Grey Cup. It was last not awarded in 1919 \u2014 which also happened to be during a pandemic \u2014 because of a rules dispute in the west, lack of interest in the east and education concerns in the university ranks. The first Grey Cup was held in 1909. The cancelled season is a blow for Ambrosie, who took the job in 2017. One of his biggest objectives has been expanding the CFL's footprint internationally with his CFL 2.0 initiative, holding combines in countries around the world and creating roster spots for international players. But the pandemic quashed plans for a second global draft this year. International players made minimal impact following the first draft last year. Ambrosie appeared to solve one of the league's biggest problems early this year when Toronto businessmen Sid Spiegel and Gary Stern were introduced as owners of the Montreal Alouettes, who were run by the league and financed by other teams last season after owner Robert Wetenhall stepped away. Fresh off their first trip to the playoffs since 2014 under new coach Khari Jones last season and bolstered by new owners, the Alouettes never got a chance to build on that momentum. The league has long-running attendance problems in its two other biggest markets, Toronto and Vancouver, which now will turn their sporting focus to other teams with active seasons. The cancellation also puts the new-look Edmonton team on hold. The team announced it was dropping the name Eskimos this summer after facing pressure from sponsors, along with other teams with racist or stereotypical names. Now, the Edmonton Football Team faces the challenge of creating a new name with extremely limited revenue.","question":"What was significant about the cancellation of the 2020 CFL season in terms of the Grey Cup?","answer":"It marked the first time since 1919 that the Grey Cup was not awarded.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: The cancellation of the 2020 CFL season was significant because it marked the first time since 1919 that the Grey Cup, Canada's championship game in Canadian football, was not awarded.

The territory has now confirmed a total of\u00a047\u00a0cases since the pandemic began, with 17 that are currently active. Premier Sandy Silver said at Tuesday's update that the new mask rules will extend to Yukoners over the age of five, after saying last week they would apply to those over the age of two. He also said\u00a0indoor public spaces include \"indoor areas of a building that are intended for the common use of the whole public.\" This includes public bathrooms, lobbies, hallways, waiting rooms, elevators and stores, along with other spaces, he added. \"If you're not sure whether or not you're in a public space, wear a mask,\" Silver said. He said some exemptions will include people with medical conditions which prevent them from wearing masks, people participating in sports, people in private areas of long-term care homes\u00a0and anyone\u00a0eating or drinking in a public restaurant. Silver said the government can give people\u00a0fine of up to $500 if people don't comply\u00a0with the rules and can't reasonably verify an exemption. \"Sanctions would only be used in egregious scenarios of non-compliance,\" Silver said.

They're an addition to all those measures that are already well-known. It's important that you continue to physically distance and wash your hands, and follow the other measures where applicable,\" Hanley said. He added that for those who can not afford or find a mask, the government will be make them available for a limited time at public facilities. Missed the update? Watch it here: Case counts double in 3 weeks, no evidence of community spread The territory has seen a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases over the last few weeks. \"Our case count \u2026 doubled in the past three weeks from 23 cases as of Nov. 10 to 47 cases as of this morning,\"\u00a0Hanley emphasized on Tuesday.

However, we haven't ruled\u00a0it out,\" he said.

Government to provide support for leave Silver emphasized the importance of staying home if they are feeling sick, and said the territorial government supports employers and employees in doing so. \"Our government has [a] paid sick leave rebate program for employers, including those who are self-employed,\" Silver said. \"To compliment this, under new COVID-19 regulations, an employee is also entitled to a leave without pay for a period of up to 14 days if they require.\" The leave is available to employees if they or someone in their care is required to follow a health protection measure such as self-isolating, Silver said, given that they are able to provide a doctor's note. Silver said that approved vaccines are expected to be available by early 2021, but there are still many details to work out on national and territorial levels.

Province has reported\u00a0almost 10,000 new cases over the past six days CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Dec 03, 2020 3:30 PM EST | Last Updated: December 4, 2020 Alberta Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw provided her latest update on COVID-19 at a news conference Thursday. (Jason Franson\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Alberta once again shattered records on Thursday, with 1,854 new cases and a positive-test rate of 9.5 per cent. The province has\u00a017,743 active cases, with 511 people being treated in hospital for the illness, including 97 in ICU beds. Another 14 deaths were reported on Thursday. \"I am very concerned about these numbers,\" Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's chief medical officer of health, said Thursday at a news conference. \"No one should be watching these numbers to determine whether or not they need to change their behaviour. Behaviour needs to change, and that's already a mandate. And what we need to do as we're watching these numbers is determine whether or not there should be further changes.\" The regional breakdown of active cases on was: Edmonton zone: 8,331 Calgary zone: 6,445 Central zone: 1,251 North zone: 991 South zone: 633 Unknown: 92 With case numbers rising in all parts of the province, Hinshaw addressed a portion of her news conference to people who live outside the two big cities. \"While infection rates in Edmonton and Calgary make up the majority of cases in the province, we are seeing increased spread in many rural communities,\" she said. \"COVID-19 is not a Calgary problem or an Edmonton problem. This is a provincial problem within the context of a global problem. 'COVID-19 doesn't care where you live' Among the 15 geographic areas with the highest active case rates in Alberta, one-third of them are outside Calgary and Edmonton. \"We are also seeing growing outbreaks in the Central, North and South zones,\" she said. \"I know that many rural areas did not see widespread transmission in the spring or summer, and so it's natural that some people living in those areas may feel safe from COVID, due to their smaller populations or distance from large urban centres. \"They may wonder why they should wear a mask or not host a party in their home. Unfortunately, our overall active case rates prove that COVID-19 doesn't care where you live or what your postal code is. It only takes one case entering a community to cause significant spread.\" WATCH | Dr. Hinshaw says COVID isn't just a risk for those who live in cities Dr. Hinshaw asks rural Albertans to follow restrictions 4 years ago Duration 1:31 Dr. Deena Hinshaw pleaded with Albertans in rural areas to wear masks and follow public health orders, warning them that their distance from ICUs will make COVID-19 \u201ceven more daunting.\u201d It's\u00a0important that everyone follow public health guidelines wherever they live, she said. \"If people in a community aren't consistently observing physical distancing, wearing masks when appropriate or staying home when they feel unwell, it doesn't take long to infect a large percentage of the population. \"Coping with this virus is a challenge for everyone, but being further away from health care, especially from advanced services like ICUs, can also make the experience even more daunting for those living in rural areas. That's why it's important for all Albertans, rural and urban, take COVID-19 seriously and do everything possible to limit the spread.\" 2nd wave hitting far harder than 1st The second wave of the pandemic has hit Alberta far harder than the first. The province reported its first case of the respiratory illness on March 5. It took until June 28, 116 days, for the total number of cases to reach 8,050. That included 7,255 people who had recovered, 641 active cases and 154 deaths. Alberta reported\u00a08,187\u00a0new cases over the past five days alone. As noted above, the past six days have been grim. Alberta reported\u00a01,731 new cases on Saturday, 1,608 on Sunday, 1,733 on Monday, 1,307 on Tuesday and 1,685 on Wednesday, and 1,854 on Thursday. The total number of cases as of Thursday was 63,023, which includes 17,743 active cases, 44,705 people who have recovered, and 575 deaths. Kenney\u00a0Q&A Premier Jason Kenney hosted a live Q&A on Facebook Thursday night that lasted about 90 minutes. When asked about the potential for further restrictions, the premier said the province is waiting to see what effect the most recent measures have before announcing any new measures. However, Kenney hinted that any possible new restrictions would be linked to the \"hot zones\" of the province \u2014Edmonton and Calgary. \"If we don't start to see a stabilization or a reduction in the growth, then as I announced last week, we'll have to move forward with additional restrictions,\" he said. \"I suspect that if we do that, those restrictions will be likely geographically focused. In a worst-case scenario, we may have to suspend more businesses again.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices \u00b7 About CBC News Corrections and clarifications \u00b7 Submit a news tip \u00b7 Report error","question":"How many active COVID-19 cases did Alberta have as of December 2020?","answer":"As of December 2020, Alberta had 17,743 active COVID-19 cases.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: As of December 2020, Alberta had approximately 20,000 active COVID-19 cases.","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer of 'approximately 20,000 active COVID-19 cases' contradicts the expected answer of '17,743 active COVID-19 cases'.

Five others were wounded in the Halloween night attack. A man in his mid-20s was arrested shortly before 01:00 (06:00 GMT) on Sunday. Police said an initial probe found the suspect was not affiliated with any extremist groups. The attack took place in the historic Old Quebec neighbourhood. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter , external : \"My heart breaks for the loved ones of the two killed in last night's horrific attack in Quebec City. \"I'm also wishing a full recovery to the injured. We're keeping you in our thoughts and will be there for all of you.\" He also thanked first responders for their critical work. The identity of the suspect has not been made public. At a news conference on Sunday, Quebec City Police Chief Robert Pigeon said it was believed that the attack was premeditated, adding that the suspect, from the Montreal suburbs, came to Quebec City with \"the intention of doing the most damage possible\". \"Dressed in medieval costume and armed with a Japanese sword, everything leads us to believe he chose his victims at random,\" Mr Pigeon added. The suspect had spoken of conducting an attack \"in a medical context\" five years ago but was not known to police and did not have a criminal record, police said. \u00e2\u0080\u008bFirst reports of the incident near the French-speaking city's national assembly came through shortly before 22:30 local time on Saturday. The suspect was arrested near the Espace 400e business park. Quebec's Le Soleil newspaper reported that he was lying on the ground, barefoot and hypothermic, when he was arrested. He surrendered to police without any resistance, it said. Following his arrest, the suspect was taken to hospital for \"evaluation\". The five wounded are also being treated in hospital, with varying levels of injury, according to police. Police have not released details of the victims' identities or ages.

ORDER OF CANADA BACKGROUNDER Established in 1967 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Order of Canada is the cornerstone of the Canadian Honours System, and recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation. The Order recognizes people in all sectors of Canadian society. Their contributions are varied, yet they have all enriched the lives of others and made a difference to this country. Motto and Levels The Order of Canada's motto is DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM\u00a0(\"They desire a better country\"). Her Majesty The Queen is the Sovereign of the Order, and the governor general is the chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order. Companion \u2013 Post-nominal: C.C. recognizes national pre-eminence or international service or achievement; Officer \u2013 Post-nominal: O.C. recognizes national service or achievement; and Member \u2013 Post-nominal: C.M. recognizes outstanding contributions at the local or regional level or in a special field of activity. Insignia Description The insignia of the Order is a stylized snowflake of six points, with a red annulus at its centre which bears a stylized maple leaf circumscribed with the motto of the Order, DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (\"They desire a better country\"), surmounted by the Royal Crown. It is struck in fine silver and is composed of three individual pieces: the snowflake, annulus and maple leaf. The colour is added by hand through a unique application of opaque and translucent enamel. The design of the insignia of the Order of Canada dates from 1967, and is credited to Bruce\u00a0Beatty, C.M., S.O.M., C.D. The technical drawings used by the Royal Canadian Mint in this\u00a0new generation of the insignia\u00a0were developed by the Canadian Heraldic Authority at the Chancellery of Honours, part of the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General. The insignia is manufactured by the Mint at its Ottawa facility. Investiture Ceremony Following their appointment to the Order of Canada , all Companions, Officers and Members are invited to an investiture ceremony, which is normally held in person, where they are presented with their insignia. Four investiture ceremonies are typically organized each year for groups of approximately 40\u00a0appointees. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person investiture ceremonies were postponed indefinitely, which resulted in a greater number of appointees than usual who had not yet participated in an investiture ceremony. As such, the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General organized a virtual investiture ceremony with six appointees of the Order of Canada on December 15, 2020 as a way to continue to recognize outstanding Canadians in an environment that accommodates the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. All appointees of the Order are celebrated from the moment their appointments are announced to the moment they receive their insignia. Each member of the Order earns the right to wear the appropriate ribbons or devices, miniatures, and lapel badges, as well as the authorized use of post-nominal letters. The typical in-person investiture ceremony is a closed event for the recipients, their family and loved ones. Normally, media are invited to attend investiture ceremonies and may be invited to participate in future virtual investiture ceremonies. Eligibility All Canadians are eligible for the Order of Canada , with the exception of federal and provincial politicians and judges while in office. The Order's constitution permits non-Canadians to be considered for honorary appointments. Members of the Royal Family, governors general and their spouses are appointed in the extraordinary category. There are no posthumous appointments. Officers and Members may be elevated within the Order in recognition of further achievement, based on continued exceptional or extraordinary service to Canada . Usually, promotions are considered five years after the first appointment. Nominations Any person or group is welcome to nominate a deserving individual as a candidate for appointment to the Order of Canada . Appointments are made on the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Order of Canada , an independent council chaired by the chief justice of Canada . Members of the Advisory Council for the Order of Canada reflect the diversity and excellence in Canadian society. Certain members are appointed by virtue of their office; others are appointed for a fixed term to achieve a balanced representation of the various regions of the country.

{"year":"2020","month":"12","event_desc":"Prime Minister Trudeau says that the country will receive 240,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine candidate by the end of the year.","text":"By ROB GILLIES Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday Canada will get up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany\u2019s BioNTech before the end of December. The vaccine is expected be approved by Health Canada as soon as Thursday. Trudeau had come under criticism from opposition parties for saying Canadians won\u2019t be among the first to get a vaccine against COVID-19 because the first doses will likely go to citizens of the countries they are made in. Canada doesn\u2019t have mass vaccine-production facilities. Trudeau said Canada recently amended the contract with Pfizer so that it would deliver up to 249,000 doses this month. That will mean about 124,500 of the highest risk Canadians will get vaccinated at first as two doses are required per person a few weeks apart. \u201cWe are now contracted to receive up to 249,000 of our initial doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine in the month of December,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cPending Health Canada approval, the first shipment of doses is tracking for delivery next week.\u201d Canada has contracts with six other vaccine makers as well. Trudeau said 14 distribution centers will be located in large Canadian cities initially. There will be one in each province and two each in Canada\u2019s four largest provinces. He said millions of more doses will be on the way. \u201cIt has been a difficult year, and we are not out of this crisis yet,\u2033 Trudeau said. \u201dBut now, vaccines are coming.\u201d Retired Gen. Rick Hillier, who leads the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Task Force in Canada\u2019s largest province of Ontario, said he expects Ontario to get about 85,000 doses this month for roughly 42,500 people.

(Heather Gillis\/CBC) Liberal candidate Fred Hutton has won\u00a0the byelection\u00a0in Conception Bay East-Bell Island and will\u00a0become Newfoundland and Labrador's newest MHA. Through all\u00a051 reported polls, Hutton defeated PC candidate Tina\u00a0Neary, 2,603\u00a0votes to 2,152 votes\u00a0\u2014 securing 45.9\u00a0per cent of the vote to Neary's\u00a037.9 per cent. The NDP's Kim Churchill garnered 14.9 per cent of the votes with\u00a0846, while Independent candidate Darryl Harding received 70 votes for 1.2 per cent of the vote. \"Tonight, we start a new chapter,\" Hutton told supporters shortly after the win was projected.\u00a0\"It feels great.\" The win marks the first time the district has switched hands since 2003. David Brazil, who had been the district's MHA since 2010 \u2014 winning 56.2 per cent of the vote in the 2021 election \u2014\u00a0resigned in December to focus on his health following a heart attack in 2022. Premier Andrew Furey was quick to celebrate the win, welcoming Hutton to the podium. \"Twenty years a Tory district. Tory no more, Fred Hutton,\" Furey said with a large smile. \"Fred's going to contribute a lot. He's already contributed a lot to the province [and] wants what's best for Newfoundland and Labrador.\" Hutton is a prominent former journalist with stints at NTV, VOCM and the CBC. He has also worked alongside\u00a0Furey\u00a0since he was elected in 2020, often travelling\u00a0with him to news conferences and events. Huttton took a leave from his office to run in the byelection. \"I've sat at the desk before when I've watched and read the announcements coming in for the numbers in elections. I always found that very exciting.\u00a0I can tell you it's very different from this side,\" he said with a laugh. Hutton told the crowd he was skeptical and nervous about deciding to run, but speaking with residents of the district affirmed for him that it was the right thing to do. \"Thank you for your endorsement, thank you for your confidence, thank you for your trust,\" he said. WATCH | Fred Hutton speaks with supporters following the win: Fred Hutton celebrates win in Conception Bay East-Bell Island byelection 1 year ago Duration 1:35 Liberal candidate Fred Hutton secured nearly 46 per cent of the vote in the Conception Bay East-Bell Island byelection Tuesday night and says he's ready to represent his home district. Voting took place from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., a day later than scheduled, after a winter storm that hit the\u00a0Avalon Peninsula\u00a0on Monday forced a delay. About 45 per cent of the district's\u00a012,612 eligible voters, according to Elections N.L., cast a ballot. Issues on the minds of voters, highlighted at a debate earlier this month, include\u00a0the cost of living, improving ferry service for the region, frequent emergency room closures in Wabana and improving health care. Byelection candidates say they were prepared for possibility of weather forcing postponement Ferry service and health care among top topics at Bell Island byelection debate Hutton said the vote is an endorsement of Furey and the work the party has done, adding he was saddened that he couldn't celebrate the win with his friend and\u00a0former cabinet minister Derrick Bragg,\u00a0who died earlier this month following a diagnosis of tongue cancer last year. Asked whether he was considering calling\u00a0a general election following the momentum of the win, Furey\u00a0said he's only focused on celebrating the victory for the people in the district and the province. \"The election, as I've said many times, it'll sort itself out,\" he said. The party has another vacancy following Bragg's death, but Furey said he hasn't thought about calling a byelection. \"I personally have been in a period of mourning,\" he said. \"I haven't given any thought to it.\" Losing parties see small victories Neary\u00a0told CBC News she sees the support for her campaign as a victory. \"It isn't what we were hoping for, but at the end of the day, you know what, as far as I'm concerned it's still a win for us. We had an amazing team of supporters,\" she said. PC candidate Tina Neary congratulates Hutton after the winner was declared. (Heather Gillis\/CBC) Neary said she'll continue to advocate for people as a town councillor in Portugal Cove-St. Philip's and would like to be back for a future campaign if the opportunity arises. For now, she said, she hopes Hutton keeps the promises he and the party made for residents. \"They've made a lot of commitments and, you know, I can only hope that they stand true to their word.\" The provincial NDP released a statement thanking Churchill for her candidacy following the vote. \"For a political first-timer her effort and dedication was nothing short of awe-inspiring. She stood up and demanded better for the people of the district, and we look forward to her success in future campaigns,\" said provincial party president\u00a0Raj Sharan\u00a0in the statement.

(Ken Linton\/CBC) Social Sharing P.E.I.

Unofficial results show that MacFarlane\u00a0earned 1,226 votes for 48.9 per cent of the 2,507 votes cast, compared to the PC candidate's 964 votes, for 38.5 per cent.

Unofficial results from the Elections P.E.I. website The most recent P.E.I. provincial\u00a0byelection before this one, in Cornwall-Meadowbank, had a voter turnout of 55 per cent. MacFarlane, a lawyer with Key Murray Law in Summerside, lives in Augustine Cove on the Island's south shore. Matt MacFarlane, shown campaigning earlier this month, said the byelection amounted to 'a mid-term exam for the Dennis King government.' (CBC) The byelection was made necessary by the resignation of Progressive Conservative Jamie Fox, who left the seat after deciding to run for the Conservatives in the next federal election. \"This was a mid-term exam for the Dennis King government,\" MacFarlane told supporters Wednesday night. \"The residents and voters of District 19 graded that exam, and they graded it with a failing grade.\" Summerside hospital's progressive-care unit being cut from 8 beds to 4 Government record on health care and housing at centre of byelection debate He said the vote showed that\u00a0Prince Edward Islanders are unhappy with the King government's management of health care, and said he would make advocating for the return of a full\u00a0eight-bed intensive care unit at the Prince County Hospital his top priority as MLA. Health care pushed buttons Health care became a major issue for King's PC government in recent weeks after services at that hospital in nearby Summerside were reduced. The hospital's intensive-care unit was downgraded to a progressive-care unit in mid-2023, meaning patients who needed critical care would be sent to Charlottetown's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, an hour's drive away, if their condition didn't warrant being airlifted to hospitals off the Island. A large crowd filled a conference room at Credit Union Place in Summerside on Feb. 1 for a town hall to address concerns about health services at the city's Prince County Hospital. (Sheehan Desjardins\/CBC) Then in January, Health P.E.I. cited staff shortages as the reason behind reducing the number of beds in Summerside's progressive-care unit from eight to four, saying patients would have to be sent to Charlottetown if those four beds were full. Hundreds pour into Summerside town hall to object to hospital service reductions P.E.I. is failing in its health recruitment efforts, say workers and former board chair \"As [past] co-chair of the South Shore Health and Wellness Centre, I fought for improved access to health care right here in our district and I know we can accomplish much more with a strong, dedicated voice in the legislature,\" MacFarlane was quoted as saying in a message on the Green Party's campaign website. How will the win change the legislature? MacFarlane's win\u00a0in District 19 leaves his party tied in the\u00a0P.E.I.\u00a0legislature with the Liberals,\u00a0with three seats each compared to the PCs' 21. The Liberals are currently the Official Opposition, which gives them more debate time in the house and a larger budget for staffing. Workers at the District 19 byelection polling station in Crapaud said voting was steady all day, with the lineup out the door at times. (Kerry Campbell\/CBC) There is no rule or precedent on record\u00a0in this province\u00a0to determine which party should form the Official Opposition when two parties are tied.\u00a0But other jurisdictions have dealt with this situation, and according to the clerk of the P.E.I.

Getty Images Story highlights 5 former members of Canada's world junior hockey team face charges The allegations date back to an alleged assault in 2018 The case sparked parliamentary hearings in 2022 Investigators have scheduled a news conference for Monday CNN \u2014 Four NHL players and one former NHL player are facing sexual assault charges in Canada in connection with allegations from 2018, their attorneys said Tuesday \u2013 a fresh development in a case that has wrapped Canada\u2019s national hockey governing body in controversy . The charges relate to a woman\u2019s accusation that multiple members of Canada\u2019s world junior hockey team sexually assaulted her in London, Ontario, in 2018. All five of the players facing charges were members of that team at the time. One of the players facing charges, former Ottawa Senators forward Alex Formenton, who now plays professionally in Switzerland, turned himself in to police in London on Sunday, his legal team said. The others facing charges, according to their lawyers or their clubs, include New Jersey Devils center Mike McLeod ; Devils defenseman Cal Foote ; Philadelphia Flyers goalie Carter Hart ; and Calgary Flames center Dillon Dube . The current NHL players have been instructed to surrender to authorities in connection with the allegations, London police have said. The case garnered widespread attention in May 2022 when Canadian broadcaster TSN reported the woman had settled a lawsuit she\u2019d filed against Hockey Canada \u2013 the nation\u2019s governing body for the sport \u2013 and members of the junior team over the assault allegations. A cascade of developments followed, including June 2022 parliamentary hearings over Hockey Canada\u2019s handling of the case, and July 2022 announcements that London police and Hockey Canada would reopen their investigations. Investigators are scheduled to address the London police investigation and pending charges in a news conference scheduled for Monday. Formenton \u201cwill vigorously defend his innocence and asks that people not rush to judgment without hearing all of the evidence,\u201d his attorneys, Daniel Brown and Lindsay Board, said in a release. Formenton, who played for the Senators in 2017, took an indefinite leave of absence from Swiss hockey club Ambri-Piotta last week. McLeod \u201cdenies any criminal wrongdoing,\u201d his attorneys, David Humphrey and Seth Weinstein, said in a release. \u201cHe will be pleading not guilty and will vigorously defend the case. Foote \u201cis innocent of the charge and will defend himself against this allegation to clear his name,\u201d a lawyer for Foote said. \u201cWhat is most critical at this time is the presumption of innocence, and the right to a fair trial that everyone in Canada is entitled to.\u201d Hart \u201cis innocent and will provide a full response to this false allegation in the proper forum, a court of law,\u201d his attorneys Riaz Sayani and Megan Savard said in a joint release. Dube \u201cwill plead not guilty and maintains his innocence,\u201d and \u201cwill defend the allegations in court,\u201d his attorneys, Louis P. Strezos and Kaleigh Davidson, said in a statement. The Flames are \u201caware of the charge of sexual assault that has been laid against Dillon Dube,\u201d the club said Tuesday. \u201cWe take this matter very seriously. Because the matter is now pending legal proceedings, we will have no further comment at this time.\u201d The Flames had said January 21 that Dube was \u201c granted an indefinite leave of absence from the team while he attends to his mental health.\u201d On Tuesday, the club said it had \u201cno knowledge of pending charges at the time Dillon\u2019s request for a leave of absence was granted.\u201d The Devils, for whom McLeod and Foote play, are \u201caware of the reports\u201d and have \u201cbeen told to refer all inquiries regarding this to the league,\u201d the team told CNN Tuesday. The NHL declined to comment Tuesday when reached by CNN. CNN also has sought comment from the woman\u2019s lawyer and Hockey Canada. Hockey Canada apologized in 2022 for its handing of the case A month after the TSN report, the Canadian government in June 2022 announced it was freezing federal, public funding for Hockey Canada until the organization had submitted the complete results of its original, two-year investigation and plans for implementing change within Hockey Canada. During parliamentary hearings in June 2022, executives for Hockey Canada disclosed that it was notified of the incident the day after it was alleged to have taken place in 2018. \u201cWe immediately initiated a process to investigate, beginning by contacting police.

Smith made a speech last November to party members promising to protect parents\u2019 rights. The delegates overwhelmingly passed a motion requiring parental consent if a child under the age of 16 wishes to use a different name or pronoun at school, mirroring legislation recently passed in Saskatchewan that has drawn harsh criticism from LGBTQ2 advocates. Story continues below advertisement \u201cOne of the things that was talked about at that meeting in the fall was a bill of rights that would deal with parental consent around their children, and education and healthcare decision making,\u201d Hardcastle told Global News. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t clear if this is going to be part of a broader set of legal changes or whether we\u2019re simply going to see more narrow changes, for example to health insurance legislation.\u201d Hardcastle said the policy could be a part of a larger suite of changes being discussed among the party. \u201cIn some ways, this is a political move more than it is a change to the health care that lots of people receive. For example, it isn\u2019t clear if children under 18 are currently receiving surgery anyway. And so I would question whether the change is meant to address something that\u2019s actually occurring or if it\u2019s meant more to pander to the premier\u2019s political base,\u201d she said. But she said it\u2019s also important to remember that this is a policy, not a piece of legislation. \u201cIf this is just going to be a policy change and isn\u2019t going to be legislation, then unfortunately, we won\u2019t have the benefit of legislative debates on this issue. If these kinds of changes are emerging from some of the resolutions that were voted on at the UCP\u2019s annual general meeting \u2014 that\u2019s a narrow subset of the public,\u201d she said. Story continues below advertisement \u201cThe government should really be consulting with these changes and what they look like with healthcare professionals who treat children in this area, we should be hearing from adults who are parents to children who are seeking gender-affirming care, we should hear from adolescents themselves seeking gender-affirming treatment. those voices seem to be largely missing from this discussion.\u201d Lori Williams, a political scientist at Mount Royal University, said the policy is a \u201cnod\u201d to the social conservatives in the UCP base. The video is \u201cdesperately trying to depoliticize something that is highly political and highly controversial,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis does have some consistency with Danielle Smith\u2019s past, her support of LGBTQ2S rights and freedoms, but also trying to recognize the concerns that parents, particularly social conservative parents, have,\u201d she told Global News. Williams added the policy is similar to Saskatchewan\u2019s and New Brunswick\u2019s policies, but may be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see what the courts do.

(Ryan Remiorz\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld the province's controversial secularism law\u00a0in a ruling on challenges to the law's constitutionality released Thursday afternoon. The heavily anticipated judgment is 290-pages long and quashes a previous exception, made by Superior Court Judge Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard, that allowed\u00a0English schools to employ teachers wearing religious symbols\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as a head covering\u00a0\u2014\u00a0while on the job. A panel of Appeal Court judges\u00a0heard arguments\u00a0from civil liberties groups challenging the law, as well as from the government, in November 2022. Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault's government had appealed the Superior Court decision, rendered in April 2021, that upheld most of the law but made the exception for English schools. His government had said the exception created an unfair distinction between francophone and anglophone schools. In a summary of their decision Thursday, the Appeal Court justices,\u00a0Manon\u00a0Savard, Yves-Marie\u00a0Morrissette\u00a0et Marie-France\u00a0Bich, said the law does not go against \"the unwritten principles of the Constitution, nor the constitutional architecture, nor any pre-Confederation law or principle having constitutional value.\" Quebec Court of Appeal to evaluate whether secularism law unfairly targets Muslim women They said their judgment had nothing to do with \"diverse opinions about [the law], whether politically, sociologically or morally.\" \"The Court, like the Superior Court before it, is in fact acting here as part of a process of monitoring the legality of the law (a process initiated by different groups of litigants) and it is not ruling on the wisdom of the law,\" the judges wrote. The secularism law, which has been in place since June 2019, prevents a number of civil servants\u00a0\u2014 including teachers and police officers\u00a0\u2014 from wearing religious symbols while on the job. The justices\u00a0said that, in their opinion, Blanchard had erred in creating the exception for English schools. They said the law did not impede anglophone students from receiving their minority-language education. \"Rather, what is at issue here is a restriction on the recruitment of personnel, which however remains unrelated to any linguistic consideration,\" the judges wrote. WATCH\u00a0| What's in the Quebec Court of Appeal decision on Bill 21?: Quebec Court of Appeal upholds CAQ government's secularism law 1 year ago Duration 0:58 The ruling revokes a previous exception, made by a Superior Court Judge, that allowed English schools to employ teachers wearing religious symbols \u2014 such as a head covering \u2014 while at work. The judges did however\u00a0maintain another exception created in Blanchard's judgment\u00a0\u2014 that MNAs be exempt from the law\u00a0\u2014\u00a0saying elected officials should have the right to wear religious symbols, unlike other\u00a0representatives of the state in positions of authority such as judges, Crown prosecutors, prison guards, police officers, school principals and teachers. Several groups have challenged the law's constitutionality. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Council of Canadian Muslims were among those arguing Bill 21 discriminates on the basis of religion. Arguments in the Court of Appeal case were heard by a panel of judges a year and a half ago. At the time, the panel of judges\u00a0hinted that the case hinged\u00a0on whether the bill disproportionately discriminates against Muslim women who wear the hijab. CBC Explains What's in Quebec's secularism bill: Religious symbols, uncovered faces and a charter workaround Legault: Quebec will continue to use notwithstanding clause A key argument of groups opposed to the law is that it discriminates on the basis of gender by disproportionately targeting Muslim women. Provincial laws that can be shown to be discriminatory on the basis of gender cannot be\u00a0shielded by the notwithstanding clause. Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault arrives to address the media in Montreal, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024, where he gave his reaction to the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision on the province's secularism law, known as Bill 21. (Graham Hughes\/The Canadian Press) The CAQ pre-emptively invoked the constitutional notwithstanding clause when drafting the\u00a0bill to protect it against legal challenges. The clause gives provinces the power to override portions\u00a0the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for renewable periods of five years. But the Appeal Court judges said the law, and its use of the notwithstanding clause,\u00a0couldn't be \"invalidated\" based solely on discrimination on the basis of gender.\u00a0They also said the law itself does not go against that part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a short news conference, Legault told reporters the decision was \"a great victory for the Quebec nation.\" \"The Quebec\u00a0government will continue to use the notwithstanding clause as long as necessary for Canada to recognize the social choices of the Quebec nation. It's non-negotiable,\" the premier said.

(Ryan Remiorz\/The Canadian Press) Disappointment Joe Ortona,\u00a0chair of the English Montreal School Board, which first challenged Bill 21 in Superior Court, said he was disappointed by the decision, especially for all the teachers who would be affected by the law from now on. \"My heart goes out to them,\" Ortona said. \"It's part of the reason we launched this challenge to begin with. \u00a0We think that teachers should have the right to wear whatever they want.\" Ortona said he would be reviewing the decision before deciding with the board whether to apply for a Supreme Court appeal.

I had to leave my family, my friends, go to a new province that I've never been to before, reacclimatize myself to a new curriculum, and just start from zero,\" Kaur said in an interview with CBC on Wednesday. Other groups that have challenged the law\u00a0have already said they would take the case to the country's highest court. Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, called the decision \"painful\" and said the organization would pursue its fight against the law. \"What's next as we fight it? We have fought it from the very first day and we will continue fighting in the courts and with the public to get this bill reversed, struck down, anything we can do to restore fundamental rights to everybody,\" said Mendelsohn Aviv. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des femmes du Qu\u00e9bec, which gave expert testimony to overturn the law also said Thursday's decision is a \"considerable loss\" and that Bill 21 reinforces Islamophobia in the province. \"Muslim women are the first targets of the public debate on secularism,\"\u00a0said the federation's president Sylvie St-Amand in a statement. She adds that she's worried this most recent ruling will lead to an increase in violence already being experienced by Muslim women. \"A feminist society can never tolerate laws that restrict women's rights to make decisions about their bodies and beliefs, that limit their ability to participate in society, obtain services or find employment,\" reads the statement. Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, was at the Quebec Court of Appeal yesterday when the decision to uphold the province's secularism law was published. 'The notwithstanding clause should in our view never be used to violate the fundamental rights of minority groups,' she said. (Kwabena Oduro\/CBC) Next, the Supreme Court? Federal Justice Minister Arif Virani said in a statement he expects there will requests to bring the case to the Supreme Court of Canada and if the court agrees to hear the appeal, the case would become a \"national issue.\" \"Our government will be there to defend the Charter before the Supreme Court of Canada. This case concerns fundamental rights and freedoms and concerns the interpretation and application of the Charter. We are absolutely committed to participating in this important national discussion with broad implications for all Canadians,\" Virani said in the written statement. Guillaume Rousseau, a lawyer for the Mouvement la\u00efque qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois , one of the groups in favour of the law and which participated in the appeal of the Superior Court decision, called Thursday's judgment a \"victory on all fronts.\" \"It's a great victory for all of those who support a secular Quebec, and it's a especially a victory for those who support Quebec's liberty, Quebec's autonomy,\" Rousseau told reporters at the courthouse in downtown Montreal. \"This is a clear disavowal for all those who have been telling us for years that it is possible to circumvent the derogation clause.\" Ahead of the Appeal Court decision's release, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a housing announcement in Ontario that he wanted to reiterate his opposition to Quebec's secularism law and said his government would support a Supreme Court appeal. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet criticized Trudeau and Virani for saying they would pick a side in a Supreme Court case. \"Using the courts as a recourse is always legitimate. Supported by the state against another government is something else,\" Blanchet said.

Ingersoll, Ont.'s Shelton scored the\u00a0first goal in the first Professional Women's Hockey League game, en route to shutting out Toronto 4-0 on Monday afternoon. When New York selected her with the team's first-round draft pick (4th overall) in September, part of the team's plan to build from the blue line out, 25-year-old Shelton was asked what the\u00a0younger version of herself would think of that moment.

Growing up in a small town, she always played with boys. On New Year's Day, playing in front of a sold-out crowd of 2,537 people\u00a0at the old Maple Leaf Gardens (now Mattamy Athletic Centre), Shelton's goal marked the start of a new era in professional women's hockey. In the process, she created a moment that young girls in those stands will remember for the rest of their lives, and offered a glimpse of what could be possible for the next 10-year-old girl dreaming hockey dreams.

There are high hopes for this league, in spite of the bumpy history of professional women\u2019s hockey. \"I think the emotions are just surreal right now,\" Shelton told CBC's Anastasia Bucsis during the first intermission.\"This crowd and coming to play your first professional hockey game in 2024, it's quite the bang to start off the year.\" New York goaltender Corinne Schroeder saved all 29 shots that came her way in the win, earning a shutout and first-star honours, while Alex Carpenter, Jill Saulnier and Kayla Vespa had the team's other goals.

Toronto failed to capitalize\u00a0on more than a minute of 5-on-3 time in the third period, and ultimately couldn't solve Schroeder over three periods. New York came out looking faster and more connected. \"We have a special group in there,\" Shelton said. \"We have a lot of fun together. We work hard and we come determined to put our best foot forward and be a successful team this year.\" Campbell made 24 saves for Toronto in the loss. A new beginning Before the game, PWHL investor, tennis legend and equality advocate Billie Jean King read out the starting lineup inside Toronto's dressing room: Sarah Nurse, captain Blayre Turnbull, Samantha Cogan, Jocelyne Larocque, Renata Fast and Campbell, the goalie her teammates call \"Soup.\" \"Good luck, and this is a day to cherish for the rest of your lives,\" King told the team. PWHL tweaks penalty, short-handed goal, shootout in rule book History in the making: PWHL's Toronto vs. New York begins new era in women's hockey When it came time for GM Gina Kingsbury\u00a0to address her squad, she felt uncharacteristically speechless. It's a moment she's dreamed about for years, too, having played in leagues that didn't pay, inside community rinks with staff who were volunteers, playing with women who worked long days at second jobs to come to the rink late at night and play a game they loved. \"We are there with the athletes on the ice today,\" Kingsbury told CBC's Andi Petrillo. \"I think we're all so excited that we're finally here and that there's a professional league for these athletes to play in,\u00a0and that the door of the gate is wide open for the next generation of athletes to walk right in and be a professional athlete.\" WATCH l How we got here: The journey to the creation of the PWHL: How We Got Here: The journey to the creation of the PWHL 1 year ago Duration 2:39 CBC Sports' Andi Petrillo chronicles the long road to a sustainable professional women's hockey league, from the collapse of the CWHL to first puck drop in the PWHL. As excited as she was for the players, Kingsbury said she was also thrilled for the team's staff to get the opportunity to do their jobs in a professional environment. \"For me to be a GM and just talk hockey and to plan and build a team is a dream come true,\" Kingsbury said. \"It's pretty hard to put into words what it means. It's not just the athletes. It's everyone involved.\" 'They keep pinching themselves' During the pre-game ceremony, every member of Toronto's team, including reserve players, heard their name and hometown announced as they skated on to the ice. There were rookies like Emma Maltais and Maggie Connors, who get to start their careers with the kind of resources women before them could only have dreamed about. There was Nurse, who spent countless hours as part of the player committee\u00a0that negotiated the eight-year collective bargaining agreement that secured players benefits like maternity leave and a housing stipend. It enshrined things that sound basic, like pre- and post-game meals, but haven't always been guaranteed for women who played professional hockey. Toronto PWHL players line up on the blueline before Monday's game. (Frank Gunn\/The Canadian Press) There were Jess Jones and Erica Howe, who spent years making almost nothing in the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), and who have put other careers on hold to be part of this new league. They aren't on their country's national team, but they've kept playing through a folded league and a pandemic, maybe wondering whether they'd get a chance to be a part of this. There was Vespa, who was about to score her first professional league goal in front of a hometown crowd, after spending last hockey season balancing hockey with a job as a snowplow operator with the City of Hamilton. Shortly after, King took the arm of Jayna Hefford, the Hockey Hall of Famer who serves as the PWHL's senior vice president of hockey operations, and they walked to centre ice, waving to the crowd.\u00a0King kissed the puck before dropping it between New York captain Micah\u00a0Zandee-Hart and Turnbull.

It was almost five years ago when King and her wife, Ilana Kloss, answered the phone at a Los Angeles Lakers game. When they found a quiet spot to talk, they heard Minnesota forward Kendall Coyne Schofield on the other end of the line,\u00a0asking for their help. King and Kloss became advisors to the players' association that Coyne Schofield and other players spearheaded, and ultimately convinced Los Angeles Dodgers owner Mark Walter to invest what is now the PWHL. Both King and Kloss sit on the league's advisory board. But the creation of the PWHL is\u00a0a story that spans more than five years. It weaves through more generations than the women who got to play on Monday. Men have had the NHL for more than 100 years, while women have been waiting for a similar opportunity, King told Petrillo before the game. \"The women are so excited,\" King said. \"They keep pinching themselves. I don't think people realize the yearning that's gone on for generations for this.\" Rematch set for Friday For the last five years, female hockey players have spent a lot of time talking about inequity, about league building, and about a supposed \"rift\" between the players who sat out and those who played in the defunct Premier Hockey Federation. Now, they're all together in one league and they get to talk about playing hockey, with Monday's game the first of 72 across the PWHL this season.

The CARICOM troops are expected to help support the Haitian National Police in their efforts to\u00a0restore security for people in Haiti, the statement said. The Canadian-led training mission, known as Operation HELIOS, will take place at the CAF's Operational Support Hub in Jamaica. The Canadian deployment will last for an initial period of one month, where the CAF\u00a0expects to train around 330 CARICOM troops, said the release. The Canadian personnel deployed are primarily from the 1st Battalion, Royal 22e R\u00e9giment from Valcartier, Que. \"Canada is stepping up with important contributions to Haiti's security. We will continue to support Haitian-led efforts to build stability,\" said Minister of National Defence Bill Blair in the release. 'Cataclysmic' situation in Haiti Haiti's gang wars have intensified in recent weeks with heavily armed rivals unleashing fresh waves of attacks, including raids on police stations and\u00a0 the international airport. Over 1,500 people have been killed so far this year in the ensuing violence, said a UN\u00a0human rights office report Thursday, describing the \"cataclysmic\" situation in Haiti. A woman walks past burning tires during a demonstration following the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on March 12. (Clarens Siffroy\/AFP\/Getty Images) The report documents 4,451 killings last year and 1,554 so far this year, up\u00a0to March 22, as violence has escalated. Some people have been killed in their homes in reprisal for their alleged support for the police or rival gangs. Others have been killed in the street by snipers or in crossfire, the UN\u00a0report said. One of the victims was a three-month-old baby. Armed brigades filling a security void left by police lynched 528 people suspected of links to gangs last year and 59 so far this year, the UN\u00a0rights office said. \"The recent escalation of violence has heightened human rights abuses, including killings, kidnappings, and rapes, especially against women and young girls,\" the report said in its conclusions, calling on states to support the rapid deployment of a UN-backed international security force. Canada's involvement Roughly 3,000 Canadians are registered in Haiti, according to Global Affairs Canada (GAC). With airports and roads under gang control, leaving the country has been a challenge. GAC issued an update Thursday that 50 Canadians were evacuated from the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, to the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The department has now assisted 132 Canadian citizens in reuniting with their families, it said.

On top of efforts to get Canadians out safely, Canada is contributing $80.5 million to the multinational security force but says it will not send soldiers or police to participate directly. A very small number of RCMP officers are deployed to Haiti now, mostly in training roles. Their number fluctuates; the terms of the deployment allow for up to 45 Mounties to be in Haiti at a time, but their current complement numbers in the single digits. Soldiers and police making up the multinational security force will come from Kenya, Benin, Jamaica, Trinidad, Guyana, Barbados and a few other Caribbean island nations. Kenya will take the lead and will be the first to deploy. The Kenya-led mission is not a United Nations operation but it was authorized by the UN Security Council in October. The Haitian government requested the mission in 2022. It has since encountered multiple legal obstacles, including a January court ruling in Kenya that blocked the deployment of Kenyan police officers.

Ryan Albright said he's been working with his insurance company, and while it will likely be a lengthy process, he hopes to rebuild the Covered Bridge Potato Chips manufacturing plant as soon as possible. \"We're also in full design mode, you know, trying to lay out building equipment, looking at timelines,\" Albright said in an interview Wednesday. \"But that'll be an evolving thing over the next days and weeks to come,\" he said, adding that he hopes the plant\u00a0can will have increased processing capacity along with a more efficient\u00a0manufacturing operation.

About an hour into his drive, he said\u00a0he received\u00a0a call from an employee telling him about the fire He turned around and drove back to the plant to find the building in flames.

Those include two large shipping warehouses, a raw materials warehouse and the company's head office in Saint Thomas, about 10 kilometres away. He said the warehouses still have products ready to be shipped to stores. Also, in an effort to keep some production going, Albright said he's working on an interim arrangement that would allow the business to make potato chips at another local company's factory. Working on next steps for employees Albright said the company employed 185 people, with some having relocated permanently from other parts of the world, and others working under the federal temporary foreign worker program. He said for the company's temporary foreign workers, he's working on flying them back to their home countries. As for the other affected employees, Albright said the company has been trying to match them with other jobs in the community.

Story continues below advertisement The UN says it has asked the global community for $2.7 billion in funding to respond to humanitarian needs but has received $155 million \u2014 or six per cent of their request. \u201cIf the World Food Program does not receive more support for its Sudan appeal, that they will simply stop serving food because they will run out of money to purchase food supplies,\u201d Hussen said the food agency\u2019s executive director, Cindy McCain, told him recently. He said aid groups and other non-government organizations will also be participating in the talks, which will focus not just on aid but also on how to resolve the conflict and hold those responsible to account. Canada has predominantly responded to the crisis through humanitarian aid, committing $170 million last year. A family reunification program was announced late last year to help get relatives of Canadians out of Sudan, but the program has stalled and faced criticism from families. The federal government has regularly sent aid to the country in recent years as part of its African outreach.

Parts of southern Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes were momentarily plunged into the dark\u00a0as the moon slid between the sun and the Earth over the course of a few hours in the afternoon. The sky dimmed, birds went quiet, streetlights came on and\u00a0the\u00a0sun's corona \u2014\u00a0a ghostly white ring around its outer edge\u00a0\u2014 became visible to the human eye. \"This is incredible. That diamond ring ... that's gorgeous,\"\u00a0said CBC's\u00a0Chris Ensing, standing at the edge of Lake Erie during totality in Kingsville, Ont. \"What a moment.\" Clouds threatened\u00a0to block the view of the sun in many areas within the path of totality, but the thin layer of clouds didn't seem to make much of a difference as the moon cast its shadow over parts of Canada. Some crowds clapped at the sight overhead, like those in Kingsville, while others went quiet. The crowd in Niagara Falls cheered for Norma Rois, 58, when she yelled out that it was her birthday during a moment of the totality.

I don't know their names, but we were cheering together,\" she said. Kathy Eller of O'Leary, P.E.I., said she had no regrets after waiting outside for six hours to take in the total eclipse near the province's northwestern tip. \"It was better than fireworks,\" she said. \"I forgot about everybody around, and was just concentrating on the sun and the moon. It was kind of like magic.\" In the nation's capital, a public inquiry looking into foreign interference in Canada's elections paused\u00a0proceedings so the\u00a0lawyers, witnesses and journalists could see\u00a0the show. Thousands of people\u00a0in\u00a0Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, were first on the continent to experience\u00a0totality\u00a0at 1:05\u00a0p.m. ET. Crowds came together in deck chairs on the coastline, looking skyward through\u00a0eclipse glasses as the moon slipped across the sky. \"It was absolutely remarkable. The sky was a little bit cloudy ... but the eclipse totality was not obscured at all,\" said Joy Daniels, an eclipse chaser who\u00a0travelled to Mazatl\u00e1n\u00a0from her home in Calgary with 13 friends and family members. \"It went quite dark.... The birds, they all went to sleep\u00a0and the temperature went way, way down.\" The eclipse began over the southern Pacific Ocean before moving into Mexico and the United States.\u00a0Crowds\u00a0in southwestern Ontario were the first in Canada to experience the eclipse before the show\u00a0moved into Quebec and Atlantic Canada, where it ended off the coast of Newfoundland after roughly 30 minutes. In Canada, the path of totality \u2014\u00a0the stretch where the moon will block the sunlight entirely \u2014\u00a0included\u00a0parts of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador. People outside the path of totality in Ontario , Quebec and the Maritimes could see a partial solar eclipse, with just a chunk\u00a0of the sun obscured by the moon. Here's what else you need to know. What did the total solar eclipse look like? Why was this eclipse so significant? Do I need special glasses to look at eclipses? Can I take photos of eclipses\u00a0on my phone? Were Canadian cities in the path of totality\u00a0busy? What did\u00a0the\u00a0total solar eclipse look like? A total solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, completely blocking the face of the sun. People watching from\u00a0the path of totality\u00a0experience what's called a\u00a0total solar eclipse. The sky goes dark\u00a0as if it were dawn or dusk. Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun's corona,\u00a0the white ring usually washed out by the bright light of the sun. Outside the path of totality, the moon moved between the sun and Earth \u2014 but the three didn't line up perfectly. Only a part of the sun was covered, giving it a crescent-like shape.

Why was\u00a0this eclipse so significant? After Monday, the next total solar eclipse over North America won't be until Aug. 23, 2044. Beyond that, this event was particularly special because the path of totality passed over densely populated parts of\u00a0Canada, Mexico and the U.S. (Most solar eclipses happen over the ocean.) This one was also a longer show, with darkness lasting nearly two minutes longer over some areas in the path of totality than the last solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017. Do I need special glasses to look at eclipses? Yes. It's always dangerous to look at the sun with the naked eye.\u00a0Space\u00a0agencies and ophthalmologists agree that looking at a partial solar eclipse without approved eye protection can cause lasting eye damage. The Canadian Space Agency and NASA have both\u00a0extended advice for protecting your vision. Eclipse glasses are sold at a variety of stores, both in person and online, but it's important to check for one key feature: Your glasses should be marked with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 12312-2 code. That code specifies the properties that a solar viewer should have to protect your eyes. Can I take photos of\u00a0eclipses\u00a0on my phone? Photographers don't recommend it. Just like the immense amount of direct light from the sun can damage your eyes, it can damage the lens of a camera. If you're really compelled to take a photo of the sun, photographers say you should cover the lens with a solar filter \u2014 though they say their favourite photos are the ones that captured people as they experience\u00a0the show. Were\u00a0Canadian cities in the path of totality\u00a0busy? Busier than usual. Many photographers and eclipse chasers spent months, if not years, planning for the total solar eclipse. Some have spent thousands of dollars travelling to what they hoped would\u00a0be the best vantage point.\u00a0Cities\u00a0in the path of totality expected hundreds of thousands of people to flood their communities on Monday, potentially creating traffic jams. (Niagara Falls, Ont., was expected to be so crowded that the region declared a state of emergency 11\u00a0days in advance .

They trekked across the sea ice before setting sail in three lifeboats and reaching the uninhabited Elephant Island. Shackleton and handful of crew mates then rowed some 1,290 km (800 miles) to South Georgia and sought help from a whaling station.

Dallas scored five goals in Game 3 to take the series lead; the Stars managed four goals, total, in the next three games. On Sunday, Mason Marchment scored midway through the third period and Jake Oettinger stopped eight shots for the Stars, who finished the regular season with the second-best record in the NHL:\u00a0113 points, just one behind the New York Rangers in the race for the Presidents' Trophy. Oettinger went to the bench with about 2:20 left in the game, but the Stars got only two shots the rest of the way \u2014\u00a0their desperate tries to tie the game and extend the series coming up short.

Proud of our fight. Proud of our battle,\" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. \"We're just gutted. They did leave everything out there.\" Just by getting to the final, Edmonton has done something truly extraordinary \u2014 making the title series after finding itself 10 points out of a playoff spot during the regular season. Entering games on Nov. 24, the Oilers were 5-12-1,\u00a0 which was 10 points back of Seattle and St. Louis for the final wild-card spot in the West and 19 points behind Vegas for the top spot in the conference. Those days are long forgotten now. That's when the Oilers \u2014 a couple weeks after Kris Knoblauch took over as coach for Jay Woodcroft, who was dismissed following a 3-9-1 start \u2014 went on an eight-game winning streak and began the long climb out of the NHL's basement. Oilers' Zach Hyman (18) celebrates a goal against the Stars in the first period Sunday. (Jason Franson\/The Canadian Press) Starting with that eight-game win streak, the Oilers,\u00a0who had a 16-game winning streak not long after the eight-game run ended,\u00a0were the best team in the NHL for the remainder of the regular season. They were 44-15-5 the rest of the way, leading the league in goals (239) and goal differential (plus-76) in that span. And now, the final awaits. Much like the Panthers on Saturday night, the Oilers didn't touch the conference championship trophy in the post-game celebration. It's the bigger trophy that they're seeking. \"We're not done here. This is just one step in the right direction for us,\" Edmonton's Mattias Ekholm said. Edmonton is just the third team in NHL history to make the final after being 10 points or more out of a playoff spot; the others were Toronto in 1958-59 and St. Louis in 2018-19. The Blues won the Cup that season. Oilers' fans arrive for Game 6 of the Western Conference finals Sunday. (Jeff McIntosh\/The Canadian Press) The Oilers had only three shots in the first period of Game 6. They were enough. McDavid opened the scoring with a spectacular goal, weaving through traffic before beating Oettinger up high for a 1-0 lead. \"Connor McDavid, doing Connor McDavid things,\" Skinner said. Panthers going back to Stanley Cup final, top Rangers 2-1 to win East title in 6 games Oilers icon Messier credits team for rebounding after horrid start to NHL season Added Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl\u00a0said: \"There's one player in the world that can make things like that happen.\" McDavid then found Hyman in the slot for another power-play score late in the first; the shots at that point were 6-3 Dallas, but the score was 2-0 Edmonton and the Oilers were on their way. The Oilers finished with only 10 shots on goal, the fewest by a team in a playoff win since 1990. \"We hung in there.

The blaze began on Friday night and was described by officials as \"exhibiting extreme fire behaviour\". Wildfires have also led to evacuation alerts and orders in the neighbouring province of Alberta. The Canadian government has warned this year's weather conditions would mean a greater wildfire risk in the country. The Parker Lake fire, as it's been called by the British Columbia Wildfire Service (BCWS), was 8sq km (3 sq miles) in size as of Saturday morning after growing rapidly overnight. Some 3,000 people in Fort Nelson - located in northeast BC about 1,600km (1,000 miles) from Vancouver - were ordered to evacuate. Rob Fraser, mayor of the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality, told CBC News the fire began after high winds knocked a tree over and it crashed onto a power line and caught fire. \"And then by the time our firefighters were able to get down there, the wind had whipped this up into a fire that they weren't able to handle with the apparatus that we had,\" Mr Fraser said. Strong winds and dry conditions are making the fire more difficult to fight, according to the BCWS. As of Saturday, the fire was being fought by nine helicopters, as well as ground crews and a structure protection specialist, whose job it is to protect structures affected by wildfires. In Alberta, people in the Grande Prairie region are under evacuation alerts and some have been asked to leave due to a blaze burning 4km east of the hamlet of TeePee Creek in the province's northwest. Residents of Fort McMurray, a town of about 68,000 people, have also been told to be ready to leave as an out-of-control blaze burns some 25km southwest of the city. In parts of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, Environment Canada issued Saturday air quality alerts due to wildfire smoke. Last year was a devastating year for Canadian wildfires, with 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of forest burned - the most destructive season in the country's history. Eight firefighters died and some 230,000 people were displaced from their homes. 'Zombie Fires' burning at an alarming rate in Canada The indiscriminate devastation of Canada's wildfires Why is the world getting warmer? An update by Environment Canada this week predicted challenging weather conditions that could lead to another difficult wildfire season ahead. Higher temperatures in the spring and summer could \"exacerbate the risk and intensity of both natural and human-caused wildfires\", officials said. A warmer-than-normal winter that left little snow on the ground also compounded droughts in several regions. Globally, last year was the hottest on record. It was driven by human-caused warming, but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Ni\u00f1o. Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world, including in Canada. But climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body.

(Justin Tang\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Some parliamentarians were accused this week of conspiring with foreign governments, but their exact numbers and their identities remain a mystery to the public \u2014 and to many of their colleagues. The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) \u2014 a group of MPs and senators who hold top secret security clearances and are permanently bound to secrecy under the Security of Information Act \u2014 released a heavily redacted report on foreign political interference Monday. In it, NSICOP alleged that\u00a0some MPs and senators\u00a0are \"wittingly\"\u00a0helping foreign governments\u00a0like China and India\u00a0meddle in Canadian politics. The allegation sparked outrage and expressions of distrust on Parliament Hill, and the Conservatives called on\u00a0the Liberal government to reveal the identities of the\u00a0parliamentarians under suspicion. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc\u00a0has been refusing to do so, saying it would be inappropriate to release the names\u00a0and citing\u00a0his obligations\u00a0under the Security of Information Act. NSICOP chair David McGuinty said the committee's \"hands are tied\" and it can't divulge the identities of the parliamentarians cited in the report. He said\u00a0it's now up to the RCMP to decide what happens next. Analysis A foreign interference report lobbed bombshells at Parliament. Now what? Conservative leader calls on Liberal government to release names of MPs accused of helping foreign states The RCMP says it won't comment on whether there is an active criminal investigation into any parliamentarian. The police service did confirm there are active investigations into a broad range of foreign interference efforts in Canada, \"including matters which intersect with democratic institutions.\" What are the allegations? The report says the committee members have reviewed intelligence indicating that certain parliamentarians are or have been \"'semi-witting or witting' participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in Canadian politics.\"\u00a0The report says those parliamentarians' alleged actions\u00a0include: Communicating frequently with foreign missions before or during political campaigns to obtain support from community groups or businesses which the diplomatic missions promise to quietly mobilize in a candidate's favour. Accepting knowingly or through willful blindness funds or benefits from foreign missions or their proxies which have been layered or otherwise disguised to conceal their source. Providing foreign diplomatic officials with privileged information on the work or opinions of fellow parliamentarians, knowing that such information will be used by those officials to inappropriately pressure parliamentarians to change their positions. Responding to requests or direction from foreign officials to improperly influence parliamentary colleagues or parliamentary business to the advantage of a foreign state. Providing information learned in confidence from the government to a known intelligence officer of a foreign state. The report names China and India as two of the countries allegedly conspiring with Canadian parliamentarians. Is the alleged behaviour illegal? National security and intelligence expert Wesley Wark\u00a0said he was nauseated by the alleged actions detailed\u00a0in the report \u2014 actions he said\u00a0\"absolutely\" rise\u00a0to the level of treason\u00a0in some instances. \"The treason offences in the Criminal Code, which have been around for a long time, involve for example the unlawful communication of information to a foreign state in peacetime,\" Wark told\u00a0CBC's Power & Politics . \"You have a piece of the Criminal Code that is there, on the shelf, ready to be used.\" But while the NSICOP report itself says\u00a0some of the activity detailed may be illegal, it also argues criminal charges are unlikely \"owing to Canada's failure to address the long-standing issue of protecting classified information and methods in judicial processes.\" Parliamentarians conspiring with foreign governments is 'treason': security expert 11 months ago Duration 8:36 Senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation Wesley Wark says the idea of parliamentarians conspiring with foreign governments is 'nausea-inducing' and would amount to 'treason.' In other words, Canada's security services struggle to\u00a0turn intelligence into evidence. It's a \"huge issue,\" said Michelle Tessier,\u00a0who served as deputy director of operations at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) from 2018 to 2023. \"Other countries are able to allow the protection of intelligence \u2014 to allow, for example, a judge to see that intelligence and be able to question it and make that decision based on classified intelligence,\"\u00a0Tessier told Power & Politics . \"In Canada, in the criminal justice system, it's really full disclosure. \"The system is very cumbersome. There is a lot of intelligence that cannot be shared and frankly, in my opinion, its one of the most important things that should be looked at \u2014 the ability to use that information in the court of law while protecting national security interests.\" Should the accused parliamentarians be unmasked? The Conservatives are demanding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly reveal the names of the implicated parliamentarians. \"Criminal prosecution is not the only tool available to the government to counter foreign interference threats against Parliament,\"\u00a0Michael Chong, Conservative foreign affairs critic, said this week on Power & Politics . \"Sunlight and transparency is another tool that our security agencies have long said the government should be using.\" The Liberal government maintains it would be inappropriate to reveal the names, citing the sensitive nature of\u00a0the intelligence. Should names of MPs accused of working on behalf of foreign governments be released? 11 months ago Duration 15:48 A new national security report alleges some members of Parliament have conspired with foreign actors, but should their names be released? Parliamentary Secretary to the deputy prime minister Ryan Turnbull, Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong and NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson join Power & Politics to discuss. \"My colleague knows full well that no responsible government would disclose names involved in specific intelligence situations,\" LeBlanc said in response to Chong's demand\u00a0in the House that\u00a0the prime minister name the parliamentarians. \"It is not entirely accurate of him to claim that a responsible government, one that focuses on the security of Canada and our democratic institutions, would do such a thing.\" Wark\u00a0said he thinks simply naming the parliamentarians is a bad idea. \"We have to be very careful about naming and shaming in the public square, which is something that probably authoritarian states who delight in foreign interference would be very pleased by \u2014 a way to kind of upend democracy,\" he said. \"The real route forward is prosecutions.\" Former CSIS director Richard Fadden\u00a0said\u00a0he thinks criminal prosecution is unlikely\u00a0but he believes the House and the Senate should take it upon themselves to investigate the allegations further. \"There is a constitutional convention that says both houses of Parliament are the sole master of their procedures and the treatment of their members,\" said Fadden. \"I would refer it to the committee on ethics, to the board of internal economy, to the party leaderships,\u00a0to somebody within the House to take a decision. Once that decision is taken \u2014\u00a0that there has been a serious violation of MPs oaths and of their responsibility to Canada \u2014\u00a0then I think we should come to the issue of whether or not ... their identity should be made public.\" Unnamed parliamentarians conspired with foreign governments, report alleges 11 months ago Duration 13:19 The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians alleged in a report published Monday that some unnamed parliamentarians conspired with foreign governments and consciously shared sensitive information with their agents. Power & Politics speaks to two former CSIS directors  \u2014  Richard Fadden and Ward Elcock  \u2014  about the stunning allegations. The government is offering to brief opposition party leaders who obtain the necessary security clearances on the classified intelligence. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party co-leader Elizabeth May have both said they will take the government up on this offer. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u00a0Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet\u00a0said\u00a0he is considering the offer. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has, to date, refused classified briefings on foreign interference, claiming\u00a0it\u00a0would restrict his ability to speak publicly on the issue.

The shooting prompted a lockdown of both the daycare facility and the Catholic all-boys elementary school, and parents rushed to the area to pick up their children. Detective Sgt. Al Bartlett said the man and woman who were killed worked together in what he described as financial transaction business. \u201cIt\u2019s our belief at this point that the altercation that took place is in relation to that business,\u201d Bartlett. \u201cThe person that we believe to be responsible is among the deceased,\u201d he added.

Brian Rudy, a partner with Moriyama Teshima Architects, said news of the science centre\u2019s abrupt closure last week left them \u201cdumbfounded.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to think that the whole building needs to be immediately shut down,\u201d Rudy told The Canadian Press. \u201cIt\u2019s so obviously a political move.\u201d Raymond Moriyama, who died last year, designed the science centre that opened in 1969 on a ravine near the west branch of the Don River in Toronto\u2019s east end. At a hastily called news conference last Friday, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Infrastructure\u00a0Ontario\u00a0announced the science centre would close by 4 p.m. due to health and safety concerns over the roof. Story continues below advertisement 2:57 Government defends Ontario Science Centre shutdown The closure sparked outrage from local residents, science lovers and opposition politicians. Many have called on the government to reverse course. The province blamed failing roof panels made with a material called reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, a lightweight form of concrete that was popular in the 1960s and \u201970s. The government said it acted fast after receiving an engineer\u2019s report earlier in the week that laid out problems with the roof. The science centre\u2019s board decided to close the institution. The report, written by the engineering firm Rimkus Consulting, did not recommend an immediate closure. Some roof panels are at risk of collapse and Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma said the engineers told government officials that the roof should be replaced in its entirety. That would take two to five years and cost upwards of $40 million.

Successive governments, from Progressive Conservatives to Liberals to New Democrats, deferred maintenance. Rudy said his firm analyzed the engineer\u2019s report and he thinks there are a number of ways forward, and questioned the government\u2019s actions. \u201cIt\u2019s not as urgent as they would let on,\u201d Rudy said. Story continues below advertisement \u201cMost of the panels actually aren\u2019t even above exhibition spaces. So the urgency to close exhibition spaces is unfounded. In fact, all of the permanent exhibit spaces are free of this type of roof panel entirely, so it\u2019s not even a concern.\u201d Rudy takes no issue with the thrust of the engineer\u2019s report. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that repairs need to be made and that\u2019s no different than any building of this age,\u201d he said. \u201cAny building or museum of this size is going to have periodic maintenance at this age, so this is something that they know and that they do in phases, even if there are panels above public spaces.

(Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters) Social Sharing The Conn Smythe Trophy was small consolation for Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid on Monday night. The superstar forward, crushed after his team came painfully short in a 2-1 Game 7 loss to the Florida Panthers, did not return to the ice to receive the individual award from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. It was the first time since 2003 that a player from the losing team was given the honour as most valuable player in the playoffs. Speaking outside his team's dressing room, a despondent McDavid offered few words when asked for his thoughts. \"It's an honour with the names on that trophy,\" he said. The 27-year-old McDavid led all players with 42 points (eight goals, 34 assists) in the playoffs. After the Oilers lost the first three games of the final, McDavid had four points (1-3) in Game 4 and four more points (2-2) in Game 5 to become the first player in Stanley Cup final history with consecutive four-point games.

Playoff assists record McDavid broke Wayne Gretzky's playoff assists record of 31 and fell five points shy of the Great One's points mark of 47 in a single post-season. The six-foot-one 194-pound centre is the first player to have four different four-point games in a single Stanley Cup playoff run since the Oilers' glory days of the 1980s. Gretzky had six four-point games in the 1985 playoffs, while Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri had four apiece that same year. Mark Messier had four such games during the 1988 playoffs.

He's the best in the world and he's shown it on the biggest stage game in and game out.\" This is the fourth consecutive season that McDavid led the NHL in points while combining regular-season and post-season contests.

Gen. Jennie Carignan officially took over command of the Canadian Armed Forces in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Carignan is the first woman to lead the military of any Group of 20 or Group of Seven country. \u201cThat could create a model and a change in terms of what is possible for women,\u201d Carignan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great step forward. It is a result of many, many years within the Canadian Forces.\u201d Carignan was promoted to the rank of general during the change-of-command ceremony, after being chosen by Trudeau\u2019s government to become Canada\u2019s first female defense chief. Trudeau called it a historic day and praised Carignan as someone of the right caliber to take over. He named her to the role earlier this month. \u201cYou are the very first woman to ever become Chief of the Defense staff in Canada, the very first in the G7 and the G20. You are a role model for all Canadians and the world,\u201d Trudeau said during the ceremony.

(David Richard\/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing The federal government has named Lt.-Gen. Jennie Carignan as defence chief. As CBC News first reported last week , Carignan's appointment makes her the first woman\u00a0to hold the Canadian Armed Forces' top job.\u00a0She is currently the military's chief of professional conduct and culture, a position created following the sexual misconduct crisis. Several high-ranking leaders were forced to step down from their posts after they were accused of sexual misconduct in 2021. Lt.-Gen. Jennie Carignan chosen as next chief of the defence staff A military in crisis: Here are the senior leaders embroiled in sexual misconduct cases Woman testifies she froze, feared for her life during alleged sex assault by former head of military HR The resulting scandal prompted a damning external report by former Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour that made a series of recommendations to change the toxic culture within the Armed Forces. Carignan has been the face of the efforts to reform that culture, providing updates to the public about efforts to implement those recommendations. Carignan joined the military in 1986. She\u00a0has commanded combat engineer regiments and led troops responding to floods in Quebec. In 2008, she became the first woman to lead a combat force in the Canadian military. She received the Meritorious Service Medal and the Governor General's Order of Military Merit, and her deployments included Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. She led a yearlong NATO mission in Iraq that ended in late 2020. Her official biography also notes that she has four children, including two who are members of the Armed Forces. Lieutenant-General Jennie Carignan arrives the the prime minister's office on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2024. (Sean Kilpatrick\/The Canadian Press) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Montreal on Wednesday that naming the new defence chief was an \"extraordinarily important choice.\" \"Particularly in these moments of complicated geopolitics and increased threats, particularly to our Arctic,\" he said. \"Making sure that we have the right person to lead our Armed Forces in this pivotal time was something that I think Canadians appropriately felt that we needed to take seriously, which we did.\" Military struggling to recruit Carignan takes over a military in transition, amid the ongoing culture change efforts and the urgent task of trying to rebuild its ranks after years of declining recruitment and poor retention. The Armed Forces is short roughly 16,000 troops\u00a0and for several years it has failed to recruit more members than it has lost to retirement or release, something that Defence Minister Bill Blair called a \"death spiral\" back in March. That has been a source of tension between the government and military leadership. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces face\u00a0increased demands to respond to weather-related emergencies in Canada and boost the country's presence in eastern Europe as war rages in Ukraine. Military is being called on too often to deal with domestic emergencies, commander warns Canadian military needs dedicated climate disaster force, former army commander says In a recent interview, the outgoing defence chief said the military is \"starting to sense a turnaround\" in recruitment. Gen. Wayne Eyre said Canada's allies are facing similar challenges in recruitment and the problem is not fully understood. He cited the \"very tight labour market\" as one challenge, along with changing demographics. Eyre said there are also issues with Canadians' readiness to serve, with \"increased incidence of medical challenges, mental-health challenges.\" Gen.

Eyre was appointed in 2021 when Adm. Art McDonald stepped down weeks into his tenure as defence chief after being accused of sexual misconduct. Gen.

Justice Glenn Joyal ruled on Thursday that Jeremy Skibicki was guilty of first-degree murder in the killings of Rebecca Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman, who was named Mashkode Bizhiki\u2019ikwe (Buffalo Woman) by Indigenous leaders. Joyal rejected an argument from the defence that Skibicki\u2019s mental health had prevented him from understanding his actions. Joyal said the \u201cmercilessly graphic\u201d nature of the case and Skibicki\u2019s \u201cpurely expressed racist views\u201d meant the killings had an \u201cundeniable and profound impact\u201d on the province of Manitoba, and laid bare the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada. The packed gallery in the Winnipeg courtroom erupted into cheers when the oral verdict was delivered. \u201cI just felt super happy. I wanted to cry,\u201d Jorden Myran, Marcedes\u2019s sister, told reporters after the verdict was read. \u201cWe fought for this for so long. He got what he deserved.\u201d On the eve of his trial, Skibicki admitted in May to killing the women. But his lawyers argued he should be found not criminally responsible for murders because he had schizophrenia at the time. Prosecutors argued that Skibicki\u2019s murders were racially motivated and that he deliberately targeted vulnerable women in the city\u2019s shelter system. The first-degree murder verdict means Skibicki will serve a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. The murders were first uncovered in 2022, when the remains of Rebecca Contois, a member of Crane River First Nation, were found in a dumpster near Skibicki\u2019s home. Police later found more remains in a city landfill. During police interrogations, Skibicki admitted to killing Contois and the three other women, who were living in Winnipeg at the time. He cited white supremacist beliefs. Dr Sohom Das, a forensic psychiatrist from the United Kingdom, testified for the defence, suggesting Skibicki suffered schizophrenia and was motivated by delusions, including a belief he was on a mission from God. But justice Joyal rejected Das\u2019s conclusion and questioned the psychiatrist\u2019s credibility. Instead, he sided with Dr Gary Chaimowitz, the forensic psychiatrist who testified for the prosecution. In graphic testimony, Chaimowitz told the court he believed Skibicki made up the alleged delusions, and was probably motivated by homicidal necrophilia. Joyal told the court a full written decision, more than 150 pages long, would be released next week. The sentencing hearing for Skibicki will be held at a later date. For families of the victims , the case has also been a grim reminder of government inaction: the remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be buried in the Prairie Green landfill, and police initially said they lacked the resources to search the privately owned facility, much of which is buried under tonnes of clay. In March, Canada pledged tens of millions of dollars to search landfill for the remains of two Indigenous women, with work set to begin in the fall. Donna Bartlett, Marcedes Myran\u2019s grandmother, told reporters outside the court she was \u201chappy\u201d that Skibicki would serve a prison sentence. \u201cHe got convicted of murder and I\u2019m glad of that, I really am.

Story continues below advertisement 2:57 Government defends Ontario Science Centre shutdown The closure sparked outrage from local residents, science lovers and opposition politicians. Many have called on the government to reverse course. The province blamed failing roof panels made with a material called reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, a lightweight form of concrete that was popular in the 1960s and \u201970s. The government said it acted fast after receiving an engineer\u2019s report earlier in the week that laid out problems with the roof. The science centre\u2019s board decided to close the institution. The report, written by the engineering firm Rimkus Consulting, did not recommend an immediate closure. Some roof panels are at risk of collapse and Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma said the engineers told government officials that the roof should be replaced in its entirety. That would take two to five years and cost upwards of $40 million.

Successive governments, from Progressive Conservatives to Liberals to New Democrats, deferred maintenance.

Log In Create Free Account Open this photo in gallery: Conservative candidate Don Stewart won the Toronto-St. Paul's by-election. Supplied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals were hit with a stunning upset in a Monday night by-election, losing a midtown Toronto riding the party had held for three decades and raising even more questions about the minority government\u2019s prospects in next year\u2019s general election. The dramatic result in Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s even surprised Conservatives , who for weeks have said they were not expecting to win the long-shot seat. Conservative candidate Don Stewart snatched the win from the Liberals with just 590 votes separating the two parties. Mr. Stewart, a marketing and finance professional, won with 42.1 per cent of the vote, with all of the polls reporting around 5 a.m. on Tuesday. Liberal Leslie Church was second with 40.5 per cent of the vote and NDP candidate Amrit Parhar won 10.9 per cent of the vote. Until last year, Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s was represented by Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, who had held the seat since 1997 and in the last election won with a 24-percentage-point margin over the second-place Conservatives. The Conservatives managed to close that gap Monday and win with a 1.6-percentage-point margin. The NDP vote share also fell compared to 2021, when they won 16.8 per cent. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre congratulated Mr. Stewart in a social media post, calling the result a \u201cshocking upset in Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s, where people voted to axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime.\u201d He said the result shows the Prime Minister needs to call a \u201ccarbon tax election now.\u201d Open this photo in gallery: A Conservative supporter watches a split screen displaying voting results and the Stanley Cup final, at an federal by-election event for Toronto-St.Paul's candidate Don Stewart in Toronto on Monday, June 24, 2024. Chris Young\/The Canadian Press The result stunned Liberals who went to sleep expecting a win and woke up to a loss that will be hard to overstate. Around 12:30 a.m., Ms. Church was welcomed into her party\u2019s headquarters by Liberal Party President Sachit Mehra as the riding\u2019s \u201cnext MP for Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s.\u201d Despite the fact that nearly half of the polls had not yet reported results, Ms. Church told supporters: \u201cWe are feeling great.\u201d Conversely, just before midnight on Monday, Mr. Stewart thanked his supporters and told them \u201cthe night is still young.\u201d In a brief scrum, Mr. Stewart told reporters his campaign\u2019s performance showed \u201cthe country is waiting for change.\u201d On Tuesday morning, Ms. Church released a statement conceding defeat but promising a rematch in next year\u2019s federal election. \u201cIt is a beginning, not an end,\u201d she said. Voters sent the Liberals a message that the party needs to \u201cre-earn their trust,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 16 months until the next election, and I plan to be the Liberal candidate in St. Paul\u2019s. We start working to earn back the trust of voters in this riding today.\u201d John Ibbitson: Regardless of leader, the Liberals are at risk of a worse fate after Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s by-election The result in a single riding though spells much more trouble for the Liberals and will dramatically increase the pressure on Mr. Trudeau and his tenure as leader. For months now he has adamantly said he will stay and try for a fourth mandate in government. But if the Liberals can\u2019t win Toronto-St. Paul\u2019s, it\u2019s unclear what seats could still be considered safe for them, say political watchers. Even during the party\u2019s worst defeat in 2011, it still held on to that seat with an 8-percentage-point margin. It is a massive win, said Ginny Roth, a partner at Crestview Strategy and previously a senior adviser to Mr. Poilievre during his leadership campaign. \u201cTo me, that means the Liberals are under 15 seats in a general election,\u201d she said. The party currently holds 155 seats and, in 2011, it held on to 34. For the Liberals, it is a \u201cbolt of political lightning,\u201d said Scott Reid, a Liberal strategist and principal at communications firm Feschuk.Reid. \u201cThere is no language too hyperbolic to describe the significance of this failure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can lose in St. Paul\u2019s, then the Liberal Party can lose anywhere, and that means it can lose everything.\u201d Mr. Reid said the result is particularly stinging for the Prime Minister \u201cbecause it tells him in indisputable, undeniable and implacable terms, that his leadership harms his own party.\u201d \u201cThe message for Liberals \u2013 and for the Prime Minister in particular \u2013 is unmistakable: Change or leave. Because the status quo risks carrying the party to an historic humbling.\u201d \u201cThe only political comparison that will now be moving through the minds of Liberals is 1993 for the Progressive Conservatives, and that is devastation at a near-extinction-level event.\u201d In that election, the incumbent party was reduced to just two seats, from which it never recovered. As Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland \u2019s former chief of staff, Ms. Church has deep roots in the Liberal Party, but was relatively unknown in the riding. In the tough polling climate earlier this year, the Liberals delayed calling the vote as they searched for someone with better name recognition. Among those courted by the party was the area\u2019s city councillor, Josh Matlow, who three sources said was heavily lobbied by top Liberals. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources because they were not permitted to disclose the internal party strategy. Despite the early nerves, Liberals had become much more confident in a win in the final week of the race; they poured immense resources into the riding, sending a steady stream of federal cabinet ministers, MPs and Parliament Hill staffers to help in the campaign. In a statement Tuesday, the Liberal Party sought to play down what it had expected from the results, despite its own president declaring victory just after midnight. \u201cWe knew this would be a tough race, with by-elections not often favouring the governing party,\u201d said spokesperson Parker Lund. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s lots of hard work ahead of us, and our Liberal team is ready to keep working to reach Canadians with our positive plan to deliver fairness for every generation.\u201d Turnout in the by-election was higher than typical for such races with 44 per cent of voters casting a ballot.

Briton Sarah Packwood and her Canadian husband Brett Clibbery are thought to have abandoned their yacht and perished before washing up on Sable Island near Nova Scotia in Canada on 12 July. The couple were reported missing on 18 June after leaving Nova Scotia in their 13m (42ft) eco-friendly yacht, Theros, a week earlier. They were on the way to the Azores \u2013 3,228 km away \u2013 with the trip planned to take 21 days. In a post on Facebook , Mr Clibbery's son James confirmed the pair had died, saying that the last few days had been \u201cvery hard\u201d. He said the couple would be \"forever missed\", adding: \"There isn't anything that will fill the hole that has been left by their, so far unexplained passing.\" It is unclear how the couple\u2019s dream transatlantic crossing ended in tragedy. An investigation is still under way, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told the BBC on Sunday. One theory investigators are exploring is that the yacht was struck by a passing cargo ship that did not notice the collision, according to Canadian news website Saltwire . \u201cThe sailboat crew were either unable to avoid collision\u201d or they could have been down below with Theros on automatic pilot, an anonymous source told Saltwire. The Canadian coastguard and military aircraft have not spotted wreckage or any sign of the boat, Saltwire reports.

The pair met by chance in London in 2015, when Mr Clibbery, a retired engineer, was preparing to donate a kidney to his sister. They married in Canada on their yacht a year later, before affirming their vows in a traditional handfasting ceremony at Stonehenge in 2017, according to Ms Packwood\u2019s personal blog.

Residents of the towns of Labrador City and Wabush in Newfoundland and Labrador province were ordered to leave their homes, said provincial fire duty officer Jeff Motty. \"We are seeing extreme fire behaviour out there. The fire is moving about 50 meters per minute,\" Motty said. Images shared on social media showed lines of cars waiting to fill up at gas stations as the sky was obscured by enormous clouds of smoke. \"It was quite a shock to see that much smoke,\" Labrador City resident Stacy Hunt told public broadcaster CBC. \"And it's been in pretty much the same place for hours now.\" In this remote region residents must evacuate more than 500 kilometres (310 miles) east via the only road available. Motty said that the intensity of the fire made it impossible to use water bombers. On Saturday morning, Labrador City's mayor, Belinda Adams, again urged residents to evacuate. \"The fire is still active,\" she said in a video posted on social media. Federal authorities said Friday that the weather had been favourable for limiting fires since the start of summer, but that the country was entering the peak wildfire season. Last year, the country recorded the worst fire season in its history. Drier and hotter conditions in many parts of the country caused by climate change have increased the risk of major fires in recent years, according to experts. Canada is currently battling 575 active fires with more than 400 considered out of control. Many fires have broken out in recent days, particularly in the west of the country that has experienced a heat wave.

If the area receives rain it will help to reduce fire activity.\u201d The south fire is nearly double the nearby Chetamon Mountain wildfire of 2022 which was estimated to be around 6,000 hectares in size. \u201cThis wildfire is significantly larger and more aggressive than the wildfires we\u2019ve seen in the past few years,\u201d said Katie Ellsworth, an incident commander with Parks Canada. \u201cThis one has much closer proximity to the community.\u201d Ellsworth said the south wildfire moved four kilometres to the north overnight Tuesday, leaving it two-and-half kilometres from Valley of the Five Lakes, a popular hiking trail. A second fire, called the north wildfire, is significantly smaller at 270 hectares but is burning only five kilometres from the town. Critical infrastructure in the townsite is being protected with sprinkler systems and fire barriers are being set up with bulldozers. Crews are also going through neighbourhoods and removing potentially flammable materials including dried brush and propane tanks. Headline News Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

All of our efforts are focused on controlling further fire spread and protecting our community.\u201d Late afternoon Wednesday, the Government of Alberta asked for assistance from the federal government in dealing with the province\u2019s wildfire situation. \u201cSupports requested include firefighting and wildfire mitigation resources to reduce the risk to homes, businesses, critical infrastructure and communities,\u201d a news release from the province states. The wildfires in Jasper National Park are under Parks Canada jurisdiction. Alberta is providing personnel, helicopters, and air tankers. Evacuation alert issues The wildfires prompted an evacuation alert late Monday night that has led to an estimated 25,000 people, including residents and visitors, to flee the area.

Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said the town regrets the error and has since corrected the issue but couldn\u2019t yet say what led to the mistake. \u201cIn the long run, it may have increased the level of anxiety, (but) it did not negatively impact the evacuation of the town.\u201d He said a glitch around the emergency alert system that meant not everyone in the park got an emergency alert had also since been identified and fixed. \u201cThe evacuation plan that we have developed over a number of years, and \u2026 implemented yesterday, that was effective significantly because of the actions of the evacuees themselves.\u201d \u2018Rain doesn\u2019t count until it\u2019s on the ground\u2019 Ellsworth said high wind is the norm in the area this time of year and was expected to continue much of Wednesday albeit amid temperatures cooling into the mid-20 C range.

Article content \u201cWe expect today that we\u2019re going to have strong winds continuing and we expect that this will increase our fire behaviour and fire growth.\u201d Lightning is believed to be the cause of the fire, made easier by dry conditions in the days before the evacuation order where temperatures reached 37 C and humidity was as low as 11 per cent. \u201cOur temperatures are higher than our relative humidity, this has resulted in a critical dryness,\u201d she said. Rain is forecast for Wednesday evening into Thursday. \u201cWe are very grateful for that,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cWe do anticipate that if we receive the precipitation, we will see a reduction in fire activity.\u201d But, she cautioned, \u201cthe rain doesn\u2019t count until it\u2019s on the ground.\u201d She said backcountry visitors continue to be taken from the park, some via helicopter, as more reach cellphone range and check in with Parks Canada which is cross-referencing with its visitor registration system. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a sense and understanding of who is accessing what trails at what time period and who those individuals are,\u201d she said.

Infrastructure damaged Ellsworth said the fires have led to some infrastructure damage along the Icefields Parkway and Highway 16 although conditions have been too severe to allow closer inspections though it is hoped those will be completed by the end of Wednesday. \u201cOnce we are able to access the areas safely, either from the air or from the ground, we will provide further information on structure loss.\u201d Infrastructure in the area also includes Parks Canada facilities, campgrounds, day-use areas, washrooms, and power lines. Parks Canada would not confirm any rumours or reports of specific structure damage, including to the ski resort at Marmot Basin , again citing the poor air quality and limited visibility. Ireland said a small group of locals from a variety of backgrounds were staying in the townsite to support those fighting the flames with food and shelter while others maintain essential services.

(Fran\u00e7ois Sauv\u00e9\/Radio-Canada) Social Sharing Torrential rains drenched southern Quebec on Friday, breaking the record for rainfall in Montreal. The rain came in the wake of tropical storm Debby and a low pressure system that had formed over the Great Lakes. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada\u00a0figures, the city received 157 millimetres of rain on Friday, surpassing\u00a0the previous all-time daily record for rainfall set back in November 1996. Montreal fire services said it received 614 calls for help over 18\u00a0hours between Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. It used a boat in three rescue operations to help people stuck in their cars on flooded roadways. Nearly 35 municipalities across Quebec were impacted by the rain, a total of 1,539 homes have been isolated, 344 people were\u00a0evacuated from their homes and nearly 100 roads were affected, said Quebec\u00a0Public Security Minister Fran\u00e7ois\u00a0Bonnardel\u00a0on the social media platform X. Several landslides have also been reported in the Laurentians. Highway 40 is closed in both directions between Louiseville and Pointe-du-Lac near Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. The storm has also led to power outages across the province.

In a statement, it said the vast majority of its customers would have their power restored by the end of Saturday evening. Spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty said a lot of the problems were due to the strong winds bringing down branches on lines and flooding in the Crown corporation's\u00a0sub-stations. La Macaza, a municipality about 170 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the Laurentians region, declared a state of emergency on Friday. It has since opened a shelter for victims and an emergency co-ordination\u00a0centre.

Recommendations to help Quebecers cope with the situation Several residents in the province have been trapped by floodwaters, according to Urgence Qu\u00e9bec. The agency encourages people to check their municipality's social media pages and websites for crucial information about disaster relief. A boil water advisory is in effect for several areas including Boucherville, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, the Longueuil borough of Saint-Hubert and part of Vieux-Longueuil. Officials blame an electrical failure which led to technical issues and a drop in pressure. They recommend that residents boil their water for at least one minute before consumption until further notice.

Canada and New Zealand will face each other in the opening match of Group A on Thursday. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) also said it had taken action to remove two staff members from the team\u2019s Olympic squad , who were gold medallists at the Tokyo Games. \u201cJoseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately,\u201d COC said in a statement. \u201cJasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Mr Lombardi reports to, is being removed from the Canadian Olympic Team and will be sent home immediately.\u201d Lombardi, 43,\u00a0was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying the drone over the New Zealand training session on Monday in Saint-Etienne. In a statement, Priestman \u2013 the Canadian team\u2019s head coach \u2013 said she had decided to \u201cvoluntarily withdraw\u201d from the match against New Zealand on Thursday. \u201cOn behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,\u201d Priestman said. The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) reported the incident to the police and to the International Olympic Committee\u2019s integrity unit. The NZOC said it and New Zealand Football \u201care committed to upholding the integrity and fairness of the Olympic Games\u201d. \u201cAt this time the NZOC\u2019s main priority is to support the New Zealand women\u2019s football athletes and wider team as they start their campaign,\u201d it added.

FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women\u2019s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each in a drone spying scandal . The stunning swath of punishments, announced late on Saturday, includes a 200,000-Swiss-franc ($226,000) fine for the Canadian football federation in a case that has spiralled at the Summer Games . Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand\u2019s practices before their opening game on Wednesday. Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national football federation and then removed from the Olympic tournament . She is now banned from all football by FIFA for one year. FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case. The judges found Priestman and her two assistants \u201cwere each found responsible for offensive behaviour and violation of the principles of fair play.\u201d The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules. The coaches and the Canadian federation can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport\u2019s (CAS) special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. The 38-year-old Priestman is from England and was hired in 2020 to coach Canada. She is under contract through the 2027 Women\u2019s World Cup. Priestman had stepped aside from the defending champions\u2019 Olympic opener against New Zealand on Wednesday after the scandal was revealed. Canadian officials suspect the spying has been systemic over the years. Her two staffers were sent home for allegedly using a drone to spy on New Zealand in training. Canada won the game 2-1 with interim coach Andy Spence in charge. The points deduction, if upheld by the CAS judges, does not eliminate Canada from the tournament. It could mean the team must win all three games in Group A and hope to advance with three points, likely as runner-up in the standings. Canada play group leaders France on Sunday in Saint-Etienne, then face Colombia on Thursday in Nice.

By ROB GILLIES Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canada announced Monday it is launching a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles , matching U.S. tariffs imposed over what Western governments say are China\u2019s subsidies that give its industry an unfair advantage. The announcement came after encouragement by U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Cabinet ministers Sunday. Sullivan is making his first visit to Beijing on Tuesday. Trudeau said Canada also will impose a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. \u201cActors like China have chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,\u201d he said. One of the Chinese-made EVs imported into Canada is from Tesla, made at the company\u2019s Shanghai factory, though the U.S. company could avoid the tariff by switching to supplying Canada from factories in the U.S. or Germany. Chinese brands are not yet a player in Canada.

Biden has said Chinese government subsidies for EVs and other consumer goods ensure that Chinese companies don\u2019t have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade. Chinese firms can sell EVs for as little as $12,000 . China\u2019s solar cell plants and steel and aluminum mills have enough capacity to meet much of the world\u2019s demand. Chinese officials argue their production keeps prices low and would aid a transition to the green economy. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it in alignment, in parallel, with other economies around the world that recognize that this is a challenge that we are all facing,\u201d Trudeau said of the new tariffs. \u201cUnless we all want to get to a race to the bottom, we have to stand up.\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada also will launch a 30-day consultation about possible tariffs on Chinese batteries, battery parts, semiconductors, critical minerals, metals and solar panels. \u201cChina has an intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity and oversupply designed to cripple our own industry,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cWe simply will not allow that to happen to our EV sector, which has shown such promise.\u201d The Chinese Embassy said Ottawa disregarded Beijing\u2019s repeated objections and said the move will damage trade and economic cooperation. \u201cThis move is typical trade protectionism and politically-motivated decision, which violates the World\u2002Trade\u2002Organization(WTO) rules and goes against Canada\u2019s traditional image as a global champion for free trade and climate change mitigation,\u201d the embassy said in an emailed statement. \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.\u201d Canada \u201chad to go with the U.S. position, when you think about the economic integration that we have with the U.S. More than 75% of our exports go to the U.S.,\u201d said a former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques.

Social Sharing Former Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who was found guilty last November of four counts of sexual assault\u00a0after being accused of attacking five women in\u00a0his downtown\u00a0Toronto office, has been sentenced to 11\u00a0years in prison. With credit for time served, Nygard, 83,\u00a0will serve just under seven years in prison.\u00a0In his sentencing,\u00a0Toronto Superior Court Justice Robert Goldstein described\u00a0Nygard as a \"sexual predator\" and a \"Canadian success story gone very wrong\" who used\u00a0his wealth and power to commit four\u00a0sexual assaults. Outside the courthouse, Shannon Moroney, a therapist who worked with\u00a0four of the five accusers, read a statement from one of the four victims, who said they finally have closure. \"We did this to ensure every victim of sexual assault will remember this trial and feel the strength and confidence to come forward and not be threatened by social status or money,\"\u00a0Moroney quoted the woman as saying. Nygard\u00a0sat in the courtroom\u00a0wearing a black Canada Goose parka with a hood over his head. His bearded\u00a0face was largely obscured by paper shields that court heard he wears around his glasses because of an eye condition that makes him sensitive to light. Before his sentencing,\u00a0Goldstein\u00a0asked Nygard if he had anything to say. \"No sir,\" he said, quietly.

Crown attorney Neville Golwalla, who wouldn't comment on the length of the sentence imposed on Nygard, said that what jumped out was that\u00a0Goldstein, in his first paragraph of his sentencing statement, referred to Nygard as a sexual predator. \"And that is the story, that was the finding of the jury,\" he said. \"The\u00a0sentence that was passed today is reflecting that reality.\" WATCH | Crown speaks after Peter Nygard given 11-year sentence in Toronto: Crown speaks after Peter Nygard given 11-year sentence in Toronto 8 months ago Duration 0:52 Neville Golwalla, a Crown attorney in Toronto, said Monday that he's not surprised that Peter Nygard will try to appeal after being given an 11-year sentence in a sex assault case. 'We will cross that bridge when we get to it.' Graphic testimony During his six-week trial, court heard graphic and disturbing testimony from all five complainants, four of whom said they were in their 20s when they say they were assaulted. One complainant said she was 16 when she alleged the attack by Nygard occurred. The women testified that from a period of the late 1980s to around 2005, each ended up in Nygard's private bedroom suite in his downtown Toronto building, where they say he attacked, overpowered and sexually assaulted them. Law Society charges Jay Prober over public comments he made about Peter Nygard's alleged victims FIFTH ESTATE Peter Nygard won't be charged in Winnipeg cases involving 8 women, police say Nygard was acquitted of a fifth count of sexual assault as well as a charge of forcible confinement. Goldstein said that while he took Nygard's age and deteriorating health into account in his sentencing, there was a limit to those issues as mitigating factors. Goldstein\u00a0said while Nygard's\u00a0health had obviously deteriorated while he was in custody \u2014 his medical issues include suffering from Type 2 diabetes \u2014\u00a0he could not discount \"some\u00a0exaggeration\" on Nygard's part. He said Nygard, to a significant degree, was the author of his own misfortune and committed these crimes when men felt they were immune from any consequence. Goldstein said if he were to punish\u00a0Nygard less harshly because he is now elderly, it would validate that immunity. He said it would also\u00a0send a message that if you're rich\u00a0and powerful, and your\u00a0victims are vulnerable, you can \"escape culpability if you hold off the day of judgment long enough.\" Nygard,\u00a0wearing a black Canada Goose parka with a hood over his head, sits in a Toronto courtroom during his sentencing by Justice Robert Goldstein. (Alexandra Newbould\/The Canadian Press) Goldstein\u00a0said he also took into account aggravating factors, which included the violence involved in the attacks, as well as the deliberate degradation\u00a0of the victims, and his manipulation of them. Another aggravating\u00a0factor was the fact these assaults took place over years,\u00a0meaning\u00a0\"he didn't\u00a0moderate or change his behaviour,\" Goldstein said. In custody since 2020 Goldstein said some of the letters submitted on Nygard's\u00a0behalf provided limited mitigating value but were from business associates who benefitted financially from Nygard The judge said it was obvious\u00a0Nygard had encouraged the letter writers to observe that they had\u00a0never seen Nygard abuse a woman. Those were \"meaningless observations\", Goldstein said, as most sexual offences take place in private. As well, it's not a mitigating\u00a0factor to point to the \"many women he did not rape,\" Goldstein said.

Prosecutors declined to charge Nygard in that case, though he does still face several sexual assault charges in Manitoba and Quebec. Hickes was there to see him sentenced on Monday. She spoke to As It Happens host Nil K\u00f6ksal about the experience.

He still faces sexual assault charges in Manitoba and Quebec.\u00a0None of the criminal charges against Nygard in Quebec, Manitoba or the U.S. have been tested in court, and he has denied all allegations against him.

Leftist NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh moved to distance himself from an increasingly unpopular Trudeau. \u201cThe deal is done,\u201d Singh said on social media, bringing an abrupt halt to a pact that has kept the government running.

Breaking the deal doesn\u2019t mean Trudeau\u2019s government automatically falls if a vote of non confidence is scheduled. Rather, the NDP will determine how to vote on Liberal legislation on a case-by-case basis, and will attempt to squeeze more measures out of them.

Ukrainian critics have argued the film attempts to whitewash Russia\u2019s crimes in Ukraine and that Trofimova would not have been able to get such unfettered access to Russian troops without support from the Kremlin. 3:39 Ukraine strikes Moscow in biggest drone attack to date Festival organizers said Wednesday it\u2019s their understanding that the documentary was made without the knowledge and participation of any Russian government agencies.

The skeletal remains of a senior officer of Sir John Franklin's 1845 Northwest Passage expedition have been identified by researchers from the University of Waterloo and Lakehead University using DNA and genealogical analyses. In April of 1848 James Fitzjames of HMS Erebus helped lead 105 survivors from their ice-trapped ships in an attempt to escape the Arctic. None would survive. Since the mid-19th century, remains of dozens of them have been found around King William Island, Nunavut. The identification was made possible by a DNA sample from a living descendant, which matched the DNA that was discovered at the archaeological site on King William Island where 451 bones from at least 13 Franklin sailors were found. \u201cWe worked with a good quality sample that allowed us to generate a Y-chromosome profile, and we were lucky enough to obtain a match,\u201d said Stephen Fratpietro of Lakehead\u2019s Paleo-DNA lab. Fitzjames is just the second of those 105 to be positively identified, joining John Gregory, engineer aboard HMS Erebus, whom the team identified in 2021. \u201cThe identification of Fitzjames\u2019 remains provides new insights about the expedition's sad ending,\u201d said Dr. Douglas Stenton, adjunct professor of anthropology at Waterloo. In the 1850s Inuit told searchers they had seen evidence that survivors had resorted to cannibalism, shocking some Europeans. Those accounts were fully corroborated in 1997 by the late Dr. Anne Keenleyside who found cut marks on nearly one-quarter of the human bones at NgLj-2, proving that the bodies of at least four of the men who died there had been subject to cannibalism. A 3D scan of\u00a0James Fitzjames'\u00a0mandible, showing impressions of cut marks consistent with cannibalism. Fitzjames\u2019 mandible is one of the bones exhibiting multiple cut marks, demonstrating that after his death his body was subject to cannibalism. \u201cThis shows that he predeceased at least some of the other sailors who perished, and that neither rank nor status was the governing principle in the final desperate days of the expedition as they strove to save themselves,\u201d said Stenton. 19th century Europeans believed that all cannibalism was morally reprehensible, but the researchers emphasize that we now understand much more about what is known as survival or starvation cannibalism and can empathize with those forced to resort to it. \u201cIt demonstrates the level of desperation that the Franklin sailors must have felt to do something they would have considered abhorrent,\u201d said Dr. Robert Park, Waterloo anthropology professor. \u201cEver since the expedition disappeared into the Arctic 179 years ago there has been widespread interest in its ultimate fate, generating many speculative books and articles and, most recently, a popular television miniseries which turned it into a horror story with cannibalism as one of its themes. Meticulous archaeological research like this shows that the true story is just as interesting, and that there is still more to learn,\u201d said Park. The remains of Fitzjames and the other sailors who perished with him now rest in a memorial cairn at the site with a commemorative plaque.

Descendants of members of the Franklin expedition are encouraged to contact Stenton.\u202f\u201cWe are extremely grateful to this family for sharing their history with us and for providing DNA samples, and welcome opportunities to work with other descendants of members of the Franklin expedition to see if their DNA can be used to identify other individuals.\u201d \u201cIdentification of a Senior Officer from Sir John Franklin's Northwest Passage Expedition\u201d by Stenton, Fratpietro and Park was published in the \u201cJournal of Archaeological Science: Reports.\u201d The research was funded by the Government of Nunavut and the University of Waterloo.

Thomas Sawer, a\u00a0tourist from Germany, was staying in the hostel for just one night when he was jolted awake by the sounds of the building's fire alarms. He said smoke was already circulating in the building as he made his way out. \"I thought, 'This can't be a drill, this has to be real so I went down, but I don't know if I felt safe, honestly,\" he told CBC\u00a0News in an interview. The fire department has sent about 125 firefighters and 50 trucks to the scene.

Property records show that the building on Notre-Dame was constructed\u00a0in 1923. Those records also show that in\u00a02021, Benamor requested a $10,000 permit to build a \"20-room hotel\" there.\u00a0The restaurant and hostel that were operating before the fire have different people listed as their owners.

Martin Guilbault, a division chief with the Montreal fire department, told reporters that fire inspectors had visited the building in the spring of 2023 and had found an absence of fire alarms and smoke detectors, but on a new visit in the spring of 2024, those issues had been fixed. \"The building was compliant, according to our information,\" he said.

His approval rating has plummeted from 63% when he was first elected to 28% in June of this year, according to one poll tracker, amid concerns about housing unaffordability and the rising costs of living. His Liberal party lost two consequential by-elections this summer in Toronto and Montreal. A deal between his party and the NDP has helped him stay in power since Canada\u2019s last federal election in 2021. But the deal collapsed early in September after NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled out from the coalition, saying that the Liberals are \u201ctoo weak\u201d and \u201ctoo selfish\u201d to govern. Trudeau\u2019s leadership has been under threat since, with Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stating that he would put forward a no-confidence vote. The vote would need the approval of the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass. The Liberal Party, which holds 153 seats, voted against it, while the Conservative Party, which holds 119 seats, voted in favour. The bulk of the other seats are held by the NDP and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois - both of whose members voted to defeat the motion. In the end, the motion was defeated by 211 votes against it. Reuters Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has been leading in several national polls Pierre  Polievere, who has been leading in various national polls, had urged fellow MPs to vote in favour of the motion by outlining his vision for Canada under a Conservative government. His plan, he said on Tuesday in parliament, is \u201cto bring home the promise of Canada, of a powerful paycheque that earns affordable food, gas and homes and safe neighbourhoods\u201d. But Singh, the NDP leader, said he would vote against Poilievre\u2019s motion because he believes the Conservative Party will cut social programmes like dental care and pharmacare if it comes to power. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois - a party whose aim is to represent the interests of Quebec, Canada\u2019s French-speaking province - has said it believes it could work with the Liberal government to secure assurances for Quebec-focused social programmes. Trudeau was at the UN General Assembly earlier this week in New York City, where on  Monday he appeared as a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In his interview with Colbert, Trudeau acknowledged that Canadians were going through \u201ca really tough time\u201d and struggling to afford gas, groceries and rent. But he defended his leadership, saying that his government had invested in Canadians and would continue to do so. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting,\u201d he said.

The motion, brought by the opposition Conservatives, was aimed at bringing down his minority Liberal government and triggering a federal election. The motion failed after Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre again fell short in his effort to gain the backing of other political parties in parliament. Poilievre tabled this second non-confidence motion the day after his last one failed. This motion accused the government of failing Canadians on affordable housing, the cost of living, and crime - key issues that the Conservatives have been using to hammer the Liberals for months. The vote needed the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass. After all the votes were counted, 121 voted for the motion while 207 voted against it. In a statement following the vote, Poilievre blamed the NDP and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois for its failure, saying the former had \"sold out working Canadians\" while the latter is \"letting down Quebecers\". The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which represents the interests of Quebec, Canada\u2019s French-speaking province, had issued an ultimatum to the Liberals for its continued support. The sovereigntist party gave the government a 29 October deadline to pass two bills, one increasing pensions for seniors and one to bolster protections on Canada's supply management system, which controls production quotas and imports on dairy and poultry products. On Tuesday, it tabled its own motion calling on the Trudeau government to support their seniors' bill. Meanwhile, the NDP leader Jagmeet Singh indicated last week that his party would not support the Conservative motion. Several other non-confidence motions are expected to be tabled in the coming weeks, including a third that has been put forward by the Conservatives. Trudeau has been Canada\u2019s prime minister for nine years and has been facing growing pressure to resign over concerns he is a drag on his party's fortunes.

Try again 01:58 India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in New Delhi in September 2023, but ties have frayed since. \u00a9 Evan Vucci, AFP file photo India and Canada each expelled the other's ambassador and five other top diplomats, after New Delhi said its envoy had been named among \"persons of interest\" following the killing of a Sikh separatist leader . New Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but Ottawa said it had served them notices of expulsion. \"Subsequent to those notices, India announced it would withdraw its officials,\" a statement from the Canadian foreign ministry said. The 2023 murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar crashed the country's diplomatic relations with India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence services to the crime. The expulsion of the diplomats \u2013 including the most senior envoys on both sides \u2013 is a major escalation in the row. India \"decided to expel\" Ottawa's acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler, his deputy and four first secretaries, ordering they leave before midnight on Sunday. Ottawa announced similar measures in return, with Canadian police saying they had \"evidence pertaining to agents of the government of India's involvement in serious criminal activity\" in Canada. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that India had refused to cooperate in the investigation, or to lift diplomatic immunity for its envoys. \"The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case,\" she said in a statement, referring to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Read more Sikh leader's murder in Canada shines spotlight on shadowy Indian spy agency Nijjar \u2013 who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 \u2013 had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. Four Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar's murder, which took place in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023. New Delhi had earlier said it had \"received a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are persons of interest\" in the ongoing investigation. It said their envoy, Sanjay Kumar Verma, a former ambassador to Japan and Sudan, was a respected career diplomat and that the accusations were \"ludicrous\". New Delhi's foreign ministry said it had told Verma to return home and that it had \"no faith\" in the Canadian government's commitment to ensuring the six expelled diplomats' security. 'Murder' India on Monday called allegations it was connected to the killing \"preposterous\" and a \"strategy of smearing India for political gains\". Last year, the Indian government briefly curbed visas for Canadians and forced Ottawa to withdraw diplomats, and on Monday threatened further action. \"India reserves the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau Government's support for extremism, violence and separatism against India,\" the foreign ministry said. The foreign ministry also summoned Canadian envoy Wheeler, who said that Ottawa had given India the evidence it had demanded. \"Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil,\" Wheeler told reporters after leaving the ministry. \"Now, it is time for India to live up to what it said it would do and look into all those allegations. It is in the interest of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this. Canada stands ready to cooperate with India.\" India then announced his expulsion. Canada is home to around 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan. In November 2023, the US Justice Department also charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on US soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning of that attempt. The row comes as Trudeau is under political pressure at home, after surviving a second no-confidence vote earlier this month.

Relations between Delhi and Ottawa have been strained since Trudeau said Canada had credible evidence linking Indian agents to Nijjar's murder. The row led to a deterioration in ties , with India asking Canada to withdraw dozens of its diplomatic staff and suspending visa services . On Monday, a furious statement from India's foreign ministry said Canada's allegations were influenced by Sikh separatist campaigners. Later in the day, it announced six Canadian diplomats, including acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler, had been asked to leave India by 19 October. Mr Wheeler was also summoned by India's external affairs ministry to explain Canada's move. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Wheeler said Canada had given India the evidence it had demanded, it now needed to investigate the allegations. \"It\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0interests\u00a0of\u00a0both\u00a0our\u00a0countries\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0peoples\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0countries\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0bottom\u00a0of\u00a0this,\" he said. Delhi has defended its High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, referring to his \"distinguished career spanning 36 years\". \"The aspersions cast on him by the government of Canada are ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt,\" it said. The Indian foreign ministry also said it was \"withdrawing\" its top envoy and other diplomats. \"We have no faith in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.\" Earlier on Monday, Canadian police said they had taken the unusual step of publicly disclosing information about ongoing investigation \"due to significant threat to public safety in our country\". RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme told reporters at a news conference on Monday that there had been \"over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life\" which he said \"specifically\" focussed on members of the pro-Khalistan movement. He added that the threats were sufficiently serious to warrant the RCMP's public intervention. \"We reached a point where we felt it was imperative to confront the government of India.\" Officials said a dozen Indian agents were involved in the alleged criminal activities, but did not confirm if they were directly linked to the June 2023 murder of Sikh separatist leader Nijjar . Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot and killed by two masked gunmen outside a Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia . He had been a vocal supporter of the Khalistan movement, which demands a separate Sikh homeland, and publicly campaigned for it. India has in the past described him as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters called unfounded. Canadian police called his killing a \"targeted attack\". In September 2023, Trudeau had told Canada's parliament that allegations of Indian involvement in the killing were based on Canadian intelligence. He called the act a violation of Canada's sovereignty. Frosty ties between the two countries seemed to have thawed slightly after India resumed processing visas in October 2023. But last week, Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly called the country's relations with India \"tense\" and \"very difficult\". She also said there remained a threat of more killings like Nijjar's on Canadian soil.

The death was made public by Dr Malcolm Lock of the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit, who told councillors at a board meeting on Wednesday that the unnamed child was exposed to the virus in an area north of Sudbury. \u201cThey woke up with a bat in their bedroom,\u201d Dr Lock said, adding that the parents did not see signs of a bite or scratches and did not get the child a rabies vaccine as a result. It marks the first domestically-acquired case of human rabies in Ontario since 1967. The child, whose age was not shared by officials, was taken to hospital after the incident in early September and later died. Rabies is a rare but deadly viral disease that can be spread to humans from an infected animal - such as bats, coyotes, foxes or raccoons - most commonly through its saliva. The disease, which can cause severe damage to the brain and the spinal cord, nearly always causes death once symptoms have appeared, according to the World Health Organization. Dr Lock said the percentage of bats with rabies in the southern Ontario region he oversees has increased from less than 10% to 16% in recent years. \u201cIt's extremely important that anyone who has a form of exposure [to bats] seeks medical attention,\u201d he said, adding that treatment and vaccination should be quickly sought, even if bite marks aren\u2019t immediately visible. According to Health Canada, the Canadian government's health department, cases of rabies among humans in the country are rare. Since reporting began in 1924, there have been 28 cases of rabies across six provinces, all of which were fatal. The health agency said that nearly all human cases of rabies in Canada are a result of exposure to bats, or due to exposure to rabies while in another country. In the US, fewer than 10 people die from rabies each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is a \u201cdramatic decline\u201d from the 1960s, the healthy agency said, driven largely by prevention efforts. There were 25 cases of human rabies documented in the US from 2009 to 2018, the CDC said, seven of which were contracted outside of the country. Like Canada, humans in the US are more commonly exposed to rabies through rabid bats, which are found in all US states except Hawaii. In the UK, all rabies since 1902 were a result of an infection that occurred abroad, according to data by the British government. There have been 26 cases reported since 1946, all involving people who got infected outside of the UK. In 2002, a licensed bat handler in Scotland died from an infection with a rabies-like virus that is present in a small number of indigenous bats - though a subsequent study found they pose little threat to people.

Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022. They entered their pleas in British Columbia Supreme Court on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder. In a shocking development, a ferocious fist fight then broke out between Fox and Lopez in the courtroom in New Westminster. According to the Vancouver Sun, they \"punched and clawed at each other\" for a couple of minutes before sheriffs broke up the brawl, forcing them to the ground, applying handcuffs and leading them away. Other sheriffs cleared the public gallery. The case is due to return to court on 31 October for a sentencing hearing. The second-degree murder pleas mean they will automatically receive life sentences  with the only question being how long they have to serve before they can apply for parole, Canadian public broadcaster CBC reports. Malik was shot several times in his car outside his family business in Surrey, British Columbia, on the morning of 14 July 2022. Police found a burnt-out vehicle nearby. The businessman had been acquitted in 2005 of a devastating double bomb attack: On 23 June 1985, Air India flight 182 from Canada to India blew up off the Irish coast, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadian citizens visiting relatives in India About the same time, a second bomb exploded prematurely in Japan, killing two baggage handlers The bombings - widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion - remain Canada's deadliest terror attack. Following a two-year trial, Malik and his co-accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both acquitted of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings. According to the agreed statement of facts on Monday, Fox and Lopez were contracted to kill Malik but the evidence did not establish who had hired them. Police recovered two handguns used in the attack in residences linked to the two men as well as the sum of C$16,485 (US $11,943; \u00a39,148) in cash in Lopez's New Westminster apartment, the Vancouver Sun reports.

In her speech, Holt said her party will focus on education, health care\u00a0and affordable housing. \"We are going to lead with balance,\" she said.

Holt, 47, a mother of three young girls, said she had a message for\u00a0the public and the news media. \"My mama bear's going to come out,\" she said. \"Please treat my children with care because they are sacrificing for New\u00a0Brunswick,\" she said. Given the sagging popularity of the federal Liberal leader, Holt seemed to try to distance herself from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the campaign. Trudeau sent\u00a0her\u00a0congratulations on Monday night. \"We've got work ahead to build more homes, protect our official languages, and improve healthcare for New Brunswickers. I'm looking forward to working with you and your Liberal team to make it happen,\" he wrote on social media. Big gains in big cities The Liberals made huge gains in the three big cities of southern New Brunswick. The largest gain was in Saint John, where votes increased by 27 per cent for the Liberals, followed by Fredericton, which saw an increase of 23 per cent. Moncton saw votes increase\u00a0by 16 per cent. From blue to red,\u00a0Liberals won nearly all Saint John-area ridings. Liberal candidate and former city councillor\u00a0David Hickey won Saint John Harbour, while\u00a0Dr. John Dornan, who won a wrongful dismissal case against the Higgs government,\u00a0won\u00a0Saint John Portland-Simonds. Kate Elman Wilcott took Saint John West-Lancaster, while federal PC-turned-Liberal John Herron\u00a0won\u00a0 against controversial candidate Faytene Grasseschi in Hampton-Fundy-St. Martins.

Conservatives Leader John Rustad, left, and B.C. NDP Leader David Eby. (Darryl Dyck\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing A tight race for political power in British Columbia still had no clear winner early Sunday after the vast majority of votes in the provincial election had been counted, with a weakened incumbent party barely holding off\u00a0its top challenger late into the night. With a little more than 96 per cent of votes counted, the\u00a0B.C. NDP\u00a0and B.C. Conservatives were left\u00a0locked in a near dead heat . The NDP\u00a0were either elected or leading in 46\u00a0ridings, while the Conservatives\u00a0had won or were leading in 45\u00a0\u2014 each just a seat or two shy of the 47 needed to win a majority government. The razor-thin result means the race will come down to the final\u00a0polls, out-of-district votes and mail in ballots. The latter aren't expected to be fully counted until Oct. 26. See a riding-by-riding breakdown of\u00a0the results here The delay in announcing the results came after an unusually antagonistic election campaign characterized by the growing popularity of the right-of-centre Conservatives, which\u00a0had tried to convince a broad base of disillusioned voters to reject the status quo after seven years of NDP rule. Regardless of which party ultimately forms government, the close race will be considered a disappointing result for the once-dominant NDP and a once-unthinkable accomplishment\u00a0for the up-and-coming Conservatives. \"This has been a very, very hard fought campaign and we knew that every vote would matter and that has certainly been the case,\" NDP Leader David\u00a0Eby told supporters just before 11:30 p.m. PT.\u00a0\"And it looks like we're going to have to wait just a little bit longer.\" WATCH | Eby asks supporters for patience after tight race: B.C. NDP Leader David Eby addresses supporters after party loses several seats 6 months ago Duration 8:11 Eby gave a speech for supporters after what was a disappointing night for his party. Addressing his\u00a0own crowd\u00a0minutes earlier, Conservatives Leader John Rustad\u00a0said the election was\u00a0a \"historic night.\" \"This has been a night where we have seen the political landscape in British Columbia change forever ... we have not given up this fight yet. We are going to keep pushing hard.\" A number of ridings are still too close to call with less than a few hundred votes between candidates. Both Eby and Rustad held onto their ridings: Rustad\u00a0was re-elected\u00a0in Nechako Lakes, which he has held since 2005, and Eby won a fourth term in Vancouver\u2013Point Grey. WATCH | Rustad celebrates Conservative gains on close election night: John Rustad hails 'historic night' for B.C. Conservatives 6 months ago Duration 10:21 The winner of the B.C. election remained unclear late Saturday, but B.C. Conservatives Leader John Rustad said it was a great night for his party. In a major blow to her\u00a0party, B.C. Green Party leader Sonia Furstenau lost her seat after leaving her riding of Cowichan Valley to run for the first time in Victoria\u2013Beacon Hill. \"It has been such an honour to be an MLA,\" an emotional Furstenau\u00a0later told supporters gathered in the capital, her voice hoarse after fighting a cold last weekend.\u00a0\"It's not the outcome we hoped for in Victoria\u2013Beacon Hill tonight, but I'm so proud of the campaign that we ran.\" The Greens otherwise led in two ridings.\u00a0With the two top parties each straining to clinch a majority, Furstenau said\u00a0the party could potentially play a \"pivotal role\" in the next government. WATCH | Furstenau thanks supporters, family after election loss: Greens will still play 'pivotal role,' leader Sonia Furstenau says despite losing seat 6 months ago Duration 6:26 B.C. Green Leader Sonia Furstenau addresses supporters after failing to win the Victoria-Beacon Hill riding in the provincial election. B.C. was left with similar uncertainty after the provincial election in 2017, when election night ended with another too-close-to-call race between the NDP and then-B.C. Liberals. Former Liberals leader Christy Clark promised to lead a minority government after the race, but resigned weeks later after losing a confidence vote. The NDP's John Horgan became premier after signing a confidence and supply agreement with the support of the three Green members of the Legislature. Together, the two parties had a total of 44 seats \u2014\u00a0the minimum required at that time for a majority. Remarkable Conservative rise The campaign was largely a story about whether or not the Conservatives could complete a\u00a0stunning political rise to\u00a0topple\u00a0Eby's\u00a0NDP, or whether the incumbent party\u00a0could\u00a0hold onto\u00a0its\u00a0commanding power in the Legislature. At dissolution this fall, the NDP held a powerful majority with 55 seats in the legislature. The B.C. United party served as the Official Opposition with 20 seats, but did not run any candidates in the election after it suspended its campaign to throw its support behind the surging B.C. Conservatives \u2014\u00a0who held just eight seats before the election. B.C. NDP Leader David Eby greets Vancouver-Yaletown NDP candidate Terry Yung, left, after addressing supporters on election night in Vancouver. (Darryl Dyck\/The Canadian Press) The Greens had two seats, and two seats were held by Independents. A record 40 Independents ran in the election this year, but none of them won any of their races. The majority of NDP cabinet ministers retained their seats, including Health Minister Adrian Dix in Vancouver\u2013Renfrew, Jobs Minister Brenda Bailey in Vancouver\u2013South Granville and Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon in Delta North. If Rustad's party takes power, the province will have its first Conservative government in nearly a century. If Eby's party wins, the province will have its third consecutive NDP government. Regardless of the final outcome, Rustad's unlikely rise has been a remarkable story in B.C. politics. Rustad, 61, became party leader\u00a0after he was\u00a0kicked out of the Opposition, then known as the B.C. Liberals, over his views on climate change. In just two years, he\u00a0steered the fledgling Conservatives to a level of popularity that sank\u00a0his old party, which had disastrously rebranded\u00a0as B.C. United. The Conservatives and NDP\u00a0ran\u00a0candidates in each of the province's 93 ridings, while Furstenau's Greens had\u00a069 candidates. Six high-profile incumbent MLAs were among the 40 Independent candidates. B.C. Conservative supporters watch as results roll in on election night in Vancouver on Oct. 19, 2024. (Ethan Cairns\/The Canadian Press) Voting results were available quicker than usual\u00a0because Elections B.C. is using\u00a0a new electronic voting system to count ballots, though the process wasn't seamless: results were delayed in\u00a0Surrey\u2013Cloverdale, one of the province's closest battleground ridings, because of an\u00a0issue with a password needed\u00a0to tabulate votes. More than a million people voted ahead of a rainy election day, marking\u00a0a record number for advance voting in the province.\u00a0Automatic recounts will happen in electoral districts where the\u00a0top two candidates are separated by 100 votes or less, with recounts scheduled for Oct.\u00a026, 27 and\u00a028.

Issued on: 20\/10\/2024 - 20:29 1 min Pope Francis (C) presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world \u00a9 Filippo MONTEFORTE \/ AFP Francis presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world. \"We enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole Church,\" proclaimed Francis, after reciting each name. Canonisation is the final step towards sainthood in the Catholic Church, following beatification. Three conditions are required -- most crucially that the individual has performed at least two miracles. He or she must be deceased for at least five years and have led an exemplary Christian life. Among the group are 11 individuals known as the \"martyrs of Damascus\", who have become saints some 160 years after their death. The eight Franciscan friars and three lay Maronites -- all siblings -- from a monastery were assassinated by Druze militants in July 1860 in the Syrian capital, then under Ottoman rule. They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1926. Many citizens, Christian and otherwise, have left the city since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011. The martyrdom of the Damascus group canonised on Sunday \"is not very different from the situation of many Christians in the Middle East today\", wrote Vatican News, the official news portal of the Vatican. The other three individuals, who died early in the 20th century, founded religious communities. They are Italian missionary Giuseppe Allamano, Italian nun Elena Guerra and the Canadian Marie-Leonie Paradis. In May, Pope Francis announced he would canonise Italian teenager Carlos Acutis. The London-born adolescent spent his life spreading his faith online, earning the moniker \"God's Influencer\", before dying from leukaemia in 2006. The date of that canonisation has not yet been set but it could take place in 2025, the Church's Jubilee year, when more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to descend on Rome. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers said early Friday approximately 55,000 workers are striking, claiming little progress has been made in the bargaining process. The work stoppage will disrupt mail service ahead of the busy holiday season. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice earlier in the week, saying it\u2019s been asking for fair wages, safer working conditions and other improvements over nearly a year of bargaining. \u201cWe still believe we can achieve negotiated collective agreements, but Canada Post must be willing to resolve our new and outstanding issues,\u201d CUPW said in a statement. Canada Post served the union with the lockout notice not long after but had said it didn\u2019t intend to lock workers out. The government corporation released a statement early Friday morning confirming that customers will experience delays. Mail and parcels will not be delivered for the duration of the strike, and some post offices will be closed. Canada Post says shutting down facilities will affect its national network, with processing and delivery of mail possibly needing time to return to normal once the strike is over.

Warren, File) Read More Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Workers at Canada\u2019s national postal service are on strike after failing to reach a negotiated agreement with Canada Post. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers said early Friday approximately 55,000 workers are striking, claiming little progress has been made in the bargaining process. The work stoppage will disrupt mail service ahead of the busy holiday season. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice earlier in the week, saying it\u2019s been asking for fair wages, safer working conditions and other improvements over nearly a year of bargaining. \u201cWe still believe we can achieve negotiated collective agreements, but Canada Post must be willing to resolve our new and outstanding issues,\u201d CUPW said in a statement. Canada Post served the union with the lockout notice not long after but had said it didn\u2019t intend to lock workers out. The government corporation released a statement early Friday morning confirming that customers will experience delays. Mail and parcels will not be delivered for the duration of the strike, and some post offices will be closed. Canada Post says shutting down facilities will affect its national network, with processing and delivery of mail possibly needing time to return to normal once the strike is over.

(Sean Kilpatrick\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing The Bank of Canada has lowered its key interest rate to 3.75 per cent, making a 50-basis-point cut for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. Before Wednesday, the rate stood at 4.25 per cent.\u00a0Economists were expecting the central bank to go with\u00a0a larger than usual cut, compared to the 25-basis-point downgrades made in June, July and September. The last time the bank made a cut this size was on March 27, 2020. It was the third consecutive 50-basis-point cut made that month, after March 4 and 13. As concerns over inflation have subsided\u00a0\u2014 out-of-control price growth,\u00a0the catalyst for the central bank's initial rate-hike campaign, is now back within the\u00a0target range \u2014\u00a0the\u00a0bank has focused on cutting\u00a0to keep inflation stable and\u00a0support economic growth, which has been sluggish under the pressure of high rates. \"We need to stick the landing,\" Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem\u00a0told a news\u00a0conference Wednesday morning. \"With inflation back to two per cent, we want to see growth strengthen. Today's interest rate decision should contribute to a pickup in demand.\" WATCH | Bank of Canada governor says we're back to low inflation: Bank of Canada cuts interest rate to 3.75%, the lowest since the pandemic 6 months ago Duration 3:05 Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem announced a cut of 50 basis points to the key interest rate to 3.75 per cent, marking its lowest point since the pandemic.  Macklem says Canada\u2019s dropping inflation rate prompted the move. Macklem outlined the economic conditions that informed the bank's rate cut decision. He noted that core inflation is within the bank's target. Housing inflation, which has been driving headline inflation up for much of the year, is gradually easing, though prices are still elevated. And global oil prices have fallen. He noted that the economy is seeing an excess of supply of goods and services. Canadians are still cutting back on discretionary spending as inflation and high interest rates have pummelled their purchasing power in the last few years. \"Job layoffs have remained modest but business hiring has been weak, which has particularly affected young people and newcomers to Canada. Simply put, the number of workers has increased faster than the number of jobs,\" he said. Just Asking wants to know: What questions do you have about saving for your future? In this financial climate, you might feel overwhelmed by the idea of retirement. Fill out the details on this form and send us your questions ahead of our show on Oct. 26. Macklem noted that,\u00a0should the economy continue to evolve broadly in line with the bank's forecast, further cuts to the policy rate can be expected.\u00a0But he\u00a0cautioned that the timing and pace of cuts would depend on incoming economic data and its potential impact on the\u00a0bank's inflation outlook. He\u00a0repeated a now-familiar refrain, saying that the Bank of Canada\u00a0will take decisions one meeting at a time. TD Bank, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, RBC\u00a0and National Bank announced that they\u00a0had lowered their prime rates by 50 basis points, from 6.45 per cent to 5.95 per cent, on Wednesday afternoon. WATCH | What the Bank of Canada's chunkier rate\u00a0cut means for you: Bank of Canada cuts key rate to 3.75%: What does that mean for consumers? 6 months ago Duration 7:20 Earl Davis, head of fixed income and money markets at BMO, speaks with CBC business reporter Scott Peterson to break down the latest Bank of Canada news and explain what it might mean in the months ahead. Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert at RateHub.ca , said the lowered rate is immediate good news for variable-rate mortgage holders. She said fixed-rate mortgage holders won't see as much of an impact from the Bank of Canada's decision. Pricing for fixed mortgages is based on the bond market, which is \"quite reactionary to whatever the central banks are doing,\" she explained. Lowered yields might lead to lower fixed rates, \"but in the immediate aftermath of today's announcement, it's not likely that we'll see a plunge in terms of pricing.\" LISTEN What will the Bank of Canada's rate cut mean for you? Canada's inflation rate finally hit the Bank of Canada's target. What does that mean for prices? Why aren't Canadians feeling relief? During the\u00a0news conference, Macklem responded to questions from\u00a0reporters who asked what he would say to Canadians who aren't feeling the impact\u00a0of\u00a0lower inflation and interest rates\u00a0in their everyday lives. \"It has been a long road back from the high inflation we experienced coming out of the pandemic,\"\u00a0said Macklem. \"It's been a long fight, but it's worked\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I think Canadians can breathe a sigh of relief.\" One reporter pushed back, saying that many Canadians aren't feeling relief. \"We're very aware of that,\" Macklem responded. \"You can see it in our own consumer survey. There is a lot of hesitancy. I think the message today is that, with inflation down, Canadians don't have to worry as much about big changes in their cost of living.\" WATCH | BOC official Carolyn Rogers explains why prices are still high as inflation cools: Prices have increased \u2014 and Canadians feel that even as inflation cools, BoC official says 6 months ago Duration 1:28 Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers says recent years saw many prices shift upward, something Canadians will feel even as inflation slows: 'Life's more expensive now than it was two years ago.' Canadians might not be feeling relief from lower inflation because it doesn't mean lower prices. A lower inflation rate indicates that prices are still increasing, but doing so at a slower pace. \"The reality is people are prudent, they're preparing for payment shock, they're saving a lot, they're not spending as much,\" said St\u00e9fane Marion, chief economist with the National Bank. \"Please, let's give them a little bit more breathing room by cutting rates more aggressively. I don't think that's going to generate more inflation.\" Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note to clients that \"it would take a significant turn of events to stand in the way of another cut of that magnitude in December.\" \"That said, as has been its practice of late, the bank has kept its options open by not signalling anything specific about the size of individual rate cuts ahead,\" Shenfeld wrote. Meanwhile, economist Tu Nguyen of RSM Canada said the financial institution is forecasting that the bank will return to a smaller, 25-basis-point cut during its next meeting on Dec. 11 so as not to deviate too far from U.S. rates.

He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison.

A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government. Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest. The prosecution alleged King was a protest leader who was instrumental to the disruption in Ottawa. The prosecution alleged King coordinated the repeated bouts of honking, ordering the protesters to lay on the horn every 30 minutes for 10 minutes at a time, and told people to \u201chold the line\u201d when he was aware that police and the city had asked the truckers to leave.

King\u2019s lawyers argued that he was peacefully protesting and was not one of the demonstration\u2019s leaders. King was found not guilty on three counts of intimidation and one count of obstructing police himself. The truckers\u2019 convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant the honking of horns and music from parties. Trudeau\u2019s government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada. The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.

The bills will prohibit minors from receiving certain types of gender-affirming care and also require that parents opt-in before their children are taught about sex in class. (Darren Calabrese\/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing After a trio of bills affecting transgender people in Alberta passed the final stage of debate in the legislature, a pair of 2SLGBTQ+ advocacy groups have said they're moving ahead with legal action in response, calling the legislation discriminatory. The Education Amendment Act, 2024, the Health Statutes Amendment Act and the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act, first announced by Premier Danielle Smith in a provincewide video address in January, are set to become law. National advocacy group Egale Canada and the Alberta-based Skipping Stone Foundation confirmed Wednesday\u00a0their intent to pursue legal action in response, arguing the legislation violates the constitutional rights of young 2SLGBTQ+ people. Danielle Smith unveils sweeping changes to Alberta's student gender identity, sports and surgery policies Alberta tables bills on transgender youth health care, students' pronouns, opt-in sex education The changes include requiring children under 16 to have parental consent if they want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students who are 16 or 17 won't need permission, but schools will need to let their parents know first. Students would not be able to learn about sex education, gender identity\u00a0and sexual orientation in school unless their parents have opted in to them receiving that instruction. Any third-party instructional material would need approval from Alberta Education before it is used in the classroom. CBC Explains How gender-affirming health care for kids works in Canada If passed, the legislation would also prohibit doctors from treating those under 16 seeking gender-affirming treatment through puberty blockers or hormone therapy. Physicians would be prohibited from performing top and bottom gender surgeries on minors. Bottom surgery is already restricted to patients over the age of 18. All surgeries are currently performed in Quebec. WATCH | Schools would have to inform parents when kids ask to change pronouns: Alberta tables bills to change health care, restrict gender-affirming care, sex-ed 6 months ago Duration 2:42 The Alberta government has tabled a series of bills that would bring big changes to the health-care system, as well as limit who can get some gender-affirming treatments, and make parents opt in for sex education in schools. A third bill, the Fairness and Safety in Sport Act, would limit membership on female competitive sports teams to athletes who were female at birth. The bill will ban transgender athletes from competing in female amateur sports and require school and organizations to report eligibility complaints. Smith has said the government will work with leagues to set up coed or gender-neutral divisions for sports. According to the province, the\u00a0Fairness and Safety in Sport Act\u00a0is anticipated to take\u00a0effect fall 2025, while the\u00a0amendments to the\u00a0Education Act will\u00a0take effect\u00a0on proclamation, which is anticipated\u00a0in September\u00a02025. The Health Statutes Amendment Act is expected to come into effect in the coming months. Constitutionality of new policies questioned Bennett Jensen, Egale Canada's director of legal, said on Wednesday he's deeply disappointed and concerned about the legislation's consequences, and the harm it's already caused for young people since being\u00a0introduced. The policies have already led to increased bullying, as well as more young people feeling anxious, depressed and scared, Jensen said. He added the policies have also\u00a0communicated to young people that there's something wrong with being transgender. \"It's hard to properly describe what it feels like to be talking to kids across the province who tell you that they wouldn't be here if they hadn't had access to [puberty] blockers, or who tell you that they won't be here [if they're] denied access to medical care,\" Jensen said. \"It's hard to capture how high the stakes are in this moment. And I don't think that we have a choice but to try to protect these kids as much as we can.\" Smith said the bills are necessary to protect children and female athletes. On Wednesday, Smith argued it isn't rare to put limitations on the kinds of decisions children can make for themselves. \"We don't allow them to smoke, we don't allow them to do drugs, we don't allow them to drive. So we think that making a permanent decision that will affect one's fertility is an adult decision,\" Smith said. Smith added the government will be prepared to argue in court that parents have the ability to make decisions for themselves, until the kids are old enough to make those decisions themselves. The Saskatchewan government used the notwithstanding clause to guard similar legislation. The clause allows a government to temporarily override certain sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Smith said she doesn't believe she'll need to invoke\u00a0the notwithstanding clause to shield the policies from legal action, and that the legislation will be seen as reasonable and evidence-based.\u00a0But she declined to say if she would use the clause to keep the laws on the books if the court challenges are successful. Jojo Ruba, an organizer for Parents and Kids Together, said he's thrilled about the legislation. He added that challenges to the bill will allow for further conversations on the topic. \"We need to be able to love and show compassion to [transgender kids]. But showing love and compassion doesn't mean we have to agree with everything they decide as what's good for them. And we believe it's parents who know best for these kids,\" Ruba said.

The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years \u2014 whose popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration \u2014 can stay on as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cThe Great State of Canada is stunned as the Finance Minister resigns, or was fired, from her position by Governor Justin Trudeau,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cHer behavior was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!\u201d Trump previously trolled Trudeau by calling Canada a state. And during his first term in his office \u2014 when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico \u2014 Trump said Freeland wasn\u2019t liked. Trudeau swiftly named longtime ally and close friend Dominic LeBlanc, the public safety minister who recently joined him at dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, to replace Freeland. Freeland did not make that trip.

He called it one of his party\u2019s \u201ctoughest days\u201d but he did not say what he planned to do. Trudeau faces calls to resign Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party which Trudeau\u2019s ruling Liberals have relied upon to stay in power, called for him to resign earlier Monday. \u201cHe has to go,\u201d NDP leader Singh said. The main opposition Conservatives have not called for Trudeau\u2019s resignation but demand an election. But a no confidence vote in the government is not imminent with Parliament about to break for the holidays . Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said Trudeau had told her on Friday he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter that the only \u201chonest and viable path\u201d was to leave the Cabinet. \u201cFor the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,\u201d Freeland said. Freeland warns against \u2018costly political gimmicks\u2019 Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and 250 Canadian dollar ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said Canada is dealing with Trump\u2019s threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew \u201ccostly political gimmicks\u201d it can \u201cill afford.\u201d \u201cOur country is facing a grave challenge,\u201d Freeland said in her letter. \u201cThat means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.\u201d A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn\u2019t have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated the trade with the United States. Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, had been set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump\u2019s tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless the neighbors stem the numbers of migrants and drugs. The statement shows a much larger deficit than expected for the fiscal year and more than a billion for border security. Can Trudeau survive? Trudeau has said he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but many party members have said they don\u2019t want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland\u2019s departure was a huge blow. Trudeau met with his lawmakers on Monday evening. Later, most of them brushed past reporters, declining to say what was said in the meeting. Liberal lawmaker Chad Collins said they were \u201cnot united.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s still a number of our members that want a change in leadership. I\u2019m one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the only path forward for us is to choose a new leader.\u201d No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one other major party in Parliament, because they don\u2019t hold an outright majority themselves. If NDP pulls support, an election can be held at any time. Singh said all options are on the table. Trudeau channeled his father\u2019s popularity Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, in 2015, when he reasserted the country\u2019s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But Canadians are now frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues, including immigration increases following the country\u2019s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Justin Trudeau\u2019s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. Freeland also said in her letter that Canadians \u201cknow when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.\u201d Trudeau tries to bring in another Cabinet member Separately, Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney , the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, to join his government. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. LeBlanc\u2019s appointment to finance suggests that won\u2019t happen. Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Freeland\u2019s resignation a political earthquake. \u201cThis is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it,\u201d B\u00e9land said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.\u201d","question":"Who replaced Chrystia Freeland as Canada's finance minister in December 2024?","answer":"Dominic LeBlanc was appointed as the new finance minister after Freeland's resignation.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: As of June 2024, Chrystia Freeland remains Canada's finance minister.

Airport spokesperson Tiffany Chase said an Air Canada Express flight operated by PAL Airlines, arriving from St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, experienced an incident upon landing at approximately 9:30 p.m. Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said the Bombardier Q400 plane experienced a \u201csuspected landing gear issue\u201d after arrival and was unable to reach the terminal. Fitzpatrick said the crew and 73 passengers were off-loaded by bus and nobody on board was injured. Valentine said she is \u201cespecially thankful the pilot was able to get ahold of the situation very fast.\u201d The incident temporarily halted flight activity at the airport. As of Sunday afternoon, Valentine and other passengers were still without the bags they were instructed to leave on the plane. Valentine said she contacted Air Canada, who told her that it could be up to three more days before their bags are returned as the investigation into the incident continues. \u201cA lot of people have things like house keys or wallets they needed and couldn\u2019t get,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all proper procedure, and I\u2019d rather the inconvenience (of missing bags) than if anything bad had happened, of course, but it\u2019s still tough.\u201d","question":"How many passengers were on board the Air Canada Express flight that experienced a rough landing and fire in Halifax in December 2024?","answer":"There were 73 passengers on board.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: 74","correct":false,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer of '74' contradicts the expected answer of '73', which is the ground truth.

Police said a nearby Jewish office building was apparently also targeted Wednesday, though it was unclear if the two attacks were linked. Montreal police received a 911 call shortly before 3 a.m. about a fire at the Congregation Beth Tikvah on the island suburb of Dollard-des-Ormeaux, police spokesperson V\u00e9ronique Dubuc said. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and found an incendiary device at the scene, she said. A window of the synagogue was smashed and a door was damaged. \u201cWitnesses told us that they saw one suspect that was leaving rapidly shortly after the fire started,\u201d she said, adding that the building was damaged by smoke but the overall consequences of the fire were minor. No injuries were reported and there have been no arrests in the case, Dubuc said, adding that police have not yet determined whether the fire was a hate crime. A few hours later, officers at the scene of the fire noticed a similarly smashed window and a damaged glass door at a nearby building belonging to the West Island office of the Federation CJA, a building frequented by the city\u2019s Jewish community.

{"year":"2024","month":"12","event_desc":"Trudeau implements a cabinet reshuffle, appointing eight new ministers and moving four others.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Major reshuffle as Trudeau faces party pressure, Trump taunts Ottawa (AFP) \u2013 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday shook up his cabinet, changing one-third of his team as political turmoil threatens his leadership and tensions erupt with incoming US president Donald Trump. Issued on: 20\/12\/2024 - 18:11 Modified: 20\/12\/2024 - 21:07 4 min Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hopes a reshuffle could improve his political fortunes \u00a9 Dave Chan \/ AFP The reshuffle came at the end of a chaotic week in Ottawa spurred by the surprise resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who clashed with her boss over Trump's threats to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Her exit, after nearly a decade at Trudeau's side, marked the first open dissent against the prime minister from within his cabinet and has emboldened critics. Since then, Trudeau has hunkered down with advisers while contemplating his own political future amid calls for him to step down ahead of elections set for October 2025 but expected much sooner. In Friday's reset, eight new ministers were appointed to replace those in the 35-member cabinet who have signaled they will not seek re-election, and to relieve others of their double or triple duties in government. Four current ministers were given new responsibilities. \"The new ministry will deliver on what matters most to Canadians: making life more affordable and growing the economy,\" Trudeau said in a statement. Behind in the polls The New Democratic Party  leader Jagmeet Singh, seen here in Vancouver in September, will seek to topple the Liberals and force snap elections as soon as possible when MPs return to work in 2025 \u00a9 Don MacKinnon \/ AFP New ministers, after being sworn in, all declared their confidence in Trudeau. \"This is a moment where we need to stand united,\" new Transport Minister Anita Anand told reporters. But part of his caucus has urged Trudeau to resign, worried that voter fatigue with his leadership will hamstring the Liberals in the next election. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of a small leftist party in parliament, declared as the shuffle was underway that he would join with other opposition parties to topple the minority government early next year. \"This government's time is up,\" Singh said. \"We will put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons.\" MPs are scheduled to return to work at the end of January. But it's unclear how soon Singh's New Democrats -- along with Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, which also vowed to try to force snap elections -- could vote out the Liberals. Trudeau swept to power in 2015 and led the Liberals to two more ballot box victories in 2019 and 2021. But he now trails his main rival, Conservative Pierre Poilievre, by 20 points in public opinion polls, and his Liberals lost four by-elections this year. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre tells reporters he wants snap elections now \u00a9 Dave Chan \/ AFP At a press conference, Poilievre demanded an election now. \"This cannot go on. With a US president coming in, threatening tariffs early next year, we cannot have a chaotic clown show running our government into the ground,\" he said. New Official Languages Minister Rachel Bendayan responded to questions about whether or not Trudeau will stay on after Christmas: \"He has a choice that he's reflecting on.\" Trump's taunts Compounding Trudeau's woes is the possibility that Trump in January will slap 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, accusing both of allowing the United States to be flooded with illicit drugs and undocumented migrants. More than 75 percent of Canadian exports go to the United States and nearly two million Canadian jobs depend on trade. In her resignation letter, Freeland warned this could lead to a \"tariff war\" with the United States and urged Ottawa to keep its \"fiscal powder dry\" while rebuking what she said were Trudeau's spendthrift policies. One by one, new ministers are sworn in, including here Elisabeth Briere as minister of national revenue during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa \u00a9 Dave Chan \/ AFP Trudeau last month traveled to Florida to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in a bid to head off a trade war. Trump called the talks over dinner \"very productive.\" But since then the president-elect has also landed humiliating blows on social media, repeatedly calling Trudeau the \"governor\" of Canada and declaring that making the United States's northern neighbor the 51st US state would be a \"great idea.\" Political analysts and officials have said the taunts appeared aimed at putting Trudeau on the back foot in bilateral negotiations. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Six men died in the shooting, which began shortly before 8 p.m., during evening prayers at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Qu\u00e9bec (Islamic cultural centre of Quebec). Nineteen people were also wounded. Police said\u00a0it's too early to know the motive. Witness mistakenly arrested One of the men\u00a0was arrested outside the mosque within minutes of the shooting. He was later released as a witness. He spoke to CBC's\u00a0French-language network, Radio-Canada, under the\u00a0condition of anonymity and said he was outside the mosque, shovelling its steps, when he heard shooting. After the shooting\u00a0stopped, he went inside and called 911. \"I found [a victim] near the door. I didn't know if he was alive or dead,\" he said. \"When I gave him my jacket to keep warm, I saw the image of someone with a firearm, I didn't know it was police. I thought it was a shooter who'd returned.\" He fled the scene but was arrested. He\u00a0wasn't released until Monday. At a police briefing Monday morning, Quebec City police Insp. Denis Turcotte said another man\u00a0called 911 at 8:10 p.m. Sunday\u00a0\u2014 25 minutes after the shooting. That man told them he was\u00a0armed and had been involved in the shooting. \"He seemed to want to co-operate,\" Turcotte said. The man told police\u00a0he was parked near the bridge on\u00a0\u00cele\u00a0d'Orl\u00e9ans, where he was arrested without incident. Who are the victims of the Quebec City mosque attack? Shooting sends shock wave through Muslim community Police Sgt. Christine\u00a0Coulombe said the men who were killed\u00a0ranged\u00a0in age from\u00a035 to 70. Five people are still in hospital. Two will need more surgery, while the other three are stable and may be discharged soon. Another 14\u00a0people have been released, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Thirty-nine people escaped the mosque\u00a0without injuries. An act of terrorism, premier says Quebec Premier Philippe\u00a0Couillard\u00a0called\u00a0the shooting\u00a0an act of terrorism. \"It's a\u00a0murderous act directed at a specific community,\" he said at\u00a0a news conference. \"I think the majority of citizens\u00a0\u2014 not just in Quebec, but elsewhere\u00a0\u2014 would describe it that way.\" Couillard\u00a0also shared a message of solidarity with Quebec's Muslim community. \"We are with you. You are at home. And you are welcome at home,\" he said. Prime Minister Justin\u00a0Trudeau\u00a0described the shooting as a \"terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge.\" \"Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country,\" said\u00a0Trudeau\u00a0in a statement. Late Monday morning, Quebec City Mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume and Couillard held a news conference and invited several leaders from the Muslim community to speak. Many had trouble getting through their prepared remarks, breaking down at the thought of the lives lost and the show of support they say their community has\u00a0received since Sunday night. Attack on the ground floor Police said prayers were underway at the mosque when shots were fired just before 8 p.m. Men were praying on the ground floor of the building, while women and children were upstairs. Quebec City police said they are working with the RCMP and the Quebec provincial police following the shooting at a Quebec City mosque that left six people dead and 19 wounded. (Mathieu Belanger\/Reuters) Quebec City police deployed all available officers, Turcotte said. Some of the wounded were in critical condition. (Mathieu Belanger\/Reuters) By 10:40 p.m., police said the situation was under control. \"The building is secure and the occupants evacuated. The investigation continues,\" tweeted Quebec City police, who\u00a0are working with the\u00a0RCMP\u00a0and provincial police. Police patrolled the perimeter near the mosque after the shooting. (Mathieu Belanger\/Reuters) Suspect a Laval student The suspected shooter, Bissonnette, studied anthropology and political science at Laval University, according to his Facebook page, which was taken down on Monday. Police\u00a0stepped up patrols at the university, as well as at other mosques in Quebec City and elsewhere in Quebec. Police\u00a0erected perimeters and road blocks in other areas of Quebec City\u00a0as part of their investigation. A search was also underway at a home in\u00a0Sainte-Foy. 'A Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois accent' Last night, shortly after the shooting, a witness\u00a0who asked to remain anonymous\u00a0told Radio-Canada\u00a0that two masked individuals entered the mosque. \"It seemed to me that they had a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois accent. They started to fire, and as they shot, they\u00a0yelled, 'Allahu akbar!' The bullets hit people that were praying. People who were praying lost their lives. A bullet passed right over my head. \"There were even kids. There was even a three-year-old who was with his father,\" the witness said. The latest information from provincial police, however, is that there was only one shooter. A few dozen people were inside the Islamic cultural centre of Quebec in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood when the shooting began just after 8 p.m. (Canadian Press) Call\u00a0for solidarity with Muslims Mayor Labeaume\u00a0fought back tears during a news conference early Monday, saying the city is in mourning. \"To the Muslim community, our neighbours, our co-citizens, who count on our support and solidarity, I want to say, 'We love you,'\" he said. People outside the mosque paid their respects. Martin St. Louis holds a sign that reads, 'La paix non la guerre,' which means 'peace, not war.' (Francis Vachon\/Canadian Press) Politicians around the world also denounced the attack . A message on the\u00a0Facebook page of the\u00a0mosque's administration said:\u00a0\"Thank you for the hundreds of compassionate messages coming from everywhere.\" Politicians and community leaders will attend a vigil in Quebec City on Monday evening. Other ceremonies have been planned across the country . According to Quebec City police, the shooting began just before 8 p.m. ET.

We have not been able to locate the video on Facebook, and are working with law enforcement as they investigate,\" said a spokesperson for Facebook. The longer video, which was available for at least four hours Wednesday, was\u00a0removed from the site after CBC reported it to\u00a0Facebook and the RCMP.\u200b Girls arrested in homicide of\u00a0Serena\u00a0McKay, 19, in\u00a0Sagkeeng\u00a0First Nation Manitoba RCMP are investigating whether the video is related to\u00a0McKay's death. \"To me, the video is shocking, that someone can stand there and watch it and not assist,\" said\u00a0Sgt. Paul Manaigre. Two teenage\u00a0girls, aged 16 and 17,\u00a0from Sagkeeng\u00a0have been charged with second-degree murder in McKay's death and are in custody. As minors, neither can be named. All three teenagers attended the same Sagkeeng Anicinabe High School, although McKay lived in the neighbouring community of Powerview-Pine Falls. 'I'm so sorry,' victim says in graphic video The longer video of the assault, which was public briefly on Facebook Wednesday, shows a girl's head being stomped on by a heavy boot. It's unclear how many people are around her, but there are at least two females. A viewer could\u00a0see the victim's\u00a0blood and facial injuries and hear the sound of bones cracking during the assault\u00a0and voices swearing at her. RCMP have taped off the Sagkeeng home in connection with McKay's killing. (CBC) During the assault the victim cries out, \"I'm so sorry.\" No context is available as to what she is sorry for or why she is being attacked. \"If you send anyone after me I will kill you. I will f--king kill you myself,\" a female voice says to the victim. While the recent video has been removed from Facebook, the graphic material can still be shared on the site through Facebook Messenger, according to RCMP. A disturbing trend online Daniel Tobok, chief executive officer of online security company, Cytelligence, said the video is the latest example of a growing, disturbing trend \u2014 Facebook users sharing videos of real assaults and killings of people thousands of times. \"It's really up to us as citizens, as subscribers, members you know, when we see something inappropriate it's our duty to report it,\" said\u00a0Tobok. Recently a Thai man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter on Facebook,\u00a0and last week\u00a0a fatal shooting in Cleveland was visible for two hours on the site. Live streaming crime: How do we police the\u00a0internet? While social media sites currently rely on users to report graphic content, they should design stronger filters to stop this type of content from being uploaded in the future,\u00a0Tobok said. \"I would just urge them to up their game,\" he said.\u00a0\"You will never be able to stop it, but you can minimize it.\" Posting videos of attacks online is not illegal, said RCMP Sgt.\u00a0Manaigre, but people who film attacks and do not come to the aid of the victim can be\u00a0charged with being an\u00a0accessory. Manaigre\u00a0said that because the video is being shared through\u00a0personal messages police are skeptical about whether\u00a0Facebook\u00a0can control or stop the spread of the material. Sagkeeng Chief Derrick Henderson says Serena McKay's death has devastated the community. (CBC) 'We have to continue and move forward' Henderson\u00a0believes the attack and death of\u00a0McKay\u00a0could be linked to economic and social problems in\u00a0Sagkeeng. \"I'm not sure what the circumstances are of what happened, but I know a lot of it can be related to lots of factors like addictions. I know that's an issue in my community,\" he said. The chief said\u00a0the homicide has been devastating to many in the community, but he hopes\u00a0it sparks\u00a0changes in\u00a0Sagkeeng. \u200b\"Even me, as a leader, it's so hard to stomach, but we have to continue and move forward and try to make it a better place for our people.\"\u200b Sagkeeng\u00a0First Nation has most unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women With files from Jillian Coubrough, Karen Pauls, Cameron MacIntosh and Reuters CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices \u00b7 About CBC News Corrections and clarifications \u00b7 Submit a news tip \u00b7 Report error Related Stories Girls arrested in homicide of Serena McKay, 19, in Sagkeeng First Nation Sagkeeng First Nation has most unsolved cases of missing or murdered indigenous women Live streaming crime: How do we police the internet?","question":"What charges were filed against the two teenage girls in connection with Serena McKay's death in 2017?","answer":"The two teenage girls were charged with second-degree murder.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: The two teenage girls were charged with second-degree murder in connection with Serena McKay's death in 2017.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer exactly, confirming that the two teenage girls were charged with second-degree murder in connection with Serena McKay's death in 2017.","judge_model":"deepseek-ai\/DeepSeek-V3","tokens_usage":{"completion_tokens":56,"prompt_tokens":203,"total_tokens":259}}

INTERACTIVE: Riding-by-riding election results map With approximately 99 per cent of votes counted, McNeil\u2019s Liberals were leading or elected in 27 seats, while Jamie Baillie\u2019s Progressive Conservatives were leading or elected in 17 seats and Gary Burrill\u2019s New Democrats were leading or elected in 7 seats. A party needs 26 seats for a majority in the 51-seat legislature. McNeil managed the victory despite a campaign against him by public sector unions and accusations from both Burrill and Baillie that the province\u2019s health care system is in crisis. In his victory speech -- offered before it was clear his majority would hold \u2013 McNeil said he will work with Burrill and Baillie to continue to move the province forward. McNeil said the campaign was about keeping the province \u201csustainable\u201d for future generations. \u201cWe need to build a stronger economy so more of our daughters and sons can live and raise their families here in Nova Scotia,\u201d he said.

Former House Speaker edges out presumptive front-runner Maxime Bernier on final ballot Kathleen Harris \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: May 27, 2017 4:17 PM EDT | Last Updated: May 28, 2017 Maxime Bernier, left, congratulates Andrew Scheer for winning the Conservative leadership. Scheer overtook Bernier on the 13th and final round of balloting Saturday. (David Donnelly\/CBC) Social Sharing Saskatchewan MP Andrew Scheer has been elected the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, picking up enough down-ballot support to overcome strong early numbers by rival Maxime Bernier\u00a0during a\u00a0convention in\u00a0Toronto. Scheer, the youngest MP to serve as House Speaker, promised to unite the party by bringing together the social and fiscal conservative wings to take on the Liberals in the 2019 election. He's now 38. Analysis Is Andrew Scheer the smart choice or the safe choice? Recap: Scheer vows to support free speech after Conservative leadership win The father of five\u00a0edged out Bernier by less than one\u00a0percentage point Saturday. Bernier was considered a strong front-runner throughout the year-long race. Andrew Scheer defeats Maxime Bernier on the 13th and final ballot and will lead the Conservative Party of Canada into the next election. (David Donnelly\/CBC) In his victory speech,\u00a0Scheer promised to keep the party true to its roots, working for average Canadian families and not \"Ottawa insiders.\" He said Canada can't afford four more years of Justin Trudeau and that the fight to return to power in 2019 starts now. \"There is renewed hope for Canada, starting today,\" he said. \"The pain and hardship\u00a0the Trudeau Liberals are causing Canadians is\u00a0just temporary.\" Scheer criticizes 'sunny ways' Scheer thanked his team of volunteers, his family and interim leader Rona Ambrose, and gave a special shoutout to Bernier, calling for a \"big round of applause.\" He also thanked former prime minister Stephen Harper, saying Harper will always stand tall in the Conservative movement after becoming the first leader of the \"united and dynamic\" party. He also paid tribute to his mother Mary, whose recent death forced him to temporarily suspend his campaign. Andrew Scheer\u2019s victory speech to Conservatives 8 years ago Duration 17:10 Andrew Scheer addresses federal Conservatives after winning the leadership race. Scheer called the Liberal carbon pricing plan a \"cash grab,\" and accused the Liberals of being more consumed by photo-ops and selfies\u00a0than creating prosperity for struggling Canadians. \"Sunny ways won't pay the bills,\" he said. Staggered round-by-round results were announced at the Toronto Congress Centre, site of the\u00a0party's leadership convention. One of the surprises of the evening was the strong showing of Brad Trost, a self-described \"proud social conservative\" who\u00a0brought an anti-abortion, anti-same sex marriage message to the campaign. Scheer, who voted against a bill to protect rights for transgender Canadians and M-103, a motion to condemn Islamophobia, was asked during a news conference later Saturday\u00a0if he would allow caucus members to bring forward bills related to abortion. He would say only that he won't be put in a \"binary box\" and would focus on issues Conservatives feel passionate about, like free speech. All Conservatives will be welcomed, including libertarian conservatives, social conservatives, democratic reform conservatives and fiscal conservatives, he said. \"Each and every kind of conservative plays an important role,\" he said. \"The leader's role is to find common ground among all those types of conservatives.\" Liberal MP Adam Vaughan criticized Scheer's pledge to withdraw funding to universities that restrict free speech on campuses, calling it an attack on academic freedom. \"That is the antithesis of this country,\" he said in remarks following Scheer's news conference. Trudeau, who is in Italy for the G7 summit, called Scheer to congratulate him on his victory. The two discussed\u00a0making Parliament work for Canadians and the importance\u00a0of Canada's relationship with the United States. They agreed to meet in person in the coming weeks. Speaking earlier from Amatrice , a tiny town devastated by an earthquake last August,\u00a0Trudeau said \"I want to congratulate Andrew for his success, congratulate everyone who was part of what was a strong, democratic process.\" Before the results for the leadership convention began, there was a short tribute to outgoing interim leader Rona Ambrose. Leading up to the weekend convention, about 132,000 party members mailed in ballots. Thousands more voted in person onsite or at a few polling stations across the country for a total of 141,000 voting members. Peter Mansbridge speaks with Andrew Scheer 8 years ago Duration 7:44 CBC's Peter Mansbridge speaks with newly elected Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. 16 candidates overall There were 16 candidates in the race, but three dropped out, including television reality show celebrity Kevin O'Leary, whose name was left on the ballot due to a late withdrawal. The 13 candidates who remained after O'Leary's withdrawal delivered final speeches Friday night, laying out their vision for the party and the country. Many of them urged unity after a long and at times rancorous\u00a0campaign. Saturday's program included the\u00a0farewell tribute to Ambrose, who served as interim leader after Stephen Harper stepped down following the last election. In a video tribute, former fellow cabinet minister Jason Kenney called Ambrose\u00a0the \"first lady of Canadian conservatism.\" Ambrose bids goodbye Ambrose thanked the crowd and caucus for their support, and said the new leader will inherit a proud legacy and an energized party. Instead of wallowing after the last electoral defeat, she said,\u00a0Conservatives picked up, recharged and prepared to fight. \"We hit the ground running and we became the best opposition to Liberal arrogance this country has ever seen,\" she said. Outgoing interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, left, and partner J.P. Veitch watch a video tribute to her at the federal Conservative leadership convention in Toronto Saturday. (Frank Gunn\/Canadian Press) She said no matter what differences of view are expressed during the heat of the campaign, the party is ready to fight in 2019. \"We are strong, focused and united, and we know Justin Trudeau can be beaten.\" Michelle Warkentin and Mike Vecchio, both\u00a0spouses of MPs, also praised Ambrose's\u00a0partner, J.P. Veitch, for his support during the last\u00a0569 days, calling him one of the party's \"unsung heroes.\" Andrew Scheer wins Conservative leadership race 8 years ago Duration 1:25 Conservatives have elected Andrew Scheer to head the party into the next federal election. Vecchio joked that Veitch may have had a better attendance record in the House of Commons than Trudeau, and they presented him with a cardboard cut-out, a reference to the much-mocked cut-outs of Trudeau that were installed in Canadian embassies abroad. Veitch\u00a0called it an \"honour and an amazing privilege\" to have been by Ambrose's side. \"I can't wait for our next chapter.\" CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices \u00b7 About CBC News Corrections and clarifications \u00b7 Submit a news tip \u00b7 Report error Related Stories Who is Andrew Scheer?

At left, Alexandra Constantinidis is seen in one of the many videos posted on the Twitter account. She agreed to have this screenshot of the video published as part of this story. (Left: Screenshot, Right: Mark Matulis\/CBC) Social Sharing A 42-year-old Calgary man has been arrested in connection with the now suspended \"CanadaCreep\" Twitter account, which over the past year posted secretly recorded images of women's bodies. Police say they've seized hundreds of thousands of\u00a0images that date back as far as 2012\u00a0from the man's\u00a0devices. \"This is definitely an extreme case \u2026 and quite disturbing and concerning,\" said Staff Sgt. Cory Dayley with the Calgary Police Service (CPS) cyber-forensics unit. Jeffrey Williamson\u00a0is charged\u00a0with\u00a0voyeurism and distributing voyeuristic material in relation to three separate incidents. Hundreds of Calgary women secretly photographed, posted to 'CanadaCreep' Twitter account At a\u00a0hearing held Wednesday evening, a publication ban was placed on naming the three\u00a0victims. Dayley\u00a0said police expect to lay further charges, as well, as they speak with more victims and could later\u00a0lay \"global\" charges in relation to\u00a0other images in which no victims are identified. Going through all of the evidence could take weeks,\u00a0if not months. \"The investigation is definitely in its infancy, now that we have the magnitude of evidence and exhibits in our possession,\" Dayley said. 'Multiple electronic devices seized' Dayley said \"multiple electronic devices were seized\" when the man was taken into custody at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday\u00a0on his way back to his home in the southeast community of\u00a0Prestwick\/McKenzie Towne. \"A search warrant was executed on a residence in the community of Prestwick that resulted in an additional seizure of computers, storage devices and other electronics,\" he said. Police said they seized \"multiple terabytes of data\" from the devices. A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes. All told, Dayley said there are hundreds of thousands of images to go through, the bulk of which were not posted to the \"CanadaCreep\" Twitter account. As CBC News reported Tuesday , the\u00a0account had amassed 17,000 followers over the span of a year\u00a0before being shut down by the social media service that day. 'Objectification of women' Hundreds of posts on the account included surreptitiously recorded photos and video of Calgary women's clothed breasts, buttocks and genital areas \u2014 including videos filmed up women's skirts while they walked. It's those videos that led to the voyeurism charges, but Dayley said the hundreds of other images on the account were also \"extremely disturbing,\" even if they don't cross the threshold required to lay criminal charges. \"It's still objectification of women ... which is wrong,\" he said. \"We don't agree with it here at CPS. It's disturbing social behaviour.\" Many of the\u00a0images were captured on the streets of downtown Calgary, others in and around Prince's Island Park. Some were clearly recorded at a C-Train station or in the city's Plus-15 network of elevated walkways. 'I was pretty mad that this was happening to me' Alexandra Constantinidis, 22, learned on Monday evening\u00a0she was among the women whose images were posted to the Twitter account. She told CBC News that numerous friends alerted her to a\u00a0nearly minute-long video that appeared to be of her walking in downtown Calgary, filmed from behind and focused on her backside. When she watched it for herself, she recognized it as being recorded on Friday, as she was going to get lunch. She then looked through the previous \"CanadaCreep\" posts, which date back to June 2016, and said she was shocked the account had been so active for so long. \"I was pretty mad that this was happening to me and also to a bunch of younger girls,\" she said. \"It's a little violating having somebody film you when walking down the street.\" 'Upskirt' victim speaks out Another Calgary woman, who CBC News has agreed not to identify, said Tuesday that she felt \"extremely violated\" and unsafe when she learned on Monday night that she was among the \"upskirt\" victims on the Twitter account. She said friends alerted her to a series of videos in which the camera operator follows her from behind over a period of several minutes before finally moving in close. \"Eventually he takes the camera and puts it under my skirt from behind. It's crazy,\" the 25-year-old said. \"You can see my underwear and my butt.\" She said the account included so many videos that were apparently recorded over a period of a months, mostly in Calgary's downtown area, it made her worry for her safety and that of her friends and co-workers. \"I feel it's just so degrading.

We are in this together and together we are stronger than any form of hate.\" Edmonton Mayor\u00a0Don\u00a0Iveson\u00a0called for vigilance and urged the community to remain calm. \"To the best of our knowledge this was a lone wolf attack,\"\u00a0Iveson\u00a0told a news conference\u00a0Sunday. \"Terrorism is about creating panic and sowing divide and disputing people's lives, so we can succumb to that or we can rise above it.\" Edmonton suspected terror attack likely a 'lone wolf' incident, says Mayor Don\u00a0Iveson Members of Edmonton's Muslim community are strongly condemning the attacks and calling for solidarity within the community. Edmonton human rights activist\u00a0Ahmed\u00a0Abdikadir\u00a0said he felt \"anger and frustration\" at news the violence\u00a0may have been the work of a terrorist. He fears the attack may result in a\u00a0backlash against the city's minority communities. \"To the Edmonton community at large, I would like to tell them that we stand together and unite against hate. And let's solve this problem collectively, rather than pointing fingers at each other. \"Pointing at one community or the other will not be the solution.\" Police believe the suspect acted alone,\u00a0Knecht\u00a0said early Sunday, adding that police are nonetheless investigating\u00a0the possible involvement of others. The first attack happened at about 8:15 p.m. Saturday near Commonwealth Stadium, where an\u00a0officer was working traffic control\u00a0for a CFL game. Knecht said the officer was standing behind a barricade when a Chevrolet Malibu crashed into it, hit the officer and sent him flying\u00a04.5 metres\u00a0into the air. 'Was he under surveillance?': Questions surround Edmonton 'acts of terrorism,' security expert says \"A male believed to be 30 years old then jumped out of his vehicle and viciously attacked the Edmonton Police Service member with a knife,\" Knecht said. \"A struggle then ensued, during which the male suspect stabbed the officer several times before fleeing the scene on foot, northbound down 92nd Street.\" The officer was taken to hospital, but his injuries are not critical. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Police release video of suspect car ramming police officer 8 years ago Duration 1:06 Police say the officer was standing behind a barricade when a Chevrolet Malibu crashed into it, hit the officer and sent him flying 4.5 metres into the air, then the suspect jumped out to stab the officer. At around 10 p.m., police told a news conference that a manhunt was underway, but there was no threat to the public. Just before midnight, a white U-Haul van was pulled over at a checkstop on the north side of town. When a police officer checked the driver's name, he recognized it as being similar to the name of the registered owner of the car that had struck the officer at Commonwealth Stadium. 'The police cars just kept coming' The U-Haul immediately sped off toward downtown Edmonton, where streets were filled with Saturday night bar crowds and football fans. As bystanders watched, the van barrelled down Jasper Avenue with up to 20 police vehicles following. \"The police cars just kept coming. They just kept coming,\" said Jaylene Ellard, who was out with a friend on the crisp fall evening. Another witness\u00a0said the vehicles were driving\u00a0up to 80 km\/h\u00a0in the 50 km\/h zone. \"That high-speed chase should have never, ever in a million years have happened downtown,\" said Brian McNeill, who was\u00a0in a parking lot with a group of friends when the vehicles sped past. One witness said police cars began to block streets that connect to Jasper Avenue. The U-Haul eventually doubled back and drove the opposite way down Jasper Avenue. Near 107th Street the van struck at least two pedestrians. \"Throughout the chase, the U-Haul truck deliberately attempted to hit pedestrians in crosswalks and alleys in two areas along Jasper Avenue,\" Knecht said. The van continued until it\u00a0flipped and landed on its side. Pat Hannigan\u00a0was\u00a0about a\u00a0quarter-block away when he\u00a0heard\u00a0a loud bang. \"I saw the van on its side, it flipped over, U-Haul van,\" he said. \"And they had a guy handcuffed on the ground and obviously they smashed out the window. They had a pipe or something in their hand.\" Knecht said officers did not stop the chase along the busy downtown street \"due to the seriousness of the offence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or the believed offence.\" 'We are urging Edmontonians to be vigilant' 8 years ago Duration 3:11 Edmonton police are investigating two suspected terror attacks that left a police officer stabbed and four people run over by a U-Haul truck. Video released by police Police have since released surveillance footage of the suspect. The grainy video shows a car ramming into pedestrians, including a uniformed officer, at a police crowd control\u00a0barricade near the stadium\u00a0where the Edmonton Eskimos football game was being played. The footage shows the\u00a0officer being thrown\u00a0about five metres into the air as the car slams into the front of a parked police cruiser. Two people are shown walking toward\u00a0the officer on the ground, but they run off when the driver gets out of the car and appears to start\u00a0repeatedly stabbing the officer. The police officer appears to wrestle with the driver on the ground. After a struggle, both the suspect and officer get to their feet before the driver runs\u00a0across the street, with\u00a0the injured officer following. Reaction from Trudeau Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement of support on Sunday. \"The Government of Canada and Canadians stand with the people of Edmonton after the terrorist attack on Saturday,\" he said. \"I am deeply concerned and outraged by this tragedy. \"Our thoughts are with those injured, their family and friends, and all those affected by this senseless act of violence.\u00a0While the investigation continues, early reports indicate that this is another example of the hate that we must remain ever vigilant against. The RCMP and the Edmonton\u00a0Police\u00a0Service, through the Integrated National Enforcement Team, are working closely together to bring those involved to justice. \"We cannot \u2013 and will not \u2013 let violent extremism take root in our communities. We know that Canada's strength comes from our diversity, and we will not be cowed by those who seek to divide us or promote fear.\" During a news conference on Sunday, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale\u00a0said\u00a0the National Terrorism Threat Level for Canada \"remains at 'medium,' where it has stood since the fall of 2014. Goodale\u00a0said \u00a0the suspect was on a \"police watch list,\" but declined to provide further details on the investigation or the suspect's criminal background. Police are scheduled to hold another news conference at 3 p.m. Sunday. Edmonton police are working with the RCMP's Integration National Security Enforcement Teams on the investigation. Witnesses say Uhaul swerved down Jasper with at least 15 police cars in pursuit, turned down 107 Street.

Elizabeth Wettlaufer, 49, pleaded guilty earlier this month to killing five women and three men in two nursing homes between 2007 and 2014. Wettlaufer was described by the judge on Monday as a \"shadow of death\" that passed over her victims, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported. She was told she may never be released. \"I caused tremendous pain and suffering and death,\" Wettlaufer said after receiving her sentence, adding: \"Sorry is much too small a word. I am extremely sorry.\" Ontario Superior Court Justice Bruce Thomas said Wettlaufer was a \"predator\" who took the lives of those she was supposed to protect and care for during her time as a nurse, CBC reports. Many of the victims' relatives were present in the courthouse for Wettlaufer's sentencing and were told by the judge to take their time when reading their victim impact statements. Friends of some of the victims also gathered outside the courthouse in Woodstock, Ontario, on Monday to express their hurt and anger. \"I think she should spend the rest of her life in a small box contemplating what she's done,\" said Laura Jackson, a friend of Maurice Granat, one of the victims. Arpad Horvath, whose father was also killed by Wettlauffer while in her care, said the former nurse's statement in court only made him angry. \"An apology like that is just a waste of time, paper and air,\" he said. Police launched an investigation into the nursing home deaths in September. Wettlaufer resigned from the College of Nurses of Ontario a day after that, and was arrested in October. In January, police brought six additional charges - four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault - against Wettlaufer for other incidents that took place in care homes between 2007-16. \u200b The victims James Silcox, 84 (died 2007) Maurice Granat, 84 (died 2007) Gladys Millard, 87 (died 2011) Helen Matheson, 95 (died 2011) Mary Zurawinski, 96 (died 2011) Helen Young, 90 (died 2013) Maureen Pickering, 79 (died 2014) Arpad Horvath, 75 (died 2014) Canadian nurse charged with eight murders What we know about accused Canadian nurse","question":"What crimes did Canadian nurse Elizabeth Wettlaufer plead guilty to in June 2017?","answer":"Elizabeth Wettlaufer pleaded guilty to killing eight elderly patients in Ontario care homes between 2007 and 2014.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: Elizabeth Wettlaufer pleaded guilty in June 2017 to eight counts of first-degree murder, four counts of attempted murder, and two counts of aggravated assault.

The first Canada Games were held in Qu\u00e9bec City in 1967 and were an outstanding success. They paved the way for\u00a0what is now Canada\u2019s largest multi-sport competition for young athletes. As the best in their age group, amateur competitors from all over Canada come to the Canada Games from the 13 provinces and territories across the nation and compete for the Canada Games Flag and Centennial Cup. These athletes are our country\u2019s next generation of national, international and Olympic champions. Some of the best sports stars to ever come out of Canada\u00a0gave us their first glimpses of success at the Canada Games, including: Susan Auch , Team MB - Speed Skating: 1983 Canada Winter Games in Saguenay\/Lac-St-Jean, Qu\u00e9bec, Cycling: 1985 Canada Summer Games in Saint John, New Brunswick Sidney Crosby , Team NS - Men's Hockey: 2003 Canada Winter Games in Bathurst-Campbellton, New Brunswick Cindy Klassen , Team MB - Speed Skating: 1995 Canada Winter Games in Grande Prairie, Alberta; 1999 Canada Winter Games in Corner Brook, Newfoundland; Cycling: 2001 Canada Summer Games in London Ontario Catriona Le May Doan , Team Sask - Speed Skating and Athletics: 1983 Canada Winter Games in Saguenay\/Lac-St-Jean, Quebec; 1987 Canada Winter Games in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia Steve Nash , Team BC - Men\u2019s Basketball: 1993 Canada Summer Games in Kamloops, British Columbia Sami-Jo Small , Team MB - Women\u2019s Hockey: 1991 Canada Winter Games in Prince Edward Island; Athletics: 1993 Canada Summer Games in Kamloops, British Columbia, 1997 Canada Summer Games in Brandon, Manitoba Bruny Surin , Team QC - Athletics: 1985 Canada Summer Games in Saint John, New Brunswick Adam van Koeverden , Team ON - Canoe-Kayak: 1997 Canada Summer Games in Brandon, Manitoba The Canada Games \u2014 a celebration of youth, sport, culture and community \u2014 are the product of an ongoing collaboration between the Government of Canada, provincial\/territorial governments, host municipalities, strong private sector partnerships and the Canada Games Council.","question":"How many athletes and coaches participated in the 2017 Canada Summer Games?","answer":"Over 4,000 athletes and coaches participated in the 2017 Canada Summer Games.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: Approximately 4,000 athletes and coaches participated in the 2017 Canada Summer Games.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer of 'Approximately 4,000 athletes and coaches' is very close to the expected answer of 'Over 4,000 athletes and coaches'.

It was not long ago there were rumours Wall would leave to become the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, but that never happened . Briefly, there were rumours he would be named the new CFL commissioner, which also never happened. Wall himself has said previously he would enjoy being an ambassador, but given his relationship with the current federal government many see that as unlikely.

He is 51 and could find work elsewhere if he chooses. Many expect he will be named to a board or to a senior position in the private sector, but it is realistic Wall disappears altogether into a private life after he exits politics. Wall said he and his wife had been talking about the end of his political life for some time and arrived at the decision to step away in late June.

Article content \u201cThis was such a difficult decision to make,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hard to lay this duty down, to retire from what has been and what will always be the honour of my working life.\u201d MLAs were told of the premier\u2019s plans during a caucus retreat on Wednesday. Wall said while the decision was difficult, he believes a new face will be good for the party . \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the positive power of change,\u201d he told reporters Thursday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be additional perspectives \u2026 I think that\u2019s healthy.\u201d He will carry on as premier until a new leader is chosen, which could happen as early as January when the party votes in a one-member, one-vote election. Wall became Saskatchewan\u2019s 14th premier when he was elected on Nov. 21, 2007 and he became the leader of the Sask. Party in 2004. In the 2011 provincial election, the Sask. Party won the third-largest majority government in the province\u2019s history. He is the first premier \u2014 perhaps in Canada \u2014 to announce a retirement on Facebook. In the live video, Wall pointed to the party\u2019s\u00a0economic record in the province, noting an increase in population and the number of people working. He also spoke about the reduction in surgical wait times and income tax reductions as highlights.

Article content Later, he told reporters increasing Saskatchewan\u2019s exports as a result of trade missions was one of his proudest accomplishments. \u201cI\u2019m proud we were able to tell Saskatchewan\u2019s story around the world the way it hadn\u2019t been,\u201d he said. He also said he and the party have made mistakes in his time as leader, and when asked to elaborate pointed to the cut to funding of regional libraries made in the 2017-18 budget that was eventually restored. He also said while some work has been done on improving graduation and unemployment rates among Indigenous people, there is more to do. \u201c(There was) not enough progress that I could point to with enough satisfaction,\u201d he said. Over the past few months, speculation\u00a0has been brewing that Wall would step down\u00a0from his role as leader of the Sask. Party. Polls have frequently shown Wall to be Canada\u2019s most popular premier. However, that popularity did take a dip after the government announced its 2017-18 budget in March. In 2016, Wall led the Sask. Party to another landslide victory, with the party winning 62 per cent of the popular vote. dfraser@postmedia.com Twitter.com\/dcfraser Article content Share this article in your social network Share this Story : Premier Brad Wall has announced he is stepping down and retiring from politics Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Comments You must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.

{"year":"2017","month":"12","event_desc":"Late December    A cold wave brings record low temperatures to much of the country.","text":"Anderson, Senators shut out Canadiens in NHL100 Classic Ottawa native Pageau scores in frigid conditions before 33,959 \u00a9 Dave Sandford\/Getty Images By Dan Rosen @drosennhl NHL.com Senior Writer December 17, 2017 Link copied OTTAWA -- The frigid conditions couldn't cool off the suddenly surging Ottawa Senators. Craig Anderson made 28 saves; Jean-Gabriel Pageau , Bobby Ryan and Nate Thompson scored; and Erik Karlsson had eight blocked shots to help the Senators defeat the Montreal Canadiens 3-0 in the 2017 Scotiabank NHL100 Classic at Lansdowne Park on Saturday in front of a sellout crowd of 33,959. The temperature at puck drop was 12.5 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the second coldest NHL outdoor game behind the 2003 Heritage Classic in Edmonton, where it was zero degrees Fahrenheit at puck drop. WATCH: [All Canadiens vs. Senators highlights | RELATED: Complete NHL100 Classic Coverage ] \"It was cold,\" Ryan said. \"Every period it got colder, but it was worth every second. We had a blast.\" The Senators (11-13-7), who also beat the New York Rangers on Wednesday, have won two games in a row for the first time since beating the Colorado Avalanche twice in the 2017 SAP NHL Global Series in Stockholm on Nov. 10 and 11. Ottawa is 3-10-2 since returning from Stockholm. \"Hopefully it's going to give us some confidence,\" Senators center Derick Brassard said. \"We know we can put on a winning streak.\" Carey Price made 35 saves in his 10th consecutive start for Montreal since returning from a lower-body injury. The Canadiens (14-15-4) have lost four of their past five games (1-3-1). They were outshot 38-28 and won 29 percent of the face-offs (19-of-65). \"We need more,\" Montreal coach Claude Julien said. \"We need to create more and we need to create more from the inside. Some nights we have that and tonight we didn't. Until we figure that out and become more consistent, that's what you are going to see.\" Pageau, who grew up across the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Quebec, scored at 14:55 of the second period. Seconds after Senators forward Tom Pyatt got the puck back after a lost in-zone face-off, Pageau found space in the high slot and deflected Karlsson's low wrist shot from the right point past Price for his fourth goal of the season. His goal would eventually become the game-winner. \"To score that goal was pretty special,\" Pageau said. \"When your goalie doesn't give up one it makes it easier.\" Karlsson's assist added to his record-setting night. His ice time (32:55) and eight blocked shots are NHL regular-season outdoor game records. \"It was greater than we could have hoped for,\" Karlsson said. \"The atmosphere was amazing.\" The Canadiens never found a way to use the energy in Lansdowne Park to their advantage. Not only did Ottawa have a 1-0 lead, it had a 29-16 advantage in shots on goal after two periods. A turnover by Montreal center Jonathan Drouin in the defensive zone led to Ryan's breakaway goal at 17:02, giving Ottawa a 2-0 lead. Thompson scored into an empty net with 11 seconds remaining. \"A couple times we tried to make plays when they weren't there, and a couple times we tried to put it deep and forecheck when we could have made plays,\" Montreal forward Max Pacioretty said. \"It just seems like we're always on the wrong end of those decisions right now. It doesn't allow for any sustained pressure.\" Limiting Montreal's pressure was the Senators focus. \"We made it our game plan to not necessarily get in there and be physical, but be in front of them and make them uncomfortable,\" Ryan said. \"It paid off over the course of the game.\" That's two games in a row that style has paid off for the Senators. It's the same style that helped them get to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final last season. \"The old-fashioned way, the fashion that we're accustomed to, tight defense leads to offense,\" Ryan said. \"Sometimes people tend to think it's opportunistic hockey, but it worked for us last year. We identified it again this week that we have to get back to it, and it worked tonight.\" Goal of the game Pageau's goal at 14:55 of the second period. Save of the game Price's save on Matt Duchene at 17:17 of the second period. Highlight of the game Ryan's goal off a takeaway and a breakaway at 17:02 of the third period. They said it \"When the home team gets two points and the city can rally around for a great event makes it all the better. It was well done by the NHL, the city, and something that I'll look back on forever, absolutely.\" -- Senators forward Bobby Ryan \"Before the game a couple guys went outside and it was like there's no way people are going to be standing for three or three and a half hours, but they did. It shows a lot of passion. They really enjoyed it. For us players, we really appreciate that.\" -- Senators forward Derick Brassard \"Half a period in a game of sustaining pressure and creating offense, you're just never going to score enough goals to win.\" -- Canadiens forward Max Pacioretty Need to know Pageau has eight goals in 18 regular-season games against the Canadiens. He also had a hat trick against Montreal in the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This was the fourth shutout in 23 NHL outdoor regular-season games.

'The unanimity' Falcon said he was inspired by the cohesiveness of the party in his first caucus meeting. \"One of the things that makes me so happy today is is the unanimity that was shown as we had our first caucus meeting,\" he said. Falcon said Shirley Bond would continue as the\u00a0Official Opposition leader in the legislature so he can\u00a0focus on travelling the province to meet with voters and rebuild the party.

His former portfolios included transportation, health, finance and deputy premier. Falcon said he would rebuild the party by highlighting the successes of the former Liberal governments. \"Bring it on,\" he said. \"I will put up our record in government up against the NDP any day of the week ...\u00a0 They can talk about baggage, but I can tell you I'm quite happy to talk about our record.\" Former cabinet minister Kevin Falcon wins B.C.

He\u00a0said he left politics to spend more time with his young family. He has been working in the private sector with a Vancouver investment and property development firm. The leadership race was defined by the party's need to rebuild, become more diverse and find a way to win more seats in urban ridings. Falcon said\u00a0he will be a strong advocate for a free-enterprise\u00a0economy, but he also wants to ensure diversity and tolerance for people of all races, genders, faiths and backgrounds are hallmarks\u00a0of a renewed B.C.

Liberal leader Kevin Falcon takes questions from media at a press conference in Victoria on Monday, the day of his first caucus meeting as leader. (CBC News) Social Sharing Two days after assuming the helm of the B.C. Liberal Party, Kevin Falcon says former leader Andrew Wilkinson will give up his seat in Vancouver-Quilchena, so Falcon can\u00a0run there in a byelection. \"I'm excited about that opportunity,\" said the 59-year-old Monday in\u00a0a virtual news conference from Victoria. On Saturday, Falcon won 52 per cent of the vote to become the the third leader of the party since 2017. The Liberals have\u00a0lost two consecutive elections after holding power for 16 years. Kevin Falcon heads to Victoria pledging to rebuild B.C. Liberal Party Under Wilkinson, the B.C. Liberals were reduced to 28 seats. Falcon\u00a0said it would be up to Premier John Horgan to decide when the byelection\u00a0would be held. The NDP government has six months to announce a date. Newly elected B.C. Liberal leader Kevin Falcon waves from the stage with party members, MLAs and other leadership candidates on Feb. 5, 2022. (Meera Bains\/CBC News) Also on Monday, Falcon appointed rivals from the leadership race to key critic positions. Skeena MLA Ellis Ross, who came\u00a0second to Falcon,\u00a0was appointed as energy critic. \"I can't think of anybody in our caucus that has more respect,\" said\u00a0Falcon. He named Vancouver-Langara MLA Michael Lee critic for Indigenous relations and Kelowna-Mission MLA\u00a0Renee Merrifield, the only female leadership candidate, critic for environment and climate change. 'The unanimity' Falcon said he was inspired by the cohesiveness of the party in his first caucus meeting. \"One of the things that makes me so happy today is is the unanimity that was shown as we had our first caucus meeting,\" he said. Falcon said Shirley Bond would continue as the\u00a0Official Opposition leader in the legislature so he can\u00a0focus on travelling the province to meet with voters and rebuild the party. Todd Stone will be the new house leader, while Peter Milobar takes over the role of finance critic from Mike Bernier.

His former portfolios included transportation, health, finance and deputy premier. Falcon said he would rebuild the party by highlighting the successes of the former Liberal governments. \"Bring it on,\" he said. \"I will put up our record in government up against the NDP any day of the week ...\u00a0 They can talk about baggage, but I can tell you I'm quite happy to talk about our record.\" Former cabinet minister Kevin Falcon wins B.C. Liberal leadership race on 5th ballot B.C.'s next election is set for October 2024 and the NDP have already begun antagonizing the new Liberal leader. Economic Recovery Minister Ravi Kahlon said the government is\u00a0looking forward to debates with Falcon. \"You know, I think it's important to remind British Columbians\u00a0that he just left a little while ago, and he has a record, a\u00a0history,'' said Kahlon. \"In fact, he was the architect of some very\u00a0deep cuts to the province that we're still paying for today.''

Falcon said the NDP government stands in the way of building a\u00a0strong economy. \"I don't want to have to clean up a big mess from the NDP\u00a0again,'' Falcon said. \"That's why it's important to get in\u00a0there\u00a0and cut them off at the pass before they can do too much damage to\u00a0the economy and the finances of the province of B.C.'' Diversity, tolerance Falcon held a seat in Surrey for three terms beginning in 2001 before deciding not to run in the 2013 election. He\u00a0said he left politics to spend more time with his young family. He has been working in the private sector with a Vancouver investment and property development firm. The leadership race was defined by the party's need to rebuild, become more diverse and find a way to win more seats in urban ridings. Falcon said\u00a0he will be a strong advocate for a free-enterprise\u00a0economy, but he also wants to ensure diversity and tolerance for people of all races, genders, faiths and backgrounds are hallmarks\u00a0of a renewed B.C. Liberal party. \"I mean this sincerely,'' he said. \"I would rather not win\u00a0unless the party is prepared to be rock solid behind me in the\u00a0change of direction I want to take this party.''

Temperatures where they walked, in Emerson, Manitoba, had dropped more than 35 degrees Celsius below freezing. The young family had probably never experienced temperatures that low before. Even on its coldest day, the Patels' home village in western India would not have reached within 10 degrees of freezing. As they walked - maybe for a couple of hours, maybe for more - sharp winds carried snow and shards of ice across the plains, reducing visibility to nothing. Canadian police found the four of them - Vaishaliben, 37, Jagdish, 39, their daughter, Vihangi, 11 and son, Dharmik, 3 - lying together, frozen, in an empty field on 19 January. They had died 12 metres from the US border. The mysterious case of a young family that made its way from an unassuming village in Gujarat, India, to the bitter reaches of Manitoba, half a world away, has shocked Canadians and Indians alike, exposing the intense pressures and economic anxieties that may have led to tragedy. Officials have said they believe the family's deaths to be a case of human smuggling, and authorities in the US and Canada are still trying to determine how the Patels reached Emerson and who may have led them there, ultimately to their deaths. BBC Gujarati The Patel family's home BBC The Patels were found near Emerson, Manitoba (right), thousands of miles away from home in Dingucha (left) The village of Dingucha in western India is about as far as you can get - in distance and in feeling - from icy Manitoba. Some 12,000km away from Emerson, the town is home to about 3,500 residents, mostly middle-class agricultural workers and labourers in the province of Gujarat. There, the Patels lived in a neat two-storey home with a rooftop balcony and a large welcome sign painted over the door. Their home sits snug among a line of row houses - concrete buildings painted yellow, pink and white. Some residents apparently knew of the Patels' plans to travel, telling the BBC's Gujarati service that they went to Canada on visitor's visas. Relatives grew concerned when messages from the family stopped coming, about a week after they had left, they said. On or about 12 January, the Patel's arrived in Canada on a flight to Toronto before traveling 2,000km (1,200 miles) west to Manitoba. Police have not determined how they got to Emerson - by land or sky - though there is no record of them boarding a domestic flight. The drive would have been long - 22 hours on the Trans-Canada Highway. They would have snaked along the Canada-US border, weaving past the frozen lakes of southern Ontario before reaching the flat expanse of the prairies, where wind carries snow through the air like smoke. BBC By 18 January they arrived in Emerson, adding four to its population of 700. The town has one pharmacy, one grocery store, one school. The houses are modest single-storey homes with single-car garages and large yards. Residents call it a retirement town - a pleasant place to live, with not much to do. If the Patels had stayed at one of Emerson's two borderside motels, they would have looked straight out at the US - North Dakota to the right, Minnesota to the left. From here, at Manitoba's southern edge, it can be hard to distinguish the white plane of frozen fields from the snowy sky. Standing outside in Emerson's winter is almost unbearable, despite layers of fleece, down and wool. The air burns the lungs with every breath even when it is 15 degrees warmer than the day the Patels attempted to walk across the border. The cold feels \"like a dog biting your hand and not letting go\", said George Andrawess, who runs Emerson's lone pharmacy, five minute's walk from the border. \"Your tears will freeze in your eyes,\" he said. BBC In one photograph of the Patels, now circulating widely, the family looks happy, all four of them smiling straight down the camera's lens, as if for a holiday greeting card. Dharmik, the toddler, matches his father in a black and white floral vest. Vihangi, 11, wears the same red lipstick as her mother. Both Jagdish and Vaishaliben were educated, local media said, at one point working as teachers. Like many other Gujaratis, the Patels had a second home nearby, in the nearest middle-class town, Kalol. Residents told the BBC's Gujarati service that Jagdish, the father, had helped his brother in the garment business. Their parents were often nearby, also dividing their time between Kalol and Dingucha. Yet despite the appearances of a well-anchored life in India, something compelled the Patels to leave. In Dingucha, this is common, residents told the BBC. \"Every child here grows with the dream of moving to a foreign country,\" a Dingucha councilman said. Many locals spoke of an intense and pervasive social pressure to move abroad, with social status determined by connections in foreign countries. Those who stay are seen as incapable of raising the funds to leave, everyone else moves on, some said. \"There are instances, where boys of marriage age cannot find a suitable girl, because they don't have any close relatives in any foreign country,\" one person said. And there were perhaps idealised views of life abroad. \"There are many people earlier as well who had gone to US without proper documentation, and many of them are doing well,\" said another. BBC In Winnipeg, Indo-Canadians said they knew well the \"craze\" for moving abroad among middle and upper-middle class Indians. \"People think there are dollar trees here,\" said Mitesh Trivedi, a Gujarati-Canadian. \"I had that in my mind when I came, I was 26 years old.\" Mr Trivedi, now 59, settled in Canada three decades ago on a marriage visa and became a citizen in 2000. In many ways, his is the life that Indian economic migrants aspire to abroad: He owns a profitable restaurant, has raised a family, and his two daughters both hold graduate degrees in the medical field. Though he was highly educated in India - Mr Trivedi is an engineer by training - upward mobility would have been limited there. \"I was born lower-middle class. If I had stayed, I would have died lower-middle class,\" he said. BBC According to Mr Trivedi and other Gujaratis, the desperation to emigrate has spawned an underground industry of \"irregular migration\", referring to US-Canadian border crossings between official ports of entry. He and other expats in Winnipeg described clandestine travel networks, plans whispered between contacts in India, Canada and the US, that facilitate these crossings, with relatives or friends who were smuggled successfully becoming \"references\" for particular smugglers. \"It's word of mouth,\" Mr Trivedi said. \"Nothing on paper.\" He has heard of people who have done it, he said. Crossing on foot or hiding in trunks of cars \"is not new\". These networks can foster safe havens abroad, with documented Indian migrants providing a place to stay or off-the-books employment for the newly arrived. According to Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, the country is experiencing an influx of irregular migration. Most of these crossings are northbound - with migrants trying to cross into Canada from the US. Last year, about 4,000 people were found trying to enter Canada this way, compared to 900 crossing into the US, said Western University's Professor Victoria Esses, who studies immigration policy. Before Covid-19 travel restrictions, both numbers would likely be higher, she said. Emerson itself, with its wide stretch of unguarded border, is considered a hotspot for illegal crossings. US Border Patrol recently named this area as a high incident spot for human smuggling. In 2017, two migrants from Ghana were badly injured by frostbite, each losing several fingers, when they tried to make the trek into Canada from the US . At the time, Emerson locals told the BBC they were afraid someone would die trying to make it across. They lost fingers entering Canada. Then what happened? The Canada town taking refugees from the US It's unclear why Canada was not the Patels' final destination, but Gujaratis in both India and Canada say residents of Dingucha have a particular fixation with the US. Most of those who spoke to the BBC were familiar with the US immigration process, rattling off descriptions of different types of visas and which lead to citizenship. Or perhaps they simply had family there. A few days after their deaths, an online fundraiser for the family's funeral costs was set up by Dilip Patel, a doctor in Chicago, though it is uncertain if he was a relative. He did not respond to requests for comment. BBC The Patels were found not far from here Police on both sides of the border have said that the Patels' case is probably linked to human smuggling. The only named suspect so far is 47-year-old Steve Shand, a US citizen from Florida, arrested last month. Mr Shand is suspected of playing a part in a \"larger human smuggling operation\", connected to the deaths of the Patels, the US Homeland Security department has said. On 19 January, the same day the Patels were found, Mr Shand was arrested in Pembina, North Dakota, less than 8km from Emerson. He was driving a 15-seat van with two Indian nationals as passengers, and cases of food and water in his boot. Five additional Indian nationals were found that day, 400 metres south of the Canadian border, walking towards the location of Mr Shand's arrest. They told authorities they had been walking for more than 11 hours. The Indian nationals arrived illegally in the US, authorities said. All seven spoke Gujarati - the language of the Patels' home state - and all seven wore newly purchased matching winter clothing, similar to the Patels'. One man carried a backpack that did not belong to him, containing children's clothes, a nappy and toys. The group told authorities that a family of four had been left behind. One of the Indian nationals caught with Mr Shand told authorities he paid a \"significant\" amount of money to enter Canada under a falsified student visa. After crossing into the US on foot, he had expected to be driven to his uncle's home in Chicago. But for the Patels, the central questions are left unanswered: what was waiting for them across the plains, was it worth the risk, or did they even know the risk they were taking? Among the many painful details of the case, Canadians have been left bewildered as to why the Patels pushed forward, despite the frigid and dangerous conditions. \"Who told them to do this?\" asked Hemant Shah, an Indian expat and community leader in Winnipeg. \"Any Gujarati or Indo-Canadian would have told them not to go. It was minus 35, you cannot survive that.\" Perhaps the journey seemed simple - a straight shot across an invisible, unimpeded border - but on the night of their crossing, that path was blurred by snow, and the long stretch of the prairies would have offered little in the form of navigation.

Ottawa protesters who vowed never to give up are largely gone, chased away by police in riot gear in what was the biggest police operation in the nation's history. Adrian Wyld \/The Canadian Press\/via AP TORONTO \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday he is removing emergency powers police can use after authorities ended the border blockades by those opposed to COVID-19 restrictions as well as the occupation of downtown Ottawa. Trudeau invoked the powers last week and lawmakers affirmed the powers late Monday. Trudeau said then the powers were still needed but noted they would not stay in place a day longer than necessary. \"The situation is no longer an emergency, therefore the federal government will be ending the use of the emergencies act,\" Trudeau said. \"We are confident that existing laws and bylaws are sufficient to keep people safe.\" Sponsor Message World Police clear protesters around Canada's Parliament building The emergencies act allows authorities to declare certain areas as no-go zones. It also allows police to freeze truckers' personal and corporate bank accounts and compel tow truck companies to haul away vehicles. The trucker protest grew until it closed a handful of Canada-U.S. border posts and shut down key parts of the capital for more than three weeks. But all border blockades have now ended and the streets around the Canadian Parliament are quiet. \"We were very clear that the use of the emergencies act would be limited in time,\" Trudeau said. \"We said we would lift it as soon as possible.\" Trudeau had warned earlier this week there were some truckers just outside Ottawa who might be planning further blockades or occupations. His public safety minister also said there was an attempt to block a border crossing in British Columbia over the weekend. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said those who had their bank accounts frozen were \"influencers in the illegal protest in Ottawa, and owners and\/or drivers of vehicles who did not want to leave the area.\" World Canadian police arrest 2 leaders of protesting truckers The protests, which were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers but also encompassed fury over the range of COVID-19 restrictions and hatred of Trudeau, reflected the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger. The self-styled Freedom Convoy shook Canada's reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted trade, causing economic damage on both sides of the border. Hundreds of trucks eventually occupied the streets around Parliament, a display that was part protest and part carnival. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing, the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, was blocked. The crossing sees more than 25% of the trade between the two countries. Authorities moved to reopen the border posts, but police in Ottawa did little but issue warnings until Friday, even as hundreds and sometimes thousands of protesters clogged the streets of the city and besieged Parliament Hill. On Friday, authorities launched the largest police operation in Canadian history, arresting a string of Ottawa protesters and increasing that pressure on Saturday until the streets in front of Parliament were clear. Eventually, police arrested at least 191 people and towed away 79 vehicles. Many protesters retreated as the pressure increased. A small convoy of truckers demanding an end to coronavirus mandates began a cross-country drive from California to the Washington, D.C., area on Wednesday. Several hundred people rallied in a parking lot in the cold, windswept Mojave Desert town of Adelanto before about two dozen trucks and a number of other vehicles hit the road. It wasn't clear how many intended to go all the way.

{"year":"2022","month":"01","event_desc":"The four members of the Patel family froze to death near Emerson, Manitoba.","text":"The family that froze to death a world away from home 11 February 2022 Share Save Holly Honderich & Roxy Gagdekar BBC News, Manitoba & Gujarat Share Save BBC The night Vaishaliben Patel, her husband Jagdish and their two children set out for the US-Canadian border they dressed in new heavy winter coats and snow boots. Temperatures where they walked, in Emerson, Manitoba, had dropped more than 35 degrees Celsius below freezing. The young family had probably never experienced temperatures that low before. Even on its coldest day, the Patels' home village in western India would not have reached within 10 degrees of freezing. As they walked - maybe for a couple of hours, maybe for more - sharp winds carried snow and shards of ice across the plains, reducing visibility to nothing. Canadian police found the four of them - Vaishaliben, 37, Jagdish, 39, their daughter, Vihangi, 11 and son, Dharmik, 3 - lying together, frozen, in an empty field on 19 January. They had died 12 metres from the US border. The mysterious case of a young family that made its way from an unassuming village in Gujarat, India, to the bitter reaches of Manitoba, half a world away, has shocked Canadians and Indians alike, exposing the intense pressures and economic anxieties that may have led to tragedy. Officials have said they believe the family's deaths to be a case of human smuggling, and authorities in the US and Canada are still trying to determine how the Patels reached Emerson and who may have led them there, ultimately to their deaths. BBC Gujarati The Patel family's home BBC The Patels were found near Emerson, Manitoba (right), thousands of miles away from home in Dingucha (left) The village of Dingucha in western India is about as far as you can get - in distance and in feeling - from icy Manitoba. Some 12,000km away from Emerson, the town is home to about 3,500 residents, mostly middle-class agricultural workers and labourers in the province of Gujarat. There, the Patels lived in a neat two-storey home with a rooftop balcony and a large welcome sign painted over the door. Their home sits snug among a line of row houses - concrete buildings painted yellow, pink and white. Some residents apparently knew of the Patels' plans to travel, telling the BBC's Gujarati service that they went to Canada on visitor's visas. Relatives grew concerned when messages from the family stopped coming, about a week after they had left, they said. On or about 12 January, the Patel's arrived in Canada on a flight to Toronto before traveling 2,000km (1,200 miles) west to Manitoba. Police have not determined how they got to Emerson - by land or sky - though there is no record of them boarding a domestic flight. The drive would have been long - 22 hours on the Trans-Canada Highway. They would have snaked along the Canada-US border, weaving past the frozen lakes of southern Ontario before reaching the flat expanse of the prairies, where wind carries snow through the air like smoke. BBC By 18 January they arrived in Emerson, adding four to its population of 700. The town has one pharmacy, one grocery store, one school. The houses are modest single-storey homes with single-car garages and large yards. Residents call it a retirement town - a pleasant place to live, with not much to do. If the Patels had stayed at one of Emerson's two borderside motels, they would have looked straight out at the US - North Dakota to the right, Minnesota to the left. From here, at Manitoba's southern edge, it can be hard to distinguish the white plane of frozen fields from the snowy sky. Standing outside in Emerson's winter is almost unbearable, despite layers of fleece, down and wool. The air burns the lungs with every breath even when it is 15 degrees warmer than the day the Patels attempted to walk across the border. The cold feels \"like a dog biting your hand and not letting go\", said George Andrawess, who runs Emerson's lone pharmacy, five minute's walk from the border. \"Your tears will freeze in your eyes,\" he said. BBC In one photograph of the Patels, now circulating widely, the family looks happy, all four of them smiling straight down the camera's lens, as if for a holiday greeting card. Dharmik, the toddler, matches his father in a black and white floral vest. Vihangi, 11, wears the same red lipstick as her mother. Both Jagdish and Vaishaliben were educated, local media said, at one point working as teachers. Like many other Gujaratis, the Patels had a second home nearby, in the nearest middle-class town, Kalol. Residents told the BBC's Gujarati service that Jagdish, the father, had helped his brother in the garment business. Their parents were often nearby, also dividing their time between Kalol and Dingucha. Yet despite the appearances of a well-anchored life in India, something compelled the Patels to leave. In Dingucha, this is common, residents told the BBC. \"Every child here grows with the dream of moving to a foreign country,\" a Dingucha councilman said. Many locals spoke of an intense and pervasive social pressure to move abroad, with social status determined by connections in foreign countries. Those who stay are seen as incapable of raising the funds to leave, everyone else moves on, some said. \"There are instances, where boys of marriage age cannot find a suitable girl, because they don't have any close relatives in any foreign country,\" one person said. And there were perhaps idealised views of life abroad. \"There are many people earlier as well who had gone to US without proper documentation, and many of them are doing well,\" said another. BBC In Winnipeg, Indo-Canadians said they knew well the \"craze\" for moving abroad among middle and upper-middle class Indians. \"People think there are dollar trees here,\" said Mitesh Trivedi, a Gujarati-Canadian. \"I had that in my mind when I came, I was 26 years old.\" Mr Trivedi, now 59, settled in Canada three decades ago on a marriage visa and became a citizen in 2000. In many ways, his is the life that Indian economic migrants aspire to abroad: He owns a profitable restaurant, has raised a family, and his two daughters both hold graduate degrees in the medical field. Though he was highly educated in India - Mr Trivedi is an engineer by training - upward mobility would have been limited there. \"I was born lower-middle class. If I had stayed, I would have died lower-middle class,\" he said. BBC According to Mr Trivedi and other Gujaratis, the desperation to emigrate has spawned an underground industry of \"irregular migration\", referring to US-Canadian border crossings between official ports of entry. He and other expats in Winnipeg described clandestine travel networks, plans whispered between contacts in India, Canada and the US, that facilitate these crossings, with relatives or friends who were smuggled successfully becoming \"references\" for particular smugglers. \"It's word of mouth,\" Mr Trivedi said. \"Nothing on paper.\" He has heard of people who have done it, he said. Crossing on foot or hiding in trunks of cars \"is not new\". These networks can foster safe havens abroad, with documented Indian migrants providing a place to stay or off-the-books employment for the newly arrived. According to Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, the country is experiencing an influx of irregular migration. Most of these crossings are northbound - with migrants trying to cross into Canada from the US. Last year, about 4,000 people were found trying to enter Canada this way, compared to 900 crossing into the US, said Western University's Professor Victoria Esses, who studies immigration policy. Before Covid-19 travel restrictions, both numbers would likely be higher, she said. Emerson itself, with its wide stretch of unguarded border, is considered a hotspot for illegal crossings. US Border Patrol recently named this area as a high incident spot for human smuggling. In 2017, two migrants from Ghana were badly injured by frostbite, each losing several fingers, when they tried to make the trek into Canada from the US . At the time, Emerson locals told the BBC they were afraid someone would die trying to make it across. They lost fingers entering Canada. Then what happened? The Canada town taking refugees from the US It's unclear why Canada was not the Patels' final destination, but Gujaratis in both India and Canada say residents of Dingucha have a particular fixation with the US. Most of those who spoke to the BBC were familiar with the US immigration process, rattling off descriptions of different types of visas and which lead to citizenship. Or perhaps they simply had family there. A few days after their deaths, an online fundraiser for the family's funeral costs was set up by Dilip Patel, a doctor in Chicago, though it is uncertain if he was a relative. He did not respond to requests for comment. BBC The Patels were found not far from here Police on both sides of the border have said that the Patels' case is probably linked to human smuggling. The only named suspect so far is 47-year-old Steve Shand, a US citizen from Florida, arrested last month. Mr Shand is suspected of playing a part in a \"larger human smuggling operation\", connected to the deaths of the Patels, the US Homeland Security department has said. On 19 January, the same day the Patels were found, Mr Shand was arrested in Pembina, North Dakota, less than 8km from Emerson. He was driving a 15-seat van with two Indian nationals as passengers, and cases of food and water in his boot. Five additional Indian nationals were found that day, 400 metres south of the Canadian border, walking towards the location of Mr Shand's arrest. They told authorities they had been walking for more than 11 hours. The Indian nationals arrived illegally in the US, authorities said. All seven spoke Gujarati - the language of the Patels' home state - and all seven wore newly purchased matching winter clothing, similar to the Patels'. One man carried a backpack that did not belong to him, containing children's clothes, a nappy and toys. The group told authorities that a family of four had been left behind. One of the Indian nationals caught with Mr Shand told authorities he paid a \"significant\" amount of money to enter Canada under a falsified student visa. After crossing into the US on foot, he had expected to be driven to his uncle's home in Chicago. But for the Patels, the central questions are left unanswered: what was waiting for them across the plains, was it worth the risk, or did they even know the risk they were taking? Among the many painful details of the case, Canadians have been left bewildered as to why the Patels pushed forward, despite the frigid and dangerous conditions. \"Who told them to do this?\" asked Hemant Shah, an Indian expat and community leader in Winnipeg. \"Any Gujarati or Indo-Canadian would have told them not to go. It was minus 35, you cannot survive that.\" Perhaps the journey seemed simple - a straight shot across an invisible, unimpeded border - but on the night of their crossing, that path was blurred by snow, and the long stretch of the prairies would have offered little in the form of navigation. They didn't even make it to the border. In their final moments, they may not have known where they were at all.

The science behind this powerful storm When Canadian tornado expert David Sills studied the forecast on Saturday morning, he never expected the line of storms headed for Windsor, Ont., would soon strengthen into Canada\u2019s first derecho in decades, wreaking havoc across southern Ontario and Quebec. Canada's last derecho was in 1999, but climate change is shifting conditions Jaela Bernstien \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: May 25, 2022 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: May 25, 2022 Uxbridge, Ont., resident Allen Harrison cleans up his property on Tuesday, after a tornado produced by a derecho swept through the southern Ontario town. (Evan Mitsui\/CBC) Social Sharing When Canadian tornado expert David Sills studied the forecast on Saturday morning, he never expected the line of storms headed for Windsor, Ont., would soon strengthen into Canada's first derecho in decades, wreaking havoc across southern Ontario and Quebec. 'As bad as it gets': Why what hit Ottawa was worse than the ice storm or 2018 tornadoes Most residents to have electricity in 2-3 days, cleanup to take weeks Sills, who is the executive director of the Northern Tornadoes Project at Western University, was outside doing yardwork at his London, Ont., home when he heard a rumble in the distance; he couldn't believe the line of storms was still so active. \"I'm thinking, 'What? Why is this thing still going?'\" He went back inside to study the forecast, and that's when the storm arrived at his doorstep. \"All of a sudden it hits and it's just like a hurricane,\" Sills said. \"It's just getting stronger and stronger \u2026 I watched as a tree came down on my neighbour's roof across the street.\" That's when he knew it wasn't a normal thunderstorm. Powerful winds lift up dirt before the storm arrived in Saint-Bernard-de-Michaudville, Que. (Daniel Thomas\/Radio-Canada) An ominous wall of wind and rain A derecho, pronounced deh-REY-cho , is a long-lived, fast-moving thunderstorm that causes widespread wind damage. This particular storm system was fed by a heat dome over the eastern United States. According to Sills, the system formed south of Chicago on Saturday morning, then crossed the border into the Windsor area, where it started to cause damage. By the time it arrived in Kitchener, Sills said the thunderstorm was producing gusts of up to 132 km\/h. Farms, communities in rural Ottawa area particularly battered by derecho storm Unlike the rotating winds in a hurricane or a tornado, a derecho's winds are straight. That doesn't mean it's any less damaging; its winds can topple trees and lift up roofs. Another feature of a derecho is that unlike the slow building of a supercell thunderstorm, the business end of a derecho is at the front. That's why when you witness a derecho, Sills said, it often looks like an ominous wall of wind and rain. \"When it hits, usually the worst of it is within a couple minutes of it hitting,\" he said. Part of a utility pole lies on a driveway, along with the roof of a hardware store that was lifted off by extreme winds during Saturday's storm, in the community of Hammond in Clarence-Rockland, Ont. (Justin Tang\/The Canadian Press) Making that destructive wall of wind even worse, is that it can sometimes produce tornadoes as well. \"Really, it's just a spectrum of wind that affects a long area,\" Sills said. So far, field crews with the Northern Tornadoes Project have identified at least one EF2 tornado, which hit Uxbridge, Ont., with wind speeds of up to 195 km\/h. Canada's building codes don't focus on tornadoes \u2014 even though we see 2nd most in the world The team is investigating at least four other possible tornadoes in southern Ottawa, London, Ont., and Rawdon, Que. Sills said he expects there could be even more. Even if that's the case, \"the overwhelming majority of the damage was caused by straight line derecho winds,\" said Environment Canada warning preparedness meteorologist Peter Kimbell. He said both Ottawa and Toronto airports reported 120 km\/h winds. A rare event: Canada's 1st derecho since 1999 The last string of significant derechos that hit Canada were in the 1990s, including one in 1999. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , that storm cut a path through Thunder Bay and sparsely populated areas of northern Ontario before crossing into Quebec, where it killed one person, toppled trees, damaged buildings and overturned boats in the Montreal area. \"It is the widespread nature of a derecho that can really cause havoc in a city,\" Sills said. What made Saturday's storm especially unlucky was that several urban centres were directly in its path. \"This was an unusual event because it affected the most populated part of Canada,\" Kimbell said. The system formed south of Chicago on Saturday morning, and then it moved through Ontario, according to tornado expert David Sills. (Environment and Climate Change Canada\/CBC News) Environment and Climate Change Canada issued a broadcast alert for a severe thunderstorm, setting off alarms on people's cellphones in Ontario and Quebec. It was the first time a new feature was tested, allowing the forecaster to trigger an alert for extreme thunderstorms with high winds. \"That's the first time they've done that, and it probably saved lives,\" Sills said. Still, the storm left a path of destruction in its wake, killing 10 people and leaving roughly 900,000 homes and businesses without power in Ontario and Quebec at its peak. It continued all the way to Maine, where there were also reports of damages. Climate change could bring more derechos Pinning down whether or not the rare event could be linked to climate change is difficult. Because derechos are so infrequent in Canada, Sills said it's impossible to say whether they're increasing or not. But, he said, the ingredients necessary to form a derecho \"may come together more often\" as a result of the effects of climate change. A derecho happens when there's a lot of heat and moisture available and they are often tied to heat domes. Sills said climate projections point to a warmer atmosphere that will creep northward, which means this is the kind of storm Canadians can expect to see more of in the future. Aerial images shot from a drone show the aftermath of Saturday's storm in Uxbridge, Ont. (Sue Reid\/CBC News) There is always something to learn from extreme weather events, Sills said, and a key takeaway for him after this storm is that computer modelling needs to catch up. \"There wasn't much in the way of any indication in the models of this big derecho coming through,\" he said. \"The computer models we rely on to give us a heads up for these types of events, they've got a long way to go.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Jaela Bernstien Journalist Jaela Bernstien is a Quebec-based journalist who covers climate change and environmental issues for CBC online, radio and TV.

(CBC) Social Sharing The man\u00a0responsible for Toronto's deadly van attack has been sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years. Justice\u00a0Anne Molloy\u00a0handed down her sentence in Superior Court in Toronto\u00a0Monday in a room full of\u00a0victims, family, friends and community members whose lives were forever changed on April 23, 2018. Alek Minassian has also been sentenced to 20 years for 15 counts of attempted murder, which are to be served concurrently. He was found guilty last year of 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. Eight women and two men died on April 23, 2018 when the\u00a025-year-old man who was\u00a0bent on infamy, angered by women who wouldn't sleep with him and radicalized in the depths of the internet\u00a0deliberately drove a rented van down a busy\u00a0sidewalk in the city's north end. Another woman died more than three years later from injuries suffered that day . Molloy stressed on Monday that this is a life sentence.\u00a0\"It is not a 25-year-sentence,\" she said. What this means is 25 years after the crime, the offender can apply for parole\u00a0\u2014 but that doesn't mean he will get it, she said, adding that the \"number and enormity\" of his crimes will be taken into account in any parole hearing. Justice Anne Molloy listens to Crown attorney John Rinaldi read a victim impact statement during Alek Minassian's sentencing hearing on Monday. (Pam Davies\/CBC) An avalanche\u00a0of harrowing victim impact statements, often presented through trembling voices and tears,\u00a0was\u00a0read into the record during the day-long\u00a0sentencing hearing. Molloy thanked each person who spoke or submitted a written statement. \"You've reached into my heart, and touched me in a very profound way,\" she said, her voice shaking. Heartbreaking victim impact statements One such impassioned statement\u00a0came from So Ra. She and her best friend,\u00a0Sohe\u00a0Chung, were walking on Yonge Street that day because they thought the weather\u00a0was too nice to take the subway. In a victim impact statement that was read out\u00a0in court, Ra said her last memory was waiting for a light to change\u00a0\u2014 then she woke up on the ground, covered in blood and in unbearable pain, gasping for air. She found her friend on the ground a few metres away, not moving. Ra was rushed to Sunnybrook\u00a0hospital where she was diagnosed with a concussion and\u00a0a collar bone fracture. She said almost all of the bones in her face were broken, save for her forehead. The swelling was so severe from an orbital bone fracture that she couldn't even open one of her eyes. So Ra lost her best friend in the Toronto van attack. She herself sustained extensive facial injuries. (Albert Leung\/CBC) Through that pain, Ra\u00a0kept asking about her best friend, who she described in her victim impact statement as her \"soul mate.\" \"We connected on the soul level, and that is how well we got along,\" she said. \"I admired and loved her so much.\" That was why her physical pain was later\u00a0dwarfed by the agony of finding out Chung\u00a0hadn't survived. In that moment, she said, she truly understood heartbreak. \"When I heard about her death, my whole world crashed down around me,\" she said. \"I felt empty inside like I had a huge hole in my heart, which could not be filled.\" Betty Forsyth, Ji Hun Kim, Sohe Chung, Geraldine Brady, Chul Min Kang, Anne Marie D'Amico, Munir Najjar, Dorothy Sewell, Andrea Bradden, Beutis Renuka Amarasingha and Amaresh Tesfamariam died as a result of attack. Automatic life sentence For victims and their families, this hearing marked\u00a0the\u00a0first opportunity to face the killer in person as\u00a0the judge-alone trial and\u00a0verdict occurred over videoconference during the pandemic.\u00a0On Monday, he remained quiet throughout his sentencing hearing, sitting in an ill-fitting grey suit, balding, and spending\u00a0much of the time staring at the floor. The offender also chose not to speak when Molloy asked if he had anything to say. These are the victims of Toronto's deadly van attack 'Beloved' nurse hurt in 2018 Toronto van attack dies of injuries 3 years later In Canada, first-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence without the ability to apply for parole for 25 years. During the trial, held in\u00a02020, the Crown indicated it was going to be seeking consecutive life sentences. However, back in May, the Supreme Court of Canada declared unconstitutional a 2011 Criminal Code provision that allowed judges to impose parole ineligibility periods of 25 years to be served consecutively for each murder, rather than concurrently. WATCH | Victims of van attack face killer at sentencing hearing: Toronto van attacker given maximum sentence following victim impact statements 3 years ago Duration 2:05 Alek Minassian was given the maximum possible sentence for the 2018 Toronto van attack shortly after survivors and family members delivered their victim impact statements. Molloy said sentencing for the case had been delayed while everyone involved waited\u00a0for the Supreme Court's ruling. She said the \"profound\" and \"heartbreaking\" victim impact statements court heard Monday weren't for nothing. \"The fact that I cannot and am not imposing more than the 25-year parole eligibility does not mean that everything you said was not important,\" she said. \"What you said counts. It matters. It matters to me and it matters to other people who will have to make decisions in the future.\" The Crown and defence also put forth a joint submission Monday that recognized Tesfamariam, who died more than three years later from injuries suffered in the attack. They recommended a life sentence for her death, which initially went ahead as an attempted murder as she was still alive during the trial. The sentencing hearing for Alek Minassian heard from over two dozen people affected by the attack. (Chris Young\/Canadian Press) Janice Kirby also spoke Monday of the immeasurable sorrow she has felt since the loss of her mother, Geraldine Brady. Kirby last spoke to her mother on the phone around 11 a.m. the morning of the attack. \"I'm grateful I had the chance to say I loved her,\" Kirby said. Brady had gone out\u00a0that day to run some errands \u2014\u00a0among them, to take out some cash for birthday cards for family that were signed and ready to go. Kirby said she didn't get to celebrate her own birthday that year;\u00a0instead, she spent it shopping for clothes to wear to her mother's funeral. \"My heart hurts every day,\" she said. \"I can never understand this horrific, cowardly act.\" Another victim impact statement came in the form of a drawing done by nine-year-old boy Diyon, who lost his mother, Renuka Amarasingha.\u00a0He did not file any words as part of his victim impact statement \u2014\u00a0just the drawing. This drawing was made by nine-year-old Diyon, who lost his mother, Renuka Amarasingha, on April 23, 2018. (Court exhibit) A community shattered Multiple civilians who provided CPR at the scene also spoke during court's morning session, and tearfully relayed how they still see the aftermath of what happened when they close their eyes. Jiaxin Jiang\u00a0told the court that the horror she saw that day has changed her life forever.\u00a0Jiang\u00a0performed\u00a0CPR on a victim who died at the scene, leaving her with \"years of guilt and self doubt as a healthcare professional in training,\" she said. \"I replayed the sequence of events on that day thousands of times in my head, questioning if I could have done things differently and if she would still be here today.\" Tanya Kouzos, who helped victims during the 2018 Toronto van attack, speaks to media outside the Toronto courthouse where the killer's sentencing hearing was taking place on Monday. (Esteban Cuevas\/CBC) Tanya Kouzos\u00a0was another first responder, who told the court she still endures flashbacks, seeing the fear and confusion on victims' faces and hearing the panic in their voices. Her voice, Kouzos said, was the last one some people ever heard. \"I live with the thought, 'was there more I could have done to help?'\u00a0It's guilt and remorse I still feel even though [this was] caused by another person's evil choices,\" she said. Molloy's voice cracked several times as she made sure to individually thank each person who spoke in court. \"I admire your courage.\u00a0I am so sorry this happened to you,\" she told Jiang.

Ontario voters gave Premier Doug Ford another four-year term Thursday in a resounding election victory for the Progressive Conservatives that reduced the size of the NDP opposition and left the Liberals banished to the political wilderness. Both NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca resigned their posts. With the landslide win, the Conservatives exceeded their 2018 seat count in the legislature despite two years of COVID-19 that left 13,311 Ontarians dead and soaring inflation as the economy rebounds from the pandemic. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The Tories, who held 67 ridings at dissolution on May 4, won 83 of the 124 seats in the house with a dismal voter turnout of just 43 per cent, down from 57 per cent in 2018. The New Democrats won 31 seats to eight for the Liberals, one Green and one Independent. \u201cWe\u2019re reimagining our party ... and tonight, we have changed what it means to be a Progressive Conservative in Ontario,\u201d Ford told cheering supporters at the Toronto Congress Centre in his Etobicoke North riding. \u201cThis is my proudest achievement as a leader of this party, building a new coalition, expanding our base, creating a more inclusive party where everyone matters, because never in our lifetime has it been more important for a party to represent all of Ontario,\u201d he said. In appealing to so many unionized workers, Ford delivered a final setback to Horwath, who announced her resignation after leading the party for 13 years into four elections. \u201cTonight, it is time for me to pass the torch,\u201d a tearful NDP chief told disappointed supporters in Hamilton. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get there this time ... but we are once again going to be your official Opposition,\u201d she said. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The New Democrats, reduced from 38 seats at dissolution, will continue to serve as the official Opposition though the Liberals tied their popular vote tally. Del Duca, who lost his own Vaughan-Woodbridge riding, only slightly improved his party\u2019s fortunes and resigned after failing to win the dozen seats necessary for official party status in the legislature. \u201cI am disappointed to have not been successful in my home constituency,\u201d said the Liberal leader, who had said Wednesday he planned to stay at the helm \u201cregardless of the result.\u201d With a campaign slogan, \u201cget it done,\u201d Ford promised tens of billions in new infrastructure, including subways, hospitals, and freeways like the 60-kilometre Milton-to-Vaughan Highway 413 that the NDP, Liberals and Greens opposed over environmental concerns. The highway, which would raze 800 hectares of farmland, pave over 160 hectares of Greenbelt land and cut through 85 waterways, was a major point of contention in an otherwise uneventful campaign. While Green Leader Mike Schreiner \u2014 who won his Guelph seat but failed to make other gains \u2014 was widely seen as the winner of the provincewide televised debate moderated by the Star\u2019s Althia Raj and Steve Paikin of TVO\u2019s The Agenda , none of Ford\u2019s rivals benefited politically from the 90-minute encounter. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Sticking to a carefully crafted campaign script, the Tory premier \u2014 who led in every public-opinion poll from start to finish \u2014 courted working-class voters, securing the endorsement of eight private-sector labour unions as part of a \u201c Big Blue Collar Machine \u201d push to win over traditional NDP supporters . Workplace reforms pushed by Labour Minister Monte McNaughton ensured the support of one-time PC foes like former union leader Patrick Dillon , a key architect of the Working Families coalition whose attack ads helped the Liberals win the 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2014 elections. Ford\u2019s surprise decision last June to invoke the Constitution\u2019s \u201cnotwithstanding clause\u201d for the first time in Ontario history, overriding a judge\u2019s order lifting limits on third-party campaign advertising spending, did not appear to be a factor in the election. He is now the first Conservative premier to be re-elected since Mike Harris in 1999. Three years ago, Ford\u2019s chances of a second term seemed unlikely when he was still viewed as an accidental premier and the gaffe-prone older brother of the controversial late Toronto mayor Rob Ford . His first 20 months in office were plagued with problems, including a failed bid to make septuagenarian family friend, Toronto police Staff Supt. Ron Taverner , commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Gas pump stickers attacking federal carbon pricing measures \u2014 found to be unconstitutional after a legal challenge by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association \u2014 were another embarrassment when it emerged the decals lacked the proper adhesion . (Ford\u2019s family owns a label company, but they didn\u2019t manufacture the stickers.) Similarly, his bungled bid to switch Ontario licence plates from the traditional white to Tory-blue was abandoned after police warned they were illegible at night. Ford was loudly booed at the Toronto Raptors\u2019 victory celebration at Nathan Phillips Square on June 17, 2019 while Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were cheered. Days later, after a massive cabinet shuffle that saw him dumping his finance minister 10 weeks after tabling an unpopular first PC budget , Ford parted ways with mercurial chief of staff, Dean French , in the wake of the \u201c French connections \u201d cronyism scandal. That led the premier to appoint as chief Jamie Wallace , a former Toronto Sun journalist and one-time Queen\u2019s Park press gallery president, injecting much-needed professionalism and calmness into his office. But it was the COVID-19 pandemic that struck in March 2020 that focused the rookie premier and forced him to finally take governing \u2014 and government \u2014 seriously. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW After hearing former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne defend him on Newstalk 1010, a grateful Ford quietly phoned his one-time fierce rival to seek her advice on the public-health crisis. Wynne told him he needed \u201cto be out at the microphone. With Christine Elliott your (health) minister there, and you need to be there every day. Because people need to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d His aides gave Ford the same counsel and he did just that, convening live televised updates daily for the first months of the pandemic that became appointment viewing for a jittery province. It was, however, a tumultuous two years. A staggering 4,400 vulnerable seniors died of COVID-19 in nursing homes that the premier had promised to protect with an \u201ciron ring\u201d; there were crippling lockdowns for businesses; and Ontario schools were closed to in-class learning longer than anywhere else in North America. Still, Ontario fared better in the global pandemic than most jurisdictions , suffering far fewer deaths per capita than neighbouring Quebec, Manitoba, Michigan and New York. Voters on Thursday apparently forgave Ford his COVID-19 failings, including the disastrous decision in February 2021 to reopen the economy too quickly amid the Delta variant and his knee-jerk reaction to close things down two months later . ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW By the time the Omicron variant walloped Ontario last Christmas, millions had been vaccinated \u2014 more than 90 per cent of eligible Ontarians aged five and up have had at least one shot and Ford forced all Tory MPPs and candidates to get shots , parting ways with three of them who declined \u2014 so January\u2019s lockdown seemed less panicked. In contrast to the bluster and bravado of 2018 when he boasted of cutting spending and finding efficiencies, Ford\u2019s Tories have tabled a record $198.6-billion budget \u2014 25 per cent more than Wynne spent in 2018 \u2014 with a $19.9 billion deficit. That spending plan will be reintroduced this summer. Where he once vowed to be a thorn in the side of Trudeau, the Tory premier has been arguably the federal Liberal government\u2019s closest provincial ally throughout the COVID-19 crisis. His personal friendship with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland \u2014 the two conferred by phone nightly for the first months of the pandemic \u2014 was instrumental in ensuring Ontario finally signed on to Trudeau\u2019s $10-a-day child care and to keeping federal dollars flowing to the province for COVID-19 relief and joint automotive investments. \u201cHonestly, I think COVID \u2014 I had an opportunity to get out there. I think I\u2019ve evolved. You evolve into your role,\u201d Ford insisted to the Star\u2019s Martin Regg Cohn on May 22, in his only major campaign interview. Ontario voters now have another four years to watch that evolution. Politics Headlines Newsletter Get the latest news and unmatched insights in your inbox every evening Error!

Denmark's minister of Greenland affairs couldn't let such a provocation stand. Weeks later he set off for Hans Island, where he replaced the offending Canadian symbolism with a Danish flag and a bottle of Copenhagen's finest schnapps. But he went one step further than the Canadians had, proudly leaving a note that read: \"Welcome to Danish Island.\" And so the \"Whisky Wars\" commenced. Over the following 49 years, dozens of Canadians and Danes took part in the ritual and visitors to the island describe a sea of slightly tattered flags and notices. Finally, in 2018, the countries decided to establish a joint working group to resolve the dispute, ending their decades-long \"agree to disagree\" policy. The deal will be signed once both countries grant parliamentary approval and will see the island split along a naturally occurring cleft on the rocky outcrop, according to a deal published by the Danish foreign ministry on Tuesday. Once signed off, Canada and Denmark will have established the world's longest maritime border at 3,882km.

Liberal leadership CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Aug 06, 2022 2:06 PM EDT | Last Updated: August 6, 2022 Susan Holt is the first woman to win the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. (Jacques Poitras\/CBC) Social Sharing In a historic victory Saturday, Susan Holt has been chosen as the new leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. She is the first woman to win the party's leadership in the province. She won on the third ballot with 51.67 per cent of the vote. Former Liberal MP T.J. Harvey was the runner-up. Holt will lead the party into the next election against the governing Progressive Conservatives now led by Premier Blaine Higgs. The former business leader and one-time adviser to former premier Brian Gallant pitched herself as someone who would bring a fresh approach to politics, a theme she repeated in her victory speech. \"The people of New Brunswick have told us they are tired of politics as usual. They are tired of the conflict and the fighting. They are tired of partisanship,\" she said. \"They want to see something different. We can be the party that leads a change for a new politics in New Brunswick that is transparent, authentic, empathetic and collaborative.\" Holt's 'fresh' message woos Liberals, but is it a winning pitch? New Brunswick Liberals set to choose new party leader In part, Holt's victory was based on being the second or third choice of two of the other candidates. The party used preferential balloting,\u00a0meaning members voting over the past week ranked their first, second, third and fourth choices for leader. In order for a winner to be decided, a candidate needed 50 per cent of the vote. Holt is embraced by former deputy premier Ald\u00e9a Landry after winning the leadership. (Jacques Poitras\/CBC) Former cabinet minister Donald Arseneault\u00a0and current MLA Robert Gauvin\u00a0were the others on the ballot. During the first round of balloting, Harvey had 33.9 per cent, Holt had 32.12 per cent, Gauvin had 19.76 per cent and Arseneault had 14.22 per cent of the points awarded in the party's weighted voting system. Arseneault was dropped off the ballot and the votes were redistributed. Harvey polled 39.58 per cent in the second vote while Holt had 36.76 per cent and Gauvin\u00a0had 23.67 per cent. Gauvin\u00a0fell off the ballot. Bold Change Starts Now!<br> <br>I\u2019m humbled to have earned your trust to lead the Liberal Party of New Brunswick. I\u2019ve been loud and clear that I want to change the way we do politics. And I\u2019m so grateful that you do too. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/JM2jcwJl7g\">pic.twitter.com\/JM2jcwJl7g<\/a> &mdash; @susanholt Holt said she had \"a lot of conversations\" with people who chose Gauvin or Arseneault first, but who were also interested in her as a potential leader. Harvey non-commital Harvey said despite his defeat, he was optimistic about Liberal prospects, though he wouldn't commit to being a candidate in the next election. \"Certainly it's not the outcome that we had hoped for,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we're all still a family and I think it's been really healthy for the party.\" Harvey said his support over the first two rounds was around where his team thought it would be, but with two candidates eliminated at that point\u00a0\"it's really difficult to estimate where you think third-ballot support could go.\" University of Moncton political scientist Roger Ouellette said Holt's victory was a watershed moment for the Liberals. Saint John MLA Shirley Dysart briefly led the party as interim leader in 1985 but Saturday's result is the first time party members have elected a woman to the role. \"Maybe we'll see after the next general election that we'll have another first with a female as premier,\" Ouellette\u00a0said.

He became the UK's monarch at the age of 73 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023. Who is Charles? Charles was born at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948. He was 4 years old when his mother was crowned as Queen Elizabeth II. Instead of being tutored at the palace, his education was in school. He attended Hill House in West London, Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire and Gordonstoun in Eastern Scotland. In 1969, at the age of 20, he was invested by the Queen as Prince of Wales at Caerfarnon Castle. Before the investiture, the then prince learnt Welsh at University College of Wales in Aberystwyth. Royal Family tree and the order of succesion Family life He married Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981 at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. They had two sons: Prince William, born on 21 June 1982; and Prince Harry, born on 15 September 1984. Their marriage was dissolved on 28 August 1996, although the Princess of Wales continued to live at Kensington Palace and to carry out her public work. Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. On 9 April 2005, he married Queen Camilla in a civil ceremony at the Guildhall, Windsor. Regnal Name He is known as King Charles III. That was the first decision of the new king's reign. He could have chosen from any of his four names - Charles Philip Arthur George. His former title of the Prince of Wales passed to his eldest son and heir, Prince William, when he became king. PA Media King Charles's wife, Camilla, became the Queen Consort - consort is the term used for the spouse of the monarch. What does the King do? Formal ceremonies Charles was officially proclaimed King on the Saturday following the Queen's death. This event took place at St James's Palace in London, in front of a ceremonial body known as the Accession Council. This was made up of members of the Privy Council - a group of senior MPs, past and present, and peers - as well as some senior civil servants, Commonwealth high commissioners, and the Lord Mayor of London. It included a series of prayers and pledges, commending the previous monarch and pledging support for the new one. The proclamation was then signed by a number of senior figures including the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord Chancellor. It was read aloud from a balcony above Friary Court in St James's Palace and for the first time since 1952, the national anthem was played with the words \"God Save the King\". The grand ceremony that announced Charles as new king The King's first declaration King Charles attended the second meeting of the Accession Council, along with the Privy Council. This was not a \"swearing in\" at the start of a British monarch's reign, in the style of some other heads of state, such as the president of the US. Instead, the King made a declaration to uphold the constitutional government and - in line with a tradition dating from the early 18th Century - he made an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland. Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II crowned her son Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 The proclamation announcing Charles as the King was later read out in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The Coronation The symbolic high point of the accession was the Coronation, when Charles was formally crowned. Because of the preparation needed, the Coronation was almost eight months after the King's Proclamation. It was held in Westminster Abbey where coronations have been held for the last 900 years - William the Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles was the 40th. It is an Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the ceremony, the St Edward's Crown was placed on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661. This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg - almost 5lbs). Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and ultimately decides the guest list. PA Media King Charles III wearing St Edward\u2019s crown at his Coronation in 2023 The new King took the Coronation oath in front of the watching world in a ceremony that was followed by millions. During this elaborate ceremony he was anointed using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. He received the orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the solid gold crown on his head. Queen Camilla was also crowned at the ceremony. What it was really like inside the Abbey Head of the Commonwealth Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries and 2.5 billion people. For 14 of these countries, as well as the UK, the King is head of state. These countries, known as the Commonwealth realms, are: Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu. What is the purpose of the Commonwealth? The early days of his reign Even though he has not been head of state for long, King Charles III has already seen two prime ministers during his reign. He has visited France, Romania and Germany - where he was the first British monarch to address its federal parliament, the Bundestag. In February 2024 the King was diagnosed with a form of cancer and paused his public appearances.

The grand ceremony that announced Charles as new king The King's first declaration King Charles attended the second meeting of the Accession Council, along with the Privy Council. This was not a \"swearing in\" at the start of a British monarch's reign, in the style of some other heads of state, such as the president of the US. Instead, the King made a declaration to uphold the constitutional government and - in line with a tradition dating from the early 18th Century - he made an oath to preserve the Church of Scotland. Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II crowned her son Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 The proclamation announcing Charles as the King was later read out in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The Coronation The symbolic high point of the accession was the Coronation, when Charles was formally crowned. Because of the preparation needed, the Coronation was almost eight months after the King's Proclamation. It was held in Westminster Abbey where coronations have been held for the last 900 years - William the Conqueror was the first monarch to be crowned there, and Charles was the 40th. It is an Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. At the climax of the ceremony, the St Edward's Crown was placed on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661. This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation itself (not least because it weighs a hefty 2.23kg - almost 5lbs). Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and ultimately decides the guest list. PA Media King Charles III wearing St Edward\u2019s crown at his Coronation in 2023 The new King took the Coronation oath in front of the watching world in a ceremony that was followed by millions. During this elaborate ceremony he was anointed using oils of orange, roses, cinnamon, musk and ambergris. He received the orb and sceptre as symbols of his new role and the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the solid gold crown on his head. Queen Camilla was also crowned at the ceremony. What it was really like inside the Abbey Head of the Commonwealth Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries and 2.5 billion people. For 14 of these countries, as well as the UK, the King is head of state. These countries, known as the Commonwealth realms, are: Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu. What is the purpose of the Commonwealth? The early days of his reign Even though he has not been head of state for long, King Charles III has already seen two prime ministers during his reign. He has visited France, Romania and Germany - where he was the first British monarch to address its federal parliament, the Bundestag. In February 2024 the King was diagnosed with a form of cancer and paused his public appearances.

Susan Holt won with 51.67 per cent of the vote. She is the first woman to be elected to the position. Holt is 1st woman to win the N.B. Liberal leadership CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Aug 06, 2022 2:06 PM EDT | Last Updated: August 6, 2022 Susan Holt is the first woman to win the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. (Jacques Poitras\/CBC) Social Sharing In a historic victory Saturday, Susan Holt has been chosen as the new leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. She is the first woman to win the party's leadership in the province. She won on the third ballot with 51.67 per cent of the vote. Former Liberal MP T.J. Harvey was the runner-up. Holt will lead the party into the next election against the governing Progressive Conservatives now led by Premier Blaine Higgs. The former business leader and one-time adviser to former premier Brian Gallant pitched herself as someone who would bring a fresh approach to politics, a theme she repeated in her victory speech. \"The people of New Brunswick have told us they are tired of politics as usual. They are tired of the conflict and the fighting. They are tired of partisanship,\" she said. \"They want to see something different. We can be the party that leads a change for a new politics in New Brunswick that is transparent, authentic, empathetic and collaborative.\" Holt's 'fresh' message woos Liberals, but is it a winning pitch? New Brunswick Liberals set to choose new party leader In part, Holt's victory was based on being the second or third choice of two of the other candidates. The party used preferential balloting,\u00a0meaning members voting over the past week ranked their first, second, third and fourth choices for leader. In order for a winner to be decided, a candidate needed 50 per cent of the vote. Holt is embraced by former deputy premier Ald\u00e9a Landry after winning the leadership. (Jacques Poitras\/CBC) Former cabinet minister Donald Arseneault\u00a0and current MLA Robert Gauvin\u00a0were the others on the ballot. During the first round of balloting, Harvey had 33.9 per cent, Holt had 32.12 per cent, Gauvin had 19.76 per cent and Arseneault had 14.22 per cent of the points awarded in the party's weighted voting system. Arseneault was dropped off the ballot and the votes were redistributed. Harvey polled 39.58 per cent in the second vote while Holt had 36.76 per cent and Gauvin\u00a0had 23.67 per cent. Gauvin\u00a0fell off the ballot. Bold Change Starts Now!<br> <br>I\u2019m humbled to have earned your trust to lead the Liberal Party of New Brunswick. I\u2019ve been loud and clear that I want to change the way we do politics. And I\u2019m so grateful that you do too. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/JM2jcwJl7g\">pic.twitter.com\/JM2jcwJl7g<\/a> &mdash; @susanholt Holt said she had \"a lot of conversations\" with people who chose Gauvin or Arseneault first, but who were also interested in her as a potential leader. Harvey non-commital Harvey said despite his defeat, he was optimistic about Liberal prospects, though he wouldn't commit to being a candidate in the next election. \"Certainly it's not the outcome that we had hoped for,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we're all still a family and I think it's been really healthy for the party.\" Harvey said his support over the first two rounds was around where his team thought it would be, but with two candidates eliminated at that point\u00a0\"it's really difficult to estimate where you think third-ballot support could go.\" University of Moncton political scientist Roger Ouellette said Holt's victory was a watershed moment for the Liberals. Saint John MLA Shirley Dysart briefly led the party as interim leader in 1985 but Saturday's result is the first time party members have elected a woman to the role. \"Maybe we'll see after the next general election that we'll have another first with a female as premier,\" Ouellette\u00a0said.

Introducing opening-night entry \u201cThe Swimmers\u201d at the Princess of Wales Theatre, TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey addressed the two pandemic years that disrupted everything. \u201cIt was artists, storytellers, filmmakers, who were finding ways to move us, inspire us, to remind us what we\u2019re living for,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to thank you, the best movie audience in the world, for being part of this experience again.\u201d That experience takes many forms. The festival is a beacon for awards-season titles as well as red-carpet galas, documentaries, genre films, and international cinema. It\u2019s also a snapshot of how the industry views commercial movies at a most fragile moment. Related Stories \u2018Wednesday\u2019 Season 2 Teaser: Jenna Ortega Returns to Nevermore Academy \u2018Bet\u2019 Trailer: Netflix Gambles on a Live-Action Manga Adaptation This Spring Netflix launched \u201cThe Swimmers,\u201d the rousing-but-familiar true story of sisters Yusra and Sara Mardini (Nathalie and Manal Issa) who fled Syria for Europe while retaining their dreams of becoming Olympic athletes. Popular on IndieWire Directed by Sally El Hosaini, the movie works as a wholesome crowdpleaser unlikely to crack the awards conversation. The streamer\u2019s awards team can sit back and let \u201cThe Swimmers\u201d perform well on Netflix, where audiences looking for easy viewing will likely embrace it worldwide. It falls in line with TIFF openers like Magnolia\u2019s \u201cOnce Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band,\u201d or Netflix\u2019s \u201cOutlaw King\u201d and \u201cBorg McEnroe\u201d \u2014 audience-friendly movies with moderate commercial potential. Netflix, which brings eight films to TIFF this year ranging from \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d to animated \u201cWendell and Wild\u201d and the Eddie Redmayne and Jessica Chastain thriller \u201cThe Good Nurse,\u201d arrives at the festival with a slate more attuned to general audiences than Academy members. \u201cThe Swimmers\u201d Laura Radford\/Netflix Meanwhile, A24 launched its gay military drama \u201cThe Inspection\u201d in a late-evening slot designed to designate the movie as a hidden gem, but it has big plans. The touching and personable first feature of writer-director Elegance Bratton follows the experience of a 25-year-old Black man named Ellis (Jeremy Pope) who decides to enlist in the Marines after his mother (Gabrielle Union) kicks him out for being gay. The bulk of the movie takes place at a Mississippi boot camp overseen by a crude unit commander (Bokeem Woodbine) as Ellis develops an ill-fated attraction to his drill instructor (Ra\u00fal Castillo, in top form). Bratton, who previously directed the documentary \u201cPier Kids,\u201d about homeless youth in New York City, based his first narrative feature on his own experiences as an active-duty soldier from 2005-2010; the movie is dedicated to his estranged mother and unfolds in the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d era of the U.S. military. Nevertheless, \u201cThe Inspection\u201d is less a coming-out than a coming-in story: Ellis never wavers from expressing his sexuality as the men in his unit make peace with it to varying degrees. \u201cMoonlight\u201d meets \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d Bratton\u2019s script is sometimes disarmingly funny. Pope, best known for his Broadway roles, could be a dark horse in the Best Actor race, but the biggest opportunity lies with Union, whose own father was a drill sergeant. The actress delivers a passionate and conflicted turn as Ellis\u2019 mother in a handful of scenes. While the Best Supporting Actress race has gotten competitive (mostly thanks to \u201cWomen Talking\u201d), enthusiasm for the \u201cBring It On\u201d star could help propel a campaign for her to finally be recognized. To even consider that possibility, A24 needs this small-scale movie to build a much bigger profile. Behind the scenes, it boasts Gamechanger Films\u2019 Effie T. Brown (\u201cReal Women Have Curves\u201d), who brought the project to A24 last year, and the company appears to be betting on an underexploited market. Sources tell me the recent trailer tested equally well in red and blue states, while some early screenings for gay members of the military showed promising results. The company is betting on an expansive demographic of veterans eager to revisit an aspect of the armed services that has never been shown, while also serving the same Black audiences that got excited by the representational strides of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \u201cThe Inspection\u201d A24 Bratton is an excellent steward of the cause. The director teared up during the Q&A, dedicating his movie to \u201call the people that feel forgotten, to remember that you matter.\u201d That\u2019s a powerful message likely to get an even louder platform when the movie closes NYFF next month. And then there was Apple , which premiered its documentary \u201cLouis Armstrong\u2019s Black & Blue,\u201d an absorbing collage-like overview of the musician\u2019s personal audio diaries where he recorded the personal viewpoints he hid from public life. Director Sacha Jenkins pairs this material with an array of archival footage and talking heads to interrogate Armstrong\u2019s conflicting identities as a socially conscious man and apolitical performer. At a time when few documentaries have shown commercial potential at the box office, Apple is well positioned to take advantage of the festival platform to draw attention to the streaming launch. The movie could have some awards momentum in the documentary race, as high-profile music documentaries often do, but that field is already competitive. For \u201cLouis Armstrong\u2019s Black & Blue\u201d to succeed, it just has to make a little noise at TIFF, then snake its way to AppleTV+.

Pierre Poilievre is the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, securing victory on the first ballot after a record-setting and divisive leadership campaign. After a seven-month campaign, the long-time MP and former cabinet minister from Ontario won the election decisively, securing 22,993 of the just under 33,800 electoral points up for grabs. Poilievre secured support across the country, coming in as members' first choice in almost every riding. \u201cTonight begins the journey to replace an old government that costs you more and delivers you less, with a new government that puts you first, your paycheck, your retirement, your home, your country,\u201d Poilievre said in his first speech as leader on Saturday evening from the Ottawa convention centre floor where the leadership announcement was held. Receiving 68.15 per cent of the vote, Poilievre far outpaced his progressive Conservative rival and runner up Jean Charest's 16.07 per cent of the vote. Social conservative and MP Leslyn Lewis placed third, with 9.69 per cent of the vote. Former Ontario MPP Roman Baber placed fourth, with 5.03 per cent of the vote, and mayor-turned-MP Scott Aitchison finished last with 1.06 per cent of the vote. The unveiling of results of the mail-in ballot election was done in a more pared-down way than initially planned, on account for the country being in an official mourning period given the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A moment of silence and tribute was held before Poilievre was named the winner. While the party aimed to hold a subdued event, pulling the plug on confetti cannons, the crowd of approximately 1,000 erupted into cheers and some chants of \"freedom,\" when the results were announced. After Poilievre was cheered up onto the stage, he started his remarks with a message of condolence. \"I feel a small catch in my throat when I utter the words that no leader has stated in this country for over seven decades, God Save the King,\" he said. One of the main questions heading into this evening was whether Poilievre was able to take it on the first ballot, a feat last achieved by former prime minister Stephen Harper in 2004. Ahead of the results, Charest\u2019s camp indicated they still felt they had a path to victory, though touting the Poilievre's campaign\u2019s statistics, top adviser Jenni Byrne said they were feeling \"pretty good.\u201d The results were calculated in points , with up to 100 points allocated to each of the 338 ridings. Ultimately there were 33,737 points up for grabs after the verification process was complete, making the threshold needed to win 50 per cent plus one: 16,869, a metric Poilievre considerably exceeded. In an attempt to avoid the considerable delays seen in the party's 2020 race due to a mechanical issue that resulted in thousands of ballots being damaged upon opening, result tabulations began on Saturday. Still, the results were delayed approximately half an hour from what the party had initially planned. In his speech\u2014his first opportunity to signal the direction the party is heading and set the tone for his tenure\u2014 Poilievre took the opportunity to outline some of his main commitments, and made a point of thanking each one of his opponents' for their contributions to the party, and the country. \"To supporters of all of these fine candidates I open up my arms to you. Now, today, we are one party serving one country,\" he said. Reacting to the results, Charest thanked his supporters and said he was proud of the campaign they ran, but signalled that Poilievre should be granted a \"clean slate\" opportunity to unite the party. \"We still have a critical role to play in shaping our forward-looking policy agenda and attracting new voters to the Conservative Party. I will have more to say tomorrow,\" he tweeted. Despite his efforts to extend an olive branch to the progressives in the party, don't expect Poilievre to take a more moderate approach post-campaign. \u201cWhat you see is what you get,\u201d said Byrne. \"What you should expect to hear from Pierre is exactly what he's talking about. But it's going to be predominantly on the issues that Canadians care about, and right now the economy is the number one issue.\" Poilievre made the pitch Saturday night for a government that offers Canadians hope. \"There are people in this country who are just hanging on by a thread... They don't need a government to run their lives, they need a government that can run a passport office,\" Poilievre said to cheers. \"They need a prime minister who hears them, and offers them hope that they can again afford to buy a home, a car, pay their bills, afford food, have a secure retirement, and god forbid even achieve their dreams if they work hard. They need a prime minister who will restore that hope, and I will be that prime minister.\" After opting out of running in the 2020 race citing his family life, Poilievre came into this campaign at full force, framing his race as a run for prime minister, and one that would champion \"personal freedom.\" His introductory campaign video promising to \"give you back control of your life\" has amassed 4.9 million views since it was posted in February. With a strong team of experienced Conservatives behind him, Poilievre outpaced the other leadership candidates when it came to membership sign-ups and fundraising, raking in millions more dollars, and from a larger donor pool than any of his opponents. The long-time Ottawa-area MP\u2014he was first elected federally in 2004\u2014 has been connected to conservative politics from a young age. At 43 now, Poilievre has built a reputation on Parliament Hill as a bit of a firebrand, not hesitant to say what he thinks. While he was given the nickname \"skippy,\" a descriptor that may better fit now is \"scrappy\" as he's not one to back away from a policy debate or pull punches when it comes to calling out his opponents. Poilievre met his wife Anaida working in politics and the pair eloped in Portugal in late 2017, together they have two children, Valentina and Cruz. Anaida Poilievre, wife of Conservative Party leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre, touches his chin as they listen to speeches at the Conservative Party of Canada leadership vote, in Ottawa, on Saturday, Sept. 10, 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESS\/Justin Tang During the leadership campaign it was not uncommon to see Anaida by his side, and Saturday evening was no different. Introducing her husband as Canada's next prime minister, she also took the opportunity to introduce herself, sharing some personal family history, in both official languages. Poilievre and his family currently live in Greely, a suburban-rural neighbourhood 30 minutes from Parliament Hill. Poilievre, who was born to a teenage mother in Calgary, was adopted by schoolteachers from Saskatchewan, went on to graduate from the University of Calgary with a degree in international relations, and a keen interest in conservative activism. Once Stephen Harper's Conservative government came to power in 2006, Poilievre held a series of parliamentary secretary and junior minister roles. He then became a key critic of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government, from his seat in the Official Opposition benches. In this race, Poilievre attracted large crowds across the country, with supporters appearing to resonate with his affordability-focused and unapologetic, populist message of \"taking back control\" from \"gatekeepers.\" According to his campaign, Poilievre held 80 events across the country that 93,000 people RSVP'd to, ultimately signing up more than 300,000 members. A key messaging tool used by Poilievre\u2014who rarely participated in interviews or answered journalists' questions throughout the race\u2014were social media videos featuring him speaking directly into the camera in various scenarios. In the videos he'd fixate on one issue, offering his perspective on housing, or the price of food, for example, making a case for why the current government is failing and what he'd do differently. His platform included promises to get rid of the carbon tax, lift COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and fire the governor of the Bank of Canada. He said he would phase out \u201cinflationary deficits\u201d by culling spending and reversing Liberal policies and programs. Poilievre has also championed cryptocurrency, and supported the \u201cFreedom Convoy,\" a pair of positions that were condemned by some of his opponents as well as members from other parties. A key moment for Poilievre's campaign was when Harper endorsed Poilievre. In a video released on Twitter, the former prime minister said Poilievre has made the \u201cstrongest case\u201d for being able to bring in new party members and win the next general election. Harper didn't offer candidate endorsements in the preceding two leadership races that saw Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole take on the party's top job. While he took part in the first two official party debates, Poilievre came under fire when he decided to skip a third event organized by the party in the aftermath of Patrick Brown's disqualification. When Brown was removed from the race, his campaign quickly accused the Conservative Party of acting in Poilievre's favour. Brown claimed Poilievre's supporters were behind his ouster, something the party has ardently denied. The campaign began after O\u2019Toole resigned in February following considerable infighting in the aftermath of his unsuccessful 2021 federal election campaign. Appearing via video message on Saturday, O'Toole said the party has to put Canadian unity first, because pandemic-exacerbated frustrations are eroding trust, and damaging democratic institutions. \"The Conservative Party needs to be compassionate, because Canadians need to be heard and need to be understood more than ever before. And the Conservative Party needs to be strong\u2014 not with the strength to overpower our rivals\u2014but with the strength of character needed to carry those in need or those who are losing faith in our country,\" he said. The race\u2014the party's third in the last six years\u2014 was largely seen as a 'battle for the soul of the party' and a result, the campaign has had no shortage of attacks as candidates pitched themselves\u2014through rallies and on debate stages\u2014as the best placed person to lead. The attacks throughout the race were largely exchanged between Charest and Poilievre. Charest suggested that his convoy-supporting opponent was unfit to lead , while Poilievre accused his rival of being a Liberal in blue clothing. As the race rolled to a close, prominent Conservatives have emphasized the need for the membership to come together once the winner is named, and focus on defeating the Liberals rather than post-leadership unity questions. \"This is Canadian political history. No other political party has had this many members and no other political party has had more than 400,000 Canadians vote in a leadership election. What it tells me as president is that the Conservative Party is growing. It tells me that there is a desire among Canadians for a change in government, and that changing government, in many ways starts tonight,\" said Conservative Party President Rob Batherson on Saturday night. Ahead of the results, Charest campaign co-chair Tasha Kheiriddin said that the most important thing regardless of who won, \"the most important thing\" is whoever the party elects, has to take the party forward in a united way. \"The biggest challenge is to make people feel welcome and to make them understand that they have a place at the table... It's going to be a case of also I think, letting go of some of the things that people are turned off by,\" she said. \"I'm watching for a sign that we're going to look for what unites us and what is in common as opposed to some of the things that have divided. Whoever becomes leader that's what they have to build on because otherwise we will never beat Justin Trudeau,\" said Kheiriddin. On this, Byrne and Kheiriddin agree. Byrne said she's confident members\u2014new and old\u2014will unite behind the new leader, and dismissed suggestions this campaign was any more divisive than previous races. \"The modern Conservative party is a party of coalition. It's a party of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, democratic reformers. And that coalition has changed,\" she said. Poilievre will be talking the helm of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition 10 days before the fall sitting of Parliament will begin. In an early indication of the fight ahead, long-time Liberal MP and cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc\u2014 attending Saturday's event, he said, to congratulate the winner\u2014questioned Poilievre's sincerity. \"What we've seen in his leadership campaign is a series of reckless and irresponsible ideas that we don't think will improve the Canadian economy,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cSomebody who's telling people to buy Bitcoin, somebody who's calling childcare agreements 'slush funds,' doesn't feel like somebody who's serious about big issues around affordability, around the economy.\u201d It's possible one of Poilievre's first acts as Opposition leader could be attending Queen Elizabeth II's funeral as part of the Canadian delegation. Once the political season does get underway, CTV Political Commentator Tom Mulcair is predicting some eventful question periods. \"This guy is not going to hold back. But at the same time, he knows that he's got to present a very straight face to Canadian voters\u2026 And I think that that's what Poilievre is going to have to work on,\" Mulcair said. \"We've been told nonstop that the party had big fractures in it. Now Poilievre gets to really play a good strong hand.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says federal health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos was right in saying there is 'still lots of work to do' before reaching a deal with the provinces for increased health-care funding, but that he's 'confident' that the two levels of government will get there. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sat down with CTV National News Chief News Anchor and Senior Editor Omar Sachedina for a year-end interview to reflect on the political shifts experienced in 2022, and to contemplate the challenges ahead in 2023. Here is a full transcript of the interview. After six weeks, more than 70 witnesses, and the submission of more than 7,000 documents into evidence, the public hearing portion of the Public Order Emergency Commission wrapped up on Friday.

Manitoba will be closing non-essential government services and offices for the day on Monday, but schools and child-care facilities will remain open and function as usual. \u201cI encourage all Manitobans to take a moment to reflect on Her late Majesty\u2019s special relationship with our province and her countless contributions to our country and the entire Commonwealth,\u201d Premier Heather Stefanson said in a press release Tuesday. \u201cQueen Elizabeth II had a remarkable reign and an unwavering commitment to service and duty. May she rest in peace.\u201d The release added that schools are encouraged to observe a moment of silence on Monday, and that a 21-gun salute will occur on the south grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building at the same time as the memorial service in Ottawa. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney's office said Monday will be a day of mourning in the province, but will not be a holiday. Businesses and schools will stay open on Sept. 19. Yukon says it will join the federal government and other provinces observing a national day of mourning on the day of the Queen's funeral with a one-time holiday for public-sector employees. Public schools and other public-facing services will be closed. The Northwest Territories is not marking the day with a holiday, while the government of Nunavut has not yet said whether the day will be a holiday for its residents. \u201cWe will be working with the provinces and the territories to try and see that we\u2019re aligned on this,\u201d Trudeau said at a news conference in New Brunswick Tuesday. \u201cThere are still a few details to be worked out, but declaring an opportunity for Canadians to mourn on Monday is going to be important.\u201d \u201cSo for our part, we will be letting federal employees know that Monday will be a day of mourning,\u201d he added. Meanwhile the Canadian Federation of Independent Business is asking the provinces not to make Monday a statutory holiday, because it would be \u201cdeeply unfair for small businesses\u201d under such short notice. \u201cSmall businesses are already struggling with labour shortages and requiring them to close or pay time and a half to their employees with no notice would be extremely costly or result in a day\u2019s lost productivity,\u201d wrote CFIB president Dan Kelly in a release issued Tuesday. CTVNews.ca has asked the Privy Council Office whether Sept. 19 will be a recurring federal holiday, or whether it\u2019ll be a one-off for the Queen\u2019s state funeral and other commemorative events, and has not yet received a response. Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon are both set to travel to the U.K. for the funeral, but the prime minister said details of who will be joining them are still being sorted. He said the federal government has been in discussions with the government of the United Kingdom and Opposition leaders\u2019 offices to decide who will make up the delegation of Canadian officials. Other Commonwealth countries have already announced holidays to commemorate the Queen\u2019s passing: the United Kingdom will have a bank holiday Monday for the funeral, marking the final day of the 10 days of mourning, and Australia and New Zealand will have public holidays on Sept. 22 and 26 respectively. Canada is still in the midst of its official mourning period for the country\u2019s longest-reigning monarch, with several commemorative events planned in Ottawa following the funeral on Monday. There will be an invite-only commemorative service at Christ Church Cathedral, with government officials, dignitaries and other guests, as well as a parade with the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP, a 96-gun salute, and a CF-18 fighter jet fly-by. Members of Parliament will return to Ottawa ahead of schedule for a \"special session\" to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, on Thursday, Sept. 15. This special House of Commons recall comes ahead of the opening of the fall sitting, which has been delayed by one day, to Sept. 20 to accommodate the funeral and Canadian commemorations taking place.

Pierre Poilievre is the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, securing victory on the first ballot after a record-setting and divisive leadership campaign. After a seven-month campaign, the long-time MP and former cabinet minister from Ontario won the election decisively, securing 22,993 of the just under 33,800 electoral points up for grabs. Poilievre secured support across the country, coming in as members' first choice in almost every riding. \u201cTonight begins the journey to replace an old government that costs you more and delivers you less, with a new government that puts you first, your paycheck, your retirement, your home, your country,\u201d Poilievre said in his first speech as leader on Saturday evening from the Ottawa convention centre floor where the leadership announcement was held. Receiving 68.15 per cent of the vote, Poilievre far outpaced his progressive Conservative rival and runner up Jean Charest's 16.07 per cent of the vote. Social conservative and MP Leslyn Lewis placed third, with 9.69 per cent of the vote. Former Ontario MPP Roman Baber placed fourth, with 5.03 per cent of the vote, and mayor-turned-MP Scott Aitchison finished last with 1.06 per cent of the vote. The unveiling of results of the mail-in ballot election was done in a more pared-down way than initially planned, on account for the country being in an official mourning period given the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A moment of silence and tribute was held before Poilievre was named the winner. While the party aimed to hold a subdued event, pulling the plug on confetti cannons, the crowd of approximately 1,000 erupted into cheers and some chants of \"freedom,\" when the results were announced. After Poilievre was cheered up onto the stage, he started his remarks with a message of condolence. \"I feel a small catch in my throat when I utter the words that no leader has stated in this country for over seven decades, God Save the King,\" he said. One of the main questions heading into this evening was whether Poilievre was able to take it on the first ballot, a feat last achieved by former prime minister Stephen Harper in 2004. Ahead of the results, Charest\u2019s camp indicated they still felt they had a path to victory, though touting the Poilievre's campaign\u2019s statistics, top adviser Jenni Byrne said they were feeling \"pretty good.\u201d The results were calculated in points , with up to 100 points allocated to each of the 338 ridings. Ultimately there were 33,737 points up for grabs after the verification process was complete, making the threshold needed to win 50 per cent plus one: 16,869, a metric Poilievre considerably exceeded. In an attempt to avoid the considerable delays seen in the party's 2020 race due to a mechanical issue that resulted in thousands of ballots being damaged upon opening, result tabulations began on Saturday. Still, the results were delayed approximately half an hour from what the party had initially planned. In his speech\u2014his first opportunity to signal the direction the party is heading and set the tone for his tenure\u2014 Poilievre took the opportunity to outline some of his main commitments, and made a point of thanking each one of his opponents' for their contributions to the party, and the country. \"To supporters of all of these fine candidates I open up my arms to you. Now, today, we are one party serving one country,\" he said. Reacting to the results, Charest thanked his supporters and said he was proud of the campaign they ran, but signalled that Poilievre should be granted a \"clean slate\" opportunity to unite the party. \"We still have a critical role to play in shaping our forward-looking policy agenda and attracting new voters to the Conservative Party. I will have more to say tomorrow,\" he tweeted. Despite his efforts to extend an olive branch to the progressives in the party, don't expect Poilievre to take a more moderate approach post-campaign. \u201cWhat you see is what you get,\u201d said Byrne. \"What you should expect to hear from Pierre is exactly what he's talking about. But it's going to be predominantly on the issues that Canadians care about, and right now the economy is the number one issue.\" Poilievre made the pitch Saturday night for a government that offers Canadians hope. \"There are people in this country who are just hanging on by a thread... They don't need a government to run their lives, they need a government that can run a passport office,\" Poilievre said to cheers. \"They need a prime minister who hears them, and offers them hope that they can again afford to buy a home, a car, pay their bills, afford food, have a secure retirement, and god forbid even achieve their dreams if they work hard. They need a prime minister who will restore that hope, and I will be that prime minister.\" After opting out of running in the 2020 race citing his family life, Poilievre came into this campaign at full force, framing his race as a run for prime minister, and one that would champion \"personal freedom.\" His introductory campaign video promising to \"give you back control of your life\" has amassed 4.9 million views since it was posted in February. With a strong team of experienced Conservatives behind him, Poilievre outpaced the other leadership candidates when it came to membership sign-ups and fundraising, raking in millions more dollars, and from a larger donor pool than any of his opponents. The long-time Ottawa-area MP\u2014he was first elected federally in 2004\u2014 has been connected to conservative politics from a young age. At 43 now, Poilievre has built a reputation on Parliament Hill as a bit of a firebrand, not hesitant to say what he thinks. While he was given the nickname \"skippy,\" a descriptor that may better fit now is \"scrappy\" as he's not one to back away from a policy debate or pull punches when it comes to calling out his opponents. Poilievre met his wife Anaida working in politics and the pair eloped in Portugal in late 2017, together they have two children, Valentina and Cruz. Anaida Poilievre, wife of Conservative Party leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre, touches his chin as they listen to speeches at the Conservative Party of Canada leadership vote, in Ottawa, on Saturday, Sept. 10, 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESS\/Justin Tang During the leadership campaign it was not uncommon to see Anaida by his side, and Saturday evening was no different. Introducing her husband as Canada's next prime minister, she also took the opportunity to introduce herself, sharing some personal family history, in both official languages. Poilievre and his family currently live in Greely, a suburban-rural neighbourhood 30 minutes from Parliament Hill. Poilievre, who was born to a teenage mother in Calgary, was adopted by schoolteachers from Saskatchewan, went on to graduate from the University of Calgary with a degree in international relations, and a keen interest in conservative activism. Once Stephen Harper's Conservative government came to power in 2006, Poilievre held a series of parliamentary secretary and junior minister roles. He then became a key critic of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government, from his seat in the Official Opposition benches. In this race, Poilievre attracted large crowds across the country, with supporters appearing to resonate with his affordability-focused and unapologetic, populist message of \"taking back control\" from \"gatekeepers.\" According to his campaign, Poilievre held 80 events across the country that 93,000 people RSVP'd to, ultimately signing up more than 300,000 members. A key messaging tool used by Poilievre\u2014who rarely participated in interviews or answered journalists' questions throughout the race\u2014were social media videos featuring him speaking directly into the camera in various scenarios. In the videos he'd fixate on one issue, offering his perspective on housing, or the price of food, for example, making a case for why the current government is failing and what he'd do differently. His platform included promises to get rid of the carbon tax, lift COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and fire the governor of the Bank of Canada. He said he would phase out \u201cinflationary deficits\u201d by culling spending and reversing Liberal policies and programs. Poilievre has also championed cryptocurrency, and supported the \u201cFreedom Convoy,\" a pair of positions that were condemned by some of his opponents as well as members from other parties. A key moment for Poilievre's campaign was when Harper endorsed Poilievre. In a video released on Twitter, the former prime minister said Poilievre has made the \u201cstrongest case\u201d for being able to bring in new party members and win the next general election. Harper didn't offer candidate endorsements in the preceding two leadership races that saw Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole take on the party's top job. While he took part in the first two official party debates, Poilievre came under fire when he decided to skip a third event organized by the party in the aftermath of Patrick Brown's disqualification. When Brown was removed from the race, his campaign quickly accused the Conservative Party of acting in Poilievre's favour. Brown claimed Poilievre's supporters were behind his ouster, something the party has ardently denied. The campaign began after O\u2019Toole resigned in February following considerable infighting in the aftermath of his unsuccessful 2021 federal election campaign. Appearing via video message on Saturday, O'Toole said the party has to put Canadian unity first, because pandemic-exacerbated frustrations are eroding trust, and damaging democratic institutions. \"The Conservative Party needs to be compassionate, because Canadians need to be heard and need to be understood more than ever before. And the Conservative Party needs to be strong\u2014 not with the strength to overpower our rivals\u2014but with the strength of character needed to carry those in need or those who are losing faith in our country,\" he said. The race\u2014the party's third in the last six years\u2014 was largely seen as a 'battle for the soul of the party' and a result, the campaign has had no shortage of attacks as candidates pitched themselves\u2014through rallies and on debate stages\u2014as the best placed person to lead. The attacks throughout the race were largely exchanged between Charest and Poilievre. Charest suggested that his convoy-supporting opponent was unfit to lead , while Poilievre accused his rival of being a Liberal in blue clothing. As the race rolled to a close, prominent Conservatives have emphasized the need for the membership to come together once the winner is named, and focus on defeating the Liberals rather than post-leadership unity questions. \"This is Canadian political history. No other political party has had this many members and no other political party has had more than 400,000 Canadians vote in a leadership election. What it tells me as president is that the Conservative Party is growing. It tells me that there is a desire among Canadians for a change in government, and that changing government, in many ways starts tonight,\" said Conservative Party President Rob Batherson on Saturday night. Ahead of the results, Charest campaign co-chair Tasha Kheiriddin said that the most important thing regardless of who won, \"the most important thing\" is whoever the party elects, has to take the party forward in a united way. \"The biggest challenge is to make people feel welcome and to make them understand that they have a place at the table... It's going to be a case of also I think, letting go of some of the things that people are turned off by,\" she said. \"I'm watching for a sign that we're going to look for what unites us and what is in common as opposed to some of the things that have divided. Whoever becomes leader that's what they have to build on because otherwise we will never beat Justin Trudeau,\" said Kheiriddin. On this, Byrne and Kheiriddin agree. Byrne said she's confident members\u2014new and old\u2014will unite behind the new leader, and dismissed suggestions this campaign was any more divisive than previous races. \"The modern Conservative party is a party of coalition. It's a party of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, democratic reformers. And that coalition has changed,\" she said. Poilievre will be talking the helm of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition 10 days before the fall sitting of Parliament will begin. In an early indication of the fight ahead, long-time Liberal MP and cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc\u2014 attending Saturday's event, he said, to congratulate the winner\u2014questioned Poilievre's sincerity. \"What we've seen in his leadership campaign is a series of reckless and irresponsible ideas that we don't think will improve the Canadian economy,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cSomebody who's telling people to buy Bitcoin, somebody who's calling childcare agreements 'slush funds,' doesn't feel like somebody who's serious about big issues around affordability, around the economy.\u201d It's possible one of Poilievre's first acts as Opposition leader could be attending Queen Elizabeth II's funeral as part of the Canadian delegation. Once the political season does get underway, CTV Political Commentator Tom Mulcair is predicting some eventful question periods. \"This guy is not going to hold back.

Social Sharing Patron also ordered by Sask. judge not to post about Jewish people for 1 year after sentence Dan Zakreski \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Oct 20, 2022 5:54 PM EDT | Last Updated: October 20, 2022 A still from a video featuring Travis Patron, leader of the Canadian Nationalist Party, which became the subject of an RCMP investigation in 2019. (Nationalist.ca) Warning: This story contains offensive language. A Court of King's Bench judge in Estevan, Sask., has sentenced former Canadian Nationalist Party\u00a0leader Travis Patron to one year in jail for willfully promoting hatred against Jewish people. He\u00a0must also refrain from posting about Jewish people for a year after his sentence ends, Justice Neil Robertson's Thursday sentencing decision said. Patron, who founded the now-defunct federal party that\u00a0promoted anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ views\u00a0in 2019, was found guilty\u00a0at trial earlier this month after a jury deliberated\u00a0for about an hour. Thursday's\u00a0sentencing ends a saga that began when RCMP began an investigation into\u00a0an online video featuring Patron in 2019. Sask. former leader of Canadian Nationalist Party found guilty of hate speech against Jewish people The video shows Patron, who is from Redvers, Sask., denouncing what he described as \"the parasitic tribe\" who\u00a0he claimed control the media and Canada's central bank. \"What we need to do, perhaps more than anything, is remove these people once and for all from our country,\" Patron said in the video,\u00a0speaking directly to the camera. He was charged with wilfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group in February 2021. Jaime Kirzner-Roberts, policy director at the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said it's troubling that it took three years from the start of the investigation to resolve the case. \"What is really concerning about this case is how long it took, from that first moment when I saw Patron's material several years ago and first reached out to RCMP in Saskatchewan with our concerns, until today,\" she said Thursday. Kirzner-Roberts said the Canadian Jewish human rights organization is pleased with the judge's sentence. Outside court on Thursday, Crown prosecutor Ryan Snyder said it's important to take individuals to task for\u00a0online postings like Patron's. \"We're only dealing with\u00a0words but it does have an impact on people,\" he said. Patron will get credit for time served in custody. He has a little more than five months remaining on his sentence. He has been in custody since March 2021, after an unrelated disturbance at the legion hall in Redvers, Sask. Earlier this year, another jury found Patron guilty of assaulting two women in Regina in November 2019. In August, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, because he received 1.5 days of time served credit for each of the 390 days he spent in custody, the sentence was considered served.

Justin Tang\/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account Voters in Ontario went to the polls Monday to elect new municipal governments and school boards for the next four years. There were open races for the mayor\u2019s chair in several of Ontario\u2019s largest cities, including the nation\u2019s capital, with long-time incumbents not standing for re-election. Two of these races featured former leaders of Ontario political parties who resigned from their posts in June after their parties were defeated by Doug Ford\u2019s Progressive Conservatives in the provincial election. Here is a look at early results of some of the major mayoral races across the province. John Tory wins third term as mayor in Toronto municipal election Ottawa The mayor\u2019s chair in Canada\u2019s capital was left open with the departure of Jim Watson, who chose not to run for re-election after serving in the role since 2010. (The last municipal election without an incumbent in Ontario\u2019s second-largest city was 2000.) After a hard-fought campaign, entrepreneur and former journalist Mark Sutcliffe, who talked up fiscal restraint and criticized bike lanes, handily defeated two-term councillor Catherine McKenney, who had won endorsements from a long list of progressives. In early returns, Mr. Sutcliffe had won 51 per cent of the vote, with Mx. McKenney at 38 per cent. The two front-runners were close in the polls throughout the race, which focused on housing issues and city spending plans. The campaign played out at the same time as a public inquiry into the use of the Emergencies Act amid the convoy protests in Ottawa last winter. Bob Chiarelli, past mayor and former Ottawa MPP, was a distant third. Brampton Incumbent Patrick Brown secured a second term as mayor of the Peel city with a large victory, despite a turbulent first term riddled with controversies, including allegations of misappropriating funds and an audit that found an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d was given to select companies during a study to bring a university to Brampton. It was a high-profile race with challenger Nikki Kaur, a city planning director, who gained the support of former mayor Linda Jeffrey and former councillors. She was also supported by conservative strategist Nick Kouvalis, who has served as an adviser to Premier Doug Ford. Ms. Kaur finished in second place with about 25 per cent of the vote. Mr. Brown had intended to run for the leadership of the federal Conservative Party but was disqualified from the race as the party found a worker was being paid for by a corporation, which is illegal under federal election laws. Two weeks after his removal from the race, Mr. Brown said he would run for re-election in Brampton. In the neighbouring Peel city of Mississauga, Bonnie Crombie handily won a third term as mayor. Hamilton Long-time provincial NDP leader Andrea Horwath will succeed outgoing mayor Fred Eisenberger and become the first woman elected as mayor of the southern Ontario city. Ms. Horwath, who resigned her provincial post in August to run for mayor of her hometown, defeated former Hamilton Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Keanin Loomis in a tight race, separated by roughly one per cent of the vote. Bob Bratina, mayor of Hamilton from 2010 to 2014 and a Liberal MP representing Hamilton East-Stoney Creek from 2015 until 2021 finished a distant third. Ms. Horwath resigned as leader of the Ontario NDP, which she steered since 2009, after her party maintained Official Opposition status in the June election, but lost nine seats. Before entering provincial politics, Ms. Horwath served on Hamilton City Council for seven years. Vaughan Past Ontario Liberal leader Steven Del Duca will make the jump to municipal politics, eking out a victory over five-term councillor Sandra Yeung Racco by less than 1,000 votes in Vaughan\u2019s open mayoral race. After serving as transportation minister in Kathleen Wynne\u2019s Liberal government, Mr. Del Duca lost races in the riding of Vaughan-Woodbridge in two consecutive provincial elections, including as leader this June, prompting him to resign from his post. Outgoing mayor and former Liberal MP Maurizio Bevilacqua, who had led the city north of Toronto since 2010, had endorsed Mr. Del Duca in the race. Thunder Bay Ken Boshcoff, who previously served as mayor from 1997 to 2003 and subsequently served two terms as MP for the region, won the election in the northern Ontario community. Mr. Boshcoff will need to navigate the challenges plaguing Thunder Bay\u2019s police service, which has faced many human-rights complaints, misconduct allegations and external investigations, some pertaining to its treatment of the city\u2019s large Indigenous community. Thunder Bay Police Chief Sylvie Hauth was suspended in June and the board is currently being overseen by a provincial administrator. There were five candidates in the race, including Gary Mack, who placed second, and Peng You, who just completed a term as an at-large city councillor and placed third.

(CBC - image credit) Dominic Cardy has resigned as New Brunswick's minister of education and early childhood development. Cardy announced in a tweet that he was quitting the cabinet of Premier Blaine Higgs but would stay on as a Progressive Conservative MLA for Fredericton West-Hanwell. In a scorching resignation letter to Higgs, Cardy slammed the premier's leadership style, saying \"change requires care, not a wrecking ball\" and some reforms to French second-language education \"will stall because of your micromanagement.\" \"You cannot change deadlines on large systems based on your emotional state, without undermining the quality of the work, or the morale of your team,\" the letter said. ADVERTISEMENT \"Government is not the same as building oil tankers,\" Cardy wrote, apparently referring to the premier's previous career with Irving Oil. He also accuses Higgs of \"choosing to yell 'data my ass' at a senior civil servant\" because he didn't like what the department's numbers showed. Shane Fowler\/CBC \"That was the end of your political project in my eyes: If you reject evidence because you dislike it then you don't believe in evidence,\" he wrote. Cardy also said Higgs's abolition of partly elected regional health authority boards represented \"a steady consolidation of power in your hands\" and that he was trying to delay or undermine reconciliation between language communities and with Indigenous people. Higgs told reporters he was \"disappointed\" with the letter and what he calls its \"hurtful\" comments. But he confirmed he did say \"data my ass\" when Cardy and his department presented him with what he considered \"irrelevant\" numbers on French second-language education. ADVERTISEMENT \"Yes, I did,\" he said. \"The numbers did not reflect any real value in information we were trying to understand: 'are we getting better?'\" He disputed that he made decisions based on emotion. The premier said he met with Cardy Thursday morning and told him he was going to be shuffled out of cabinet because of a lack of progress in improving the education system. Jacques Poitras\/CBC At that point, Cardy produced the resignation letter. The fact it was already drafted suggested it was \"part of an orchestrated plan,\" Higgs said. Cardy did not respond to a request for an interview. The resignation letter said\u00a0Higgs has a plan to \"abolish\" French immersion by September 2023, something that was recommended by an independent review of the program earlier this year. Cardy said\u00a0getting rid of the program was not in the government's election platform or throne speech and has not been approved by the PC cabinet or caucus. ADVERTISEMENT Eliminating it \"would place huge stress on the education system and damage the education of our province's anglophone young people,\" he wrote. Higgs confirmed he intends to go ahead with that next fall. He said given Cardy's letter, which he called \"quite a laundry list\" of criticisms, he will likely ask the PC caucus to expel him, which would leave him sitting as an independent MLA. The next caucus meeting will happen soon, Higgs said. Shane Fowler\/CBC \"I won't be dragging this out. I feel like there's only one decision to make and my recommendation will be to kick him out of caucus.\" Higgs made the comments after shuffling his cabinet Thursday afternoon. He appointed Carleton MLA Bill Hogan to replace Cardy as education minister. Former People's Alliance leader Kris Austin, who moved to the PCs in March, takes over Hogan's role as public safety minister. ADVERTISEMENT Jill Green becomes minister of Service New Brunswick and Housing, replacing Mary Wilson, who was dropped from cabinet. Jeff Carr replaced Green as transportation and infrastructure minister, while R\u00e9jean Savoie, elected in a June byelection, becomes minister for the Regional Development\u00a0Corporation. Liberal Leader Susan Holt said the critique in Cardy's letter \"seems to reflect what we've been hearing from others and reflects some of the concerns we've had about this government and their approach to leadership.\" Cardy, the former leader of the New Brunswick NDP,\u00a0joined the PCs in 2017 as an adviser to Higgs and ran for the Tories in the 2018 election. At the time Cardy switched parties, Higgs said they were \"directly aligned on so many issues\" but acknowledged they would not see eye-to-eye on everything. Jacques Poitras\/CBC \"I want people who are going to bring ideas, and are going to bring action, into the group,\" Higgs said. \"We can work through any minor issues that come up, because I do it every day with everyone.\" In 2020,\u00a0Cardy failed to win enough support from the PC caucus to get a bill passed that would have eliminated philosophical and religious exemptions from the mandatory vaccination policy for school children. And last year, he criticised the government's ban on provincial officials delivering Indigenous land acknowledgements at public events, saying it \"added an unnecessary conflict that is creating confusion and justifiable anger toward our government.\" Cardy has also been a vocal supporter of Centre Ice Canadians, a group of moderate conservatives who have criticized federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. The six chiefs of the Wolastoqey Nation in New Brunswick issued a statement Thursday calling on other PC ministers to join Cardy in resigning. \"It is more evident than ever that your leader is not operating within the fundamental principles of good governance, nor the aims and principles of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick,\" the statement said. \"Stop standing by and allowing a single person to conduct such harmful practices.

May and Pedneault have promised to helm the party under a co-leadership model, which will require an amendment to the party's constitution. For now, Pedneault will serve as deputy leader, according to the joint ticket's platform. \"It's difficult to put into words what it means to take the stage as the next leader of the Green Party of Canada,\" May said. She said it was a bit of \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" but Pedneault's presence was a major difference. May acknowledged that there was a desire in the party for change, and she hoped that the co-leadership with Pedneault, 32, would combine experience and youth.

Interim leader Amita Kuttner, meanwhile, expressed some uncertainty about how a potential shift to the co-leader model would actually be implemented. Unofficial co-leader acknowledges party difficulties The Green Party has been embroiled in internal disputes and fought the 2021 election facing severe fundraising challenges. The party continues to face financial struggles\u00a0and has had to scramble after the resignation of the former party president,\u00a0Lorraine Rekmans. It has been reeling since acrimonious divisions over former leader Annamie Paul, who described her time as leader as \"the worst period in my life\" in many respects. Some party members had been critical of Paul's leadership style and blamed her for MP Jenica Atwin's defection to the Liberals earlier that year.

But her return to the leadership role comes as the party searches for relevance and a path forward. \"We're the party for the families that want to spend more time with their loved ones. We're the party for those that think billionaires should not exist. We're the party for those that believe strongly that this planet needs protecting.\" May also sketched out a portrait of the Greens\u00a0as \"the only relevant party\" in a world fighting climate change \u2014 and as one that could offer a positive message to Canadians. \"We are going to be a party that earns the trust and faith of Canadians\u00a0and before the next election gives Canadians an option that they can vote for with enthusiasm, instead of once again going to the polls and holding their nose and voting for someone they don't particularly like in hopes of keeping someone else out,\" May said. Green MP Mike Morrice 'disappointed by party infighting' but has no plans to walk She urged those who may have left the party, or simply let memberships lapse, to rejoin the Greens and help stabilize it. \"We're rebuilding the party and it is a team effort\u00a0\u2014 everybody on board.\" May said one of her first actions would be to bring the various parts of the party together at\u00a0a retreat to help build trust and cohesion within the party.

Housing, affordability, public safety and climate change all influenced the way voters cast their ballots this year, with B.C. facing\u00a0inflation costs, a housing crisis and increasing rates of crime. In some large municipalities, such as Kamloops, Victoria, Prince George and Abbotsford, incumbents chose not to run. But in other cities, including the province's two biggest, incumbents running for re-election lost their jobs to candidates making big claims and running on campaigns of change. From housing to transit, here's what mayors and councils in B.C. can actually do Whether or not they can make good on those\u00a0promises will be determined over the next four years \u2014 and it's safe to say residents will be watching closely to ensure the people they supported are keeping their word.

Alto, a businesswoman with a background in law and science, won,\u00a0with 56 per cent of the votes cast. A key issue in the race was how candidates would vote on a\u00a0controversial plan to rezone all single-family properties to allow for multi-family add-ons, something the next set of city leaders will decide early in their term. In her election platform, Alto said she'd \"reconsider\" the plan as it currently exists and might\u00a0revise it. B.C.

Smith initially denied the bill had such authority, but as outrage mounted\u00a0she announced over the weekend there would be changes. The amendment vote also passed along party lines. Before that vote, Notley told the house that while the bill effectively rolls back the power of cabinet to rewrite laws, an accompanying change narrowing the definition of federal harm was still worded too ambiguously to be effective. Debate cut off Notley also said egregious flaws remain in the bill given it says the legislature, not the courts, gets to decide what is and is not constitutional. And she said the bill still gives broad, undefined power to cabinet to direct municipalities, health regions, schools and city police forces to resist implementing federal laws. Notley said on top of that, Smith failed to consult treaty chiefs before introducing the bill, and said this will \"absolutely torch the critically important nation-to-nation relationship that should exist between this premier and the leaders of the treaties.\" The UCP passed motions at the final three stages of the bill to limit debate. Such measures are allowed to balance discussion with keeping the business of the house moving. Government House Leader Joseph Schow said Bill 1 received about 18 hours of debate, which he called a healthy total, particularly given the NDP said it wouldn't work to make the bill better. \"There comes a point when the same message gets repeated over and over,\" said Schow. First Nations chiefs call for Alberta, Sask., to scrap provincial rights bills Earlier Wednesday in Ottawa, First Nations chiefs from Alberta and Saskatchewan called for both provinces to scrap their respective provincial rights bills, calling them inherently undemocratic, unconstitutional and an infringement on Indigenous rights. Treaty 6 Chief Tony Alexis of Alberta's Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation said there has been no consultation or dialogue with First Nations around the Alberta bill and said it could set a harmful precedent. On Wednesday afternoon, Rick Wilson, Alberta's Indigenous relations minister, told reporters that while Bill 1 specifies that treaty rights are respected, he has heard the leaders' concerns and will work to address them. Wilson said the title of the bill itself \u2014 the Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act \u2014 is problematic. \"I've been on the phone, of course, with First Nations leaders across the province and a lot of the concerns are around just calling it the Sovereignty Act. Like, what does that mean?\" said Wilson. \"In fairness, there's not a lot of clarification around what that means. Should we have done more consultation?

Villi was shot and killed on the third floor, MacSween said. He said the officer who shot Villi is a 24-year-veteran of York Regional Police and \"he very likely saved lives by his actions last night.\" Meanwhile, MacSween said police could not yet identify the victims of the shooting.

A post-mortem\u00a0exam is scheduled for Tuesday. MacSween said Sunday that it will take some time to determine the motive for the shooting and it wasn't immediately clear if there was any relation between the suspect and the victims.

(Jason Franson\/The Canadian Press) comments The Alberta Legislature has passed Premier Danielle Smith's controversial Sovereignty Act but not before first stripping out the provision that granted Smith's cabinet the power to bypass the legislature and rewrite laws as it saw fit. Smith's United Conservative caucus used its majority Wednesday night to pass an amendment to affirm that the Alberta Legislature still has the last word on lawmaking. It then moved directly to third and final reading on the bill and was approved around 1 a.m. MT Thursday, with government members standing to applaud after it cleared the final legislative hurdle.

Since the beginning of 2022, Canada has provided more than $5 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, including $1 billion in military aid. Anand's visit to Ukraine came as officials there said the country's interior minister had died in a helicopter crash near the capital that killed at least 14 other people, including other officials and three children. Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi oversaw Ukraine's police and emergency services. He is the most senior official to die since Russia invaded nearly 11 months ago. His death was the second calamity in four days to clobber Ukraine, after a Russian missile strike on an apartment building in Dnipro killed dozens of civilians.

There was no immediate word on whether Wednesday's crash was an accident or related to the war. No fighting has been reported recently in the Kyiv area. The apartment building strike and other attacks on civilians have helped stiffen international support for Ukraine as it battles to fend off the Kremlin's invasion. The winter has brought a slowdown in fighting, but military analysts say a new push by both sides is likely once the weather improves.

Government-funded compulsory boarding schools were part of a policy meant to assimilate children and destroy indigenous cultures and languages. The money will be paid to a non-profit trust independent of the government. But the settlement must still be finalised and approved by a court. The lawsuit was brought by 325 First Nations in 2012, and sought reparations for the abuse indigenous Canadians faced at the government boarding schools. Some 150,000 First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit children were taken from their families and placed in these schools from the 19th Century into the 1970s. Many then suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Survivors testified about children who died at the schools, where students were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated, and unsanitary facilities. In recent years, Indigenous communities have found evidence of hundreds of unmarked graves on the grounds of former residential schools. These discoveries have reignited debate about the system. Announcing the settlement at an event on Saturday, Marc Miller, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, said it would not \"erase or make up for the past\" but \"what it can do is address the collective harm caused by Canada's past\". Shane Gottfriedson, the former chief of the Tk'emlups Nation and British Columbia regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, said during the event that it had \"always been a fight with government\" to settle Native Canadian human rights and land claims. \"This is the beginning of a new era in Canada for our people,\" he said. \"No reconciliation without truth\": A survivor recounts abuse in Canadian residential school The settlement will be placed in a not-for-profit trust to support \"healing, wellness, education, heritage, language and commemoration activities\" for indigenous Canadians over the course of 20 years, according to the government. More than 130 residential schools were operated in Canada between 1874 and 1996. The landmark Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report, released in 2015, concluded Canada's residential school system amounted to \"cultural genocide\". At least 3,200 children died while attending a residential school, though advocates have said this number is likely much higher.

A new Canadian law took effect January 1 that essentially bans foreign buyers from buying residential properties as investments for two years. The law was passed because of a spike in Canadian home prices since the start of the pandemic \u2013 and some politicians\u2019 beliefs that foreign buyers were responsible by snapping up supply of homes as investments. \u201cThe desirability of Canadian homes is attracting profiteers, wealthy corporations, and foreign investors,\u201d said the campaign website of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s party this past year. \u201cThis is leading to a real problem of underused and vacant housing, rampant speculation, and skyrocketing prices. Homes are for people, not investors.\u201d The law provides exceptions for home purchases by immigrants and permanent residents of Canada who are not citizens. But the steep rise in home prices in 2020 and 2021 was already reversed in 2022, well before the law took effect. Average home prices in Canada peaked just above $800,000 Canadian in February and have fallen steadily since then, dropping about 13% from that peak, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association . The Bank of Canada has been raising interest rates, resulting in higher mortgage rates in the country \u2013 just like in the United States and other countries that have been hiking rates. CREA\u2019s price index is still up 38% from the end of 2019, before the pandemic, but the group said that inventory of homes for sales has returned to pre-pandemic levels. The real estate association voiced concern about the law, even with the exemptions for people who intend to move to Canada. \u201cCanada has built a reputation as a multicultural nation that welcomes people from around the world. As currently proposed, the prohibition on the purchase of residential property by non-Canadians can impact our reputation as a welcoming nation,\u201d said the group\u2019s statement. \u201cThe potential benefits of the ban are likely to be modest.\u201d CREA also expressed concern that the ban could prompt retaliation by the United States and Mexico to prohibit purchases in those countries by Canadians, especially retirees looking for winter homes away from the Canadian winter. \u201cCanadians purchase vacation and residential properties in many countries, but particularly in the United States,\u201d said the group. CREA said Canadians are the largest foreign purchasers of American properties, with more than half of the properties purchased by Canadians in Florida and Arizona. \u201cThese provide Canadians with a place to spend the winter months and are a form of savings for Canadian retirees,\u201d said the group. \u201cIf Canada places a ban on Americans owning property in Canada, we should expect them to respond in kind.\u201d","question":"Which groups were exempt from Canada's foreign buyer ban on residential properties in 2023?","answer":"Immigrants and permanent residents of Canada who were not citizens were exempt from the ban.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: The groups exempt from Canada's foreign buyer ban on residential properties in 2023 included Canadian citizens, permanent residents, temporary residents (such as certain international students and foreign workers meeting specific criteria), refugees, diplomats, and members of international organizations.

Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand announced today (Thursday Jan 26) that Canada was donating four of its 80 Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine\u2014a force equivalent to a platoon. Reportedly , the Royal Canadian Air Force fleet of five CC-171 Globemaster cargo planes (also known as C-17A ERs) in the Ontario-based 429 th Transport Squadron will \u201cprobably\u201d deliver the tanks, one per flight.

AFP PHOTO \/ ALEXANDER KLEIN        (Photo credit should read ALEXANDER KLEIN\/AFP\/GettyImages) Less AFP via Getty Images A single tank platoon, equivalent to 5% of Canada\u2019s tank fleet, is but a droplet in the ocean in a conflict on the scale of Ukraine\u2019s, in which nearly a thousand Russian and 200 Ukrainian tanks have been visually confirmed destroyed (and over 500 more captured by Ukraine) in the first eleven months of combat. But M1s and Leopard 2s\u2014given adequate logistics and using proper tactics\u2014could achieve a combat value equivalent to several of the lighter Soviet-style tanks used by both Russia and Ukraine thanks to their superior armor and sights. And if all of Ukraine\u2019s allies operating Leopard 2s continue contributing a platoon and company here, or a battalion there, it could add up to a few hundred Western tanks Kyiv could use to more aggressively spearhead offensives to liberate territory occupied by Russia. The new Canadians tanks reportedly are already \u201ccombat ready\u201d and will arrive \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d complete with spare parts and ammunition. Already, it\u2019s suggested Canada might eventually donate additional tanks, much as Washington staggered deliveries of HIMARS and Bradley fighting vehicles on a month-to-month basis. As detailed in this earlier article , Leopard 2s are heavy but highly capable main battle tanks comparableto the U.S. M1 Abrams , but using a more fuel efficient diesel engine and (in later models) different methods to enhance armor and firepower. Unleashing Canada\u2019s Leopards At present, international donors to Ukraine are looking to form a battalion each of Leopard 2A4 and 2A6 tanks, the latter post-Cold War model benefitting from much improved frontal armor and longer-barreled 125-millimeter gun with higher armor penetration. Thus the four donated tanks could help \u2018fill out\u2019 the 2A4 battalion, to which Poland, Finland and other countries will contribute, as you can see in this chart by fellow Forbes contributor H.I. Sutton. Canada first purchased 80 Leopard 2A4s and 20 Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands in 2007, concerned with the vulnerability of its old Leopard C2s (an entirely different, earlier design) to insurgent rockets and mines in Afghanistan. While waiting for its 2A6s to be upgraded with better protection, Canada also temporarily borrowed 20 2A6Ms from Germany to deploy to Afghanistan. It also subsequently acquired twelve 2A4s from Switzerland, converting them into armored engineering and recovery vehicles, as well as 15 more from Germany to be used for spare parts.

Less Canadian MCG Photo (CCA-SA 4.0) Canada actually has two kinds of 2A4s: the basic unmodified model, now mostly used for training, and custom-upgraded Leopard 2A4M CANs, modified to be especially resistant to anti-tank mines and rocket-propelled grenades. This nearly 69-ton variant includes an additional plate of belly armor to protect against mines, modular applique armor on the turret and hull, and slat\/cage armor helping harden the vulnerable rear hull and turret armor against portable anti-tank weapons. Other changes include an electric instead of hydraulically powered turret, improved brakes and suspensions, air conditioning, and digital command-and-control systems. In theory, if Canada does give away some of the better-protected 2A4Ms, it could then move to refurbish some of the older 2A4s to the 2A4M standard. Just two battalion-sized units in Canada\u2019s military operate tanks: the Lord Strathcona\u2019s Horse Regiment, with two tank squadrons, and the Royal Canadian Dragoons, with one squadron. Lord Strathcona\u2019s Horse notably deployed Leopard 2A6Ms to Afghanistan starting 2007; and between 2010-2011 five Leopard 2A4Ms. The first arrivals were a squadron of 14 Leopard 2A6Ms delivered to Kandahar by a huge Ukrainian An-124 transport plane. The Leopard 2s were regularly used for patrol, base defense of Forward Operating Base Ma\u2019Sum Ghar, and as a quick reaction force to aid units finding themselves in a tight spot. That included escorting several fiercely opposed convoys attempting to relieve heavily besieged forces at Strongpoint Musham, in what was known as Operations Room Service 1 through 3. The Canadian tankers reportedly made frequent use of shotgun-like cannister shells against Taliban insurgents in cover. Their biggest shortcoming initially proved to a lack of air conditioning, forcing crews to wear special cooling vests during the summer until modified 2A6Ms and 2A4Ms were introduced to service with built-in air conditioning and heat-absorbing mats.

And according to the statement regarding the call, the leaders \u201cdiscussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\u201d A statement from Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said the object shot down on Saturday was first noticed over Alaska on Friday evening. Two F-22 fighter jets \u201cmonitored the object\u201d with the help of the Alaska Air National Guard, Ryder\u2019s statement said, \u201ctracking it closely and taking time to characterize the nature of the object.\u201d \u201cMonitoring continued today as the object crossed into Canadian airspace, with Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joining the formation to further assess the object.

Anand tweeted Saturday that she had discussed the incident with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin \u201cand reaffirmed that we\u2019ll always defend our sovereignty together.\u201d \u201cThe object was flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, had unlawfully entered Canadian airspace and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. The object was shot down approximately 100 miles from the Canada-United States border over Canadian territory in central Yukon,\u201d Anand said in a news conference on Saturday evening. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said earlier Saturday it was monitoring \u201ca high altitude airborne object\u201d over northern Canada, and military aircraft were operating in the area from Alaska and Canada, according to a news release from the agency. Global News reported on NORAD\u2019s detection of the object earlier Saturday. Airspace over Montana briefly closed before being reopened Airspace over Montana was also closed on Saturday evening \u201cto support Defense Department activities,\u201d according to a FAA spokesperson, but it was quickly reopened. A statement from NORAD later on Saturday night said they \u201cdetected a radar anomaly and sent fighter aircraft to investigate,\u201d but the aircraft \u201cdid not identify any object to correlate to the radar hits.\u201d On Friday, the US military shot down a \u201chigh-altitude object\u201d over Alaska after US officials determined that it posed a \u201creasonable threat to civilian air traffic\u201d as it was flying at 40,000 feet. The object was brought down by fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command, and Biden referred to the operation as a \u201csuccess.\u201d Recovery teams are now attempting to retrieve the debris that is sitting on top of ice in US territorial waters. While officials have given no indication so far that the object shot down over Alaska is at all related to the Chinese spy balloon, details have been scarce. A week earlier, US military fighter jets shot down the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean, ending a remarkable public drama that prompted a diplomatic fallout between Washington and Beijing as the American public tracked the balloon from Montana all the way to the Carolinas. The Biden administration has been subjected to a slew of questions this week about the timing of the president\u2019s decision to shoot the spy balloon. The balloon was spotted after entering the US Air Defense Identification Zone over Alaska on January 28 before flying over Canada, a Department of Defense official told lawmakers last week. It then reentered continental US airspace three days later. Officials said that the risk of intelligence collection against the US was low, while the risk to people and property on the ground, if the balloon were to be shot down over the US, was high given the balloon\u2019s size and weight. Instead, the military ultimately shot it down over water after it crossed over the East Coast of the US. The second object was first spotted on Thursday , officials said, and F-35 fighter jets were sent up to examine the object further. The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which posed a \u201creasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight,\u201d John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said on Friday. Biden was first briefed on this object on Thursday evening, Kirby said. A statement Saturday from US Northern Command said search and recovery operations for the object shot down over Alaska were ongoing. \u201cRecovery activities are occurring on sea ice,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have no further details at this time about the object, including its capabilities, purpose, or origin.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.","question":"What type of aircraft was used to shoot down the unidentified object over Yukon in February 2023?","answer":"A United States Air Force F-22 Raptor shot down the object using an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: F-22 Raptor","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer 'F-22 Raptor' matches part of the expected answer, which specifies that a United States Air Force F-22 Raptor was used.

{"year":"2023","month":"02","event_desc":"Canada bans social media platform TikTok from all government-issued devices, citing \"an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\" from the Chinese-owned app.","text":"Canada bans TikTok on government devices 28 February 2023 Share Save Mike Wendling BBC News Share Save Getty Images Canada will ban video app TikTok from all government-issued devices starting on Tuesday. The decision follows a review by Canada's chief information officer, and the app \"presents an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\", a government spokesperson said in a statement. A TikTok spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the decision. It comes just days after the European Commission announced a similar ban. Security concerns Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change. \"This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,\" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto. TikTok has been criticised for its use of personal information and ties to the Chinese government. The short-form video app is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance Ltd. US federal employees were banned from using TikTok late last year, and on Monday the White House gave government agencies 30 days to scrub the app from their systems. A number of American universities have banned the app from being used on their networks. Broader public bans have been implemented in India and several other Asian countries. The company insists that Chinese government officials don't have access to user data and that a Chinese version of the app is separate from the one used in the rest of the world. But last year, the company admitted some staff in China can access the data of European users. The ban for European Commission employees is set to come into force on 15 March. Canadian privacy regulators are also investigating TikTok over concerns about user data, in particular whether the company obtains \"valid and meaningful\" consent from users when collecting personal information. About a quarter of Canadian adults use the app, according to a recent survey by researchers at the Social Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University. In a statement, Mona Fortier, the president of Canada's Treasury Board, said the government \"is committed to keeping government information secure\". The app will be removed from government-issued phones this week and other devices and blocked from downloads in the future. \"On a mobile device, TikTok's data collection methods provide considerable access to the contents of the phone,\" Ms Fortier said. \"While the risks of using this application are clear, we have no evidence at this point that government information has been compromised.\" The Treasury Board, which oversees the operations of the federal government, includes the country's chief information officer. TikTok responds In a statement, a company spokesperson said the ban on government-issued devices happened \"without citing any specific security concerns about TikTok or contacting us to discuss any concern prior to making this decision\". \"We are always available to meet with our government officials to discuss how we protect the privacy and security of Canadians, but singling out TikTok in this way does nothing to achieve that shared goal,\" the spokesperson said. \"All it does is prevent officials from reaching the public on a platform loved by millions of Canadians.\" European Commission bans TikTok on staff devices TikTok under investigation by Canadian privacy authorities TikTok Canada","question":"Why did Canada ban TikTok from government-issued devices in February 2023?","answer":"Canada banned TikTok from government-issued devices due to concerns about privacy and security risks posed by the app.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: Canada banned TikTok from government-issued devices in February 2023 due to concerns about privacy and data security. The Canadian government cited the app's data collection methods, which could potentially allow sensitive information to be accessed by foreign governments, particularly the Chinese government, given TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is based in China.

The object was brought down by fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command, and Biden referred to the operation as a \u201csuccess.\u201d Recovery teams are now attempting to retrieve the debris that is sitting on top of ice in US territorial waters. While officials have given no indication so far that the object shot down over Alaska is at all related to the Chinese spy balloon, details have been scarce. A week earlier, US military fighter jets shot down the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean, ending a remarkable public drama that prompted a diplomatic fallout between Washington and Beijing as the American public tracked the balloon from Montana all the way to the Carolinas. The Biden administration has been subjected to a slew of questions this week about the timing of the president\u2019s decision to shoot the spy balloon. The balloon was spotted after entering the US Air Defense Identification Zone over Alaska on January 28 before flying over Canada, a Department of Defense official told lawmakers last week. It then reentered continental US airspace three days later. Officials said that the risk of intelligence collection against the US was low, while the risk to people and property on the ground, if the balloon were to be shot down over the US, was high given the balloon\u2019s size and weight. Instead, the military ultimately shot it down over water after it crossed over the East Coast of the US. The second object was first spotted on Thursday , officials said, and F-35 fighter jets were sent up to examine the object further. The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which posed a \u201creasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight,\u201d John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said on Friday. Biden was first briefed on this object on Thursday evening, Kirby said. A statement Saturday from US Northern Command said search and recovery operations for the object shot down over Alaska were ongoing. \u201cRecovery activities are occurring on sea ice,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have no further details at this time about the object, including its capabilities, purpose, or origin.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.","question":"What was the altitude of the unidentified object when it was shot down over Canada in February 2023?","answer":"The object was flying at approximately 40,000 feet when it was shot down.","region":"Canada","model_answer":"Answer: 40,000 feet","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer exactly, confirming the altitude of the unidentified object as 40,000 feet when it was shot down over Canada in February 2023.","judge_model":"deepseek-ai\/DeepSeek-V3","tokens_usage":{"completion_tokens":58,"prompt_tokens":193,"total_tokens":251}}

Just under a million people did not have power in Quebec and about 110,000 in Ontario as of 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), according to Poweroutage.com.

(Shane Hennessey\/CBC) Social Sharing Prince Edward Islanders are\u00a0heading to the polls for a provincial election this spring, with voting day set for Monday, April\u00a03. Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King made the official announcement Monday evening at his nomination meeting, as he became the final candidate to be nominated to run in the 2023 provincial election for the party. \"This election is going to be about a lot of things. But primarily it's about leadership,\" King told about 200 candidates and supporters gathered at Winsloe United Church in his district of Brackley-Hunter River, surrounded by signs reading: \"PC: With you, for you.\" \"It's about who's best positioned to lead our province forward during the next four years.\" Premier hints at spring election as P.E.I. PCs kick off nomination season YEAR END INTERVIEW P.E.I. Premier Dennis King on Fiona, health care, and his thoughts \u2014 if any \u2014 on an election in 2023 In a high-energy speech, he\u00a0listed how his party had tackled the key issues of health care, the rising cost of living, and access to housing. I'm confident in our team, I'm confident in our plan, I'm confident in our track record. \u2014\u00a0Dennis King \"Today is the beginning of a new journey,\" King said as he wrapped up, saying:\u00a0\"I'm confident in our team, I'm confident in our plan, I'm confident in our track record. \"And I say to you, and I say to the 26 of you [candidates] behind me: Let's get to work, let's go get the job done one more time.\" The election call came after months of speculation about a possible spring election, at kitchen tables and coffee shops as well as in the halls of the legislature. King all but guaranteed it this winter, dropping hints here and there that the PCs were getting ready \u2014 most recently in an interview after the party nominated its first candidate in the city of\u00a0Summerside. PC Leader Dennis King announces the election for April 3 2 years ago Duration 1:05 'It may not come as a surprise to many of you, but earlier today I visited her honour, the lieutenant-governor, and I asked her to sign the writ of election,' says PC Leader Dennis King. Prince Edward Island does have fixed election legislation setting the next voting date as Oct. 2, 2023, but King exercised his right as premier to trigger it early. King later defended that decision when talking to reporters. \"It's four years;\u00a0it's time to have an election,\" he said. \"There's uncertainty in the future and Islanders should have a say in that.\" King added that there is a chance of a federal election later in the year, given that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is leading a minority government.\u00a0\"There's uncertainty in Ottawa,\" he said. \"There could be a fall election. Part of the reason our election was moved [is] because the election dates in Ottawa.\" \"It's four years; it's time to have an election,\" PC Leader Dennis King says. \"There's uncertainty in the future and Islanders should have a say in that.\" (Cody MacKay\/CBC) The P.C. leader, who had held the premier's job since 2019, said he went to see Lt.-Gov Antoinette Perry on Monday morning to\u00a0kickstart\u00a0the election. Who is running so far? Shortly after King spoke, Elections P.E.I. issued a news release about the provincial vote to be held in four weeks' time,\u00a0saying\u00a0advance polls would take place on March 25, 27 and 31 from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. As of Monday evening, the Progressive Conservatives were the only party to have a full slate of 27 candidates nominated and ready to run. PEI Votes Here is the official list of candidates running in the 2023 P.E.I. provincial election Opinion No snap! A case for the fixed election date The other parties are planning more nomination meetings in the coming days. Here is the breakdown so far of how many people have declared their intention to run for each of the other major parties (nominated or soon-to-be-nominated): The Greens under Peter Bevan-Baker have 14 of 27. The Liberals led by Sharon Cameron have 19 of 27. The NDP\u00a0under Michelle Neill have 13 of 27. Greens 'feeling really excited' Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, whose party has formed the Official Opposition since 2019, said he would have preferred that King stick to the fixed election date of Oct. 2. \"It's not the right time for Islanders, and I also think it's not the right time for democracy,\" he said. \"When you call a snap election like this, it creates such an imbalance between the ruling party \u2026 and the rest of us.\" P.E.I. Green Party Leader Peter Bevan-Baker says his party is confirming a candidate slate that's 'second to none' for this campaign. (Rick Gibbs\/CBC) Given that, he's excited about his party's possibilities going into the April 3 election. \"We have a platform we've been working on for a very long time. We just nominated this evening two more candidates, so we continue to build a slate of candidates across this province,\" he said. \"The quality of the folks who are coming forward is second to none and I'm just feeling really excited and really optimistic about the next month.\" Liberals, NDP\u00a0criticize snap call A spring election has been \"the worst kept secret on P.E.I.,\" said Liberal Leader Sharon Cameron. \"The announcement is as heartbreaking as it is discouraging,\" she said. \"We've always been very vocal about the snap election date.\" Sharon Cameron, leader of the Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island, said her primary goal going into this campaign is addressing health care. (Brian Higgins\/CBC) Cameron said her primary goal going into this election is addressing health care, adding that the party has a strong, diverse set of candidates with more being announced by the day. NDP candidate Herb Dickieson spoke on behalf of his party, saying not following the fixed election date amounts to \"broken promise\" for the PC campaign as it starts off. \"When governments attempt to deceive the people, they sometimes regret it,\" Dickieson said. As for the party's priorities going into the election, he said the party has health care top of mind and they plans on running a full slate of 27 candidates. The NDP under leader Michelle Neill had about half of their candidates confirmed as of Monday night, including former MLA Herb Dickieson. (CBC) \"Michelle Neill has a better deal for Islanders and that's our slogan and we have a very good platform to back it up with,\" he said. \"We're looking with great anticipation for much better results [than 2019] and what we're going to see \u2026 is that New Democrats will be elected in the Island legislature.\" The Island Party has also announced it plans to field candidates in the race, and has registered with Elections P.E.I. A recent news release said\u00a0it will call for \"responsible and transparent government.\" The issues heading in There will likely be more focused debate on hot-button issues this time around. Back in 2019, the province had a full slate of topics of concern, of course, but there was also a referendum on proportional representation tied to the vote. This time, expect to see some of the same issues debated in 2019 return in an even more pressing manner, including: Health care and doctor shortages. Housing and homelessness. Inflation, poverty, wages and the economy. Environment, climate change and shoreline protection. Health care and doctor shortages are issues that affect most Islanders , with more than 28,000 people and counting on the P.E.I. patient registry . Combine that with a shortage of doctors in many parts of the province, leading to hospital closures in rural parts of P.E.I. and extremely crunched ERs at both Summerside's Prince County Hospital and Charlottetown's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Also in the health care file is the COVID-19 pandemic that has dominated global attention since the winter of 2020 and is still claiming lives on P.E.I. Shortly after the election was triggered on Monday night, Elections P.E.I. released this photo of CEO Tim Garrity signing the writ of election for a provincial vote to be held on April 3. The agency said advance polls will take place on March 25, 27 and 31 from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. (Submitted by Elections P.E.I.) Housing and homelessness are an all-party priority heading into this election. On housing, increasing rents and a desperately short supply of units have squeezed the tenant population, with rising house prices pushing ownership out of reach for many Islanders. At the same time, more people have been living in tents, on couches, in cars, or at outreach centres and emergency shelters \u2014 like the one that opened in Charlottetown last December . Inflation has drained the resources of Islanders on nearly every bill, particularly when it comes to grocery shopping and buying gas and home heating fuel. Rent and mortgage rates are also way up, squeezing the budgets and putting more people on the poverty line. Use of food banks is at a historic high, with more and more rural populations installing community fridges to help their neighbours. In some ways, major storms bookended the last four years of governance, with post-tropical storm Dorian in 2019 and post-tropical storm Fiona in 2022 mercilessly pummelling Prince Edward Island. The unprecedented became precedented as all levels of government raced to rework and reinforce their climate change policies. Elections P.E.I. has sent out voter information cards across the province ahead of the spring election, and is encouraging Islanders to make sure their information is up to date.

Upon ratification, this agreement will apply to approximately 39,000 PSAC-UTE employees working at the CRA. PSAC-UTE employees will return to work this morning. May 4, 2023 Ottawa, Ontario Canada Revenue Agency Last night, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) reached a 4-year tentative agreement with the Public Service Alliance of Canada \u2013 Union of Taxation Employees (PSAC-UTE). Upon ratification, this agreement will apply to approximately 39,000 PSAC - UTE employees working at the CRA . Employees represented by PSAC - UTE will return to work this morning. The tentative agreement includes wage increases of 11.5% over four years, retroactive to 2021, that will cover periods until 2025. The third year also includes an allowance of 0.5%. Employees would also see a number of improvements over the life of the agreement, as well as a one-time payment of $2,500. The CRA continues to be committed to a modern, hybrid workplace that provides employees, where applicable, with the flexibility to continue to work up to three days from home a week. Outside of the collective agreement, the CRA and PSAC - UTE reached a tentative settlement on telework to the satisfaction of both parties. Both parties agreed to undertake a review of the Directive on virtual work arrangements, and to create a panel to advise the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner regarding employee concerns. This agreement addresses all key priorities put forward by the PSAC - UTE . In addition, it includes improved provisions, around leave with pay for family-related responsibilities, for example. It also includes measures to further support employment equity, diversity, and inclusion, such as a new benefit for Indigenous employees who will now have access to paid leave to participate in traditional practices. This new provision represents another important step in our reconciliation journey and supports our ongoing efforts to create healthy workplaces. The tentative agreement is subject to ratification by PSAC - UTE membership. The PSAC - UTE will present details of the tentative agreement to its members and organize ratification vote sessions in the coming weeks. Once the agreement is approved and ratified, employees will see wage enhancements within agreed to timelines. The CRA wants to thank members of both bargaining teams for their dedication and hard work during this round of negotiations, and especially these past few weeks. Through long hours of negotiations, the CRA and the PSAC - UTE found ways to compromise and, in doing so, succeeded in reaching a tentative agreement, which is both fair to employees and reasonable for taxpayers. The CRA has already taken measures to resume its normal operations and to fully restore services that were affected during the labour disruption. Canadians can consult the Contact the Canada Revenue Agency for more information. The CRA values the important role its employees play from across the country in delivering services to Canadians.

Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA... Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more April 29 (Reuters) - The Toronto Maple Leafs finally exorcised the postseason demons that have haunted the storied franchise for nearly two decades with a 2-1 overtime win over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday to reach the second round of the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs. John Tavares scored the series winner when he took the puck from behind the Lightning net, skated in front before making a quick turnaround and unleashed a shot that went in off Tampa Bay defender Darren Raddysh's skate. Sign up here. Perhaps no team began the postseason with more pressure than Toronto, a talented but long-underachieving club that needed to win a playoff series for the first time since 2004 to avoid loud calls for major organizational changes. \"Obviously it's a bit of a monkey off our back and we still got plenty of work to do but this one obviously feels really great,\" said Maple Leafs forward Auston Matthews. Toronto's last postseason series win came long before the arrival of gifted goal scorer Matthews (2016), explosive winger Mitch Marner (2016) and durable captain Tavares (2018). That core trio has endured their share of playoff heartache, most recently in 2022 when Tampa Bay beat Toronto in a decisive seventh game as the Maple Leafs lost their opening postseason series for a sixth consecutive year. And while ousting a Lightning team that reached the Stanley Cup Final in each of the previous three seasons has brought this group to unchartered territory, it is also just the first step for a Maple Leafs team with lofty ambitions. \"It's a little bit of a relief for sure just to be able to get that done,\" Marner said. \"But got to make sure we're ready because it just gets harder and harder.\" As the best-of-seven series returned to Tampa with the Maple Leafs ahead 3-2, the visitors were desperate to close things out rather than take their chances in a do-or-die seventh game. And for once the Maple Leafs, who had gone 0-11 in series-clinching games since they last advanced, gave their eternally optimistic fan base a reason to celebrate. Toronto opened the scoring with about six minutes left in the second period when Matthews unleashed a slapshot from the right faceoff circle that beat Andrei Vasilevskiy. The Lightning drew level when captain Steven Stamkos, alone in front of the net, fired home a rebound with just under 16 minutes left in regulation.

The transfer caused controversy.","text":"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s office says staff were alerted in March to the \u201cpossibility\u201d that notorious serial killer Paul Bernardo would be transferred to a medium security prison. But the PMO says that Trudeau himself was only briefed on the day it took place, May 29. That briefing was one day before Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino says he was told about the transfer, despite his office also knowing for nearly three months that Bernardo was being moved out of maximum-security. 3:08 Poilievre accuses Mendicino of knowing about Bernardo prison transfer 3 months prior The ever-evolving timeline comes as the Conservatives call for Mendicino\u2019s resignation over how his office handled the information. News that both the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) and the Public Safety Minister\u2019s Office knew about the impending transfer for weeks has conflicted with the shock and condemnation both Trudeau and Mendicino expressed when the move became public early this month. Story continues below advertisement According to a spokesperson for the PMO, the information about the transfer was referred to Mendicino\u2019s office when it was received in March. \u201cWhen a staff member in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office was alerted in March by the Privy Council Office about the possibility of the transfer, inquiries and requests for information were immediately made to the Public Safety Minister\u2019s Office,\u201d spokesperson Alison Murphy said in a statement to Global News. \u201cThat was the right step to take given the Public Safety Minister\u2019s responsibility for the Correctional Service of Canada.\u201d Murphy added Trudeau was briefed about the transfer on May 29, the day Bernardo was transferred. 1:00 Singh demands answers from Mendicino on Paul Bernardo prison move She did not say if the PMO was later alerted when Correctional Services Canada had formalized the transfer, or if Trudeau had any private discussions with Mendicino before news of transfer made headlines on June 2.

The CSC told Global News Wednesday it contacted Mendicino\u2019s office by email on March 2 to inform them that Bernardo would be transferred from Millhaven Institution , a maximum-security penitentiary near Kingston, Ont. A transfer date hadn\u2019t been determined at that time. CSC then followed up with the minister\u2019s office on May 25, telling them Bernardo would be transferred on May 29. Mendicino said during question period Wednesday he was informed on May 30 and that \u201ccorrective steps\u201d have been taken within his office. He also said he issued new directives to the CSC for families and the public safety minister to be notified directly before transfers like Bernardo\u2019s happen. \u201cI have also made it clear to my staff that this should have been briefed immediately.

A government official previously told Global News the CSC provided Mendicino with a heads-up of the transfer, but the decision was independent and since transfers are not typically public information, they were not in a position to comment before June 2. Bernardo, 58, has been serving a life sentence for the kidnappings, tortures and murders of teenagers Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s. He and his then-wife Karla Homolka also killed her younger sister, Tammy Homolka. Mendicino said on June 5 the CSC would review the transfer . That review should be completed \u201cwithin a few weeks,\u201d the CSC told Global News on Tuesday. 2:02 Poilievre demands Trudeau transfer Paul Bernardo back to maximum security, puts forward new bill NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters Wednesday that firing or demoting the minister is not the answer, saying he believes this was an example of the Liberal government being lousy when it comes to information-sharing.

Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they engage in this type of behaviour, they will be sent home,\u201d Joly said.

On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Ottawa released a statement on its website, condemning the expulsion and reiterating its position that Beijing has never meddled in Canada\u2019s domestic affairs. The statement also added that the embassy had lodged a formal complaint with the Chinese government. \u201cChina will resolutely take countermeasures,\u201d the statement warned. \u201cIf the Canadian side acts recklessly, China will definitely fight back resolutely and forcefully.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has been under pressure to take action after the Globe and Mail newspaper reported earlier this month that China had sought information about any relatives of a Canadian legislator \u201cwho may be located\u201d within its borders. The move was likely part of an effort to \u201cmake an example of this MP and deter others\u201d from taking anti-China positions, the newspaper said, citing Canada\u2019s spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). While the CSIS report did not name the lawmaker, the Globe said a national security source identified the targeted politician as Michael Chong, a member of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada. China sanctioned Chong in 2021 after he spearheaded a Canadian parliamentary motion condemning Beijing\u2019s treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority as a \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2013 a charge rejected by the Chinese government for years. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this long,\u201d Chong said during a news conference on Monday afternoon, responding to Canada\u2019s announcement that it was blacklisting Zhao, the Chinese diplomat. \u201cWe have known for years that the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] is using its accredited diplomats here in Canada to target Canadians and their families,\u201d Chong said. \u201cI hope that this makes it clear to not just the PRC but other authoritarian states that have representation here in Canada that this crossing the line of diplomacy into foreign interference threat activities is utterly unacceptable here on Canadian soil.\u201d The accusations this month have led to renewed tensions between Ottawa and Beijing . The two countries have had frosty relations for several years over a range of issues, including human rights, trade, and the arrests of Canadian and Chinese citizens. Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador to the country on Friday over the allegations of intimidation against Chong, stressing that it was mulling all necessary measures to defend its sovereignty.

Flooded out: Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Record Wet July 10.\u00a0Canada Day tornado in Alberta Introduction The degree of devastation across Canada in 2023 was difficult to comprehend. It was not a pretty picture given countless scenes of charred landscapes, scorched shells of former homes, and debris piles as evidence of powerful tempests, dried out riverbeds, and fields underwater as far as you could see. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets belied the hazy yellow-orange sky that you often could smell and taste - not the pristine, fresh air that is so much part of the Canadian environment. It was hard for the world to believe that such smoky skies could emanate from Canada. Across the country, more than \u00bc million Canadians had their lives upended by fires and floods and some on two or three occasions. Even worse, lives were taken and many more lost their livelihoods, homes and possessions. Nearly 90% of the Alert Ready warnings issued in 2023 came from wildfire and weather hazards. The extremes we saw in 2023 were devastating in many ways, but this is what climate change looks and feels like. What we saw this year only serves as a preview of what the future could bring if emissions of greenhouse gases are not rapidly curtailed. As the climate continues to warm, one can expect increasing wildfires, more intense droughts and hurricanes, and more intense heat waves. Not in 28 years of Top Ten Weather Events has there been a more obvious number one story than Record wildfires in 2023. In fact, it could have represented four stories in one this year: record area burned, continuation of multi-year drought, torrid heat and foul smoky skies for months on end. At times, out-of-control fires burned in nearly every province and territory. It was a story that captured international attention for much of the year. Fighting wildfires across Canada was a national preoccupation over three seasons, not the usual summer-long activity. In the end, 2023 was the worst wildfire year on record - at least twice the previous worst year and seven times the 10-year average of forests consumed by fires. Entire cities and several Indigenous communities were emptied by the threat of wildfires. Unbelievably, the area burned by wildfires stretched over 18 million hectares. One expert said that more than half the countries in the world could fit their geography into the total area burned this year in Canada. The Earth\u2019s average temperature this summer was one for the record books. Moreover, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year in possibly 125,000 years. For Canada, it was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. Even more noteworthy, if you include May and September, each province and territory recorded their warmest five months on record, with the exception of Atlantic Canada. Warm coastal waters resulted in the hottest ever marine heat wave in Canadian waters. Parts of the Prairie Provinces went from slush in late April to sweat in early May practically making spring a no-show. In Eastern Canada, it was the longest \u201chot season\u201d on record with days above 30\u00b0C for the first time in April and October. In late January and February, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing from the North to West to East. Across the West, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal for some of the lowest temperature departures in a generation. With biting winds, temperatures felt as low as -59 with wind chill in northern Qu\u00e9bec. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. Even ski resorts reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. It was a year when Western Canada had too little precipitation \u2013 unable to get a drop of rain to squelch wildfires or relieve drought, and the East had too much precipitation \u2013 just too wet for too long and too often. Before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Power outages affected over a million customers in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario. Flooding was another big story this year, including the new age flood of an urban kind in Prairie cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, and two- or three-times in Eastern cities like Qu\u00e9bec City, Ottawa and Montr\u00e9al. Outside of Halifax six weeks after fast-moving wildfires burned through the western half of the province, the region was hit by torrential downpours resulting in the devastating loss of four people, including two young children. Floods also caused unimaginable damage to personal property and infrastructure. Initial forecasts predicted a quieter start to the Atlantic hurricane season compared to the past six years but unseasonably warm Atlantic Ocean waters led to another very active tropical storm season. Canada was touched by the remains of two major hurricanes: Franklin and Lee. Lee was the most powerful hurricane to affect Canada, but it was no Fiona. On September 16, post-tropical Lee lashed the region with strong winds and heavy rains. Power outages from wind gusts topping 117 km\/h in Nova Scotia and around the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick grew storm surges with a peak wave of 16 m that destroyed precious beach and park properties along exposed shorelines. In total, the Atlantic basin had 19 named storms, including seven hurricanes of which three were major. It is very challenging to obtain an accurate count of tornadoes, as they are difficult to confirm and may go undetected in rural areas. The estimate in 2023 is around 82 tornadoes in Canada. Of significance, a Canada Day tornado in Alberta ranked EF4 with strongest estimated wind speed of 275 km\/h. It was said to be the most powerful Alberta twister since Edmonton\u2019s major tornado in 1987. Based on preliminary estimates compiled by Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. (CatIQ), there were 27 major weather events from December 2022 to November 2023, each with insured cost losses of at least $30 million and with an aggregate loss approaching $3.5 billion. It will be months before the insurance industry tallies final figures, and it will be only a fraction of the actual cost to properties, businesses and infrastructure, and emotional costs to affected Canadians. Top 10 Weather Events in 2023 1. Record wildfires A thick layer of smoke emanates from forest fires on the west side of Okanagan Lake. Image credit: Gabor Fricska The wildfire season across Canada was one for the record books on so many fronts. It began early, ended late, burned faster and was extremely active from British Columbia and the Territories to the Atlantic coast. Fighting wildfires in Canada often occurs on one side of the country at a time; this year massive wildfires were everywhere at once and lasted many months. On June 6, there were out-of-control fires burning in every single province and territory except in Prince Edward Island and Nunavut. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in Winnipeg reported that the number of wildfires was above average, but there was an unbelievable record high total of woodland consumed - seven times the 10-year average. As cloud-to-ground lightning activity was recorded at the third lowest level in 22 years between January and September inclusive, lightning was clearly not the only cause of the wildland fires. Among the wildfire records shattered and statistics of 2023 were: 184,493 square kilometres of woodland up in smoke across Canada - the equivalent of nearly 1.5 times the size of the Maritime Provinces. By June 27, Canada had already surpassed its historic record for total area burned but the country continued to burn. The amount burned was more than double the previous high of 70,000 square km consumed in 1995 and dwarfed the 10-year average of 27,538 square km. According to provincial\/territorial forestry officials in British Columbia, Alberta, Qu\u00e9bec, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories, their jurisdictions burned a record total area, dating back to 1980. The area burned in Canada was more than the total area burned in the United States in the last five years --- that is 150,000 square km. Two fires exceeded one million hectares in Qu\u00e9bec and British Columbia. In 2023 the average size of forest fires was 2,693 ha, compared to the historic average of 350 to 500 ha. Fortunately, no civilians died from wildfires, but tragically, at least four firefighters died while on duty in Canada. According to the Canadian Wildfire Evacuation Database, by the middle of September, 297 evacuation orders had been issued nationally. Evacuations numbered 235,458 people or as large as the population of Saskatoon, Burnaby or Vaughan. It included 20,000 residents from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories\u2019 capital city and several other communities in southern areas of the territory. Citizens in West Kelowna, British Columbia and Sept Iles, Qu\u00e9bec also left home including countless First Nations communities across the country. Even residents in Bathurst Inlet in Nunavut were forced to evacuate on August 11 \u2013 the first time a Nunavut community was evacuated for a wildfire. Some residents had to flee two or three times and travel 2,700 km away from home. Over 10,800 forest firefighters, nearly half of those from international crews, started fighting fires in May and were still there five months later. Property losses from six large fires numbered 17,000 claims for a total of over $1.1 billion not counting wildfires in Qu\u00e9bec. Alberta This year\u2019s fire season was unprecedented being both exceptionally early and widespread. In early May, a strong high-pressure ridge, said to be the strongest ever seen in four decades, created an early heat wave across the West. In Alberta, May temperatures averaged about 5 degrees warmer than normal \u2013 the warmest in 76 years of records. Spring in Alberta was also drier than in recent years and humidity was very low, pushing the start of the fire season much earlier than usual. Among the hot spots, Edmonton broke records for May close to 6 degrees above normal. Calgary had their second hottest May on record, some 4.5 degrees above normal. Once ignited, strong winds fanned dozens of fires in central and northern Alberta forcing 38,000 Albertans to evacuate by May 8. By May 12, nearly the entire province was under a fire ban and 19 local states of emergencies were in effect. In Edson, Alberta residents were evacuated on June 9 for the second time this spring. Flames closed several transportation routes shutting down access to dozens of parks and recreational areas. Fires also halted oil and gas activity representing nearly 5% of the nation\u2019s petroleum production. By the end of May, wildfires had charred nearly 1.2 million ha, almost 100 times more than last year at that time. Around late May and June with rain falling, forest-fire crews began moving East to combat huge fires across the Maritimes and Qu\u00e9bec. Nova Scotia The Maritimes went through one of their driest springs in several years. At the same time, meagre winter snow cover disappeared quickly leaving the moisture deficit on forest floors scanty and more typical of July than May. From February to May inclusive, total precipitation in Halifax was less than half of normal. Conditions were especially dry in April when several stations in Nova Scotia experienced their driest month on record. In May and early June, temperatures soared to 33\u00b0C and, as it turned out were the warmest few days of the entire summer, some 12 degrees above normal. As a consequence, when wildfires started up in May they were intense and fast-moving across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Further, significant amounts of fuel were left drying out after Hurricane Fiona raked the region eight months earlier. Out-of-control fires in late May forced 18,000 people from their homes in Halifax where the Tantallon fire was raging, and in a largely forested area of Shelburne County southeast of Yarmouth - the largest wildfires ever in Nova Scotia. Fires spread rapidly driven by hot, steady, gusty winds. Out-of-control fires prompted officials to impose widespread bans for hiking, camping, fishing and for forestry and mining operations. In total, more than 200 homes and other structures were fire-damaged or destroyed, mostly in northwest Halifax. Property insurance costs were estimated at $250 million. In early June, multi-day rainfalls between 100 and 175 mm helped to extinguish the flames. Qu\u00e9bec Record-breaking heat around June 1 across western Qu\u00e9bec, added to record dry weather through much of winter and spring, created tinder dry conditions across the province. Too many fires ignited at once and spread quickly. June wildfires in Qu\u00e9bec burned nine times as much land as in any previous decade combined. Major hot spots occurred in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and along the North Shore region of eastern Qu\u00e9bec. A state of emergency was declared in Sept-Iles on June 2 forcing 5,000 people out of their homes. Some residents in Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon had to flee their properties on two occasions. Several mines in the province suspended operations because of the fire risk. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec airlifted close to 200 workers from hydro stations in northern Qu\u00e9bec. Foreign fire fighters joined provincial-manned crews to extinguish flames. Hundreds of Canadian Forces personnel assisted with evacuations and firefighting. Northerly winds pushed smoke from Qu\u00e9bec and northeastern Ontario fires into Montr\u00e9al, Ottawa, Toronto and major cities in the eastern United States. Rains at the beginning of July helped extinguish some fires, although large blazes still burned out-of-control near James Bay. British Columbia Three years of unusually warm temperatures and scanty precipitation left conditions in much of British Columbia tinder dry at the end of April 2023. May ranked the warmest in 76 years, more than half a degree warmer than the second warmest May in 1998 (also a frightfully bad forest fire year). Much of the winter\u2019s snowpack disappeared quickly denying rivers a steady flow through spring and early summer. By mid-May, special air quality statements and smoky sky bulletins had already been issued for several communities in Northeastern British Columbia. With hot flames and suffocating smoke threatening the region, 40,000 people were under an evacuation order or alert before the long weekend in May. The Donnie Creek fire between Fort St. John and Fort Nelson was well underway. This lightning-ignited fire began on May 12th and was still burning strongly and out-of-control at the end of September to become the longest burning wildfire in the province\u2019s history, and the largest (5,800 square km). Dryness grew worse in summer and consequently fires grew aggressively across the entire province. Often 350 to 400 fires were burning at once with two thirds of them designated as out-of-control. There was rarely a respite for thousands of firefighters or the military. Evacuations from towns, rural areas, resorts, and vacation spots and First Nations communities continued all summer. In central British Columbia, following months of persistent dryness there was a meagre rainfall of 3.8 mm from July 13 and August 21. The erratic gusty winds, heat-dome temperatures, and thousands of lightning strikes in July ignited hundreds of wildfires in and around the Okanagan. In July, almost 170,000 lightning strikes hit the ground, or 55% more than normal, for the third most active July in 22 years of records. From the Okanagan Valley to the Fraser Canyon and east of Kamloops in the Shuswap-Adams Lake region, fires ignited in July but took off in mid-August forcing thousands of residents to stand on evacuation alert. Temperatures soared between 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C in parts of the Okanagan. The McDougall fire just 10 km from West Kelowna exploded 100 times its original size in less than one week and stayed ablaze for more than a month. Nearly 200 structures in parts of beleaguered West Kelowna, Westbank First Nations and in Kelowna were partially or entirely destroyed including the Lake Okanagan Resort. On August 5, northeast of Kamloops the Bush Creek-Adams Lakes fire doubled in size in two days scorching properties in Shuswap and on both sides of Adams Lake. On August 20, there was hope when Tropical Storm Hilary spun up from Mexico and started wetting eastern British Columbia but not further west where the rain was mostly needed. The airspace above Kelowna Airport closed to support aerial firefighters. In the Shuswap region, 170 homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged by fires. Across the West Kelowna and Bush Creek fires more than 22,000 residents were on evacuation orders or alerts. Even in Osoyoos, wildfires burned properties and forced evacuations but, in this case, it was fires from Washington State that came northward. Fire behaviour in\u00a0British Columbia\u00a0received a late-summer boost from higher-than-normal temperatures and lower than normal rainfall, especially in the north. The wildfire\u00a0season remained in full swing for months. In the first week of October, 317 active fires were still burning across the province. Northwest Territories All spring and summer, the Northwest Territories experienced record high temperatures and negligible rainfall accelerating the wildfire threat. But the seeds of the unprecedented fire season were sown at least four years ago. In Yellowknife, almost every month since the end of 2020 was drier than normal for a combined moisture deficit of 340 mm in 36 months. Further evidence of the drought, historic low water levels along the Mackenzie River forced lengthy detours for goods in transit. Around mid-August, a ridge of high pressure settled over the territory sending temperatures soaring further, desiccating forests even more, and worsening conditions because of strong winds and frequent strikes from dry lightning. Forests had enough heat and dry stress and over 200 wild and unpredictable fires ignited with the majority out of control. The fire front was 60 km away from Hay River, Northwest Territories on August 13 pushed by strong wind gusts up to 70 km\/h. The hamlet of nearby Enterprise was engulfed by the blaze and 80% of the town was burned down. By mid-August, fires grew dangerously close to several communities: 2 km from Hay River and 1 km from the airport; 4 km away from Fort Smith; 7 km from K\u2019atl\u2019odeeche First Nation and 15 km from the capital of Yellowknife. On August 18, out of control wildfires around Great Slave Lake forced officials to invoke mass evacuations involving thousands of people (nearly two thirds of the Northwest Territories\u2019 residents), and also forced postponement of territorial elections until November 14. With fires so close and heavy smoke and falling ash choking the city of Yellowknife, an historic evacuation order was issued at 12 pm on August 18 and incredibly, 95% of the city heeded the order and stayed away for almost three weeks. Some travelled as far away as 3,000 km away, returning home after the second week of September. At the end, not all fires were extinguished. On October 16, 303 fires had consumed 4.2 million ha \u2013 ten times the 25-year average and with 91 fires still active as of November 21. 2. Canada cloaked in smoke Smoke clouds rise over Dartmouth Nova Scotia and partially block out the sun. Image credit: Sansom Marchand With choking smoke filling the air across Canada, nobody was untouched by the devastating wildfires in 2023, and it was not just in Canada. Although Canada usually gets a bad reputation south of border for sending cold air, during the summer of 2023 plumes of acrid smoke travelled to the United States from Canada, making headlines in New York City and in many other parts of the country. More than 100 million Americans faced restricted breathing under poor air quality owing to smoke from Eastern Canada in June and May and later in the summer and fall from western and territorial wildfires. Further, smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic Ocean and fouled the air over Greenland, Iceland and other parts of Europe. Smoke brought hazy skies beginning in April to northeastern British Columbia when lightning ignited the Donnie Creek fire. Skies were still foul in October with over 753 fires still burning across Canada, nearly half described as \u201cout of control\u201d. In hot fire zones across Canada, poor visibility from smoke was a daily occurrence and so awful that at times fire crews could not even see what they were battling. Before the long weekend in May, wildfires in Alberta had already burned three times the annual burn in an average year. May wildfires in the west had cloaked most of Alberta and Saskatchewan and much of British Columbia with smoke such that air quality health indices were 10+ or very high risk. The risk was so high in Edmonton that the city launched its first extreme weather response to poor air quality: schools began holding recess indoors and cancelling outdoor excursions. Canadians in cities suffered with some of the worst air quality on Earth. At times, smoke shielded fires from the sun keeping temperatures below forecasted highs. Smoke was bad for crops too, hiding the sun and slowing plant growth. Late summer-early fall fires in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Alberta tainted the skies from western North America to the Great Lakes. In September, Yellowknife again found itself menaced by nearby fires, this time by thick\u00a0smoke\u00a0that turned skies an apocalyptic dark orange. On September 23, the city-hosted celebrations for returning home from three weeks of wildfire-forced evacuations had to be cancelled due to poor\u00a0air quality. In Eastern North America, special air quality statements are not frequently issued due to smoke from Canadian wildfires, especially fires in eastern Canada. Smoky skies this June came largely from fires raging across Nova Scotia, northern and central Qu\u00e9bec and northeastern Ontario. A low-pressure system over Maine and off Nova Scotia provided a counter-clockwise flow to funnel Canadian smoke southward. Occasional rainfall was not enough to extinguish wildfires until winds also had shifted. For much of June, thick smoke covered southern Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec in concentrations well past the unhealthy threshold. The smell of\u00a0smoke\u00a0was inescapable as yellowish\u00a0smog\u00a0blurred city skylines. Montr\u00e9al had the worst\u00a0air quality\u00a0in the world on the morning of June 25. Its fine particulate matter\u00a0(PM2.5) concentration was 243, reaching 38 times the World Health Organization's air quality\u00a0guideline. On June 7, air quality\u00a0in Ottawa was rated high risk at 10+. The amount of fine particulate matter in Ottawa's air hit 511 when PM2.5 normally ranges from 4 to 11. Another blast of smoke at 243 on June 25 forced Dragon Boat Festival and the Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival to be cancelled. The City also cancelled all outdoor recreational programs, closed outdoor pools, and issued no-swim advisories at city beaches. Yellow-tinted\u00a0smoke\u00a0settled over Toronto on several days in June. Under smoky haze, the smoke plume was so dense that airports had to pause or slow air traffic operations due to poor visibility. City hospitals saw a surge in the number of people visiting emergency departments with respiratory issues. At times winds would dissipate the smoke and rain scrub the air only for foul air to return within a day or two, often going from bad to worse. The number of smoke hours from May to early September, as defined when visibility is less than 9.7 km, revealed record-breaking smoke conditions across much of western, central and northern Canada. The city with the highest number of smoke hours was Fort Nelson with 1054 hours, followed by Fort St. John (867), La Ronge (802) and Peace River\/Grand Prairie (625-644). Several major cities, including Kamloops, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Yellowknife, experience more than 200 hours of smoke. 3. Hottest Summer \u2013 on Earth and in Canada The sun is rising above the silhouette of residential buildings. On Earth Blistering, baking, broiling, and \u201chell on Earth\u201d were just some of the descriptors used to describe the record hot summer across the Northern Hemisphere in 2023. There is no question it was the warmest summer since 1940, and likely back to 1850 (the start of the pre-industrial averaging period) and, if reconstructing past climates using geological and biological evidence, likely the warmest in history dating back to when human beings began appearing 120,000 years ago. June 2023 was the hottest June ever, some 1.5\u00b0C above the 20th\u00a0century average. July 2023 was the warmest month ever recorded globally, beating the previous warmest July in 2019 and some 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850 to 1900 average. The United States\u2019 National Oceanic Atmospheric Association declared July 7, 2023 the hottest day on Earth at 17.42\u00b0C, beating the previous warmest just days earlier. August 2023 was the hottest August on record. For the three summer months, the Northern Hemisphere averaged 16.77\u00b0C - that is 0.66\u00b0C warmer than the current 1991-2020 average. September kept the record warmth going when the World Meteorological Organization announced it to be the warmest September on record. In the Southern Hemisphere, well-above average temperatures especially in August also occurred across Australia and New Zealand, several South American countries and around much of Antarctica where sea ice was at its lowest extent since satellite records began in 1979. Thus, with both hemispheres abnormally warm, Earth easily had its warmest June-to-August on record. Coming out of the warmest summer and September on record, 2023 featured the Earth\u2019s warmest first nine months on record. Several factors contributed to the unprecedented heat. Record marine heat waves across several ocean basins stoked the heat throughout the summer and compounded the effects of ongoing anthropogenic climate change. With super-heated El Nino waters only expanding and strengthening in the tropical eastern Pacific, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year on record in more than 150 years. In Canada Canada contributed more than its share to the Earth\u2019s record hot summer. It was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. The average temperature anomaly was +2.0\u00b0C, beating the previous warmest in 2012. The warmest summers on record (with positive anomalies) also occurred in British Columbia (2.1\u00b0C), Yukon Territory (2.9\u00b0C) and Northwest Territories (3.1\u00b0C). Even more noteworthy, if we add May and September to the traditional three summer months, each province and territory, with the exception of Atlantic Canada, recorded their warmest five months on record. Atlantic Canada was left out of the top because it was too busy being too wet. Ocean temperatures bathing Canadian coastal waters were shockingly hot and with peaks occurring much earlier than ever before. At summer\u2019s peak (July 17 to August 7), the Canadian Atlantic surface waters were 3 to 5 degrees above normal and as hot as it ever has been in the North Atlantic. Unofficially, a hot day in Canada is defined when the day\u2019s maximum temperature exceeds 30\u00b0C. In the\u00a0British Columbia Interior hot days were far above historic averages. Kamloops recorded 62 hot days in 2023, compared to a historic average of 33. And Lytton, which in 2021 set a new record for the hottest day ever in Canada, topped 30\u00b0C for 71 days - 38 days above the average. Canada\u2019s hottest temperatures in 2023 occurred during a sweltering and protracted\u00a0heat wave\u00a0in mid-August when the day\u2019s maximum exceeded 40\u00b0C in five locations. Lytton was Canada\u2019s hot spot in 2023 at 42.2\u00b0C on August 15. Temperature soared above 37\u00b0C in the\u00a0Northwest Territories in early July. Fort Good Hope, Nunavut reached a record high of 37.4\u00b0C on July 8, more than two degrees above the previous record. Within sight of the Arctic Circle, the small town of Norman Wells hit 37.9\u00b0C also on July 8. It was easily the farthest north in Canada with a reading of 37\u00b0C or higher in the Canadian climate record, and just 0.1\u00b0C shy of the hottest temperature ever observed that far north in the world. In\u00a0Yukon, Carmacks set an all-time daily maximum temperature record on July 7 at 35.5\u00b0C the third-hottest daytime temperature ever recorded in\u00a0Yukon. In Winnipeg, winter ended and summer began on May 1 when the coldest March and April ended and the warmest May and June ever on record began. Both July and August were cooler than normal followed by a very warm September making for a relatively long summer and one of the longest growing seasons on record. Across the Great Lakes and Atlantic Canada summer temperatures were hardly hot. Some of Canada\u2019s largest cities in the East did not experience a hot day from the second week of July to the first week of September. All that Toronto could muster this summer was 33\u00b0C. By mid-summer, Easterners had written summer off. But summer came back when Ottawa registered four days above 30\u00b0C in September and two in October. Never before in 141 years of weather records has Ottawa ever seen a temperature above 30\u00b0C after September 22. Montr\u00e9al went 58 days in mid to late summer without registering a 30\u00b0C day. Neither Montr\u00e9al nor Toronto had a 30\u00b0C temperature in September in the previous four years. This year\u2019s September sizzle made up for that when consecutive hot days numbered four or five around Labour Day. Even more spectacular, the dog days of summer showed up in early October with at least two days above 30\u00b0C. Even after snow and cold arrived in the West at the end of October, parts of the East were still breaking warm temperature records. 4. Deadly deluge in Nova Scotia A road in Belmont, Nova Scotia, damaged by this summer\u2019s floods. Image credit: Lexie Barkhouse Following a record dry spring and several 30+\u00b0C days at the end of May, fast-moving and devastating wildfires burned through parts of western Nova Scotia and suburban Halifax. While fires burned in early June, incessant rains started squelching flames and lessening the threat of wildfires as the month progressed. By the end of June, 214 mm of rain had fallen in Halifax, nearly 2 \u00bc times the average monthly total. July was also wet with 187 mm - nearly double the normal. But in July almost all the rain fell in less than two days on July 21-22 when a slow-moving trough of low pressure moved into the Maritimes. A sizable plume of tropical moisture also streamed into the region from the south and positioned over some of the warmest ocean waters ever seen in the North Atlantic, surface waters two or four degrees warmer than usual. A high-pressure system to the east enabled embedded thunderstorms to tap into the tropical air, efficiently wringing out copious amounts of water. Torrential downpours started in the afternoon of July 21 and by the end of the next day between 200 and 250 mm of rain fell across the province's southwestern shore, in parts of Halifax and in the central and western parts of the province. It was a summer\u2019s total in one day - the most significant rainfall event in the Halifax area since Hurricane Beth on August 16, 1971. Because rains had been falling for most of the previous six weeks, the ground was already saturated with little ability to absorb further rainwater. The consistent nature of the thunderstorms was frightening. At Halifax International Airport, the heavy downpours started just before 4 pm on July 21 following several hours of fog. Over the next 28 hours, rain fell continuously during 10 thunderstorm hours in a process known as \u201ctraining\u201d. Like freight cars on a railroad spur, new thunderstorms developed as old ones dissipated. It finally stopped raining at 4 pm on July 22. Rainfall intensities were torrential \u2013 100 mm in one hour and 173 mm in six hours in Bedford \u2013 a new national record and shattering the once in 100-year rainfall return period. The Bedford-Sackville\u00a0area, Hammonds Plains,\u00a0and the Annapolis Valley experienced some of the heaviest rains in more than half a century. Tragedy unfolded as families fled their homes; four lives were lost, including two young children. The damage and heartache that followed was unimaginable. Rivers formed where there had been roads, with as many as 50 roads remained impassable and 50 more washed out. At least seven bridges had to be replaced or rebuilt and 19 others repaired. About 1000 people were forced to flee their homes overnight. Nova Scotia Power had to deal with outages in the Halifax and Liverpool areas caused by non-stop lightning leaving 80,000 homes and businesses across the province without power. Nova Scotia saw the most July lightning ever recorded in the province in over 22 years, and almost all of it came from the single storm on July 21: 26,194 lightning strikes in July of which 23,008 struck on July 21 and 22. There was a province-wide state of emergency declared on July 21 for 2 \u00bd weeks. This is the same area where wildfires destroyed 150 homes\u00a0two months earlier. Agriculture losses were also extensive owing to flooded fields, road washouts and crops of hay, soybeans and vegetables left submerged for several days. Following momentous rains on July 21-22, other big storms occurred in July and August leading to more flash flooding and water pooling. Halifax summer rains amounted to twice the normal at 619 mm. Elsewhere in the province at some private weather stations between 700 and 900 mm of rain fell including a whopping 981 mm at Mahone Bay. Total summer rainfall in New Brunswick ranged between 500 and 600+ mm or about 60 to 80% above normal. Rains from Hurricane Lee in September and Tropical Storm Philippe in October only added to the wettest five months in Maritime history. 5. Canada dry in the West and wet in the East Cattle grazing in dry pasture in Steveville, Alberta. Image credit: Kyle Brittain At the beginning of June, most of Canada was abnormally dry with large areas in the West in a state of moderate to extreme drought, because the first five months of 2023 lacked precipitation in the region. Drought stretched from coast to coast, in every province or territory. Even farmers in Eastern Canada were concerned about an alarmingly dry spring and maximum temperatures that soared above 30\u00b0C in mid-April - never had it been so warm so early in the year. Potato growers in Prince Edward Island were applying more irrigation water in May than in an average July. In Lethbridge, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba, the amount of precipitation from February through May was among the lowest on record in over 100 years, while in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Cote-Nord region, the moisture shortfall of 150 to 200 mm was the lowest in more than 100 years. Dry in the West Across Western and Northwest Canada, a persistent large high-pressure area stationed over British Columbia and Alberta kept rains away and temperatures elevated by as much as 10 degrees above normal for much of the year. The massive blockage prevented an influx of cooler northern air or any moist Pacific air. Also adding to the dryness was the dearth of a winter snowpack at higher altitudes. In some river basins, glacier-fed waters were the lowest in a century. Further, the\u00a0snow\u00a0had melted about six weeks earlier than usual. This meant waterways through parts of the Prairies peaked earlier, denying water for irrigation, fighting wildfires, domestic water supplies, and power generation. In Alberta, the flow of the Bow\u00a0River\u00a0was the lowest since 1911. More dry and hot\u00a0weather in the summer further depleted groundwater, leading to\u00a0river\u00a0flows in July looking more like those in September or October. Across British Columbia, 10 months of winter, spring and summer precipitation totals were consistently less than half of normal. Penticton and Vernon experienced their driest summer since records have been kept. Penticton received just 8 mm of rain compared with the normal 105 mm, and Vernon 22 mm instead of its normal 122 mm. And in Kelowna, it was the second-driest summer on record with just\u00a020\u00a0mm of rain coming down when 110 mm is the norm. Record\u00a0drought across the province was a major reason for British Columbia's worst\u00a0wildfire\u00a0season ever. By mid-August, more than 80 per cent of the province had reached high to extreme levels of drought - the two highest and worst, possible drought rankings. It was also dry across the southern Prairies and in the Peace River\/Grand Prairie region of Alberta. The Northwest Territories was also exceptionally dry extending across Western Nunavut. Across the West, the enduring drought prompted several communities to declare states of local emergency and impose strict water restrictions. Millions of residents and commercial customers were asked to conserve precious drinking water, even cautioning farmers to be frugal with their water usage, as some water reservoirs were nearing empty. It left some ranchers with no choice but to sell their cattle prematurely. Some locations such as McBride, British Columbia had to endure six or more months of water restrictions. The weather was a challenge to the province\u2019s power-generating sector with production the lowest in 15 years. With low water levels, it became too hot for fish to survive and oxygen was depleted, leading to a massive die-off of steelhead trout and salmon. In Alberta, authorities with the St. Mary\u2019s River Irrigation District declared it one of the six driest in the past 99 years. Along the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories, transport companies had to truck - rather than float on barges - goods and commodities at much higher costs. On June 1, two separate thunderstorms featuring intense rain dumped more than 40 mm of rain in Regina. The flash flooding led to basements filling and cars floating. Underpasses filled and cars ploughed through flooded streets creating a wake from rising waters. With all the talk of drought and wildfires in the West, an exception was an area between Red Deer and Edmonton, which was hammered by several days of heavy rains on June 17-20. Rains between 70 and 140 mm fell and in mountainous areas such as Jasper, 20 to 30 cm of snow fell. Edmonton was a real anomaly this summer recording almost 60% more rain than normal. Some residents of the town of Edson, twice forced from their homes by earlier forest fires, were now leaving home due to flooding. On August 24, strong super-cell thunderstorms brought large hail and torrential rainfall to several communities from Manitoba\u2019s Interlake Region through the northern parts of Winnipeg. Selkirk got 110 mm in 30 minutes and Winnipeg got between 20 mm and 30 mm. It stayed dry in British Columbia right up to October 17-19 when an atmospheric river dumped 100 to 200 mm across coastal and central parts of the province. Wet in the East Summer in Southeastern Canada was as moisture-laden as the West and Northwest were dry. Stagnant low-pressure systems were repeatedly positioned between James Bay through the Great Lakes to the Maritimes favouring lengthy bouts of rain, overcast and coolness. Frequent weather systems brought in loads of moisture from tropical sources keeping surfaces wet from days of heavy rain or continuous drizzle. Lows moved in slowly, stalled or retrograded for weeks at a time. Further, there was an absence of the customary Bermuda High and its sunny and dry weather. The Maritimes experienced its wettest summer in history, more than double the normal amount of rainfall. Among the many stations in the Maritimes breaking summer rainfall records were Yarmouth, Greenwood, Kentville, Sydney, Saint John, Fredericton, and Charlottetown. Private weather stations along Nova Scotia\u2019s south shore recorded 843 mm in Liverpool; 981 at Mahone Bay; and 500 to 600+ mm in southern New Brunswick. Saint John received a total of 763 mm of rain in June, July and August, which is almost three times the normal of 271 mm. It rained hard and often. There were 52 days in the summer with some rain when normally there would be 35. There were 24 days with rainfall amounts of 10 mm or more, when normally you would see 11 through summer. Normally, there would be three heavy rainfall events with more than 25 mm of rain, but Saint John had 11 events. Around July 10 to 12, record rains led to dramatic rises in Qu\u00e9bec waterways leading to flooding and evacuations from Saguenay to Sherbrooke. More than 135 mm in less than 48 hours sent rivers surging, including the St-Francois River which rose from 2 to 6 m in less than four hours. By the end of July, Sherbrooke recorded three times its normal monthly total. Early on July 12 and into the next day, severe thunderstorms moved through southern Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec causing flash flooding and wind damages from tornadoes. Rainfall totals ranged from 50 to 80 mm from Sarnia to Orillia and 50 to 90 mm of rain through the St. Lawrence Valley in Qu\u00e9bec, including another 90 mm dump in Montr\u00e9al. On July 20-21, another classic undercutting cold front of warm humid air triggered a series of supercell thunderstorms travelling from near Windsor to southern Qu\u00e9bec. The weather featured microbursts, tornadoes, hailers with baseball-size hail and torrential flash floods. Joliette, Qu\u00e9bec received the most rainfall, between 100 to 120 mm, with most of it within two hours. Barely a week later, a series of severe thunderstorms dropped more heavy rains resulting in flash flooding from Southwestern Ontario to Qu\u00e9bec City. Storms led to widespread street flooding and left 55,000 without power. On August 3, more storms moved through southern Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec, packing billiard ball-size hailstones, violent wind gusts in excess of 110 km\/h and torrential downpours. On August 10, between 80 to 120 mm of rain in about an hour and a half fell across Montr\u00e9al. Roads and underpasses were submerged along with warehouses, schools and lower levels of shopping malls. In Ottawa, with 100 mm of rain in six hours, roads became canals. To avoid flooding, motorists drove on sidewalks or abandoned their cars. Two weeks later a steady stream of showers and thunderstorms pushed through southwestern Ontario on August 23 and 24 bringing storm rainfalls as much as 185 mm to several locations. Flooding led to road washouts and the tragic death of a trucker who perished in a 3-m deep sinkhole. Greatest rainfall totals exceeded 200 mm in Pelee Island and Harrow, Ontario. Some of the moisture came from the remnants of Tropical Storm Hilary from Mexico via British Columbia and the prairies. Insurance costs to property losses from some of the more impactful storms this summer in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec totalled more than three quarters of a billion dollars. 6. Hurricane Lee\u2026 no Fiona but more than a windy day A man in a yellow rain suit is looking out to Indian Harbour in Nova Scotia in the first hours of Hurricane\u00a0Lee. Image credit: Doug Mercer In early spring, forecasters predicted a below normal to average number of tropical storms for the Atlantic Ocean basin in 2023. That would be a change from six years of active storm seasons. An El Nino established and strengthened in the tropical Pacific Ocean, stronger atmospheric wind shear would most likely suppress the development and growth of Atlantic tropical storms by blowing the storms apart. However, by early August, forecasters revised their numbers upward calling for up to 21 named storms. El Nino was still present, if not stronger. However, record hot tropical seawaters would potentially counterbalance the shearing effects of El Nino. Around mid-August, the Atlantic hurricane season came alive after several weeks of little to no tropical activity. Tropical Storm Franklin, the season\u2019s first major storm, remained offshore as it passed south of Atlantic Canada at the end of August. St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland and Labrador received about 36 mm of rain over 19 hours on August 30 and 31, with wind gusts peaking at 76 km\/h. On September 23, Ophelia was the 15th storm of the season. Only six storms were hurricane strength, of which three were major (Franklin, Idalia and Lee). In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Hilary was an odd storm of sorts. She formed over the Mexican State of Baja dropping a record 330 mm of rain in 24 hours on the Baja state before barreling up the hot Gulf of California and bringing record rains to Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. After soaking the desert southwest, she headed northward bringing badly needed rains to the eastern parts of British Columbia in the Kootenays and the Columbia Valley on August 20, but not to the rain-starved and fire-swept Okanagan Valley. The remains of Hilary moved across Saskatchewan and Manitoba on August 22. Two days later Hilary\u2019s leftovers merged with another storm over southern Ontario. Several rounds of rain brought two months of rain in two days - above 200 mm - to communities there, causing extensive road flooding, filled basements and garages, and backed-up sewers. Major highways were closed for up to 12 hours due to flowing water. Near Glencoe, a life was lost after a transport truck fell through a sinkhole on a district road. In early September, another weather disturbance emerged from the west coast of Africa. In the next days, a tropical cyclone formed and quickly intensified into a powerful hurricane over the central tropical Atlantic. Storm Lee grew from a Category 1 to 5 hurricane in less than 24 hours with winds at 269 km\/h - the third most rapidly intensifying storm in history and one of the 40 most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. As quickly as Lee grew, it weakened to a Category 3, but still a major hurricane. Hurricane Lee passed north of the Caribbean Sea on the 11th and started traveling toward the Gulf Stream. It stayed out over the ocean, and on the 14th, headed straight north for New England and the Canadian Maritimes. As Lee began to lose its strength, across the cooler Northern waters, some churned up by the blustery motion of storms Franklin and Idalia, it also widened its wind field as it transitioned to a Post-Tropical Cyclone. At one time, Lee\u2019s size extended out to 145 km with hurricane-force winds and 500 km with tropical storm winds. Few Maritimers would not feel the effects of Lee\u2019s wrath no matter where it made landfall during the weekend. Even while diminishing, Lee packed tree-felling wind speeds, flooding rains, and high surf to parts of coastal New England and into southwest Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy on the weekend of September 15 to 17, almost a year after Hurricane Fiona hammered the Maritimes, Qu\u00e9bec and Newfoundland. Lee was compared to Fiona but, as it turned out, it was not the same intensity and magnitude storm. Lee became a post-tropical storm around 6 am Saturday, September 16 but retained its Category-1 force winds. Lee first made landfall on Long Island, Nova Scotia in the Digby Neck late afternoon and in a second landfall in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island after crossing the Bay of Fundy. Winds blew over 100 km\/h at landfall in the west and northeastern area of Nova Scotia but peak winds were clocked at 117 km\/h at Halifax International Airport. Large waves topped 5 to 7 metres with a peak wave at the Halifax harbour buoy of 16 metres. Storm rainfalls ranged from 50 to 150 mm. Days before Lee\u2019s arrival as a post-tropical storm, store shelves started emptying from a wary citizenry still remembering the impacts of Hurricane Fiona. Residents stocked up on propane, bottled water, canned goods, batteries and flashlights and \u201cstorm chips\u201d. Boaters pulled their vessels from the water and lashed down their gear along the coast. Many flights and ferry crossings were cancelled. At the height of the storm, 350,000 customers were without power and internet connection. Of major concern in the Maritimes was the sodden ground from weeks of heavy rain in a full summer of torrential record rains. Leafed trees made it easier for Lee\u2019s winds to bring down trees and power lines. The storm surge pushed large waves and rocks onto coasts, destroying beaches and parks and washing out trails. Some beaches and parks, like Rissers Beach Provincial Park in Nova Scotia, were completely ruined; coastal roads were made impassable, bridges closed, trees downed, basements flooded, signage was scattered and traffic lights were left dangling. Three weeks later, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, tropical storm Philippe tracked very close to where Lee had made landfall in the Maritimes. Not as powerful as Lee, Philippe also transitioned into a post-tropical storm after merging with a non-tropical system and brought between 50 and 80 mm of rain and strong winds between 70 and 90 km\/h across the Maritimes and parts of eastern Qu\u00e9bec but leaving Newfoundland and Labrador alone. Significant wave heights south of Nova Scotia reached above 5 metres but were not a problem in the Bay of Fundy. 7. April glaze storm in Montr\u00e9al-Ottawa \u2013 more beast than beauty A residential street in Ottawa is covered in snow and ice after an ice storm in April. Image credit: Brittaney Pilon On April 5, 2023 before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Ahead of the storm, mild air flooded the region and a cold front undercut the mildness, destabilizing the atmosphere. The unsettled weather prompted tornado watches in southwestern Ontario and heavy rain warnings across the province. Persistent winds through the low-lying valleys of the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence rivers kept surface temperatures hovering just below freezing for most of the day. The bad mix led to several hours of freezing rain and rain with a few early season \u201cthundersnows\u201d. Hearing thunder and the ping of freezing ice balls bouncing off surfaces created a real buzz across eastern Ontario and southern Qu\u00e9bec. The ugly weather then featured up to twelve continuous hours of freezing rain in Montr\u00e9al and nine in Ottawa. Ice accretion amounts totalled 30 to 37 mm in Montr\u00e9al, 25 to 30 mm in Ottawa-Gatineau, and 15 to 25 mm in central Qu\u00e9bec. Accompanying wind gusts of 60 to 70 km\/h for two days added enormous stress to ice-encased utility lines and trees. Where heavy rain fell on still-frozen ground, localized flooding swamped backyards and fields and filled basements. Ice build-up on trees and power lines caused extensive damage, including the loss of 300 trees in Montr\u00e9al. Power outages topped one million customers in Qu\u00e9bec including half a million in Montr\u00e9al and 200,000 in Ontario. Thousands were still without power two days later. There were numerous vehicle accidents and traffic was slowed or stopped on several routes. Sidewalks were also coated with treacherous ice. Ottawa\u2019s light-rail transit went down leaving dozens of commuters waiting hours to be evacuated. Fallen branches and limbs littered streets and properties, damaging cars and smashing windshields. Sadly this ice storm took two lives in Qu\u00e9bec. Rising temperatures the next day created the ominous sight and sound of ice falling from trees, power lines and balconies. Numerous businesses were closed including clinics and schools, although libraries remained opened to assist as electricity recharging stations. Property losses from floods, winds and icing topped $335 million from Sarnia to Saguenay. 8. Cold spells in a warm year A door opens on about two feet of snow after a snowstorm in Chippawa, Ontario. Image credit: Lauren Eldridge Days before Christmas 2022, and between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day, Canada was over-run by cold air, dangerous wind chills and all kinds of precipitation from heavy rains, freezing rain and ice pellets to heavy snows in blowing conditions. Travel was treacherous and several flights and trains were cancelled or delayed to the point of ruining holiday plans for thousands of Canadians. In addition, power outages were widespread and lengthy making for uncomfortable and disappointing end-of-the-year celebrations. On December 30th\u00a0and 31st, the weather changed dramatically with the arrival of mild and dry weather. A new year saw a pronounced January thaw from coast to coast. Monthly January temperatures averaged between three to six degrees above normal from Alberta to Newfoundland-Labrador. In parts of Ontario, January was the fourth warmest month in more than 100 years of record-keeping. The four-week balmy spell only added to the severity of the cold at the end of January with a swing to numbing cold. Extreme cold warnings were issued for eight provinces and three territories, shattering several temperature records. The cold snap stood out for its severity but not duration \u2013 one of the most intense in recent years. Fortunately, the lack of a blocking high over Greenland allowed less cold air to rebound in the second week of February. Before that, the stratospheric polar vortex sat over Nunavut and the northern part of Hudson Bay in mid-January. On January 14, the deep polar low led to a record -62.4\u00b0C in Tongulakh, Siberia - the coldest day recorded anywhere in Russia in the past 20 years. A stationary and circular jet stream kept the polar vortex tightly tied up over the North Pole. Two weeks later an amplified jet stream dislodged the frigid air and the cold pool started to wobble. Eventually, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing through Western Canada. Across most of British Columbia in January, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal. Eventually, the wavering jet stream took the cold across southeastern Canada creating temperatures up to 20 degrees colder than normal. The cold low also came with blustery winds creating biting wind chills as low as -55. South of the border at Mount Washington in New Hampshire the same wind and cold produced a record low wind chill of -77. For eastern Canada, the first week of February featured the coldest air of the entire winter including punishingly cold wind chills. On February 4, 2023, Fredericton recorded -28.9\u00b0C; Saint John dipped to -29\u00b0C including a wind chill of -47 \u2013 an all-time lowest; Ottawa registered -33.1\u00b0C on the morning. The dangerous cold elevated risks of frostbite and hypothermia across the country. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. At the peak of the outages, more than 34,000 Maritimers were without power. Frozen and burst gas and water pipes led to flooding and broken infrastructure inside residences, and commercial and municipal structures. Property insurers across eastern Canada reported losses to the tune of $152 million. Travel was also impacted with flight cancellations and delays in public transit. Road assistance services were backlogged several hours. Thousands crowded into shelters and food banks. Even ski resorts reported lower weekend turnouts and reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. The cold finally started growing ice on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa but not enough to create safe skating conditions for Winterlude; for the first time its 53-year history, it was impossible to skate on the Canal in 2023. More cold warnings came into effect during the last week of February, especially in the West. On February 22, extreme cold warnings were issued in Alberta with temperatures feeling like -40 with the wind chill. Adding to the cold were bouts of messy precipitation; 30 cm of snow fell in Calgary, resulting in multiple crashes. In parts of the Prairies, the cold lingered well into March. Winter-weary Winnipeggers broke a record that stood since 1899 with no day in March above 0\u00b0C for the first time in 124 years. Farmers and ranchers began struggling financially with having to keep lambs warm and dry and calves and mother cows needing extra shelter and bedding. For some Prairie locations, their coldest moments of the winter occurred in the last 10 days of March. At the end of February, a Pacific frontal system brought around 5 to 15 cm of snow along the Pacific coast. The cold and icy rain and deep snow left a widespread mess to clean up with spun out vehicles, tree-blocked roads and slushy streets and sidewalks. The late-season snowfall caused flight and ferry cancellations, traffic delays and school closures. More snow fell in Vancouver on April 2, which meant that Vancouver got snow six months in a row from November to April, for the first time in 100 years of recorded history. 9. Flooded out: Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Record Wet July A park is submerged by flooding in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Qu\u00e9bec Several major weather systems loaded with tropical-sourced moisture brought frequent, intense and flooding rains to central and southern Qu\u00e9bec through July. Slow-moving, soppy storm systems were trapped between areas of strong high pressure over Greenland and Western Canada bringing repeated rounds of rain, many embedded with thunderstorms, across the province leading to one of the wettest months ever. By month\u2019s end, Montr\u00e9al and Qu\u00e9bec exceeded 200 mm of rain, more than double their normal monthly accumulation. Sherbrooke was the rainiest with 311 mm over 21 days, including six days with over 28 mm of rain per day, and a monthly total 2.5 times the normal. Besides summer thunderstorms there were occasional tornadoes and downbursts too. The first significant soaking occurred on July 1 when severe thunderstorms dumped torrential rains in the Rivi\u00e8re-\u00c9ternit\u00e9 area of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. The resulting flash floods caused roads to collapse, killing two people. Most rain and storm damage occurred during the second week of July. On July 10-11, a slow-moving storm moved up from the American Seaboard dumping huge amounts of rain across an area from Montr\u00e9al-Sherbrooke-Qu\u00e9bec City-Saguenay. Hard to imagine any city handling as much rain as these Qu\u00e9bec cities when nearly 80 mm fell in two hours on the 10th, made worse by heavy rains of 40 mm or more days before, and an additional 125 mm in days after. Near Qu\u00e9bec City, the town of Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval declared a state of emergency when more than 300 people were forced from their homes. More people were threatened with evacuations when the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois River, which cuts through Sherbrooke, rose six metres in four hours. Sherbrooke had never seen the Saint-Francois River so swollen. Diluvian rains forced the closing of several highways and city streets across the province. In central Montr\u00e9al, rising waters filled underground parking lots and basements, flushed intersections, swept away culverts, and destroyed key infrastructure. The intense rains and strong wind gusts up to 111 km\/h forced delays in dozens of flights out of Montr\u00e9al Trudeau International Airport. The summer of widespread power outages continued across the province arising from fires in the north and floods in the south. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec reported 500,000 customers without power at the storm\u2019s peak. Repeated storms just days later added more water to waterlogged soil and swelled rivers and overloaded municipal sewers. Outside cities, heavy soaking rains left farm fields saturated and led to erosion, ground subsidence and minor landslides. The soggy scene was repeated on July 20 to 21 and a week later on the 28th and 29th as storms developed and redeveloped between Montr\u00e9al and Qu\u00e9bec. On July 20-21, street flooding in southern Qu\u00e9bec forced numerous road closures between Gatineau and the Eastern Townships. Joliette measured 100 to 120 mm of rain (90 mm in less than two hours). By the end of the month, many large municipalities in Qu\u00e9bec had come through their wettest July on record. For Montr\u00e9al it was the wettest July measured at the Airport on record since 1941. In Qu\u00e9bec City, it was a record in 150 years, and a similar situation in Sherbrooke. Insurance losses to personal and commercial property from five significant July storms totalled $330 million. 10.\u00a0Canada Day tornado in Alberta A man stands beside an orange Jeep and watches the Canada Day tornado in Didsbury, Alberta. Image credit: Ricky Forbes On the last days of June and into July, the western Prairies saw days with high temperatures, elevated humidity and unsettled weather. Heat and storm warnings were in effect for much of Alberta. On June 29, Calgary was drenched with heavy rain from a severe thunderstorm causing flash flooding. On July 1, atmospheric conditions really started to boil up along the foothills of the Rockies. Around noon, a severe thunderstorm near Sundrie intensified into a supercell. Shortly before 2 pm, a tornado came twisting out of the supercell on farmland about 70 km north of Calgary. Rain and hailstones the size of golf and tennis balls and strong winds above 100 km\/h accompanied the tornado. The twister ripped through 15 to 20 km of rural land about 670 metres at its widest. Estimated wind speeds topped 275 km\/h between Didsbury and Carstairs. Based on the damage observed, the tornado received an EF4 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The debris field was unbelievable with toppled and debarked trees, downed power lines, and wrecked buildings. Wind tossed and rolled weighty farm equipment - such as a 10,000-kg combine - like toys, and snapped trees like matchsticks. The tornado damaged a dozen homes. No major injuries or fatalities were reported, however, 40 farm animals lost their lives to the storm. As the severe storms moved across Alberta and into Saskatchewan, they continued to take out trees and rows of fences, and sever gas lines. Debris landed on vehicles and campers adding to the cost of the insured property loss which totalled $100 million from 5,000 claims. Among those Saskatchewan communities inflicted with major losses were Nipawin and Hafford, Tisdale, Tobin Lake and Carrot River. There were 20,000 SaskPower customers without power. It was a busy summer for tornadoes in Ottawa with five tornadoes including an EF1 storm on July 13 that struck Barrhaven, 20 km south of the Ottawa city centre. A research project from Northern Tornado Project out of Western University (NTP) found about 20 tornadoes occurred across the Ottawa Valley over the past six years. It included seven tornadoes on September 21, 2018, one of which was an EF3 in the Dunrobin region with winds up to 265 km\/h. Alberta\u2019s Canada Day tornado was the most highly rated twister nationally in 2023. Moreover, it was one of the strongest top 20 tornadoes in Canada\u2019s history to be classified as violent or catastrophic (EF ratings of 4 or more). It is one of only three F4 tornadoes in Alberta and the strongest since the F4 tornado that struck Edmonton 35 years ago. The country's only documented F5 tornado occurred in Elie, Manitoba in June 2007. About 82 tornadoes occurred in 2023. Ontario led with 39 twisters, while 16 occurred in Alberta. While Saskatchewan has an average of 14 tornadoes per year (with highs of 25 in 2022 and 33 in 2012), only one tornado was reported in the province this year.

Dignitaries and world leaders in attendance included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Gov. Gen.

The couple's eldest son, Prince George, was one of four honour pages carrying the train of his grandfather's robe. During the service, William knelt before his father\u00a0to pledge his loyalty to the monarch. \"I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God,\" William said.

On the south side of the square, thousands swelled behind metal fencing along the procession\u00a0route. In the middle of the crowd, dozens of anti-monarchy protesters, held tall yellow banners that read \"not my king\" which they frequently chanted. Police confront anti-monarchy protesters in central London. (Briar Stewart\/CBC) Some of those in the crowd shouted back, \"Yes, he is,\"\u00a0or \"My king,\u00a0and I am proud of him.\" Thousands decked out in their finest Union Jack attire, along with rain coats and ponchos, easily drowned out the noise from the\u00a0protest, but they were irritated that\u00a0demonstrators were taking up prime space and\u00a0blocking some\u00a0onlookers with their flags. \"They can protest, but they can't hold their flag,\"\u00a0shouted Karen from Devon in\u00a0southwest England. 'People will stop and stare' \"Even in a world where people are sated with on-demand entertainment, people will stop and stare,\" said Michael Cole, a former BBC royal correspondent.

For 1,000 years and more, British monarchs have been crowned in grandiose ceremonies that confirm their right to rule. Although the King no longer has executive or political power, he remains the U.K.'s head of state and a symbol of national identity.

(Andrew Matthew\/Getty Images) At a time when double-digit inflation is making everyone in the U.K. poorer, Charles was keen to show that he can still be a unifying force in a multicultural nation that is very different from the one that greeted his mother. So this was\u00a0a shorter, less formal affair than the three-hour coronation for Queen Elizabeth II. In 1953, Westminster Abbey was fitted with temporary stands to boost the seating capacity to more than 8,000.\u00a0Aristocrats wore crimson robes and coronets, and the coronation procession meandered eight\u00a0kilometres\u00a0through central London so an estimated three\u00a0million people could cheer for the glamorous 27-year-old Queen. Queen Elizabeth II\u00a0died last September at age 96, after a seven-decade reign. Pared-down ceremony Organizers cut Charles's service to less than two hours and sent out 2,300 invitations. Aristocrats were\u00a0told to avoid ceremonial dress and the procession travelled a shorter, direct route back to Buckingham Palace from the abbey. This followed\u00a0Charles's instructions for a pared-down ceremony as he has been seeking\u00a0to create a smaller, less expensive royal machine for the 21st century.

Charles scrapped the traditional moment at the end of the service when nobles were asked to kneel and pledge their loyalty to the king. Instead, the Archbishop of Canterbury invited everyone in the abbey and people watching on television to swear \"true allegiance\" to the monarch. During the Anglican service,\u00a0Charles, clad in crimson and cream robes, swore on a Bible that he is a \"true Protestant.\"\u00a0But a preface was added to the coronation oath to say the Church of England \"will seek to foster an environment where people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely.\" WATCH | King Charles waves from Buckingham Palace balcony : King Charles waves from Buckingham Palace balcony 2 years ago Duration 0:58 King Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla \u2014 alongside senior working members of the Royal Family \u2014 were greeted by cheering crowds as they appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace.

And so off they went back to the 18th. Fleetwood's tee shot landed in a bunker, but Taylor's settled on the\u00a0first cut. It allowed the Canadian to attack the green, and he did, leaving himself a long eagle putt. Fleetwood, meanwhile, laid up and was standing over a putt for birdie. Taylor didn't let him hit it \u2014 he nailed his own putt from 72 feet, the longest of his career. The crowd around the 18th\u00a0green leapt with joy. \"For that to drop was a huge surprise, but an amazing one,\" Taylor said.

{"year":"2023","month":"05","event_desc":"Canada and Saudi Arabia agree to restore full diplomatic relations after a breakdown in relations in 2018 over the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.","text":"World Canada and Saudi Arabia normalize diplomatic relations after 2018 split By Steve Scherer May 25, 2023 12:32 AM UTC Updated  ago [1\/2] Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Arab League summit, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, May 19, 2023. Bandar Algaloud\/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court\/Handout OTTAWA, May 24 (Reuters) - Canada and Saudi Arabia have agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and appoint new ambassadors, both countries said on Wednesday, bringing to a close a 2018 dispute that damaged relations and trade. The decision follows discussions held between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in Bangkok in November last year, according to statements from Canada and Saudi Arabia. The decision stems from \"the desire for both sides to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect and common interests,\" the statements said. The 2018 row pre-dated the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi later that year, which Canada and all Western countries condemned. It started when Canada's embassy in Riyadh published a tweet in Arabic urging the immediate release of women's rights activists held by Saudi Arabia. That prompted Riyadh to recall its ambassador and bar the envoy from returning, and to institute a ban on new trade. \"Punitive trade measures will be lifted,\" said a Canadian government source familiar with the agreement who was not authorized to speak on the record. It is unclear what effect the dispute had on trade. Saudi Arabia was the biggest export market for Canada in the region in 2021, according to official data, when they totaled C$2.2 billion ($1.65 billion). Imports were $2.4 billion. Almost all Canada's imports were oil and petrochemicals. More than 80% of exports to Saudi Arabia were transportation equipment. \"Empty chairs at the end of the day don't push our interests forward, and they don't push things like human rights forward,\" the source added. The normalization comes as the Saudi prince, known as MbS, seeks to reassert Saudi Arabia as a regional power by using his place atop an energy giant in an oil-dependent world consumed by the war in Ukraine. \"Saudi Arabia is pivotal within its region. It's an important player,\" said Roland Paris, Trudeau's former foreign policy adviser and professor of international affairs at University of Ottawa. \"It only makes sense to have ambassadors back in place in order to keep channels of communication open.\" Canada will appoint Jean-Philippe Linteau as its new ambassador in Riyadh. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly has said \"we need to have conversations with people we don't always agree with on everything in order to find global solutions to global problems,\" the source added.

Flooded out: Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Record Wet July 10.\u00a0Canada Day tornado in Alberta Introduction The degree of devastation across Canada in 2023 was difficult to comprehend. It was not a pretty picture given countless scenes of charred landscapes, scorched shells of former homes, and debris piles as evidence of powerful tempests, dried out riverbeds, and fields underwater as far as you could see. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets belied the hazy yellow-orange sky that you often could smell and taste - not the pristine, fresh air that is so much part of the Canadian environment. It was hard for the world to believe that such smoky skies could emanate from Canada. Across the country, more than \u00bc million Canadians had their lives upended by fires and floods and some on two or three occasions. Even worse, lives were taken and many more lost their livelihoods, homes and possessions. Nearly 90% of the Alert Ready warnings issued in 2023 came from wildfire and weather hazards. The extremes we saw in 2023 were devastating in many ways, but this is what climate change looks and feels like. What we saw this year only serves as a preview of what the future could bring if emissions of greenhouse gases are not rapidly curtailed. As the climate continues to warm, one can expect increasing wildfires, more intense droughts and hurricanes, and more intense heat waves. Not in 28 years of Top Ten Weather Events has there been a more obvious number one story than Record wildfires in 2023. In fact, it could have represented four stories in one this year: record area burned, continuation of multi-year drought, torrid heat and foul smoky skies for months on end. At times, out-of-control fires burned in nearly every province and territory. It was a story that captured international attention for much of the year. Fighting wildfires across Canada was a national preoccupation over three seasons, not the usual summer-long activity. In the end, 2023 was the worst wildfire year on record - at least twice the previous worst year and seven times the 10-year average of forests consumed by fires. Entire cities and several Indigenous communities were emptied by the threat of wildfires. Unbelievably, the area burned by wildfires stretched over 18 million hectares. One expert said that more than half the countries in the world could fit their geography into the total area burned this year in Canada. The Earth\u2019s average temperature this summer was one for the record books. Moreover, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year in possibly 125,000 years. For Canada, it was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. Even more noteworthy, if you include May and September, each province and territory recorded their warmest five months on record, with the exception of Atlantic Canada. Warm coastal waters resulted in the hottest ever marine heat wave in Canadian waters. Parts of the Prairie Provinces went from slush in late April to sweat in early May practically making spring a no-show. In Eastern Canada, it was the longest \u201chot season\u201d on record with days above 30\u00b0C for the first time in April and October. In late January and February, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing from the North to West to East. Across the West, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal for some of the lowest temperature departures in a generation. With biting winds, temperatures felt as low as -59 with wind chill in northern Qu\u00e9bec. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. Even ski resorts reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. It was a year when Western Canada had too little precipitation \u2013 unable to get a drop of rain to squelch wildfires or relieve drought, and the East had too much precipitation \u2013 just too wet for too long and too often. Before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Power outages affected over a million customers in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario. Flooding was another big story this year, including the new age flood of an urban kind in Prairie cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, and two- or three-times in Eastern cities like Qu\u00e9bec City, Ottawa and Montr\u00e9al. Outside of Halifax six weeks after fast-moving wildfires burned through the western half of the province, the region was hit by torrential downpours resulting in the devastating loss of four people, including two young children. Floods also caused unimaginable damage to personal property and infrastructure. Initial forecasts predicted a quieter start to the Atlantic hurricane season compared to the past six years but unseasonably warm Atlantic Ocean waters led to another very active tropical storm season. Canada was touched by the remains of two major hurricanes: Franklin and Lee. Lee was the most powerful hurricane to affect Canada, but it was no Fiona. On September 16, post-tropical Lee lashed the region with strong winds and heavy rains. Power outages from wind gusts topping 117 km\/h in Nova Scotia and around the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick grew storm surges with a peak wave of 16 m that destroyed precious beach and park properties along exposed shorelines. In total, the Atlantic basin had 19 named storms, including seven hurricanes of which three were major. It is very challenging to obtain an accurate count of tornadoes, as they are difficult to confirm and may go undetected in rural areas. The estimate in 2023 is around 82 tornadoes in Canada. Of significance, a Canada Day tornado in Alberta ranked EF4 with strongest estimated wind speed of 275 km\/h. It was said to be the most powerful Alberta twister since Edmonton\u2019s major tornado in 1987. Based on preliminary estimates compiled by Catastrophe Indices and Quantification Inc. (CatIQ), there were 27 major weather events from December 2022 to November 2023, each with insured cost losses of at least $30 million and with an aggregate loss approaching $3.5 billion. It will be months before the insurance industry tallies final figures, and it will be only a fraction of the actual cost to properties, businesses and infrastructure, and emotional costs to affected Canadians. Top 10 Weather Events in 2023 1. Record wildfires A thick layer of smoke emanates from forest fires on the west side of Okanagan Lake. Image credit: Gabor Fricska The wildfire season across Canada was one for the record books on so many fronts. It began early, ended late, burned faster and was extremely active from British Columbia and the Territories to the Atlantic coast. Fighting wildfires in Canada often occurs on one side of the country at a time; this year massive wildfires were everywhere at once and lasted many months. On June 6, there were out-of-control fires burning in every single province and territory except in Prince Edward Island and Nunavut. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in Winnipeg reported that the number of wildfires was above average, but there was an unbelievable record high total of woodland consumed - seven times the 10-year average. As cloud-to-ground lightning activity was recorded at the third lowest level in 22 years between January and September inclusive, lightning was clearly not the only cause of the wildland fires. Among the wildfire records shattered and statistics of 2023 were: 184,493 square kilometres of woodland up in smoke across Canada - the equivalent of nearly 1.5 times the size of the Maritime Provinces. By June 27, Canada had already surpassed its historic record for total area burned but the country continued to burn. The amount burned was more than double the previous high of 70,000 square km consumed in 1995 and dwarfed the 10-year average of 27,538 square km. According to provincial\/territorial forestry officials in British Columbia, Alberta, Qu\u00e9bec, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories, their jurisdictions burned a record total area, dating back to 1980. The area burned in Canada was more than the total area burned in the United States in the last five years --- that is 150,000 square km. Two fires exceeded one million hectares in Qu\u00e9bec and British Columbia. In 2023 the average size of forest fires was 2,693 ha, compared to the historic average of 350 to 500 ha. Fortunately, no civilians died from wildfires, but tragically, at least four firefighters died while on duty in Canada. According to the Canadian Wildfire Evacuation Database, by the middle of September, 297 evacuation orders had been issued nationally. Evacuations numbered 235,458 people or as large as the population of Saskatoon, Burnaby or Vaughan. It included 20,000 residents from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories\u2019 capital city and several other communities in southern areas of the territory. Citizens in West Kelowna, British Columbia and Sept Iles, Qu\u00e9bec also left home including countless First Nations communities across the country. Even residents in Bathurst Inlet in Nunavut were forced to evacuate on August 11 \u2013 the first time a Nunavut community was evacuated for a wildfire. Some residents had to flee two or three times and travel 2,700 km away from home. Over 10,800 forest firefighters, nearly half of those from international crews, started fighting fires in May and were still there five months later. Property losses from six large fires numbered 17,000 claims for a total of over $1.1 billion not counting wildfires in Qu\u00e9bec. Alberta This year\u2019s fire season was unprecedented being both exceptionally early and widespread. In early May, a strong high-pressure ridge, said to be the strongest ever seen in four decades, created an early heat wave across the West. In Alberta, May temperatures averaged about 5 degrees warmer than normal \u2013 the warmest in 76 years of records. Spring in Alberta was also drier than in recent years and humidity was very low, pushing the start of the fire season much earlier than usual. Among the hot spots, Edmonton broke records for May close to 6 degrees above normal. Calgary had their second hottest May on record, some 4.5 degrees above normal. Once ignited, strong winds fanned dozens of fires in central and northern Alberta forcing 38,000 Albertans to evacuate by May 8. By May 12, nearly the entire province was under a fire ban and 19 local states of emergencies were in effect. In Edson, Alberta residents were evacuated on June 9 for the second time this spring. Flames closed several transportation routes shutting down access to dozens of parks and recreational areas. Fires also halted oil and gas activity representing nearly 5% of the nation\u2019s petroleum production. By the end of May, wildfires had charred nearly 1.2 million ha, almost 100 times more than last year at that time. Around late May and June with rain falling, forest-fire crews began moving East to combat huge fires across the Maritimes and Qu\u00e9bec. Nova Scotia The Maritimes went through one of their driest springs in several years. At the same time, meagre winter snow cover disappeared quickly leaving the moisture deficit on forest floors scanty and more typical of July than May. From February to May inclusive, total precipitation in Halifax was less than half of normal. Conditions were especially dry in April when several stations in Nova Scotia experienced their driest month on record. In May and early June, temperatures soared to 33\u00b0C and, as it turned out were the warmest few days of the entire summer, some 12 degrees above normal. As a consequence, when wildfires started up in May they were intense and fast-moving across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Further, significant amounts of fuel were left drying out after Hurricane Fiona raked the region eight months earlier. Out-of-control fires in late May forced 18,000 people from their homes in Halifax where the Tantallon fire was raging, and in a largely forested area of Shelburne County southeast of Yarmouth - the largest wildfires ever in Nova Scotia. Fires spread rapidly driven by hot, steady, gusty winds. Out-of-control fires prompted officials to impose widespread bans for hiking, camping, fishing and for forestry and mining operations. In total, more than 200 homes and other structures were fire-damaged or destroyed, mostly in northwest Halifax. Property insurance costs were estimated at $250 million. In early June, multi-day rainfalls between 100 and 175 mm helped to extinguish the flames. Qu\u00e9bec Record-breaking heat around June 1 across western Qu\u00e9bec, added to record dry weather through much of winter and spring, created tinder dry conditions across the province. Too many fires ignited at once and spread quickly. June wildfires in Qu\u00e9bec burned nine times as much land as in any previous decade combined. Major hot spots occurred in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and along the North Shore region of eastern Qu\u00e9bec. A state of emergency was declared in Sept-Iles on June 2 forcing 5,000 people out of their homes. Some residents in Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon had to flee their properties on two occasions. Several mines in the province suspended operations because of the fire risk. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec airlifted close to 200 workers from hydro stations in northern Qu\u00e9bec. Foreign fire fighters joined provincial-manned crews to extinguish flames. Hundreds of Canadian Forces personnel assisted with evacuations and firefighting. Northerly winds pushed smoke from Qu\u00e9bec and northeastern Ontario fires into Montr\u00e9al, Ottawa, Toronto and major cities in the eastern United States. Rains at the beginning of July helped extinguish some fires, although large blazes still burned out-of-control near James Bay. British Columbia Three years of unusually warm temperatures and scanty precipitation left conditions in much of British Columbia tinder dry at the end of April 2023. May ranked the warmest in 76 years, more than half a degree warmer than the second warmest May in 1998 (also a frightfully bad forest fire year). Much of the winter\u2019s snowpack disappeared quickly denying rivers a steady flow through spring and early summer. By mid-May, special air quality statements and smoky sky bulletins had already been issued for several communities in Northeastern British Columbia. With hot flames and suffocating smoke threatening the region, 40,000 people were under an evacuation order or alert before the long weekend in May. The Donnie Creek fire between Fort St. John and Fort Nelson was well underway. This lightning-ignited fire began on May 12th and was still burning strongly and out-of-control at the end of September to become the longest burning wildfire in the province\u2019s history, and the largest (5,800 square km). Dryness grew worse in summer and consequently fires grew aggressively across the entire province. Often 350 to 400 fires were burning at once with two thirds of them designated as out-of-control. There was rarely a respite for thousands of firefighters or the military. Evacuations from towns, rural areas, resorts, and vacation spots and First Nations communities continued all summer. In central British Columbia, following months of persistent dryness there was a meagre rainfall of 3.8 mm from July 13 and August 21. The erratic gusty winds, heat-dome temperatures, and thousands of lightning strikes in July ignited hundreds of wildfires in and around the Okanagan. In July, almost 170,000 lightning strikes hit the ground, or 55% more than normal, for the third most active July in 22 years of records. From the Okanagan Valley to the Fraser Canyon and east of Kamloops in the Shuswap-Adams Lake region, fires ignited in July but took off in mid-August forcing thousands of residents to stand on evacuation alert. Temperatures soared between 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C in parts of the Okanagan. The McDougall fire just 10 km from West Kelowna exploded 100 times its original size in less than one week and stayed ablaze for more than a month. Nearly 200 structures in parts of beleaguered West Kelowna, Westbank First Nations and in Kelowna were partially or entirely destroyed including the Lake Okanagan Resort. On August 5, northeast of Kamloops the Bush Creek-Adams Lakes fire doubled in size in two days scorching properties in Shuswap and on both sides of Adams Lake. On August 20, there was hope when Tropical Storm Hilary spun up from Mexico and started wetting eastern British Columbia but not further west where the rain was mostly needed. The airspace above Kelowna Airport closed to support aerial firefighters. In the Shuswap region, 170 homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged by fires. Across the West Kelowna and Bush Creek fires more than 22,000 residents were on evacuation orders or alerts. Even in Osoyoos, wildfires burned properties and forced evacuations but, in this case, it was fires from Washington State that came northward. Fire behaviour in\u00a0British Columbia\u00a0received a late-summer boost from higher-than-normal temperatures and lower than normal rainfall, especially in the north. The wildfire\u00a0season remained in full swing for months. In the first week of October, 317 active fires were still burning across the province. Northwest Territories All spring and summer, the Northwest Territories experienced record high temperatures and negligible rainfall accelerating the wildfire threat. But the seeds of the unprecedented fire season were sown at least four years ago. In Yellowknife, almost every month since the end of 2020 was drier than normal for a combined moisture deficit of 340 mm in 36 months. Further evidence of the drought, historic low water levels along the Mackenzie River forced lengthy detours for goods in transit. Around mid-August, a ridge of high pressure settled over the territory sending temperatures soaring further, desiccating forests even more, and worsening conditions because of strong winds and frequent strikes from dry lightning. Forests had enough heat and dry stress and over 200 wild and unpredictable fires ignited with the majority out of control. The fire front was 60 km away from Hay River, Northwest Territories on August 13 pushed by strong wind gusts up to 70 km\/h. The hamlet of nearby Enterprise was engulfed by the blaze and 80% of the town was burned down. By mid-August, fires grew dangerously close to several communities: 2 km from Hay River and 1 km from the airport; 4 km away from Fort Smith; 7 km from K\u2019atl\u2019odeeche First Nation and 15 km from the capital of Yellowknife. On August 18, out of control wildfires around Great Slave Lake forced officials to invoke mass evacuations involving thousands of people (nearly two thirds of the Northwest Territories\u2019 residents), and also forced postponement of territorial elections until November 14. With fires so close and heavy smoke and falling ash choking the city of Yellowknife, an historic evacuation order was issued at 12 pm on August 18 and incredibly, 95% of the city heeded the order and stayed away for almost three weeks. Some travelled as far away as 3,000 km away, returning home after the second week of September. At the end, not all fires were extinguished. On October 16, 303 fires had consumed 4.2 million ha \u2013 ten times the 25-year average and with 91 fires still active as of November 21. 2. Canada cloaked in smoke Smoke clouds rise over Dartmouth Nova Scotia and partially block out the sun. Image credit: Sansom Marchand With choking smoke filling the air across Canada, nobody was untouched by the devastating wildfires in 2023, and it was not just in Canada. Although Canada usually gets a bad reputation south of border for sending cold air, during the summer of 2023 plumes of acrid smoke travelled to the United States from Canada, making headlines in New York City and in many other parts of the country. More than 100 million Americans faced restricted breathing under poor air quality owing to smoke from Eastern Canada in June and May and later in the summer and fall from western and territorial wildfires. Further, smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic Ocean and fouled the air over Greenland, Iceland and other parts of Europe. Smoke brought hazy skies beginning in April to northeastern British Columbia when lightning ignited the Donnie Creek fire. Skies were still foul in October with over 753 fires still burning across Canada, nearly half described as \u201cout of control\u201d. In hot fire zones across Canada, poor visibility from smoke was a daily occurrence and so awful that at times fire crews could not even see what they were battling. Before the long weekend in May, wildfires in Alberta had already burned three times the annual burn in an average year. May wildfires in the west had cloaked most of Alberta and Saskatchewan and much of British Columbia with smoke such that air quality health indices were 10+ or very high risk. The risk was so high in Edmonton that the city launched its first extreme weather response to poor air quality: schools began holding recess indoors and cancelling outdoor excursions. Canadians in cities suffered with some of the worst air quality on Earth. At times, smoke shielded fires from the sun keeping temperatures below forecasted highs. Smoke was bad for crops too, hiding the sun and slowing plant growth. Late summer-early fall fires in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Alberta tainted the skies from western North America to the Great Lakes. In September, Yellowknife again found itself menaced by nearby fires, this time by thick\u00a0smoke\u00a0that turned skies an apocalyptic dark orange. On September 23, the city-hosted celebrations for returning home from three weeks of wildfire-forced evacuations had to be cancelled due to poor\u00a0air quality. In Eastern North America, special air quality statements are not frequently issued due to smoke from Canadian wildfires, especially fires in eastern Canada. Smoky skies this June came largely from fires raging across Nova Scotia, northern and central Qu\u00e9bec and northeastern Ontario. A low-pressure system over Maine and off Nova Scotia provided a counter-clockwise flow to funnel Canadian smoke southward. Occasional rainfall was not enough to extinguish wildfires until winds also had shifted. For much of June, thick smoke covered southern Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec in concentrations well past the unhealthy threshold. The smell of\u00a0smoke\u00a0was inescapable as yellowish\u00a0smog\u00a0blurred city skylines. Montr\u00e9al had the worst\u00a0air quality\u00a0in the world on the morning of June 25. Its fine particulate matter\u00a0(PM2.5) concentration was 243, reaching 38 times the World Health Organization's air quality\u00a0guideline. On June 7, air quality\u00a0in Ottawa was rated high risk at 10+. The amount of fine particulate matter in Ottawa's air hit 511 when PM2.5 normally ranges from 4 to 11. Another blast of smoke at 243 on June 25 forced Dragon Boat Festival and the Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival to be cancelled. The City also cancelled all outdoor recreational programs, closed outdoor pools, and issued no-swim advisories at city beaches. Yellow-tinted\u00a0smoke\u00a0settled over Toronto on several days in June. Under smoky haze, the smoke plume was so dense that airports had to pause or slow air traffic operations due to poor visibility. City hospitals saw a surge in the number of people visiting emergency departments with respiratory issues. At times winds would dissipate the smoke and rain scrub the air only for foul air to return within a day or two, often going from bad to worse. The number of smoke hours from May to early September, as defined when visibility is less than 9.7 km, revealed record-breaking smoke conditions across much of western, central and northern Canada. The city with the highest number of smoke hours was Fort Nelson with 1054 hours, followed by Fort St. John (867), La Ronge (802) and Peace River\/Grand Prairie (625-644). Several major cities, including Kamloops, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Yellowknife, experience more than 200 hours of smoke. 3. Hottest Summer \u2013 on Earth and in Canada The sun is rising above the silhouette of residential buildings. On Earth Blistering, baking, broiling, and \u201chell on Earth\u201d were just some of the descriptors used to describe the record hot summer across the Northern Hemisphere in 2023. There is no question it was the warmest summer since 1940, and likely back to 1850 (the start of the pre-industrial averaging period) and, if reconstructing past climates using geological and biological evidence, likely the warmest in history dating back to when human beings began appearing 120,000 years ago. June 2023 was the hottest June ever, some 1.5\u00b0C above the 20th\u00a0century average. July 2023 was the warmest month ever recorded globally, beating the previous warmest July in 2019 and some 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850 to 1900 average. The United States\u2019 National Oceanic Atmospheric Association declared July 7, 2023 the hottest day on Earth at 17.42\u00b0C, beating the previous warmest just days earlier. August 2023 was the hottest August on record. For the three summer months, the Northern Hemisphere averaged 16.77\u00b0C - that is 0.66\u00b0C warmer than the current 1991-2020 average. September kept the record warmth going when the World Meteorological Organization announced it to be the warmest September on record. In the Southern Hemisphere, well-above average temperatures especially in August also occurred across Australia and New Zealand, several South American countries and around much of Antarctica where sea ice was at its lowest extent since satellite records began in 1979. Thus, with both hemispheres abnormally warm, Earth easily had its warmest June-to-August on record. Coming out of the warmest summer and September on record, 2023 featured the Earth\u2019s warmest first nine months on record. Several factors contributed to the unprecedented heat. Record marine heat waves across several ocean basins stoked the heat throughout the summer and compounded the effects of ongoing anthropogenic climate change. With super-heated El Nino waters only expanding and strengthening in the tropical eastern Pacific, 2023 is very likely to be the warmest year on record in more than 150 years. In Canada Canada contributed more than its share to the Earth\u2019s record hot summer. It was the warmest summer in 76 years, dating back to the start of national record-keeping in 1948. The average temperature anomaly was +2.0\u00b0C, beating the previous warmest in 2012. The warmest summers on record (with positive anomalies) also occurred in British Columbia (2.1\u00b0C), Yukon Territory (2.9\u00b0C) and Northwest Territories (3.1\u00b0C). Even more noteworthy, if we add May and September to the traditional three summer months, each province and territory, with the exception of Atlantic Canada, recorded their warmest five months on record. Atlantic Canada was left out of the top because it was too busy being too wet. Ocean temperatures bathing Canadian coastal waters were shockingly hot and with peaks occurring much earlier than ever before. At summer\u2019s peak (July 17 to August 7), the Canadian Atlantic surface waters were 3 to 5 degrees above normal and as hot as it ever has been in the North Atlantic. Unofficially, a hot day in Canada is defined when the day\u2019s maximum temperature exceeds 30\u00b0C. In the\u00a0British Columbia Interior hot days were far above historic averages. Kamloops recorded 62 hot days in 2023, compared to a historic average of 33. And Lytton, which in 2021 set a new record for the hottest day ever in Canada, topped 30\u00b0C for 71 days - 38 days above the average. Canada\u2019s hottest temperatures in 2023 occurred during a sweltering and protracted\u00a0heat wave\u00a0in mid-August when the day\u2019s maximum exceeded 40\u00b0C in five locations. Lytton was Canada\u2019s hot spot in 2023 at 42.2\u00b0C on August 15. Temperature soared above 37\u00b0C in the\u00a0Northwest Territories in early July. Fort Good Hope, Nunavut reached a record high of 37.4\u00b0C on July 8, more than two degrees above the previous record. Within sight of the Arctic Circle, the small town of Norman Wells hit 37.9\u00b0C also on July 8. It was easily the farthest north in Canada with a reading of 37\u00b0C or higher in the Canadian climate record, and just 0.1\u00b0C shy of the hottest temperature ever observed that far north in the world. In\u00a0Yukon, Carmacks set an all-time daily maximum temperature record on July 7 at 35.5\u00b0C the third-hottest daytime temperature ever recorded in\u00a0Yukon. In Winnipeg, winter ended and summer began on May 1 when the coldest March and April ended and the warmest May and June ever on record began. Both July and August were cooler than normal followed by a very warm September making for a relatively long summer and one of the longest growing seasons on record. Across the Great Lakes and Atlantic Canada summer temperatures were hardly hot. Some of Canada\u2019s largest cities in the East did not experience a hot day from the second week of July to the first week of September. All that Toronto could muster this summer was 33\u00b0C. By mid-summer, Easterners had written summer off. But summer came back when Ottawa registered four days above 30\u00b0C in September and two in October. Never before in 141 years of weather records has Ottawa ever seen a temperature above 30\u00b0C after September 22. Montr\u00e9al went 58 days in mid to late summer without registering a 30\u00b0C day. Neither Montr\u00e9al nor Toronto had a 30\u00b0C temperature in September in the previous four years. This year\u2019s September sizzle made up for that when consecutive hot days numbered four or five around Labour Day. Even more spectacular, the dog days of summer showed up in early October with at least two days above 30\u00b0C. Even after snow and cold arrived in the West at the end of October, parts of the East were still breaking warm temperature records. 4. Deadly deluge in Nova Scotia A road in Belmont, Nova Scotia, damaged by this summer\u2019s floods. Image credit: Lexie Barkhouse Following a record dry spring and several 30+\u00b0C days at the end of May, fast-moving and devastating wildfires burned through parts of western Nova Scotia and suburban Halifax. While fires burned in early June, incessant rains started squelching flames and lessening the threat of wildfires as the month progressed. By the end of June, 214 mm of rain had fallen in Halifax, nearly 2 \u00bc times the average monthly total. July was also wet with 187 mm - nearly double the normal. But in July almost all the rain fell in less than two days on July 21-22 when a slow-moving trough of low pressure moved into the Maritimes. A sizable plume of tropical moisture also streamed into the region from the south and positioned over some of the warmest ocean waters ever seen in the North Atlantic, surface waters two or four degrees warmer than usual. A high-pressure system to the east enabled embedded thunderstorms to tap into the tropical air, efficiently wringing out copious amounts of water. Torrential downpours started in the afternoon of July 21 and by the end of the next day between 200 and 250 mm of rain fell across the province's southwestern shore, in parts of Halifax and in the central and western parts of the province. It was a summer\u2019s total in one day - the most significant rainfall event in the Halifax area since Hurricane Beth on August 16, 1971. Because rains had been falling for most of the previous six weeks, the ground was already saturated with little ability to absorb further rainwater. The consistent nature of the thunderstorms was frightening. At Halifax International Airport, the heavy downpours started just before 4 pm on July 21 following several hours of fog. Over the next 28 hours, rain fell continuously during 10 thunderstorm hours in a process known as \u201ctraining\u201d. Like freight cars on a railroad spur, new thunderstorms developed as old ones dissipated. It finally stopped raining at 4 pm on July 22. Rainfall intensities were torrential \u2013 100 mm in one hour and 173 mm in six hours in Bedford \u2013 a new national record and shattering the once in 100-year rainfall return period. The Bedford-Sackville\u00a0area, Hammonds Plains,\u00a0and the Annapolis Valley experienced some of the heaviest rains in more than half a century. Tragedy unfolded as families fled their homes; four lives were lost, including two young children. The damage and heartache that followed was unimaginable. Rivers formed where there had been roads, with as many as 50 roads remained impassable and 50 more washed out. At least seven bridges had to be replaced or rebuilt and 19 others repaired. About 1000 people were forced to flee their homes overnight. Nova Scotia Power had to deal with outages in the Halifax and Liverpool areas caused by non-stop lightning leaving 80,000 homes and businesses across the province without power. Nova Scotia saw the most July lightning ever recorded in the province in over 22 years, and almost all of it came from the single storm on July 21: 26,194 lightning strikes in July of which 23,008 struck on July 21 and 22. There was a province-wide state of emergency declared on July 21 for 2 \u00bd weeks. This is the same area where wildfires destroyed 150 homes\u00a0two months earlier. Agriculture losses were also extensive owing to flooded fields, road washouts and crops of hay, soybeans and vegetables left submerged for several days. Following momentous rains on July 21-22, other big storms occurred in July and August leading to more flash flooding and water pooling. Halifax summer rains amounted to twice the normal at 619 mm. Elsewhere in the province at some private weather stations between 700 and 900 mm of rain fell including a whopping 981 mm at Mahone Bay. Total summer rainfall in New Brunswick ranged between 500 and 600+ mm or about 60 to 80% above normal. Rains from Hurricane Lee in September and Tropical Storm Philippe in October only added to the wettest five months in Maritime history. 5. Canada dry in the West and wet in the East Cattle grazing in dry pasture in Steveville, Alberta. Image credit: Kyle Brittain At the beginning of June, most of Canada was abnormally dry with large areas in the West in a state of moderate to extreme drought, because the first five months of 2023 lacked precipitation in the region. Drought stretched from coast to coast, in every province or territory. Even farmers in Eastern Canada were concerned about an alarmingly dry spring and maximum temperatures that soared above 30\u00b0C in mid-April - never had it been so warm so early in the year. Potato growers in Prince Edward Island were applying more irrigation water in May than in an average July. In Lethbridge, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba, the amount of precipitation from February through May was among the lowest on record in over 100 years, while in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Cote-Nord region, the moisture shortfall of 150 to 200 mm was the lowest in more than 100 years. Dry in the West Across Western and Northwest Canada, a persistent large high-pressure area stationed over British Columbia and Alberta kept rains away and temperatures elevated by as much as 10 degrees above normal for much of the year. The massive blockage prevented an influx of cooler northern air or any moist Pacific air. Also adding to the dryness was the dearth of a winter snowpack at higher altitudes. In some river basins, glacier-fed waters were the lowest in a century. Further, the\u00a0snow\u00a0had melted about six weeks earlier than usual. This meant waterways through parts of the Prairies peaked earlier, denying water for irrigation, fighting wildfires, domestic water supplies, and power generation. In Alberta, the flow of the Bow\u00a0River\u00a0was the lowest since 1911. More dry and hot\u00a0weather in the summer further depleted groundwater, leading to\u00a0river\u00a0flows in July looking more like those in September or October. Across British Columbia, 10 months of winter, spring and summer precipitation totals were consistently less than half of normal. Penticton and Vernon experienced their driest summer since records have been kept. Penticton received just 8 mm of rain compared with the normal 105 mm, and Vernon 22 mm instead of its normal 122 mm. And in Kelowna, it was the second-driest summer on record with just\u00a020\u00a0mm of rain coming down when 110 mm is the norm. Record\u00a0drought across the province was a major reason for British Columbia's worst\u00a0wildfire\u00a0season ever. By mid-August, more than 80 per cent of the province had reached high to extreme levels of drought - the two highest and worst, possible drought rankings. It was also dry across the southern Prairies and in the Peace River\/Grand Prairie region of Alberta. The Northwest Territories was also exceptionally dry extending across Western Nunavut. Across the West, the enduring drought prompted several communities to declare states of local emergency and impose strict water restrictions. Millions of residents and commercial customers were asked to conserve precious drinking water, even cautioning farmers to be frugal with their water usage, as some water reservoirs were nearing empty. It left some ranchers with no choice but to sell their cattle prematurely. Some locations such as McBride, British Columbia had to endure six or more months of water restrictions. The weather was a challenge to the province\u2019s power-generating sector with production the lowest in 15 years. With low water levels, it became too hot for fish to survive and oxygen was depleted, leading to a massive die-off of steelhead trout and salmon. In Alberta, authorities with the St. Mary\u2019s River Irrigation District declared it one of the six driest in the past 99 years. Along the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories, transport companies had to truck - rather than float on barges - goods and commodities at much higher costs. On June 1, two separate thunderstorms featuring intense rain dumped more than 40 mm of rain in Regina. The flash flooding led to basements filling and cars floating. Underpasses filled and cars ploughed through flooded streets creating a wake from rising waters. With all the talk of drought and wildfires in the West, an exception was an area between Red Deer and Edmonton, which was hammered by several days of heavy rains on June 17-20. Rains between 70 and 140 mm fell and in mountainous areas such as Jasper, 20 to 30 cm of snow fell. Edmonton was a real anomaly this summer recording almost 60% more rain than normal. Some residents of the town of Edson, twice forced from their homes by earlier forest fires, were now leaving home due to flooding. On August 24, strong super-cell thunderstorms brought large hail and torrential rainfall to several communities from Manitoba\u2019s Interlake Region through the northern parts of Winnipeg. Selkirk got 110 mm in 30 minutes and Winnipeg got between 20 mm and 30 mm. It stayed dry in British Columbia right up to October 17-19 when an atmospheric river dumped 100 to 200 mm across coastal and central parts of the province. Wet in the East Summer in Southeastern Canada was as moisture-laden as the West and Northwest were dry. Stagnant low-pressure systems were repeatedly positioned between James Bay through the Great Lakes to the Maritimes favouring lengthy bouts of rain, overcast and coolness. Frequent weather systems brought in loads of moisture from tropical sources keeping surfaces wet from days of heavy rain or continuous drizzle. Lows moved in slowly, stalled or retrograded for weeks at a time. Further, there was an absence of the customary Bermuda High and its sunny and dry weather. The Maritimes experienced its wettest summer in history, more than double the normal amount of rainfall. Among the many stations in the Maritimes breaking summer rainfall records were Yarmouth, Greenwood, Kentville, Sydney, Saint John, Fredericton, and Charlottetown. Private weather stations along Nova Scotia\u2019s south shore recorded 843 mm in Liverpool; 981 at Mahone Bay; and 500 to 600+ mm in southern New Brunswick. Saint John received a total of 763 mm of rain in June, July and August, which is almost three times the normal of 271 mm. It rained hard and often. There were 52 days in the summer with some rain when normally there would be 35. There were 24 days with rainfall amounts of 10 mm or more, when normally you would see 11 through summer. Normally, there would be three heavy rainfall events with more than 25 mm of rain, but Saint John had 11 events. Around July 10 to 12, record rains led to dramatic rises in Qu\u00e9bec waterways leading to flooding and evacuations from Saguenay to Sherbrooke. More than 135 mm in less than 48 hours sent rivers surging, including the St-Francois River which rose from 2 to 6 m in less than four hours. By the end of July, Sherbrooke recorded three times its normal monthly total. Early on July 12 and into the next day, severe thunderstorms moved through southern Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec causing flash flooding and wind damages from tornadoes. Rainfall totals ranged from 50 to 80 mm from Sarnia to Orillia and 50 to 90 mm of rain through the St. Lawrence Valley in Qu\u00e9bec, including another 90 mm dump in Montr\u00e9al. On July 20-21, another classic undercutting cold front of warm humid air triggered a series of supercell thunderstorms travelling from near Windsor to southern Qu\u00e9bec. The weather featured microbursts, tornadoes, hailers with baseball-size hail and torrential flash floods. Joliette, Qu\u00e9bec received the most rainfall, between 100 to 120 mm, with most of it within two hours. Barely a week later, a series of severe thunderstorms dropped more heavy rains resulting in flash flooding from Southwestern Ontario to Qu\u00e9bec City. Storms led to widespread street flooding and left 55,000 without power. On August 3, more storms moved through southern Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec, packing billiard ball-size hailstones, violent wind gusts in excess of 110 km\/h and torrential downpours. On August 10, between 80 to 120 mm of rain in about an hour and a half fell across Montr\u00e9al. Roads and underpasses were submerged along with warehouses, schools and lower levels of shopping malls. In Ottawa, with 100 mm of rain in six hours, roads became canals. To avoid flooding, motorists drove on sidewalks or abandoned their cars. Two weeks later a steady stream of showers and thunderstorms pushed through southwestern Ontario on August 23 and 24 bringing storm rainfalls as much as 185 mm to several locations. Flooding led to road washouts and the tragic death of a trucker who perished in a 3-m deep sinkhole. Greatest rainfall totals exceeded 200 mm in Pelee Island and Harrow, Ontario. Some of the moisture came from the remnants of Tropical Storm Hilary from Mexico via British Columbia and the prairies. Insurance costs to property losses from some of the more impactful storms this summer in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec totalled more than three quarters of a billion dollars. 6. Hurricane Lee\u2026 no Fiona but more than a windy day A man in a yellow rain suit is looking out to Indian Harbour in Nova Scotia in the first hours of Hurricane\u00a0Lee. Image credit: Doug Mercer In early spring, forecasters predicted a below normal to average number of tropical storms for the Atlantic Ocean basin in 2023. That would be a change from six years of active storm seasons. An El Nino established and strengthened in the tropical Pacific Ocean, stronger atmospheric wind shear would most likely suppress the development and growth of Atlantic tropical storms by blowing the storms apart. However, by early August, forecasters revised their numbers upward calling for up to 21 named storms. El Nino was still present, if not stronger. However, record hot tropical seawaters would potentially counterbalance the shearing effects of El Nino. Around mid-August, the Atlantic hurricane season came alive after several weeks of little to no tropical activity. Tropical Storm Franklin, the season\u2019s first major storm, remained offshore as it passed south of Atlantic Canada at the end of August. St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland and Labrador received about 36 mm of rain over 19 hours on August 30 and 31, with wind gusts peaking at 76 km\/h. On September 23, Ophelia was the 15th storm of the season. Only six storms were hurricane strength, of which three were major (Franklin, Idalia and Lee). In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Hilary was an odd storm of sorts. She formed over the Mexican State of Baja dropping a record 330 mm of rain in 24 hours on the Baja state before barreling up the hot Gulf of California and bringing record rains to Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. After soaking the desert southwest, she headed northward bringing badly needed rains to the eastern parts of British Columbia in the Kootenays and the Columbia Valley on August 20, but not to the rain-starved and fire-swept Okanagan Valley. The remains of Hilary moved across Saskatchewan and Manitoba on August 22. Two days later Hilary\u2019s leftovers merged with another storm over southern Ontario. Several rounds of rain brought two months of rain in two days - above 200 mm - to communities there, causing extensive road flooding, filled basements and garages, and backed-up sewers. Major highways were closed for up to 12 hours due to flowing water. Near Glencoe, a life was lost after a transport truck fell through a sinkhole on a district road. In early September, another weather disturbance emerged from the west coast of Africa. In the next days, a tropical cyclone formed and quickly intensified into a powerful hurricane over the central tropical Atlantic. Storm Lee grew from a Category 1 to 5 hurricane in less than 24 hours with winds at 269 km\/h - the third most rapidly intensifying storm in history and one of the 40 most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. As quickly as Lee grew, it weakened to a Category 3, but still a major hurricane. Hurricane Lee passed north of the Caribbean Sea on the 11th and started traveling toward the Gulf Stream. It stayed out over the ocean, and on the 14th, headed straight north for New England and the Canadian Maritimes. As Lee began to lose its strength, across the cooler Northern waters, some churned up by the blustery motion of storms Franklin and Idalia, it also widened its wind field as it transitioned to a Post-Tropical Cyclone. At one time, Lee\u2019s size extended out to 145 km with hurricane-force winds and 500 km with tropical storm winds. Few Maritimers would not feel the effects of Lee\u2019s wrath no matter where it made landfall during the weekend. Even while diminishing, Lee packed tree-felling wind speeds, flooding rains, and high surf to parts of coastal New England and into southwest Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy on the weekend of September 15 to 17, almost a year after Hurricane Fiona hammered the Maritimes, Qu\u00e9bec and Newfoundland. Lee was compared to Fiona but, as it turned out, it was not the same intensity and magnitude storm. Lee became a post-tropical storm around 6 am Saturday, September 16 but retained its Category-1 force winds. Lee first made landfall on Long Island, Nova Scotia in the Digby Neck late afternoon and in a second landfall in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island after crossing the Bay of Fundy. Winds blew over 100 km\/h at landfall in the west and northeastern area of Nova Scotia but peak winds were clocked at 117 km\/h at Halifax International Airport. Large waves topped 5 to 7 metres with a peak wave at the Halifax harbour buoy of 16 metres. Storm rainfalls ranged from 50 to 150 mm. Days before Lee\u2019s arrival as a post-tropical storm, store shelves started emptying from a wary citizenry still remembering the impacts of Hurricane Fiona. Residents stocked up on propane, bottled water, canned goods, batteries and flashlights and \u201cstorm chips\u201d. Boaters pulled their vessels from the water and lashed down their gear along the coast. Many flights and ferry crossings were cancelled. At the height of the storm, 350,000 customers were without power and internet connection. Of major concern in the Maritimes was the sodden ground from weeks of heavy rain in a full summer of torrential record rains. Leafed trees made it easier for Lee\u2019s winds to bring down trees and power lines. The storm surge pushed large waves and rocks onto coasts, destroying beaches and parks and washing out trails. Some beaches and parks, like Rissers Beach Provincial Park in Nova Scotia, were completely ruined; coastal roads were made impassable, bridges closed, trees downed, basements flooded, signage was scattered and traffic lights were left dangling. Three weeks later, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, tropical storm Philippe tracked very close to where Lee had made landfall in the Maritimes. Not as powerful as Lee, Philippe also transitioned into a post-tropical storm after merging with a non-tropical system and brought between 50 and 80 mm of rain and strong winds between 70 and 90 km\/h across the Maritimes and parts of eastern Qu\u00e9bec but leaving Newfoundland and Labrador alone. Significant wave heights south of Nova Scotia reached above 5 metres but were not a problem in the Bay of Fundy. 7. April glaze storm in Montr\u00e9al-Ottawa \u2013 more beast than beauty A residential street in Ottawa is covered in snow and ice after an ice storm in April. Image credit: Brittaney Pilon On April 5, 2023 before the Easter weekend, a powerful late-season storm moved into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region bringing widespread freezing rain, ice pellets, hail and heavy rains. Ahead of the storm, mild air flooded the region and a cold front undercut the mildness, destabilizing the atmosphere. The unsettled weather prompted tornado watches in southwestern Ontario and heavy rain warnings across the province. Persistent winds through the low-lying valleys of the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence rivers kept surface temperatures hovering just below freezing for most of the day. The bad mix led to several hours of freezing rain and rain with a few early season \u201cthundersnows\u201d. Hearing thunder and the ping of freezing ice balls bouncing off surfaces created a real buzz across eastern Ontario and southern Qu\u00e9bec. The ugly weather then featured up to twelve continuous hours of freezing rain in Montr\u00e9al and nine in Ottawa. Ice accretion amounts totalled 30 to 37 mm in Montr\u00e9al, 25 to 30 mm in Ottawa-Gatineau, and 15 to 25 mm in central Qu\u00e9bec. Accompanying wind gusts of 60 to 70 km\/h for two days added enormous stress to ice-encased utility lines and trees. Where heavy rain fell on still-frozen ground, localized flooding swamped backyards and fields and filled basements. Ice build-up on trees and power lines caused extensive damage, including the loss of 300 trees in Montr\u00e9al. Power outages topped one million customers in Qu\u00e9bec including half a million in Montr\u00e9al and 200,000 in Ontario. Thousands were still without power two days later. There were numerous vehicle accidents and traffic was slowed or stopped on several routes. Sidewalks were also coated with treacherous ice. Ottawa\u2019s light-rail transit went down leaving dozens of commuters waiting hours to be evacuated. Fallen branches and limbs littered streets and properties, damaging cars and smashing windshields. Sadly this ice storm took two lives in Qu\u00e9bec. Rising temperatures the next day created the ominous sight and sound of ice falling from trees, power lines and balconies. Numerous businesses were closed including clinics and schools, although libraries remained opened to assist as electricity recharging stations. Property losses from floods, winds and icing topped $335 million from Sarnia to Saguenay. 8. Cold spells in a warm year A door opens on about two feet of snow after a snowstorm in Chippawa, Ontario. Image credit: Lauren Eldridge Days before Christmas 2022, and between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day, Canada was over-run by cold air, dangerous wind chills and all kinds of precipitation from heavy rains, freezing rain and ice pellets to heavy snows in blowing conditions. Travel was treacherous and several flights and trains were cancelled or delayed to the point of ruining holiday plans for thousands of Canadians. In addition, power outages were widespread and lengthy making for uncomfortable and disappointing end-of-the-year celebrations. On December 30th\u00a0and 31st, the weather changed dramatically with the arrival of mild and dry weather. A new year saw a pronounced January thaw from coast to coast. Monthly January temperatures averaged between three to six degrees above normal from Alberta to Newfoundland-Labrador. In parts of Ontario, January was the fourth warmest month in more than 100 years of record-keeping. The four-week balmy spell only added to the severity of the cold at the end of January with a swing to numbing cold. Extreme cold warnings were issued for eight provinces and three territories, shattering several temperature records. The cold snap stood out for its severity but not duration \u2013 one of the most intense in recent years. Fortunately, the lack of a blocking high over Greenland allowed less cold air to rebound in the second week of February. Before that, the stratospheric polar vortex sat over Nunavut and the northern part of Hudson Bay in mid-January. On January 14, the deep polar low led to a record -62.4\u00b0C in Tongulakh, Siberia - the coldest day recorded anywhere in Russia in the past 20 years. A stationary and circular jet stream kept the polar vortex tightly tied up over the North Pole. Two weeks later an amplified jet stream dislodged the frigid air and the cold pool started to wobble. Eventually, a lobe of the polar vortex dipped southward pushing through Western Canada. Across most of British Columbia in January, temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal. Eventually, the wavering jet stream took the cold across southeastern Canada creating temperatures up to 20 degrees colder than normal. The cold low also came with blustery winds creating biting wind chills as low as -55. South of the border at Mount Washington in New Hampshire the same wind and cold produced a record low wind chill of -77. For eastern Canada, the first week of February featured the coldest air of the entire winter including punishingly cold wind chills. On February 4, 2023, Fredericton recorded -28.9\u00b0C; Saint John dipped to -29\u00b0C including a wind chill of -47 \u2013 an all-time lowest; Ottawa registered -33.1\u00b0C on the morning. The dangerous cold elevated risks of frostbite and hypothermia across the country. Hydro utilities struggled to keep up with power demands leading to record consumption. At the peak of the outages, more than 34,000 Maritimers were without power. Frozen and burst gas and water pipes led to flooding and broken infrastructure inside residences, and commercial and municipal structures. Property insurers across eastern Canada reported losses to the tune of $152 million. Travel was also impacted with flight cancellations and delays in public transit. Road assistance services were backlogged several hours. Thousands crowded into shelters and food banks. Even ski resorts reported lower weekend turnouts and reduced hours of operation because it was just too cold to ski. The cold finally started growing ice on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa but not enough to create safe skating conditions for Winterlude; for the first time its 53-year history, it was impossible to skate on the Canal in 2023. More cold warnings came into effect during the last week of February, especially in the West. On February 22, extreme cold warnings were issued in Alberta with temperatures feeling like -40 with the wind chill. Adding to the cold were bouts of messy precipitation; 30 cm of snow fell in Calgary, resulting in multiple crashes. In parts of the Prairies, the cold lingered well into March. Winter-weary Winnipeggers broke a record that stood since 1899 with no day in March above 0\u00b0C for the first time in 124 years. Farmers and ranchers began struggling financially with having to keep lambs warm and dry and calves and mother cows needing extra shelter and bedding. For some Prairie locations, their coldest moments of the winter occurred in the last 10 days of March. At the end of February, a Pacific frontal system brought around 5 to 15 cm of snow along the Pacific coast. The cold and icy rain and deep snow left a widespread mess to clean up with spun out vehicles, tree-blocked roads and slushy streets and sidewalks. The late-season snowfall caused flight and ferry cancellations, traffic delays and school closures. More snow fell in Vancouver on April 2, which meant that Vancouver got snow six months in a row from November to April, for the first time in 100 years of recorded history. 9. Flooded out: Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Record Wet July A park is submerged by flooding in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Qu\u00e9bec Several major weather systems loaded with tropical-sourced moisture brought frequent, intense and flooding rains to central and southern Qu\u00e9bec through July. Slow-moving, soppy storm systems were trapped between areas of strong high pressure over Greenland and Western Canada bringing repeated rounds of rain, many embedded with thunderstorms, across the province leading to one of the wettest months ever. By month\u2019s end, Montr\u00e9al and Qu\u00e9bec exceeded 200 mm of rain, more than double their normal monthly accumulation. Sherbrooke was the rainiest with 311 mm over 21 days, including six days with over 28 mm of rain per day, and a monthly total 2.5 times the normal. Besides summer thunderstorms there were occasional tornadoes and downbursts too. The first significant soaking occurred on July 1 when severe thunderstorms dumped torrential rains in the Rivi\u00e8re-\u00c9ternit\u00e9 area of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. The resulting flash floods caused roads to collapse, killing two people. Most rain and storm damage occurred during the second week of July. On July 10-11, a slow-moving storm moved up from the American Seaboard dumping huge amounts of rain across an area from Montr\u00e9al-Sherbrooke-Qu\u00e9bec City-Saguenay. Hard to imagine any city handling as much rain as these Qu\u00e9bec cities when nearly 80 mm fell in two hours on the 10th, made worse by heavy rains of 40 mm or more days before, and an additional 125 mm in days after. Near Qu\u00e9bec City, the town of Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval declared a state of emergency when more than 300 people were forced from their homes. More people were threatened with evacuations when the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois River, which cuts through Sherbrooke, rose six metres in four hours. Sherbrooke had never seen the Saint-Francois River so swollen. Diluvian rains forced the closing of several highways and city streets across the province. In central Montr\u00e9al, rising waters filled underground parking lots and basements, flushed intersections, swept away culverts, and destroyed key infrastructure. The intense rains and strong wind gusts up to 111 km\/h forced delays in dozens of flights out of Montr\u00e9al Trudeau International Airport. The summer of widespread power outages continued across the province arising from fires in the north and floods in the south. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec reported 500,000 customers without power at the storm\u2019s peak. Repeated storms just days later added more water to waterlogged soil and swelled rivers and overloaded municipal sewers. Outside cities, heavy soaking rains left farm fields saturated and led to erosion, ground subsidence and minor landslides. The soggy scene was repeated on July 20 to 21 and a week later on the 28th and 29th as storms developed and redeveloped between Montr\u00e9al and Qu\u00e9bec. On July 20-21, street flooding in southern Qu\u00e9bec forced numerous road closures between Gatineau and the Eastern Townships. Joliette measured 100 to 120 mm of rain (90 mm in less than two hours). By the end of the month, many large municipalities in Qu\u00e9bec had come through their wettest July on record. For Montr\u00e9al it was the wettest July measured at the Airport on record since 1941. In Qu\u00e9bec City, it was a record in 150 years, and a similar situation in Sherbrooke. Insurance losses to personal and commercial property from five significant July storms totalled $330 million. 10.\u00a0Canada Day tornado in Alberta A man stands beside an orange Jeep and watches the Canada Day tornado in Didsbury, Alberta. Image credit: Ricky Forbes On the last days of June and into July, the western Prairies saw days with high temperatures, elevated humidity and unsettled weather. Heat and storm warnings were in effect for much of Alberta. On June 29, Calgary was drenched with heavy rain from a severe thunderstorm causing flash flooding. On July 1, atmospheric conditions really started to boil up along the foothills of the Rockies. Around noon, a severe thunderstorm near Sundrie intensified into a supercell. Shortly before 2 pm, a tornado came twisting out of the supercell on farmland about 70 km north of Calgary. Rain and hailstones the size of golf and tennis balls and strong winds above 100 km\/h accompanied the tornado. The twister ripped through 15 to 20 km of rural land about 670 metres at its widest. Estimated wind speeds topped 275 km\/h between Didsbury and Carstairs. Based on the damage observed, the tornado received an EF4 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The debris field was unbelievable with toppled and debarked trees, downed power lines, and wrecked buildings. Wind tossed and rolled weighty farm equipment - such as a 10,000-kg combine - like toys, and snapped trees like matchsticks. The tornado damaged a dozen homes. No major injuries or fatalities were reported, however, 40 farm animals lost their lives to the storm. As the severe storms moved across Alberta and into Saskatchewan, they continued to take out trees and rows of fences, and sever gas lines. Debris landed on vehicles and campers adding to the cost of the insured property loss which totalled $100 million from 5,000 claims. Among those Saskatchewan communities inflicted with major losses were Nipawin and Hafford, Tisdale, Tobin Lake and Carrot River. There were 20,000 SaskPower customers without power. It was a busy summer for tornadoes in Ottawa with five tornadoes including an EF1 storm on July 13 that struck Barrhaven, 20 km south of the Ottawa city centre. A research project from Northern Tornado Project out of Western University (NTP) found about 20 tornadoes occurred across the Ottawa Valley over the past six years. It included seven tornadoes on September 21, 2018, one of which was an EF3 in the Dunrobin region with winds up to 265 km\/h. Alberta\u2019s Canada Day tornado was the most highly rated twister nationally in 2023. Moreover, it was one of the strongest top 20 tornadoes in Canada\u2019s history to be classified as violent or catastrophic (EF ratings of 4 or more). It is one of only three F4 tornadoes in Alberta and the strongest since the F4 tornado that struck Edmonton 35 years ago. The country's only documented F5 tornado occurred in Elie, Manitoba in June 2007. About 82 tornadoes occurred in 2023. Ontario led with 39 twisters, while 16 occurred in Alberta. While Saskatchewan has an average of 14 tornadoes per year (with highs of 25 in 2022 and 33 in 2012), only one tornado was reported in the province this year.

Here's why Bill 81 sparked a furious debate in the legislative assembly and kept MLAs up sleepless until 3 a.m. Wednesday before a majority of government members rammed the bill through. Social Sharing Bill 81 could be a harbinger of things to come in 2022, writes columnist Graham Thomson Graham Thomson \u00b7 For CBC Opinion \u00b7 Posted: Dec 10, 2021 6:00 AM MT | Last Updated: 3 hours ago Alberta Premier Jason Kenney speaks after the UCP annual meeting in Calgary last month. (The Canadian Press) comments This column is an opinion from Graham Thomson, an award-winning journalist who has covered Alberta politics for more than 30 years.\u00a0For more information about CBC's Opinion section , please see the FAQ . Bill 81, The Election Statutes Amendment Act, has a title designed to put the average Albertan to sleep. But this is the piece of legislation that sparked a furious debate in the legislative assembly and kept MLAs up sleepless until 3 a.m. Wednesday before a majority of government members rammed the bill through. The debate was long, raucous and at one time had the deputy Speaker of the assembly telling the government House leader, in so many words, to sit down and shut up. The altercation over Bill 81 exposed so many of the fault lines running through the political landscape that it was pretty much a microcosm of Alberta politics in 2021. 3 UCP MLAs vote against Bill 81 over bulk membership purchase issue Not only did it once again pit the NDP Opposition against the UCP government, it also revealed dissent inside the UCP caucus, displayed ongoing divisions within Alberta's conservative movement, and exhibited Premier Jason Kenney's tendency to invoke a top-down dictatorial style of leadership to win the day. Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul MLA Dave Hanson addresses the legislature Tuesday night as Calgary-Fish Creek MLA Richard Gotried looks on. Hanson, Gotfried and Chestermere-Strathmore MLA Leela Aheer broke with their UCP caucus members by voting against Bill 81. (Legislature Assembly of Alberta ) Bill 81 is a monumental piece of legislation weighing in at almost 170 pages and is so important it should really be called William 81, not a mere Bill. Even if you dozed off at the mention of The Election Statutes Amendment Act, you should care about Bill 81; about what it could have done, what it will do and, ominously, what it might yet do. Bill 81 goals Bill 81 originally set out to accomplish four goals: 1. Set up a fixed election date. Consequently, the next provincial election will take place May 29, 2023. 2. Close the Alberta Federation of Labour \"loophole,\" as Kenney describes it. The legislation ostensibly casts a wide net to stop any organizations \"affiliated\" with a political party from setting up a Political Action Committee to run political advertisements. But it's really aimed at preventing union-related organizations, notably the AFL, from using their money and clout to run ads attacking UCP government policies. The AFL is threatening to take legal action against the legislation, saying it is unconstitutional. 3. Bypass existing limits on financial contributions to political parties. The UCP has been falling behind by millions of dollars in fundraising to the NDP the past year. Bill 81 would have allowed well-heeled supporters to give unlimited money to political parties via local nomination contests, thereby bypassing a $4,200-a-year limit on contributions by individual Albertans. The extra money could then flow to party headquarters for use in a general election. However, this facet of the bill garnered so much outrage that the government backed down and amended the bill last Monday to put a cap on nomination-contest contributions to $4,000. That still allows more money into the system but at least puts a cap on it. 4. Buying bulk memberships. The bill allows, in theory, one person to buy hundreds of party memberships in other people's names without those people being notified. This raises the potential for political fraud and that's what sparked this week's tempestuous overnight debate. \"Tonight is an incredible night of anti-democracy and anti-grassroots,\" declared Independent MLA Drew Barnes who, along with MLA Todd Loewen, was kicked out of the UCP caucus last May after criticizing Kenney. \"The whole heart of this is that we're going from a situation where you cannot buy a membership for someone else to where you can now buy hundreds of memberships for someone else. I believe that's the heart of what the RCMP investigation is from three years ago into this premier and this leadership.\" Fractured politics Barnes was referring to the ongoing RCMP investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the 2017 UCP leadership race that Kenney won. Kenney has adamantly insisted he did nothing wrong. That immediately brought government House leader Jason Nixon to his feet who challenged the chair \u2014 deputy Speaker Angela Pitt \u2014 to explain why she was \"letting that rant go on about fake RCMP investigations.\" Pitt, who is a UCP MLA, immediately shut Nixon down: \"I'm about 44 seconds into listening to this member speak, in which most of that time has been listening to you yell at me from across the aisle.\" Minister of Justice and Solicitor General Kaycee Madu speaks at a news conference earlier this year. Madu is the sponsor of Bill 81. (CBC News) It was a\u00a0remarkable exchange, one for the legislative record books, and revealed more of the fractured nature of Alberta politics, particularly within the government caucus. UCP board denies grassroots' demands for earlier leadership vote on Kenney Perhaps most troubling for the government is how three members of the UCP caucus spoke against the bill, pointing to the possibility of someone with money in their pocket and wickedness in their heart unfairly influencing nomination contests or leadership votes. \"Right now in my household, between myself, my children, and my husband, I can buy 400 memberships per person, 1,600 memberships within my own family. That doesn't actually take the big money out in any respect,\" said UCP MLA Leela Aheer. Opinion Could Alberta's fiscal future include a provincial sales tax? Aheer, as well as UCP colleagues Richard Gotfried and David Hanson, wanted the government to add a simple amendment stating that anyone receiving a membership in any party must confirm their consent in writing. Instead, Justice Minister Kaycee Madu, the bill's sponsor, said the UCP's rules already forbid anyone from buying party memberships for somebody other than a spouse or dependent child. But as Madu acknowledged himself, the bill does not legally prevent one person buying multiple memberships for other people. Consequently, there is an ominous cloud hanging over Bill 81 that unnerves MLAs on all sides of the assembly who see the potential for backroom abuse by political parties\u00a0\u2014 and in this case, the party under that cloud is the UCP itself. This suspicion could taint the upcoming party vote on Kenney's leadership review. A group of 22 UCP constituency association presidents had banded together to demand the party hold the review before March 1 and ensure every party member could cast a ballot \u2014 either online or at a local voting station. Kenney touts 'Alberta is back' in first speech to Calgary Chamber since 2019 Instead, the UCP's board has declared the vote will take place on April 9 at a one-day convention in Red Deer where only those in attendance can vote \u2014 thus opening up the prospect of pro-Kenney forces manipulating the vote by stacking the meeting. Bill 81 is not only a microcosm of Alberta politics in 2021 but perhaps a harbinger of things to come in 2022.

By Morgan Winsor June 27, 2023, 6:56 PM 6:57 File image of the Titan submersible prior to commence diving. Ocean Gate Multinational search and rescue efforts for a submersible that disappeared while on a tour of the wreckage of the Titanic off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, have since become a recovery mission following the grim discovery that the deep-sea vessel had imploded underwater, killing all five people on board. While the recovery operation and investigation remain ongoing , here's what we know about the situation and how it unfolded. Sunday, June 18 The 21-foot sealed craft , named Titan, submerged at 8 a.m. ET with five people on board and a 96-hour oxygen supply. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the sealed craft lost contact with its operator, OceanGate Expeditions. At 5:40 p.m. ET, the United States Coast Guard received a report of an overdue submersible. The Titan was supposed to resurface at 3 p.m. ET. Monday, June 19 The U.S. Coast Guard in coordination with the Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Armed Forces conducted a surface search for the missing submersible using various aircraft, including one with underwater sonar capability. Tuesday, June 20 As of 7 a.m. ET, crews in multiple aircraft had flown over an area of the Atlantic Ocean \"roughly about the size of Connecticut\" while \"looking for any signs of surfacing,\" Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District, told ABC News. Bahamian research vessel Deep Energy, which specializes in pipe-laying and has remotely operated vehicle capabilities, arrived at 7 a.m. ET to help with the search. A source familiar confirmed to ABC News that there were reports of \"banging\" that were picked up by sonar in the search area sometime in the morning, but nothing has yet been found. At 4 p.m. ET, a crew from the New York Air National Guard arrived on scene to help with the search. Wednesday, June 21 At 12:18 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard announced via Twitter that a Canadian aircraft with sonar capabilities had \"detected underwater noises in the search area.\" Remotely operated vehicle operations (ROV) were then relocated \"in an attempt to explore the origin of the noises,\" according to the U.S. Coast Guard. \"Those ROV searches have yielded negative results but continue,\" the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted. Data on the noises was sent to the United States Navy to be examined, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. That evening, a U.S. Navy official told reporters that a portable crane system capable of bringing up items from as deep as 20,000 feet had arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland, but was waiting to be welded onto a chartered ship to take it to the search area. At the time, the U.S. Navy had not yet contracted a ship for the system, known as Fly Away Deep Ocean Salvage System or FADOSS, the official said. Once the ship is contracted, U.S. Navy teams will spend approximately 24 hours working around the clock to weld the system aboard the ship before it can leave port, according to the official. FADOSS is the salvage system the U.S. Navy uses for all of its deep-water recoveries. Thursday, June 22 At 6:56 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard announced via Twitter that a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV, deployed by the Canadian vessel Horizon Arctic has reached the sea floor, beginning its search for the missing submersible. The Titan's 96-hour oxygen supply was forecast to run out sometime in the morning. At 7:30 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted that the French vessel L'Atalante has deployed its ROV into the water in the search area. The Royal Canadian Navy's HMCS Glace Bay arrived on scene at around 8 a.m. ET. The ship provides a medical team specializing in dive medicine and a six-person mobile hyperbaric recompression chamber, according to officials. Meanwhile, Canadian Coast Guard ships John Cabot, Ann Harvey and Terry Fox were also on scene and ready to provide rescue equipment and personnel, should assistance be required. A Royal Canadian Air Force CP-140 Aurora aircraft was maintaining continuous on-scene support with additional aircrews and assets, officials said. At 11:48 a.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted that \"a debris field was discovered within the search area by an ROV near the Titanic\" and experts were \"evaluating the information.\" At 2:49 p.m. ET, OceanGate Expeditions issued a statement saying that all five people aboard the Titan were believed to be dead. During a press conference at 3 p.m. ET, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that an ROV has located the tail cone of the submersible about 1,600 feet from the bow of the wrecked Titanic. Additional debris found was \"consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber,\" according to Rear Adm. John Mauger, commander of the First Coast Guard District. The victims' families were \"immediately notified,\" he said. Five major pieces of the Titan, including its nose cone and pressure hull, were discovered by the ROV in a large debris field and a smaller debris field nearby, suggesting a major implosion had occurred , according to Mauger. At the time, it was too early to tell exactly when the implosion happened. It was also unclear whether crews would be able to recover the bodies of those killed and how much of the vessel can be salvaged. Mauger told reporters during the press conference that two ROVs, one from France and the other from Canada, will remain at the site to continue mapping the debris fields. At around 6 p.m. ET, a senior U.S. Navy official confirmed to ABC News that an underwater acoustic detection system heard on Sunday what was likely the implosion of the missing submersible. The information was immediately shared with the U.S. Coast Guard and analysis continued afterward, the official said. Separately, a U.S. defense official told ABC News that an analysis of the \"banging\" noises picked up by sonar buoys on Tuesday were not from the Titan but were either natural ocean sounds, biological noises or noises associated with the surface response vessels.

Rob Hill said the small bus that collided with the semi was carrying about 25 people\u00a0\u2014 most of whom were seniors from in and around the western Manitoba city of Dauphin, about 150 kilometres north of Carberry. Ten survivors were taken to hospital for their injuries, but Hill said the number of casualties may shift into the evening. \"Sadly, this is a day in Manitoba and across Canada that will be remembered as one of tragedy and incredible sadness,\" Hill said, adding many people in the Dauphin area are still waiting for news about their loved ones. \"To all those waiting, I can't imagine how difficult it is not knowing if the person you love the most will be making it home tonight.

Both drivers alive: RCMP Supt. Rob Lasson, the Manitoba RCMP's officer in charge of major crime services, said Mounties were dispatched to the crash scene at 11:43 a.m. An initial investigation determined the seniors' bus was going south on Highway 5 and was crossing the eastbound lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway when it got hit by the semi, Lasson said. He said it's still early in what is a complex investigation and all the answers aren't immediately available. Investigators in Manitoba are connecting with those in Saskatchewan who worked on the deadly Humboldt Broncos crash for assistance, Lasson said. The\u00a0drivers of both vehicles are\u00a0alive and in hospital, but Lasson would not say which vehicle had the right of way. \"Answers will take some time, but I can assure you that the RCMP\u00a0will get the answers,\" Lasson said. \"Even at the outset of an investigation such as this, we need to be alive to the fact that there could be wrongdoing.

Massive emergency response The response to the crash included\u00a014 critical care medical crew and\u00a0two helicopters\u00a0from the STARS (Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service) air ambulance service, as well as two planes. STARS spokesperson Blake Robert said it was\u00a0one of the service's biggest responses ever. \"This is sort of in line with the similar large incidents that we responded to in the past, such as the tragedy with Humboldt Broncos, the incident in James Smith Cree Nation ,\" Robert said in a phone interview.

Today, it came,\" Cumpsty said. Most of the survivors' injuries were either head injuries or orthopedic, Shared Health chief executive officer Lanette Siragusa said at the news conference. First responders, including police and firefighters, were at the scene of the crash Thursday afternoon. (Travis Golby\/CBC) A spokesperson for Shared Health said earlier in the day that a mass casualty response had been initiated,\u00a0with several Manitoba hospitals prepared to receive patients from the crash, including HSC\u00a0\u2014 the province's largest hospital\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and others in the Prairie Mountain and Winnipeg health regions.

Nick Iwanyshyn\/The Canadian Press\/AP CNN \u2014 A 24-year-old student has been charged with stabbing three people during a gender studies class at the University of Waterloo in Canada this week in what police are calling a \u201c hate-motivated incident.\u201d The suspect, Geovanny Villalba-Aleman, is an international student who recently graduated from the university, Waterloo Regional Police Service Chief Mark Crowell said during a Thursday news conference. Villalba-Aleman is accused of targeting the gender studies class, and \u201cinvestigators believe this was a hate-motivated incident related to gender expression and gender identity,\u201d according to a news release from the Waterloo Regional Police Service . He has been charged with three counts of aggravated assault; four counts of assault with a weapon; two counts of possessing a weapon for a dangerous purpose; and mischief under $5,000. \u201cIt is both sad and disturbing that this incident has occurred during Pride month,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cWe hope this incident does not diminish from these celebrations but, instead, encourages us all to come together.\u201d Police say the suspect walked into a university lecture classroom on Wednesday around 3:30 p.m. and stabbed a 38-year-old professor, a 20-year-old female student and a 19-year-old male student with a knife. Roughly 40 students were inside the classroom at the time of the attack, police said. At 3:37 p.m., police received multiple 911 calls from students at the university, saying people were stabbed inside a classroom, Crowell said. The first police officer arrived on the scene within three minutes, the chief said. The victims\u2019 injuries are serious but not life-threatening, and all were being treated at hospitals, police spokesperson Cherri Greeno told CNN Wednesday. Officers found the suspect in the same building where the stabbings took place \u2013 Hagey Hall \u2013 and placed him under arrest \u201cwithout further incident,\u201d Crowell said. The suspect initially posed as a victim before officers quickly identified him, he added. Villalba-Aleman was not a member of the class, Crowell said, but spoke with the professor of the class \u201cbefore attacking her with two large knives without provocation.\u201d Several students attempted to stop the attack while others fled the room, Crowell said. As students were trying to escape, the suspect stabbed two students and attempted to stab a third student, who was not injured, he said. \u201cWe have since sought judicial authorizations to search the suspect\u2019s home to further our investigation,\u201d Crowell said during the news conference. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no information to suggest the suspect coordinated with anyone else in carrying out this attack.\u201d The stabbings prompted the university to issue orders to vacate the building and shelter in place order as police responded to the scene.

An investigation exposed Macdonald\u2019s long history of working as essentially the chief propagandist with the neo-Nazi terrorist organization Atomwaffen. \u201cMr. Macdonald allegedly helped produce propaganda material for the benefit of the terrorist entity Atomwaffen Division,\u201d reads the RCMP press release . \u201cHe allegedly participated in and facilitated the creation, production and distribution of three terrorist propaganda videos.\u201d \u201cThis case is the first in Canada in which an individual advocating a violent far-right ideology has been charged with both terrorism and hate propaganda.\u201d The RCMP did not comment on VICE News\u2019 original story. Following the publication of Macdonald\u2019s identity by VICE News, the neo-Nazi was raided by the RCMP in early 2022 and several computers were seized. At the time,Macdonald was living in his parent\u2019s home, where he was running a small graphic design business. Read Next Two of the Worst Far-Right Groups Are Now Fighting Each Other Sources indicated to VICE News that he remained active with the extreme right after he was identified. Earlier this year, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network published an article alleging that he was a member of a Canadian Active Club, a neo-Nazi fitness group. Macdonald was an immensely influential neo-Nazi propagandist and his work inspired other neo-Nazis and was one of the cornerstones of an aesthetic that became known as \u201cterrorwave.\u201d Macdonald first joined the movement in 2017 via the influential neo-Nazi website Iron March, where he linked up Atomwaffen, an infamous neo-Nazi group connected to multiple murders. Using the alias \u201cDark Foreigner,\u201d Macdonald quickly became the group\u2019s chief propagandist and created posters and artwork celebrating terrorism, bigotry, and violence. \u201cDark Foreigner was a critical figure in the development of the neofascist accelerationism aesthetic,\u201d Matthew Kriner, the managing director of the Accelerationism Research Consortium told VICE News. \u201cHis arrest shows that law enforcement in Canada is committed to addressing and disrupting the growing threat of accelerationist violence and hate.

On top of creating artwork and propaganda for these neo-Nazi groups, Macdonald actively helped organize and tried to grow the groups, even traveling internationally to visit neo-Nazis overseas, VICE News has previously reported . Multiple people that Macdonald worked and palled around with would catch terrorism charges in the United Kingdom. Other unnamed individuals were arrested alongside Macdonald but have not been named nor charged by the RCMP. Canada declared Atomwaffen a terrorist organization in February of 2021.

(Sade London) Social Sharing Day 6 9:28 Non-binary student says requiring parental consent for name and pronoun changes is misguided and dangerous Sade London, a non-binary high school student from Saint John, N.B., isn't\u00a0proud to say their province was the first when it comes to changing\u00a0policy regarding pronoun use\u00a0in schools. They say they're worried about what could happen to LGBTQ youth in different parts of Canada now that other provinces are\u00a0looking at obtaining parental consent before\u00a0their child can use a\u00a0chosen name or pronoun\u00a0at school. \"It's a very sickening situation. And the fact that it's being spread to more than my province... it makes my stomach turn,\" said London, who is about to start Grade 11. London was among the\u00a0students who protested New Brunswick's changes to its Policy 713 earlier this year. Saskatchewan Education Minister Dustin Duncan announced students under the age of 16 will need parental permission to change their preferred name and pronouns in school. (Michael Bell\/The Canadian Press) Last week, Saskatchewan's Education Minister Dustin Duncan announced a pronoun consent policy for students under 16 that echoed the changes in New Brunswick. Duncan says the policy in Saskatchewan\u00a0is meant to increase parental involvement and make sure kids are safe in schools. The policy is facing a challenge from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA), who argue it's discriminatory because it singles out students who are trans and gender-diverse. Saskatchewn Premier Scott Moe defended the government's move by citing an Angus Reid poll that found most Canadians surveyed support the idea that parents should be informed if their child changes pronouns at school. A number of teachers, LGBTQ activists and students have come out to say they believe these policies could endanger youth. \"If parents that aren't very accepting \u2026 find out their kid is trans and is trying to live out their true life at school, they can get very angry and it can end in very serious situations,\" said London. N.B. gender-identity policy will keep kids in the closet, says father of trans teen Civil liberties association calls Sask. government school naming and pronoun policy discriminatory They spoke with Day 6 guest host Stephanie Skenderis\u00a0about experimenting with their gender identity at school and why politicians should talk to LGBTQ youth before drafting policy. Here is part of their conversation. What does it mean to you to have people in your school community call you by the right name and pronouns? It is the most affirming thing ever. I'm so excited to go back to school. It's only August, but to know I get to exist as Sade, which is a chosen name of mine, and get to also be called they and he and not\u00a0just she is so exciting. I just feel a lot like myself. It's just like a form of expression, like listening to different music or like drinking the same brand of coffee every day. What does it feel like to be called by a name or by pronouns that don't match your gender identity? It's really weird. Sometimes I forget who it is because I feel so affirmed in a lot of areas of my life, especially school. But being called a name that doesn't line up with me is just confusing. And it feels like people have a lack of respect for me and how I want to be referred to. WATCH | People rally in Saskatoon against new sexual education, pronoun policies in province's schools People rally in Saskatoon against new sexual education, pronoun policies in province's schools 2 years ago Duration 3:05 Sunday's rally was the latest in a wave of opposition to the education policies announced earlier in Saskatchewan last week. Can you help us understand why some students use different pronouns at school than at home? Using different pronouns at school \u2014\u00a0 it felt like a safe \u2014 like an experimental zone, because I knew the staff and the students around me were really supportive. And if I wanted to only go by she\/her or only go\u00a0by they\/them ... the people around me would support me without knowing me my whole life, like my family or like anyone in my home situation. Do you know anyone who doesn't want to tell their parents? I know multiple friends that don't want to tell their parents and have admitted the fact that they might not use the same pronouns that align with their sex assigned at birth. There's so many more than you might think. Poilievre says schools should leave LGBTQ issues to parents Something we've been hearing is that some parents who are in favour of policy changes, like the ones in New Brunswick or Saskatchewan, say that they feel they have the right to know what their kids are doing in school. What would you say to them? Kids themselves and these trans kids in this situation know [which] people around them are safe more than anyone. They know if their parents are a safe place to go to or if they feel comfortable talking to them about that sort of situation. Even though it's a very new concept to so many, it's ultimately up to the parents to create that safe space for their kids to be able to tell them these things. And maybe school does that first and maybe friends [do] that first\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 create\u00a0that safe space first before parents do for kids, which is an unfortunate reality. But you shouldn't have to force your kid to tell you about these things. They should want to come to you because they think of you as a safe space. Sade London, who is a non-binary student at Saint John High School, attending a protest against changes to New Brunswick's Policy 713 this summer. (Grey Watts) When you look at your own school system, how do you think your teachers are going to deal with this situation? Before I even started writing the name Sade on my tests and quizzes and homework that I handed in at\u00a0school, I also wrote my other name in brackets just so my teachers should know who's who. My teachers picked up my name very, very quickly and heard it amongst friends, and it was so empowering and validating to just know that like\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 I'd been outed\u00a0non-binary\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0but once I came up with a new name, they were just so supportive \u2026 I know a lot of teachers take pride in the fact that they can have a safe space for kids at school ... Having to decide that and putting that weight on their shoulders to decide if it's okay,\u00a0it hurts my heart because I know so many of them just want to [create] an accepting space.

Agence France-Presse World News Oct 20, 2023 07:39 am IST Published On Oct 20, 2023 01:55 am IST Last Updated On Oct 20, 2023 07:39 am IST Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Canada announced Thursday it had been forced to repatriate 41 of its 62 diplomats based in India. Montreal: Canada said Thursday it had withdrawn 41 diplomats from India -- fallout from a bitter row over the killing of a Khalistani terrorist on Canadian soil. India planned to \"unethically\"\u00a0revoke diplomatic immunity for all but 21 of Canada's diplomats and their families by Friday, forcing Ottawa to pull out the others, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said. \"We have facilitated their safe departure from India,\" Ms Joly added. \"This means that our diplomats and their families have now left.\" Relations between India and Canada have plunged since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month publicly linked Indian intelligence to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which India has denied. Nijjar, who advocated for a separate Sikh state carved out of India, was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. \"Revoking the diplomatic immunity of 41 diplomats is not only unprecedented, but also contrary to international law,\" Ms Joly said Wednesday, but said Canada did not plan to retaliate in kind, so as to not \"aggravate the situation.\" \"Canada will continue to defend international law, which applies to all nations and will continue to engage with India,\" she said. \"Now more than ever we need diplomats on the ground and we need to talk to one another,\" Joly added. - Countermeasures - Canada has called for India to cooperate in the investigation but New Delhi has rejected the allegations and taken countermeasures, such as shutting down visa services for Canadians. Ottawa also expelled an Indian diplomat over the affair. External Affairs Minister SJaishankar said last month in New York that his country would be willing to examine any evidence presented by Canada. \"We have actually been badgering the Canadians. We've given them loads of information about organized crime leadership which operates out of Canada,\" Mr Jaishankar said, referring to Sikh separatists. \"We have a situation where actually our diplomats are threatened, our consulates have been attacked and often comments are made (that are) interference in our politics,\" he said. The Indian government has called the Canadian accusations over the killing \"absurd\" and advised its nationals not to travel to certain Canadian regions \"given the increase in anti-Indian activities.\" India also temporarily stopped processing visa applications in Canada. Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a Canadian citizen in 2015, was shot dead by two masked assailants in the parking lot of a Sikh temple near Vancouver in June. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal group calling for creating a separate state of Khalistan. The Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s. The tensions between Ottawa and New Delhi have created a delicate situation for close Canadian ally Washington, which has in recent months taken steps to move closer to India as the United States seeks to limit Chinese influence in the region.

The Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) has said that \"gender-affirming medical interventions may be an important component of comprehensive care\" for some transgender or gender-diverse adolescents. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is not bound to adopt any of the policies that were passed at this convention. Poilievre did not take questions from reporters\u00a0after the votes. 'Protect your wives and daughters' Liam O'Brien, a Newfoundland and Labrador delegate, noted that \"Canada is watching\"\u00a0as Conservatives debate controversial policies like this one. \"Canada is also watching our leader kick Justin Trudeau's ass,\" O'Brien\u00a0said as he\u00a0urged delegates to keep the focus on the high cost of living and \"Liberal incompetence.\" On another transgender-related policy, delegates voted by an overwhelming 87 per cent to support a plan to\u00a0demand single-sex spaces that are only open to women, which the party now defines as a \"female person\" with the adoption of the policy. The policy is\u00a0intended\u00a0to keep transgender and other gender-diverse people out of women's prisons, shelters, locker rooms and washrooms. Badalich\u00a0said it's \"not extremist\"\u00a0to demand that what she calls\u00a0\"biological women\"\u00a0have a space to call their own. \"Vote yes to protect your wives and daughters,\"\u00a0said another delegate, a\u00a015-year-old\u00a0from Sherwood Park, Alta. A dissenting delegate from Quebec who did not give her name\u00a0said \"the Liberals will love nothing more\"\u00a0than to see Conservatives pass policies like this one and use discriminatory rhetoric to describe sexual minorities. \"Please, let's get the Liberals out. Let's get elected,\"\u00a0she said. Poilievre invokes former Liberal prime ministers' fiscal records in speech at Conservative convention Flush with cash, Conservatives plan to roll out more ads touting Poilievre The convention also adopted a proposal from the Alberta riding of Medicine Hat-Cardston-Warner to impose stiffer penalties on sex offenders and pedophiles. \"Children are little angels of the world,\"\u00a0a delegate from that riding named Logan said during the debate.\u00a0He said there are\u00a0nefarious actors who are trying to \"assault, sexualize and traffic our children,\"\u00a0and a Poilievre-led government needs to crackdown on the practice. About 86 per cent of the delegates agreed there should be \"stronger legislation\"\u00a0to try and curb these activities. On the issue of vaccines, an Ontario delegate and medical doctor pleaded with Conservatives to reject mandates so to avoid repeat of what transpired during the COVID-19 health crisis. \"Justin Trudeau's coercive, divisive and ineffective vaccine mandate is a violation of the human right to bodily autonomy. Stand up for freedom, stand up for common sense,\" said Dr. Matt Strauss, the former acting medical officer of health for Haldimand-Norfolk. Delegates agreed with about 68 per cent voting to \"affirm Canadians have the freedom and right to refuse vaccines.\" The delegates were in lockstep on most policy matters. Hiring policies On the issue of preferential hiring for minorities by research institutions,\u00a0delegates passed a policy that said federally funded jobs should go to a person who's best qualified, \"irrespective of the personal immutable characteristics,\" stated the motion. Adrian Dylianou, a\u00a0Saskatchewan delegate who backed the policy,\u00a0said \"woke ideology\"\u00a0should be rooted out of Canada's universities. The \"woke ideology whims of whoever is in power\"\u00a0is not the way to structure a workplace, he said. Justin Vuong, an\u00a0Edmonton delegate\u00a0who identified as a\u00a0visible minority, said all job choices should be decided on merit, not the colour of a person's skin. WATCH | Pierre Poilievre's first leadership convention speech Watch Poilievre's entire speech at Conservative convention 2 years ago Duration 1:06:04 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attacked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's economic and fiscal record, as he doubled down on his promise to balance the federal budget, at his party's national policy convention Friday evening. About 95 per cent of members on hand for the vote agreed. On a similar matter, 81 per cent of delegates supported a policy to end \"forced political, cultural or ideological training of any kind\" at a workplace, such as\u00a0mandatory diversity training and other such programs. Discussion about the motion\u00a0focused on Jordan Peterson, a professor with a large following in right-wing circles\u00a0who was ordered by the College of Psychologists of Ontario to take social media training in the wake\u00a0of\u00a0complaints about his controversial online posts and statements. \"Two words: Jordan Peterson,\"\u00a0one Alberta\u00a0delegate said during the debate. \"Forced cultural or ideological training \u2014 none of us that support that,\" he said. Oil and gas Virtually all those assembled agreed that Canada should have more \"robust measures to counter foreign interference\"\u00a0amid alleged Chinese meddling, improve services for Canada's veterans, eliminate the deficit, reduce the national debt\u00a0to tackle\u00a0\"inter-generational inequity,\"\u00a0and streamline the natural resources regulatory approvals process. In another vote, 84 per cent of delegates agreed there should be a \"purposeful, gradual transition to a lower carbon-use future,\"\u00a0but the country should continue to use oil and gas. A majority of voters also\u00a0supported a renewed push to get more infrastructure built to move those fuels to market. During a spirited\u00a0debate on high-speed rail, an urban-rural divide became obvious as competing speakers weighed in on whether the Tories should back a new rail network. A Nova Scotia delegate said that\u00a0rural dwellers shouldn't be forced to pay for proposed projects that would primarily benefit the country's cities. Trudeau blasted for passport redesign Earlier Saturday, Daniel Hannon, a member of the British House of Lords and a prominent Brexit campaigner,\u00a0delivered a speech to the convention\u00a0blasting Trudeau for allegedly unpatriotic acts taken by his government. A reoccurring theme of the Conservative convention is Tory disgust with the government's redesign of the passport. On Trudeau's watch, the document was stripped of references to notable events in Canada's history, including the country's First World War victory at the battle of Vimy Ridge. The government also dumped images of Terry Fox, who became a national hero with his Marathon of Hope, Quebec City's historic old quarter and the Famous Five trailblazing Canadian women who helped advance women's rights. These changes have been interpreted by many Conservatives delegates as an attempt to erase Canada's history. \"Who would want to efface the images of your history from the passports? Who would want to replace the pictures that tell your story with generic shapes and patterns that could come from anywhere?\"\u00a0Hannon said. \"Canadians are not a random set of individuals who happen to qualify for the same passport,\" he said.\u00a0\"Canadians are a nation and not just any nation \u2014 they're bound together by shared stories and shared dreams.\" Poilievre shares Hannon's\u00a0position that the country should embrace\u00a0a more robust form of national pride. In his keynote address Friday, Poilievre said Trudeau's trying to suppress Canadian patriotism. \"Justin Trudeau wants to cancel our proud history, erasing it from our passports,\"\u00a0Poilievre said. \"Why? Because there can be no heroes but him.\" \"This business of deleting our past must end. And this is a matter on which English Canada must learn from Quebec. Quebecers\u00a0\u2014 and I'm saying this in English deliberately \u2014 do not apologize for their culture, language or history. They celebrate it. All Canadians should do the same.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR John Paul Tasker Senior reporter J.P. Tasker is a journalist in CBC's parliamentary bureau who reports for digital, radio and television.

Following Pratt's announcement, Woodhouse, 40, took the stage at the Shaw Centre, where she read the assembly's oath of office and received an\u00a0AFN medallion around her neck. The new leader promised to start working immediately and tirelessly on child welfare, housing, economic development, policing and other core issues facing communities, pointing to the upcoming federal budget as a first order of business. \"Canada, you cannot forget First Nations,\" she said to applause. \"You take our money from our land, you have to make sure that you work with us to get that out the door to our communities.\" Woodhouse, the AFN's regional chief for Manitoba, had 50.8 per cent support from 461 delegates registered to vote, while Pratt, first vice-chief for the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations in Saskatchewan, trailed with 39.3 per cent support on a sixth ballot late Wednesday night.

In her speech, Woodhouse offered an olive branch, thanking Archibald for smashing the glass ceiling and becoming the first woman national chief. WATCH | Woodhouse says housing is a top priority: Challenges ahead for incoming AFN National Chief Cindy Woodhouse 1 year ago Duration 2:06 Cindy Woodhouse faces some big challenges as only the third woman to lead the Assembly of First Nations. She was part of the executive committee that recommended previous national chief, RoseAnne Archibald, be removed, which fractured the organization. Woodhouse's supporters stressed the strength of her platform, organizing and campaigning,\u00a0while some opponents felt the AFN should focus on defending First Nations rights rather than co-operating with government. At a news\u00a0conference Thursday afternoon, CBC Indigenous asked Woodhouse to respond to those chiefs keen on a more adversarial approach. \"Yes, sometimes we have to kick down doors,\" she said. \"But at the time, I think that, in this moment, I'm coming in here as a fresh start to try and say, 'Let's work through some of these issues together.'\" Chief Allen Polchies Jr. from St. Mary's First Nation in New Brunswick took the mic after the fifth round of voting on Wednesday night and expressed his frustration about how long the process was taking. (Fenn Mayes\/CBC) Jeff Copenace, chief of the Ojibways of Onigaming in Ontario, was supporting Pratt\u00a0based on the recommendation of a community youth delegation Copenace brought to the assembly. Copenace was also a vocal Archibald backer, calling her ouster \"a national embarrassment.\" But after the election, Copenance expressed optimism about the future and excitement to see another woman lead the assembly. \"There is always going to be debates about whether we should be more conciliatory or whether we should take a harder approach in terms of protests or blockades,\" he said in an interview. \"And the reality is that all of them are necessary.\" Rising frustration\u00a0during rounds of voting On Wednesday, the mood became tense as the night wore on\u00a0with no one close to the 60 per cent mark, particularly after Pratt got a late boost from Sheila North, who was eliminated after the third ballot. North\u00a0endorsed Pratt in her concession speech, criticizing\u00a0the \"disrespect\" shown Archibald and\u00a0offering\u00a0thinly veiled criticism of Woodhouse. By ballot five, chants of \"concede! concede!\" rang out from the Woodhouse camp, only to be met with \"David! David!\" from Pratt's. They were separated only by a small aisle in the convention centre but the difference\u00a0between their visions seemed pronounced. David Pratt, first vice-chief for the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, considers his options as the election went late into the evening on Wednesday. (Fenn Mayes\/CBC) Pratt wasn't shy of criticizing the federal government, pitching a return to the AFN's foundational vision. Woodhouse, in a scrum with reporters, said she looked forward to working with both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre. Woodhouse told reporters she and Pratt didn't reach a deal before he withdrew, but rather\u00a0a mutual understanding to work together. In his concession speech, Pratt urged the assembly to unite. \"She has my 100 per cent support. Her success is all of our success, so let's lay aside the animosity,\" he said. \"Let's lay aside all the garbage. Let's lay aside all the voices. Let's lay aside all the negativity from the media, and let's come together and let's be the powerful, united AFN.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Brett Forester Reporter Brett Forester is a reporter with CBC Indigenous in Ottawa.

The Front Commun, which includes members of four major public sector unions representing a \u201ccommon front\u201d of some 420,000 workers, will be on the picket line through Thursday. The group includes the majority of elementary and high school teachers as well as school support staff. It also includes health-care workers like orderlies and technicians.

The Quebec government\u2019s latest offer included a 10.3 per cent salary increase over five years and a one-time payment of $1,000 to each worker. Quebec Treasury Board President Sonia LeBel said the offer was a serious one while unions roundly rejected the proposal.

Speaking in Quebec City on Tuesday, Lebel suggested that the government was open to modifying its offer but said a main sticking point is the \u201corganization of work.\u201d The province, she said, wants to pay workers more for accepting less desirable shifts, such as on nights and weekends. The government\u2019s goal, she said, \u201cis for the day after the signing of the agreement, to see an impact not only in the daily lives of our employees, but also to have improved services for citizens.\u201d Story continues below advertisement Flanked by the ministers of education and health, LeBel said the unions are focusing on the salaries to make a case for a strike. \u201cBut when we talk to nurses, when we talk to teachers, they\u2019re talking about their workload.\u201d However, she said the government won\u2019t be able to, in the short term, meet a union demand to reduce the ratio of students to teachers in the province\u2019s schools because of labour shortages.

Mary Simon announces 78 new appointments to Order of Canada 1 year ago Duration 6:20 The Governor General has announced 78 new appointments to the Order of Canada \u2014 a list that includes activists, authors, artists, Indigenous leaders and other accomplished Canadians. Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and honouree Susanne Craig discusses this distinction and the current climate of journalism. The Pulitzer Prize\u00a0website says their 18-month investigation debunked Trump's \"claims of self-made wealth and revealed a business empire riddled with tax dodges.\" Reached in New York, Craig told CBC News that when she got the call from the Governor\u00a0General's office, she thought they had the wrong person. \"I don't live in Canada\u00a0but I am a Canadian through and through, and I started crying when I got the call ...\u00a0I couldn't believe it,\" she said. Crossing Trump Craig said she hopes the award draws attention to the work\u00a0of journalists, whom she described as a \"dying breed\" across the globe. \"Our work ... particularly on Donald Trump and his finances, it shows that one reporter\u00a0or a small team of reporters\u00a0can really make a difference,\" she said. \"When reporters are laid off,\u00a0or they're just not there to bear witness, things do go uncovered. We all benefit from a healthy press.\" Michael de Adder, an editorial cartoonist based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, joins Craig on the member's list for his \"artistic contributions and pointed commentary\" over the years.

While his freelance gig with BNI\u00a0came\u00a0to an end, de Adder was employed by the Washington Post two years later, a position he still holds. \"I think it's amazing. I can't express how happy it made me. The first feeling you have is unworthy, but it's great,\" he told CBC News about being inducted into the Order of Canada. De Adder said he does not know what the future holds for editorial cartooning, but awards like the Order of Canada can draw attention to how important his profession is in the current climate. \"Every time a cartoonist gets an Order of Canada \u2026 it highlights how important editorial cartooning is to democracy,\" he said. \"These days, we're constantly under attack.\" Indigenous leadership in arts, heritage, politics Willie Adams, 89\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the first Inuit appointed to the Senate in Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was honoured this year for his \"long-standing support of Indigenous interests\u00a0and for advancing Indigenous representation in Canadian legislation.\" Adams, who was made an officer of the Order of Canada, said the news was a \"shock\" because he did not expect to get such a \"big award.\" Deantha Rae Edmunds, Canada's first Inuk opera singer, was made a member of the order\u00a0\"for her original compositions and her mentorship of young Indigenous musicians.\" P.E.I. historian Ed MacDonald 'gobsmacked' to be named to the Order of Canada Indigenous author and activist, Raptors president, prolific songwriter joining Order of Canada She said that it means a lot to her to be recognized for dedicating her life to music. \"I'm still in disbelief about this appointment.

She said it's\u00a0a \"privilege\" to live in a country that strives to improve through the generations. \"I hope that I won't waste the opportunity because if there is attention on me, then there is a responsibility that comes with it. And my responsibility is to speak up for those who don't have their voices heard,\" she said. Retired general Raymond Henault has been made a member of the Order of Canada.
