The broadcast, according to military officials, came from a Russian spy ship, the Kildin, as the vessel packed with intelligence-gathering equipment drifted temporarily out of control off the Syrian coast on Jan. 23, with flames and black fumes rising from its smokestack. The Associated Press obtained audio of the broadcast, as well as video and photos showing the blaze, that three military officials said were gathered by a ship from a NATO nation operating nearby. The officials, also from a NATO country, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven\u2019t publicly reported. The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia\u2019s fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely because of concerns that Moscow might sabotage underwater cables and pipelines amid tensions over the war in Ukraine . Even though the Kildin was in trouble, the secretive ship didn\u2019t respond to an offer of help from the NATO vessel, the officials said.

They said the blaze burned for at least four hours and that the Kildin\u2019s crew removed the covers from lifeboats though they never put them to sea. The Kildin also hoisted two black balls from its masts \u2014 a maritime signal that the ship can no longer steer, the officials said. They said the crew eventually regained control and that the Kildin is still stationed and gathering intelligence off the Syrian port of Tartus, accompanied by a frigate and a supply vessel. It is not clear what caused the blaze. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on a broadcast from a Russian spy ship that hit trouble off Syria. \u200e Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he wasn\u2019t aware of a fire aboard the Kildin and didn\u2019t say what the ship was doing at the time. He dismissed suggestions that it reflected poorly on Russian naval readiness. \u201cAssessing the state of the fleet based on the breakdown of one particular ship or one particular malfunction is not professional,\u201d Peskov said. Military officials say this photo taken from a nearby vessel shows smoke rising from a fire aboard the Russian spy ship Kildin off the coast of Syria on Jan. 23, 2025. (AP Photo) Retired Vice Adm. Michel Olhagaray, a former head of France\u2019s center for higher military studies, said that even though the Kildin regained steering, the fire highlights the logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean, far from its bases in the Arctic and the Baltic Sea. Moscow also is no longer able to use its Black Sea Fleet for Mediterranean patrols because during the Ukraine war Turkey isn\u2019t allowing warships to pass through the Bosporus, which links the Black and Mediterranean seas. \u201cThe maintenance of this Russian fleet, particularly in the Mediterranean, is extraordinarily complex,\u201d Olhagaray said. Audio captures radio exchanges The audio gathered by the NATO ship is a 75-second radio exchange between the Kildin and a Togo-flagged cargo ship, Milla Moon, the officials said. Sound of a man aboard the Kildin broadcasting over a maritime radio channel \u200e The AP also obtained a second recording of conversations among crew members aboard the NATO ship. In that, they can be heard identifying the exchange they\u2019ve just monitored as being between the Kildin and a Togolese vessel. Military officials provided both recordings to the AP, which was not able to independently authenticate them. Ship-tracking websites that use the data vessels emit on their identity, position, speed and course show the Milla Moon lifted anchor off Tartus and started cruising northward along Syria\u2019s coast on Jan. 23. That was the day of the Kildin fire, also in waters off Tartus, the military officials said. They said the Kildin at first identified itself to the Milla Moon as another ship, the Sky, and then asked to switch channels to continue the conversation. After the switch, the man with accented English is then heard identifying his vessel as a warship. \u201cMotor vessel Milla Moon, this is warship on your course,\u201d the voice can be heard saying on the clip. \u201cPlease hear me.\u201d Sound of a man aboard the Kildin broadcasting over a maritime radio channel \u200e He asks the Milla Moon to steer clear. \u201cI am drifting.

{"year":"2025","month":"01","event_desc":"17 January  Iran and Russia sign a \"comprehensive strategic partnership treaty\".","text":"Iranian and Russian leaders praise deal covering areas including politics, security, trade, transport and energy. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Russian President Vladimir Putin have signed a cooperation pact, deepening the partnership between two of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned nations. Iranian and Russian officials said the \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership treaty\u201d covers areas from trade and military cooperation to science, culture and education. At a joint news conference with Pezeshkian in Moscow on Friday, Putin praised the deal as a \u201creal breakthrough creating conditions for the stable and sustainable development of Russia, Iran and the entire region.\u201d The Kremlin earlier said that the treaty will enhance the \u201cmilitary-political and trade-economic\u201d relations between Tehran and Moscow, though the specifics remain undisclosed. Pezeshkian said the two countries were entering a new chapter in relations, especially in trade. The leaders said the two countries would intensify cooperation across a range of areas including politics, security, trade, transport and energy. Both countries have increased their trade activities in response to Western sanctions. Iran has already provided Russia with self-detonating \u201cShahed\u201d drones, which Moscow has used in its nightly strikes on Ukraine, according to Ukrainian and Western officials. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has viewed Iran as a key strategic partner, a move that has alarmed Western officials who see both nations as destabilising forces globally.    Negotiations for the new treaty have taken years. The current framework between the two countries is based on a 2001 agreement that has been periodically renewed. \u201cThe treaty \u2026 is constructive in nature and is aimed at strengthening the capabilities of Russia, Iran, and our friends in various parts of the world,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday. The treaty is expected to remain in force for 20 years, the state-owned news agency TASS reported, citing Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali. Building closer ties with Iran, China, and North Korea has been a central focus of Putin\u2019s foreign policy as he seeks to challenge what he calls US-led \u201cglobal hegemony.\u201d Pezeshkian\u2019s visit to Russia comes after Tehran faced several foreign policy setbacks last year. These included a Syrian opposition offensive that toppled President Bashar al-Assad, a key Russian and Iranian ally, and the weakening of the Iran-aligned Lebanese armed Hezbollah group after a war with Israel. The treaty was signed just days before Trump\u2019s return to power. The US president-elect, who has long been an advocate for an uncompromising stance against Iran, has threatened swift military action to end the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. During his first term, Trump withdrew from a multinational deal that provided Iran with sanctions relief in exchange for nuclear restrictions. In 2020, Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Iraq, sparking outrage in Iran. Last year, Trump warned that the US would \u201cwipe [Iran] off the face of the Earth\u201d if an alleged Iranian plot to kill him had succeeded.

Ukraine says it has captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia\u2019s Kursk region and taken them to Kyiv, where investigators were questioning them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the two prisoners of war were \u201ccommunicating\u201d with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency. \u201cRussian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea\u2019s involvement in the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on Saturday. Ukraine\u2019s SBU said in a statement that one of the captured soldiers had no documents at all, while the other had been carrying a Russian military ID card in the name of a man from Tuva, a Russian region bordering Mongolia. \u201cThe prisoners do not speak Ukrainian, English or Russian, so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence,\u201d the statement said. According to the SBU, one of the soldiers claimed he had been told he was going to Russia for training, rather than to fight against Ukraine. The agency said both men were provided with medical care in line with the Geneva Conventions. Ukraine did not provide evidence that the captured soldiers were from North Korea. Kyiv has repeatedly said North Korean troops are fighting in the Kursk region, where it launched an incursion\u00a0in August, claiming control over several hundred square kilometres of territory. However, this is the first time that the country\u2019s intelligence services said they have had the opportunity to question North Korean soldiers. While Ukraine had previously claimed to have captured North Korean soldiers in combat, it said they had been badly wounded and died shortly afterwards. Last month, a senior Ukrainian military official claimed that some 200 North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk had been killed or wounded in battle. The estimate of North Korean casualties came weeks after Ukraine announced that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 to 12,000 soldiers to Russia to help it in its almost three-year war against its much smaller neighbour.

The Kremlin said it had \u201c no complaints against Borisov \u201d and described the reshuffle as a \u201cplanned rotation.\u201d \u201cThe corporation needs dynamic development, which is why these personnel changes are taking place,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. news Russian Space Agency Says Break With West Cost It $2.1 Bln Read more A former deputy defense minister under Sergei Shoigu, Borisov was appointed to lead Roscosmos in July 2022, months after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine isolated it from Western space programs. Under his tenure, Russia\u2019s first independent Moon exploration mission in decades ended in failure when the Luna-25 probe crashed in August 2023. The space agency also faced corruption scandals, the loss of satellites and other spacecraft, as well as a lack of innovation and international partnerships. Borisov had approved plans to launch the first two modules of a Russian space station in 2027 after the European Space Agency cut cooperation with Moscow on Moon and Mars missions. While Russia has pledged to remain on the International Space Station until 2028, its long-term role in space remains uncertain. Bakanov, the incoming Roscosmos chief, previously led Gonets, which had a joint venture with satellite internet startup OneWeb until Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) scrapped the project in 2018 over espionage concerns.

According to the Strasbourg-based court, Moscow has imposed \"a systemic and widespread pattern of reporting restrictions\" over the war. The ruling follows complaints filed by the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, exiled broadcaster TV Rain and individual applicants against Russia over wartime censorship. Dozens of independent Russian media outlets were forced to leave the country and restart operations abroad after lawmakers passed draconian legislation effectively banning public criticism of the war and the use of the word \"war\" itself in publications and broadcasts. news Trump\u2019s Foreign Aid Freeze Throws Russian Civil Society Into Crisis Read more The ECHR ruled that these restrictions violated the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the article protecting freedom of expression. The court stated that the restrictions represented \"a coordinated effort to suppress dissent rather than counter any threat to national security.\" \"National courts had criminalized any reporting or statements that contradicted the official narrative describing the invasion of Ukraine as a 'special military operation',\" the ECHR said, referring to the Kremlin's preferred term for the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. \"No effort had been made to balance the competing interests at stake, in particular, to take into account a matter of crucial interest to the public, namely a major armed conflict and allegations of war crimes,\" the court added. The ECHR, which is part of the Council of Europe, is tasked with upholding the European Human Rights Convention across 46 signatory countries. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it was excluded from the Council of Europe and withdrew from the convention in September 2022. However, the court remains competent to hear cases against Russia that were brought before that date.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"Marc Fogel, an American teacher detained in Russia for drugs charges since 2021, is released and repatriated to the United States as part of a prisoner exchange.","text":"The 63-year-old arrived back on US soil late Tuesday night after three years in a Russian penal colony. American teacher Marc Fogel, arrested in Russia for allegedly carrying medically prescribed marijuana in 2021, has been freed and returned to the United States. Fogel had been serving a 14-year sentence for drug smuggling \u2013 a charge the US State Department called \u201cunjust\u201d. He received a warm welcome from President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday night. \u201cI feel like the luckiest man on earth right now,\u201d said Fogel, cloaked in a US flag. He thanked Trump and other US officials who helped negotiate his release, calling them \u201cheroes\u201d. He also credited Russian President Vladimir Putin for his role in the process. Marc Fogel, a 63-year-old teacher from Pennsylvania, spent much of his career teaching at international schools around the world, including in Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Mexico and Venezuela. A former student of Fogel\u2019s at the International School of Kuala Lumpur, who requested anonymity, recalled how Fogel would ride a moped to school, where he ran the model UN, an extracurricular activity during which students roleplay delegates. His students were expected to take off their shoes before entering his class, they told Al Jazeera. Since 2012, he and his wife had lived in Moscow, where Fogel taught history at the Anglo-American School, which caters to US citizens and the children of diplomats. He had diplomatic immunity as a teacher at the school, which is backed by the US, British and Canadian embassies, until 2020, when Russia revoked the teachers\u2019 diplomatic status, claiming the US was misusing the privilege. Prior to his arrest in August 2021, he had planned to teach one final year in Moscow before retiring. Fogel was detained in Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport after flying in from New York with less than an ounce (28.35gm) of cannabis, which his family said was medically prescribed for his chronic back pain. Russia, which has stringent drug laws, accused him of keeping the cannabis \u201ccarefully disguised\u201d in his luggage. A Moscow court later convicted Fogel of \u201clarge-scale drug smuggling\u201d and handed him a 14-year hard labour sentence. He was sent to Rybinsk penal colony four hours away from Moscow to serve his time. Penal colonies are notorious for harsh living conditions and brutality. The US State Department classified Fogel as \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d. Fogel was handed over to Trump\u2019s visiting Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow on Tuesday. Fogel\u2019s Russian lawyer, Dmitry Ovsyannikov, told Russia\u2019s TASS news agency it was unclear on what grounds the American had been released or whether he had been issued a formal pardon. Fogel arrived at a military facility in Maryland, Joint Base Andrews, late on Tuesday night before heading to the White House for a news conference with Trump. While addressing the media, Trump did not disclose details about the negotiations to secure Fogel\u2019s release but described the exchange as \u201cvery fair, very reasonable\u201d and stated that the US did not have to offer much in return. On Wednesday morning, the Kremlin announced an unnamed Russian had been freed from a US prison and would soon return home as part of the deal. Fogel was arrested months before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, after which ties between Washington and Moscow deteriorated to a historic low. Yes, at least 10 US citizens remain in Russian custody, including current and ex-military personnel. Among them are Army staff sergeant Gordon Black, Marine veteran Robert Gillman and ballet dancer Ksenia Khavana. Khavana, a dual US-Russian national, was convicted of treason after making a $51 donation to a US charity that helps Ukrainian children. The State Department says Trump is committed to bringing all the detainees home. Trump thanked Putin for helping free Fogel and said it could play a \u201cbig, important part\u201d in bringing the war in Ukraine to an end. \u201cWe were treated very nicely by Russia,\u201d said Trump, standing alongside Fogel in the White House. \u201cActually, I hope that\u2019s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war and millions of people can stop being killed.\u201d Trump also said another American held abroad will be released on Wednesday. He did not specify. The details surrounding Fogel\u2019s release are hazy, but it comes as Trump seeks to bolster ties with Russia and mediate an end to the Ukraine war. During his presidential campaign, Trump had pledged to end the Ukraine war. In an interview on Monday, he said \u201cUkraine may be Russian someday\u201d , as his administration works to end Europe\u2019s largest armed conflict since World War II. While Trump declined to say if he had brought up Fogel\u2019s release directly with Putin, he confirmed on Saturday that he had spoken with Putin about the three-year war in Ukraine . Both the leaders have said they are eager to meet to discuss how to bring a swift end to the war, but no date for any summit has been announced. Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor Mike Waltz called Fogel\u2019s release a gesture of goodwill from Russia that shows \u201cwe are moving in the right direction\u201d towards ending the Ukraine war. The release also follows an extensive prisoner swap between Russia and the West back in August 2024 that freed three high-profile US citizens , including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and US marine Paul Whelan.    The news of Fogel\u2019s release was met with praise and relief from his family and lawyers, as well as lawmakers from his home state of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed,\u201d said a joint statement from the Fogel family, who had been critical of former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s handling of the case. \u201cThis has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\u201d Fogel\u2019s defence lawyers, Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, called his release \u201chistoric\u201d and praised Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong leadership \u2026 wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring [him] home.\u201d US Congressman Mike Kelly, who represents Butler County in Pennsylvania, where Fogel\u2019s mother lives, expressed his joy that the family was finally reunited after years of his advocacy on their behalf. \u201cI want to thank President Trump for successfully securing Marc\u2019s release,\u201d Kelly said in a statement. \u201cToday is a great day for the Fogel family.\u201d Pennsylvania Senators John Fetterman, a Democrat, and Dave McCormick, a Republican, also issued statements applauding Fogel\u2019s release. Thank you @POTUS for bringing Marc home! All of Pennsylvania is happy he is back safely, especially his amazing 95 year old mom, Mafa, who never stopped fighting for his release.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"12 February  US President Donald Trump announces the beginning of negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine following a phone call with President Putin.","text":"Ukraine war talks start now, Trump says after Putin call 13 February 2025 Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr, at the White House, and Mike Wendling BBC News James Waterhouse Ukraine correspondent Share Save Reuters US President Donald Trump has said he had a \"lengthy and highly productive\"  phone call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in which the leaders agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he and the Russian president had \"agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately\". Later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had spoken with Trump about a \"lasting, reliable peace\". The calls with the warring sides came as both Trump and his defence secretary said it was unlikely Ukraine would join Nato, which will come as a bitter disappointment to Kyiv. On Thursday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Trump was the \"one man in the world\" capable of bringing both sides together and insisted US attempts to negotiate peace were \"certainly not a betrayal\" of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting invading Russian forces. Earlier, Trump wrote on social media: \"It is time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION. God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!\" He did not set a date for a face-to-face meeting with Putin, but later told reporters at the White House: \"We'll meet in Saudi Arabia.\" He wrote on social media the pair had also invited each other to their respective capitals. Zelensky said he would meet Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a defence summit on Ukraine in Munich on Friday. Follow live updates on this story Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin supported Trump's idea that the time had come to work together. The phone call between Putin and Trump lasted nearly an hour-and-a-half, during which the Russian president extended an invitation to visit Moscow, Peskov said. Trump also told reporters at the White House that it was unlikely Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said \"some of that land will come back\". The president said he agreed with Hegseth, who told a Nato summit earlier on Wednesday that there was no likelihood of Ukraine joining the military alliance. Speaking to reporters ahead of the defence meeting in Brussels on Thursday, Hegseth said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a \"factory reset\" for Nato which signalled the alliance needed to be \"robust\", \"strong\" and \"real\". Hegseth said the US had made an \"incredible commitment\" to Nato and reiterated calls for fellow members to increase defence spending. He added that no country had shown a larger commitment to Ukraine than the US. On Wednesday, seven European countries including Britain, France and Germany insisted they be part of any future negotiations on Ukraine's fate. \"Our shared objectives should be to put Ukraine in a position of strength,\" read the joint statement released after a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris. \"Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations.\" They called for strong security guarantees for Ukraine and said they were looking forward to discussing the way forward with their American allies. Watch: BBC reporter asks Trump about a return to pre-2014 Ukraine borders While it has long been known the new US administration would be less sympathetic to Ukraine than its predecessor, the words from Trump and his defence secretary will have only pleased Moscow. Zelensky has repeatedly argued there \"can be no talks on Ukraine without Ukraine\" - but the Trump-Putin phone call proved otherwise. Western help \u2013 and the Ukrainian forces who benefitted from it \u2013 are the reason Kyiv did not fall within days of Russia's invasion, as was expected by some. But the road to a \"just peace\", as Zelensky puts it, is neither going to be straight nor smooth for Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said his own call with Trump had been a \"good and detailed discussion\" about a variety of issues, and that he had also met US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is visiting Kyiv. \"No one wants peace more than Ukraine. Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace,\" Zelensky wrote. The Ukrainian leader added: \"We agreed to maintain further contact and plan upcoming meetings.\" Trump offers Putin a way back in from the cold Hegseth sets out hard line on European defence and Nato What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member? Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast on Thursday she was \"concerned\" by Trump's conversation with Putin because the end of the Russian leader's \"isolation\" would give the \"illusion\" he wanted peace. \"How do we know that Putin really wants peace and wants to negotiate, and then who or what will make sure that Putin will keep his part of the bargain?\" she asked. Asked if she could conceive of Ukraine agreeing to a settlement that would concede territory to Russia, Rudik said: \"We will not give up on our territories.\" \"However, we may, as President Zelensky said, delay our goal to regain them.\" In an interview with The Guardian published on Tuesday, Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for Ukrainian-held territory in Russia's western Kursk region as part of a peace deal. Putin's spokesman Peskov said this was \"impossible\". \"Russia has never discussed and will not discuss the exchange of its territory. Ukrainian units will be expelled from this territory. All who are not destroyed will be expelled.\" Zelensky also insisted that the US, and not just European countries, would need to be part of any security package for his country. \"Security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees,\" he said. Separately, Trump said that at \"some point you're going to have an election\" in Ukraine, in what was seen as a reference to the expiry of Zelensky's presidential term in May 2024. Zelensky says the continuing Russian invasion and martial law in Ukraine make it impossible to hold a new presidential election. Russia's Putin has repeatedly questioned Zelensky's legitimacy to hold any negotiations with Moscow. Meanwhile, fighting between Russia and Ukraine has continued overnight. Ukraine's air force said there had been 140 drone attacks, starting on Wednesday evening in the Odesa and Kharkiv regions - 85 of which had been shot down. Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in  bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine. The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. Moscow's attempts to take control of the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have taken around one-fifth of Ukraine's territory in the east and south, and have carried out air strikes across the country.

REUTERS\/Alexey Pavlishak\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Feb 28 (Reuters) - Russia's FSB security service said on Friday it had arrested two church figures suspected of plotting to kill a priest close to President Vladimir Putin on the orders of a Ukrainian spy agency. The alleged target was Tikhon Shevkunov, 66, whom Russian media have described for years as \"Putin's confessor\". He has maintained a public acquaintance with Putin since the late 1990s and the Kremlin has said the two men know each other well. Sign up here. A spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence denied Kyiv was behind such a plot and dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"lies\" in comments to Reuters. \"We are fighting according to the rules - the rules of war and international rules,\" said Andriy Yusov of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence. The Kremlin condemned the alleged assassination plot. \"It is clear that the Kyiv regime does not shrink from anything,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \"In this case, nothing is sacred. This is once again confirmed.\" In 2023, Shevkunov was appointed to the senior church rank of metropolitan of Crimea, the peninsula which Russia captured and annexed from Ukraine in 2014. In a statement, the FSB said it had detained two men it said had been recruited by Ukrainian military intelligence on the Telegram messenger service in mid-2024. The FSB said it seized an improvised explosive device and two fake Ukrainian passports. One of the men, Nikita Ivankovich, is a Russian cleric at a church in Moscow. The other, Denis Popovich, a Ukrainian born in the western city of Chernivtsi, worked as Shevkunov's assistant. The authorities released videos of both men confessing to the plot. They spoke hesitantly and it was not clear under what circumstances the confessions had been obtained. Popovich said he had been recruited to monitor Shevkunov's movements and threatened with the murder of his relatives unless he complied. He said he was then tasked with finding an accomplice in order to \"eliminate\" Shevkunov. He said the plan was to plant a bomb in a residential building of the 14th-century Sretensky Monastery in Moscow, where Shevkunov was superior until 2018. Ivankovich, in his confession, said the men had been supplied with a home-made bomb to carry out the attack. The video showed investigators recovering a box and fake passports from a hiding place in a wood. Ukraine has taken responsibility for some assassinations in Russia since the start of the war - most recently for the killing of Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, in December.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"18 February  Russia and the United States began official discussions in Saudi Arabia on ending the war in Ukraine.","text":"1:45 US and Russia to explore closer relations after Ukraine talks in Riyadh, Rubio says \u2013\u00a0video Ukraine This article is more than 2 months old US and Russia agree to explore mutual opportunities of end to Ukraine war This article is more than 2 months old Riyadh talks involving US secretary of state and Russian counterpart mark tectonic shift in relations Pjotr Sauer , Luke Harding in Kyiv and David Smith in Washington Tue 18 Feb 2025 19.21 GMT First published on Tue 18 Feb 2025 14.59 GMT Share US and Russian officials agreed to explore the \u201ceconomic and investment opportunities\u201d that could arise for their countries from an end to the war in Ukraine after talks in Saudi Arabia that amounted to a tectonic shift in Washington\u2019s approach to Moscow. The statements from the two sides came amid concerns in Kyiv and across Europe that Donald Trump could push for a peace settlement that favours Vladimir Putin. No Ukrainian or European officials were present at the meeting. Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump dismissed Ukrainian concerns about being excluded from the talks and, astonishingly, seemed to imply that Kyiv was to blame for the war. He said: \u201cToday I heard, \u2018Oh, we weren\u2019t invited\u2019. Well, you\u2019ve been there for three years. You should have ended it three years [ago] \u2013 you should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\u201d The president complained that he had seen no accounting of how US military aid is being spent and conspicuously avoided voicing support for Zelenskyy. \u201cI think I have the power to end this war,\u201d he said. After the talks at Diriyah Palace in Riyadh, the most extensive negotiations between the two countries in three years, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio , said agreement had been made to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks and to explore \u201copportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine\u201d. It marked a dramatic break with the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to isolate Moscow. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, were photographed sitting across from Rubio, who attended the talks alongside the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East. Rubio said an end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia, and that Washington\u2019s European allies had been consulted. Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, tweeted a message to Rubio: \u201cRussia will try to divide us. Let\u2019s not walk into their traps. By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace \u2013 on Ukraine\u2019s terms.\u201d The talks in the Saudi capital, however, underscored the rapid pace of US efforts to halt the conflict, raising alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, where officials met on Monday to discuss the possibility of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. Lavrov rejected the prospect of such a move on Tuesday. He said the deployment of Nato member troops in Ukraine, even if they were operating under a different flag, was unacceptable to Moscow. Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of western boots in Ukraine. Trump and Vance have smashed the old order \u2013 how should Europe respond? | Nathalie Tocci, Yanis Varoufakis and others Read more \u201cWe explained to our colleagues today what President Putin has repeatedly stressed: that the expansion of Nato, the absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic alliance, is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,\u201d Lavrov said. He also rejected a US proposal that Russia and Ukraine halt strikes on each other\u2019s energy infrastructure, falsely claiming that Russia had never endangered Ukraine\u2019s civilian energy supply system. Shortly after the meeting, Ushakov said the talks had gone well, with both sides agreeing that negotiators would discuss Ukraine. He said a potential Putin-Trump summit had been discussed, but that it was unlikely to happen next week. Ukrainian officials were not invited to the talks. During a visit to Ankara, where he held talks with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept the results of talks on how to end the war with Russia that were held \u201cbehind Ukraine\u2019s back\u201d. The Ukrainian president told reporters no decision could be made without Kyiv on how to end the war, and that he would always reject Putin\u2019s \u201cultimatums\u201d. View image in fullscreen Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (right) welcomes Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the presidential complex in Ankara. Photograph: Anadolu\/Getty Images The discussions in Riyadh mark the first high-level attempt to negotiate an end to Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since the war\u2019s early days, when talks collapsed over the Russian president\u2019s demands. Despite the flurry of diplomacy, little is known about Trump\u2019s peace plan for Ukraine or Russia\u2019s willingness to engage, and Tuesday\u2019s meeting offered few new clues. Both sides issued carefully worded statements when the talks concluded. Rubio said the meeting was \u201cthe first step of a long and difficult journey\u201d, adding: \u201cAn end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia.\u201d Waltz said: \u201cThis needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end as we\u2019ve seen in the past. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said the two sides had started listening to each other but it was too early to talk about compromises. Before the talks, Russian officials had said they would pursue \u201cnormalisation\u201d with the US and lay the groundwork for a peace deal in Ukraine. But even before the meeting began, the US made several significant concessions to Putin, indicating that Ukraine would have to abandon its Nato ambitions and accept territorial losses. Putin has not commented publicly on the Saudi talks but told Trump last week during a phone call that Russia wanted to \u201csettle the reasons for the conflict\u201d. Some observers believe this suggests Russia may not limit its focus to Ukraine and may instead seek to reshape European security more broadly. Moscow\u2019s demands could resemble those it issued on the eve of its full-scale invasion in 2022: that Ukraine adopt a neutral status and that Nato halts the deployment of weapons to member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding to include former communist nations. This would affect much of eastern Europe including Poland and the Baltic states \u2013 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. After the talks, Maria Zakharova, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, issued what appeared to be new conditions for peace, saying Russia was demanding \u201cnot just a pledge to deny Ukraine Nato membership but the annulment of the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration which promised Kyiv eventual membership without a specific timeline\u201d. Putin has previously insisted that Ukraine drastically reduce its military forces, which many in Ukraine fear would leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks. In Riyadh, Russia was also expected to leverage discussions on a potential Ukraine settlement to push for relief from western sanctions, which have placed significant strain on its economy. A diagram annotating politicians from the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia Leading Moscow\u2019s economic negotiations is Dmitriev, the 49-year-old head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and a close friend of Putin\u2019s daughter. A former investment banker, Dmitriev has played a key role in Russia\u2019s outreach to international investors. \u201cUS oil majors have done very well in Russia,\u201d Dmitriev said in a brief interview on Tuesday before the talks began, suggesting that American companies could come back to Russia. \u201cWe believe that at some point they will return \u2013 why would they pass up the opportunities Russia has provided for access to its natural resources?\u201d Tuesday\u2019s talks in Riyadh offered Saudi Arabia and its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, an opportunity to assert themselves on the world stage. Once labelled a pariah by Biden over the 2018 killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi leader has emerged as a key intermediary in discussions between Russia and the US. The latest US diplomatic push has left Kyiv and key allies scrambling to secure a seat at the table, fearing Washington and Moscow could move forward with a deal that sidelined their interests. In response, France convened an emergency meeting of EU nations and the UK on Monday to coordinate a response. Emmanuel Macron announced after the meeting that he had spoken to Trump and Zelenskyy. \u201cWe seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\u201d Macron wrote on X. Still, the security talks in Paris yielded no concrete measures, as European leaders struggled to present a united front amid divisions over the deployment of troops to Ukraine.

The victims, both eighth graders, were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, according to the local news outlet NN.ru. The suspected stabber initially fled the scene and hid in the woods before being arrested, NN.ru reported. Law enforcement sources and classmates cited by journalists said the teenager had allegedly been bullied by his victims and brought a knife to school to exact revenge. Students were evacuated, and the school was shuttered hours after the attack, NN.ru reported. The Nizhny Novgorod region prosecutor\u2019s office said it launched a preliminary investigation into the incident and the conditions at the school that may have contributed to the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously attributed the rise in school attacks to foreign influences, particularly from the United States, and has tightened gun control laws in response. Authorities have also sought to strengthen school safety protocols following a series of deadly school shootings and knife attacks in recent years.

Bezdudny was among five governors expected to be replaced ahead of September\u2019s regional elections, the Vedomosti business newspaper reported last week. \u201cNew work awaits me\u2026 I wish the tundra region development and prosperity,\u201d Bezdudny, a member of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, said in a short video address. As of Thursday afternoon, a presidential decree confirming Bezdudny\u2019s resignation had not been published. Nenets, Russia\u2019s least populous region with just 44,000 residents, was the only region to oppose the 2020 constitutional reforms that allowed President Vladimir Putin to extend his rule until 2036. It also handed Putin his lowest re-election margin last year, with 79% of the vote. Putin appointed Bezdudny as acting governor in April 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. He was formally elected by the regional legislature that September under Russia\u2019s indirect election system. Early in his tenure, Bezdudny pushed for a merger with the neighboring Arkhangelsk region, but the initiative was overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum that also saw Nenets residents vote against Putin\u2019s constitutional reforms.

Argentine authorities have dismantled a notorious Russian cult, arresting 14 individuals in a joint operation across two airports that has exposed a sinister network of alleged human exploitation. Konstantin Rudnev, the 57-year-old founder of the\u00a0Ashram Shambhala sect, was intercepted alongside his followers at airports in Bariloche and Buenos Aires on March 31 while heading to Brazil. The investigation began when a young Russian woman arrived at a hospital in Bariloche to give birth, raising immediate concerns among medical staff. Doctors were alarmed by the woman's condition and the behavior of her accompanying companions. The 22-year-old appeared severely malnourished and visibly frightened, with the two women accompanying her preventing her from speaking. This prompted an immediate police investigation that would unravel a complex web of alleged criminal activity. \u201cHer passport said she was 22, but if she's even 15, that's too old,\u201d a detective told\u00a0Infobae. Rudnev, who describes himself as an \u201calien from the star Sirius,\u201d has a long history of criminal behavior. A former Soviet soldier who was hospitalized after a psychiatric episode in the mid-1980s, he founded the sect in Novosibirsk in 1989. At its peak in the 1990s, the organization claimed over 20,000 acolytes across 18 Russian regions. The sect's operations were deeply manipulative . Followers were required to donate their property, abandon their families and submit to Rudnev's extreme control mechanisms. Women were reportedly coerced into sexual relations, while men were mandated to remain celibate. The group's income mainly came from selling recordings of ritualistic encounters and charging exorbitant fees for yoga and meditation courses. When arrested, the group was found in possession of 130 tablets containing cocaine, 12 cellphones, 10 SIM cards, a satellite phone and $15,000 in cash. According to\u00a0El Pais, Rudnev attempted to slit his own throat during the arrest but police intervened. Rudnev's previous legal troubles include an 11-year prison sentence in 2013 for rape, drug trafficking and organizing a group engaged in violence. \u201cRudnev's cult members often lost their money and property and abandoned their relatives and friends, and many of them were reported missing,\u201d reported The\u00a0Siberian Times, as quoted by The\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0in 2013. \u201cAfter joining up, females were forced to take part in \u2018ritual rapes\u2019 and orgies with Rudnov and other cult leaders,\u201d a Novosibirsk court heard. After his release in 2021, Rudnev moved to Montenegro, where he was previously detained for filming what police described as \u201critual pornography.\u201d Religious scholar Alexander Neveev, speaking to Russian outlet\u00a0360.ru, described the organization as a \u201cvery dangerous pseudo-tantric group,\u201d noting its extreme practices included ritual violence and a perverse interpretation of spiritual practices. The cult lured new members through social media, promising financial prosperity and personal happiness through \u201cwomen's practices\u201d and pseudo-spiritual manipulation. The women found with Rudnev in Argentina were severely emaciated , with patches of baldness \u2014 a potential indication of prolonged malnutrition and psychological control. Authorities are now investigating whether the women are victims of human trafficking or willing participants in the cult's activities. The case has been referred to the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Bariloche, with charges likely to include human trafficking, sexual exploitation and drug offenses. A preliminary hearing is expected in the coming days to determine the legal status of the remaining detainees. As the investigation continues, questions remain about the full extent of the Ashram Shambala sect's operations and the potential number of victims left in its wake.

Zelensky said \"the main objective\" was to protect Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv border regions, and to \"ease the pressure\" on other parts of the vast front line, particularly in the eastern Donetsk region. Russia's military had last month reported Ukrainian attempts to cross over into the Belgorod region - but said such attacks had been rebuffed. The areas in question are only a short distance inside Russian territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory. The Kremlin has rejected US and European allegations that it is dragging its feet on US President Donald Trump's push for a ceasefire in the war. Trump told reporters late on Monday that he was \"not happy about what's going on\", accusing Russia of \"bombing like crazy right now\". Zelensky's home city of Kryvyi Rih held funerals earlier for 20 people, including nine children, who were killed in a Russian missile attack last Friday. In his video address late on Monday, Zelensky said he had been briefed by his top commander Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi about the situation on the front, \"including our presence in the Kursk and Belgorod regions\". Zelensky thanked several army units defending Ukraine, including the 225th Assault Regiment deployed in the Belgorod region. \"Well done, guys! I'm proud of each and every one who is fighting for Ukraine!\" the president said. He provided no further details. It is his first explicit acknowledgement of Ukrainian troops in Belgorod. On 18 March, Zelensky had indirectly confirmed that Ukrainian troops were there. \"There is an operation there,\" he said when asked by reporters to comment on a Russian defence ministry statement that Ukrainian troops had unsuccessfully tried to enter the western part of the Belgorod region. Russia had said that all Ukrainian attempts to advance towards the villages of Demidovka and Prilesye had been rebuffed, and a cross-border raid had been prevented. However, several Russian military bloggers at the time reported fighting in Demidovka itself, which lies about two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) had also said in an update on 21 March that \"Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Belgorod\". \"Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces advanced and are consolidating positions on the outskirts of Demidovka and Prilesye,\" the ISW said, adding that such claims were unconfirmed. In the past two days, Russian military bloggers had reported that Ukrainian forces were withdrawing from the Demidovka area. Analysts from ISW told the BBC that as of Monday they believed 12km2 of the Belgorod region was still under Ukrainian control, while about 60km2 in Kursk region was still in Ukrainian hands. Ukraine's operation in Belgorod is believed to be on a much smaller scale compared to its actions in Kursk, where Kyiv at one point seized a number of villages including the regional town of Sudzha. Zelensky and his top commanders have repeatedly said that such incursions have forced Moscow to redeploy troops from the Donetsk region, where Russian troops have been making steady - although slow - advances in recent months. Ukraine could also be hoping to exchange the Russian areas it holds for parts of Ukrainian regions occupied by Moscow in any future peace negotiations that are being pushed for by the US. A number of war analysts - both in Ukraine and the West - have questioned the military expedience of Kyiv's operations on Russian soil, pointing to reported high combat casualties and weapons supply difficulties.

Amateur ballerina Ksenia Karelina, a Los Angeles resident, had been in prison in Russia for over a year, after being arrested in early 2024 during a family visit in the city of Yekaterinburg. She was accused by Russia's FSB security service of raising money for a Ukrainian organisation providing arms to the Ukrainian military. She pleaded guilty last August and was sentenced to 12 years in jail.

The Taliban authorities praised the move as a \u201csignificant development in relations between Afghanistan and Russia\" in a foreign ministry statement. \u201cWith this decision, the only remaining obstacle to further political and economic cooperation between the two countries has been removed,\u201d Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a meeting with Moscow's Ambassador to Kabul Dmitry Zhirnov, according to the statement. opinion Why Russia Doesn\u2019t Think the Taliban Are Terrorists Anymore Read more Representatives of the Taliban have made several high-level visits to Russia in recent years, including\u00a0participation in Russia\u2019s flagship economic forum in St. Petersburg in 2022 and 2024. They also met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in October 2023. Russia first banned the Taliban as a terrorist organization in 2003 over its alleged support for Islamist insurgents in the North Caucasus. However, since the militant group seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the\u00a0Kremlin has strengthened ties with the country\u2019s de facto rulers. Russia is not alone in shifting its posture. Kazakhstan removed the Taliban from its terrorist list last year, and China has deepened economic ties, becoming the first country to appoint a new ambassador to Afghanistan in 2023. Still, no country has formally recognized the Taliban government, which remains diplomatically isolated despite growing regional engagement. AFP contributed reporting.

Beslan Shavanov, 30, was holed up in a building in Grozny when police arrived to arrest him Saturday afternoon, Russia 24 reported.  Police surrounded the building and Shavano tried to escape, throwing a grenade at police officers before blowing himself up, the station said. The news came as Russian authorities reported making five other arrests in connection with Boris Nemtsov\u2019s killing. One of those arrested claims to have an alibi, according to Russia\u2019s Sputnik News . \u201cAt the time of the murder, I was at work as I usually am every day. There are many people, my colleagues, who will confirm this,\u201d the news agency quoted Tamerlan Eskerkhanov as saying in Moscow\u2019s Basmanny District Court. Two of the suspects have been formally charged and three \u201cremain under the status of suspects,\u201d court spokeswoman Anna Fadeyeva told Sputnik. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in late February. Surveillance video showed someone darting from the sidewalk and into a nearby car right after Nemtsov collapsed. Putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with Nemtsov\u2019s death, Russian media said, citing Federal Security Service director Alexander Bortnikov. Two of the other suspects are Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadayev, Bortnikov said in a televised statement. The others are Ramzan Bakhayev and Shagit Gubashev, Anzor\u2019s younger brother, according to a Sputnik report that also said Dadayev was the only one of the five to plead guilty \u2013 though to what crimes was not clear. Bortnikov said those detained are from the southern region of the North Caucasus, which for years has been a hotbed of unrest and rebellion against Moscow. The suspects Dadayev had previously served as an officer in a Chechen police battalion, Albert Barakhayev, secretary of the Security Council of the Caucasian republic of Ingushetia, told the official news agency TASS. Dadayev was the deputy commander of one of the Chechen Republic\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs groups, Sputnik reported, adding that Gubashev worked at a security firm in Moscow. Gubashev was arrested between the town of Malgobek and the village of Voznesenovskaya, while Dadayev was arrested in the city of Magas, Barakhayev told TASS . The slain opposition leader\u2019s daughter, Zhanna Nemtsova, told CNN she is \u201cnot surprised both of them (are) of Caucasus origin. It was predictable.\u201d Nemtsova said the only things she knew about the arrests came from media reports, as authorities did not contact her immediately. Later Saturday, a southern Russian law enforcement official told state news agency RIA Novosti that two more men were arrested. The two suspects in the second arrest were not named, but one of them was driving with Dadayev, and the other man is Gubashev\u2019s younger brother, Barakhayev said. Like Gubashev and Dadayev, those two suspects are also ethnic Chechens, according to Barakhayev.

Khodorkovsky landed in jail after a conviction on tax fraud, which he said was a ploy to take away his oil company. The government rejected the claim. Putin pardoned him in 2013. Former Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium, his tea spiked in a London hotel during a meeting with two former Russian security service men in 2006.

Fetishism, exhibitionism and voyeurism are also included as \"mental disorders\" now barring people from driving. The government says it is tightening medical controls for drivers because Russia has too many road accidents. \"Pathological\" gambling and compulsive stealing are also on the list. Russian psychiatrists and human rights lawyers have condemned the move. The announcement follows international complaints about Russian harassment of gay-rights activists. In 2013 Russia made \"promoting non-traditional lifestyles\" illegal. Valery Evtushenko at the Russian Psychiatric Association voiced concern about the driving restrictions, speaking to the BBC Russian Service. He said some people would avoid seeking psychiatric help, fearing a driving ban. The Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights called the new law \"discriminatory\". It said it would demand clarifications from the Russian Constitutional Court and seek support from international human rights organisations. But the Professional Drivers Union supported the move. \"We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified,\" said the union's head Alexander Kotov.

An unidentified attacker in a car shot Mr Nemtsov four times in the back as he crossed a bridge in view of the Kremlin, police say. He died hours after appealing for support for a march on Sunday in Moscow against the war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned the murder, the Kremlin says. President Putin has assumed \"personal control\" of the investigation into the killing, said his spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Investigators said the murder could have been \"a provocation aimed at destabilising the country\". The investigative committee said in a statement that several motives for the killing were being considered including \"Islamic extremism\". US President Barack Obama condemned , external the \"brutal murder\" and called on the Russian government to conduct a \"prompt, impartial and transparent investigation\". Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko described Mr Nemtsov as a \"bridge between Ukraine and Russia\". \"The murderers' shot has destroyed it. I think it is not by accident,\" he said in a statement published on his administration's Facebook page. Image source, AFP Image caption, Boris Nemtsov was one of Russia's leading economic reformers in the 1990s (file photo from 2009) In a recent interview, Mr Nemtsov had said he feared Mr Putin would have him killed because of his opposition to the war in Ukraine. Mr Nemtsov, 55, served as first deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s. He had earned a reputation as an economic reformer while governor of one of Russia's biggest cities, Nizhny Novgorod. Falling out of favour with Yeltsin's successor, Mr Putin, he became an outspoken opposition politician. Analysis: Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent A lawyer for Mr Nemtsov reported that he had received death threats over social media in recent months; but for now there's only speculation as to why he was targeted.  He openly opposed Moscow's role in the crisis in Ukraine - and the annexation by Russia of Crimea. He had been planning a rare public protest on Sunday  against both things - and a growing economic crisis in this country. Since his death, social media has been flooded with tributes to a man remembered by friends as decent, honest and a democrat. He had been pushed to the political margins in Vladimir Putin's Russia, but he was still prominent enough for someone to want to kill him. Profile: Boris Nemtsov Russian and world reaction Mr Nemtsov was shot at around 23:40 (20:40 GMT) on Friday while crossing Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge accompanied by a woman, Russia's interior ministry said. He was shot with a pistol from a white car which fled the scene, a police source told Russia's Interfax news agency. According to Russian-language news website Meduza, \"several people\" got out of a car and shot him. One of the politician's colleagues in his RPR-Parnassus party, Ilya Yashin, confirmed Mr Nemtsov's death. \"Unfortunately I can see the corpse of Boris Nemtsov in front of me now,\" he was quoted as saying by Russia's lenta.ru news website.

Speaking earlier this month to Russia's Sobesednik news website, he had spoken of his fears for his own life. \"I'm afraid Putin will kill me,\" he said in the article , external (in Russian) on 10 February. \"I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine,\" he added. \"I couldn't dislike him more.\" Mr Putin has been widely accused of fomenting the bloody rebellion in east Ukraine - an accusation he denies. Fighting there followed Russia's annexation of Crimea in March last year. Almost 5,800 people have died and at least 1.25 million have fled their homes, according to the UN. The Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation while Moscow denies it, insisting that any Russians serving with the rebels are \"volunteers\".

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab DUBAI\/MOSCOW (Reuters) - OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia have agreed a preliminary deal to extend existing record oil output cuts by one month while raising pressure on countries with poor compliance to deepen their cuts, OPEC+ sources told Reuters. However, there was no agreement yet on whether to hold an OPEC+ output policy meeting on Thursday with the main obstacle being how to deal with countries that have failed to make the deep supply cuts required under the existing pact, the sources said. OPEC+ agreed to cut output by a record 9.7 million barrels per day, or about 10% of global output, in May and June to lift prices battered by plunging demand linked to lockdown measures aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Rather than easing output cuts in July, OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, were discussing keeping those cuts beyond June. \"Saudi Arabia and Russia are aligned on the extension for one month,\" one OPEC source said. \"Any agreement on extending the cuts is conditional on countries who have not fully complied in May deepening their cuts in upcoming months to offset their overproduction,\" the source said. The group also considered holding an online meeting on June 4 to discuss output policy, after Algeria, which holds the presidency of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, proposed bringing forward a meeting planned for June 9-10. The first OPEC source said that an earlier meeting on June 4 is also conditional on compliance and that the discussions now are about implementing criteria for those countries who have not fully complied with the oil cuts and how they can compensate for their overproduction in the coming months. \"I don't think there will be a meeting on Thursday. There are still many challenges,\" another OPEC source said. OPEC members Iraq and Nigeria has shown weak compliance with its output reduction targets in May. OPEC\/O Kazakhstan also failed to fully meet its obligations under the OPEC+ oil cut pact, sources said. Two sources also told Reuters that Gulf OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are not discussing extending their deeper voluntary oil cuts of 1.180 million bpd beyond June. Oil prices rose in recent days from the lows of April buoyed by a continuing recovery in China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, while other economies are slowly opening up after lockdowns to contain its spread. [O\/R] \"Overall the market is moving in the right direction with the gradual easing of the lockdown. But we still need to be cautious. There is always a risk of another wave of the coronavirus,\" the first OPEC source said. \"The other thing is how quickly will demand patterns recover. Inventories are still above average levels and that needs to be tackled.\" Editing by Louise Heavens and David Evans Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Business Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next category Bessent says China tariffs are not sustainable as US signals willingness to de-escalate 1:10 AM UTC Aerospace & Defense category Chinese customers are rejecting new jets due to tariffs, Boeing confirms 6:31 AM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago category Kimberly-Clark's $4 billion international tissue unit set for three-way M&A fight, sources say 6:40 AM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals category Novo Nordisk's stellar Wegovy-fuelled run of hiking sales guidance could be ending 5:12 AM UTC","question":"What was the agreed oil production limit for Russia and Saudi Arabia under the OPEC+ deal from May to June 2020?","answer":"Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to produce no more than 8.5 million barrels of oil per day during that period.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: Under the OPEC+ deal from May to June 2020, both Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to cut their oil production to 8.5 million barrels per day.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer in terms of the agreed oil production limit (8.5 million barrels per day) and the timeframe (May to June 2020).

The spill happened when a fuel tank at a power plant near the Siberian city of Norilsk collapsed last Friday. The power plant's director Vyacheslav Starostin has been taken into custody until 31 July, but not yet charged. The plant is owned by a subsidiary of Norilsk Nickel, which is the world's leading nickel and palladium producer. The Russian Investigative Committee (SK) has launched a criminal case over the pollution and alleged negligence, as there was reportedly a two-day delay in informing the Moscow authorities about the spill. Ground subsidence beneath the fuel storage tanks is believed to have caused the spill. Arctic permafrost has been melting in exceptionally warm weather for this time of year. President Putin expressed anger after discovering officials only learnt about the incident on Sunday. Russian Minister for Emergencies Yevgeny Zinichev told Mr Putin that the Norilsk plant had spent two days trying to contain the spill, before alerting his ministry. The leaked oil drifted some 12km (7.5 miles) from the accident site, turning long stretches of the Ambarnaya river crimson red. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Power plant manager Vyacheslav Starostin has been detained In a televised video conference on Wednesday, Mr Putin criticised the head of the company over its response. Eye in the sky leaves polluters nowhere to hide Arctic coal passage to India threatens wildlife The journey to the 'doomsday glacier' \"Why did government agencies only find out about this two days after the fact?\" he asked the subsidiary's chief, Sergei Lipin. \"Are we going to learn about emergency situations from social media?\" The region's governor, Alexander Uss, had earlier told President Putin that he became aware of the oil spill on Sunday after \"alarming information appeared in social media\". The spill has contaminated a 350 sq km (135 sq mile) area, state media report. Image copyright AFP Image caption President Putin expressed shock after hearing officials only became aware of the spill days later In a statement, Norilsk Nickel said the incident had been reported in a \"timely and proper\" way. The state of emergency means extra forces are going to the area to assist with the clean-up operation. The accident is believed to be the second largest in modern Russian history in terms of volume, an expert from the World Wildlife Fund, Alexei Knizhnikov, told the AFP news agency. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Emergencies ministry specialists have been flown in from Novosibirsk What can be done? The incident has prompted stark warnings from environmental groups, who say the scale of the spill and geography of the river mean it will be difficult to clean up. Greenpeace has compared it to the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. Image copyright AFP Image caption Experts have warned that the clean-up operation poses huge challenges Oleg Mitvol, former deputy head of Russia's environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor, said there had \"never been such an accident in the Arctic zone\". He said the clean-up could cost 100bn roubles (\u00a31.2bn; $1.5bn) and take between five and 10 years. It is not the first time Norilsk Nickel has been involved in oil spillages. In 2016, it admitted that an accident at one of its plants was responsible for turning a nearby river red. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The source of the spill: Part of the power plant in Norilsk Minister of Natural Resources Dmitry Kobylkin warned against trying to burn off such a vast quantity of fuel oil. He proposed trying to dilute the oil with reagents. Only the emergencies ministry with military support could deal with the pollution, he said. Barges with booms could not contain the slick because the Ambarnaya river was too shallow, he warned. He suggested pumping the oil on to the adjacent tundra, although President Putin added: \"The soil there is probably saturated [with oil] already.\" Skip Instagram post  by ilya_torgonskyi View this post on Instagram \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31#\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430 #\u0447\u043f #\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f #\u041d\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a #\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u044c #\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 #\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439 #\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441 #\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a #nvrsk #\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430 #\u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 #\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440 #nature #moscow #\u0440\u044b\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430 #fishing #fish #\u0441\u043f\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 #sos #help #russia #\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c #\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 #\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 #\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440#\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0430#\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a#\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b May 29 at the Nadezhdinsky plant owned by OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, there was a spill diesel fuel in the soil and the water got more 21 thousand tons of oil products. This is the first accident such a large scale in the polar Arctic. In the country declared a state of emergency at the Federal level. The disaster in Norilsk showed irresponsible attitude of large companies to our nature, this will not continue it can! Environmental control should be enhanced, and the operation of facilities should take place under special control for warnings accidents, especially in the conditions of melting eternal permafrost due to global climate change. I however the opposite is happening now the situation in which Industrialists seek a moratorium on certain environmental restrictions requirements under the pretext of fighting economic crisis.

The amendments also emphasized the primacy of Russian law over international law, defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and included provisions to protect the \"historical truth\" about World War II. Additionally, they expanded the powers of the State Duma and the Federation Council, increased the role of the State Council, and introduced social guarantees such as adjusting pensions to inflation and ensuring a minimum wage not lower than the subsistence minimum.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer covers most of the key changes mentioned in the expected answer, such as resetting presidential term limits for Vladimir Putin, emphasizing the primacy of Russian law over international law, and defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. However, it does not explicitly mention the residency requirement for presidential candidates or the ban on foreign citizenship or residency. The candidate's answer also includes additional details not mentioned in the expected answer, such as the protection of 'historical truth' about World War II and expanded powers of the State Duma and the Federation Council.

Navalny survived after the plane he fell sick on was diverted to a nearby airport and he received quick medical attention. He rang Kudryavtsev from Germany last week, pretending to be an aide to a top FSB official. Below is an edited transcript. Dialogue is in bold. Navalny: Konstantin Borisovich? Kudryavtsev: Yes, yes! N: This is Ustinov Maxim Sergeevich, aide to Nikolay Platonovich Patrushev [former FSB chief]. I received your number from Vladimir Mikhailovich Bogdanov [head of the FSB\u2019s special technology centre]. I apologise for the early hour, but I urgently require 10 minutes of your time. K: Alright. \u201cMaxim\u201d explains that he has been told to investigate what went wrong in the operation to poison Navalny. He says he has to ask Kudryavtsev and other members of his FSB unit a few questions, including why the plot failed. K: There are always nuances, there are always nuances in every job. The whole situation turned out, as it were, on one side... well, I don\u2019t know how to say it properly here\u2026 N: Well? K: .. Well, they landed [the plane], and the situation developed in a way that\u2026 Not in our favour, I think. If it had been a little longer, I think the situation could have gone differently. N: A little longer what, Konstantin Borisovich? K: Flying. N : Flying a little longer? K: Well, maybe, yes, if it had flown a little longer and they hadn\u2019t landed it abruptly somehow and so on, maybe it all would have gone differently. That is, if it hadn\u2019t been for the prompt work of the medics, the paramedics on the landing strip, and so on. Kudryavtsev said he travelled to Omsk on 25 August \u2013 five days after the poisoning \u2013 as part of a clean-up operation. His job was to remove traces of the nerve agent novichok from Navalny\u2019s clothes. K: They treated it with solutions, that it wasn\u2019t\u2026 ohhhh\u2026 how to say it\u2026 treated it so there wouldn\u2019t be any marks there, nothing like that. N: All the things were treated? K: No, not all of them at first. First there were the basic ones: suits, underpants, all that stuff. While we were going, another box was brought in, everything, everything had already been processed there the last time. N: On the things, is there any chance that Navalny\u2019s wife, or someone at the hospital, cut off a piece of clothing and it got\u2026 K: No. N: There is no such possibility? K: No. Everything was in one piece. There were no traces of cutting and so on. N: In your opinion, how did the Germans eventually discover it all? K: Well, they got the Bundeswehr involved. They have military chemists working there. Maybe they have some methods of detection. During the 49-minute conversation \u201cMaxim\u201d presses Kudryavtsev for details of how Navalny was poisoned. N: And on which piece of cloth was your focus on? Which garment had the highest risk factor? K: The underpants. N: The underpants. K: A risk factor in what sense? N: Where the concentration [of novichok] could be highest? K: Well, the underpants. N: Do you mean from the inner side or from the outer?.. K: Well, we were processing the inner side. This is what we were doing. N: Well, imagine some underpants in front of you, which part did you process? K: The inner, where the groin is. N: The groin? K: Well, the crotch, as they call it. There is some sort of seams there, by the seams. N: Wait, this is important. Who gave you the order to process the codpiece of the underpants? K: We figured this on our own. They told us to work on the inner side of the underpants. N: I am writing it down. The inner side. Ok\u2026 Do you remember the underwear\u2019s colour? K: Blue. But I am not sure.. N: And they are whole, I mean theoretically we [FSB] could give them back? We are not going to do this, but they are undamaged and everything is ok with them? K: Yes, all is clear. N: Visually, nothing would be discovered? There are no spots, nothing? K: No, no. Everything is fine, they are in good condition, clean. N: Do you think this was a mistake \u2014 the method of administration? K: Well, this is not my call. N: What is your opinion? K: This is what my superiors have decided, therefore, it is probably correct. The method is a good one. N: Well, he remains alive, therefore, it is not that good. Do you understand what I am saying? K: Well, I already said that the circumstances developed in a way for the situation to be as it is. There was contact \u2013 therefore the penetration was good enough.

Many of the victims are children. Ten people are still listed as missing. The blaze started on an upper floor of the Winter Cherry complex during school holidays. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video posted on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape the flames. \"According to preliminary information, the roof collapsed in two cinemas,\" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The authorities have launched an investigation. Four people have been detained for questioning, including the head of the company that manages the shopping centre, according to the Investigative Committee. The owner of the Winter Cherry complex is among those being held. What do we know so far? The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The region's deputy governor Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in a children's trampoline room. \"The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,\" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. AFP Firefighters had to be lifted to a great height to tackle the blaze Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that \"a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out\". \"The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor.\" Who were the victims? At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. AFP Smoke billowed from the building The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic.

Mr Putin, who has ruled the country as either president or prime minister since 1999, got more than 76% of the vote, official results show. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race. Addressing a rally in Moscow, Mr Putin said voters had \"recognised the achievements of the last few years\". Speaking to reporters after the results were announced, he laughed off a question about running again in another six years. \"What you are saying is a bit funny.

Mr Putin's nearest competitor, millionaire communist Pavel Grudinin, received about 12%. The race also included Ksenia Sobchak, a former reality TV host, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky - they got less than 2% and about 6% respectively. Mr Putin's campaign team said it was an \"incredible victory\". \"The percentage that we have just seen speaks for itself. It's a mandate which Putin needs for future decisions, and he has a lot of them to make,\" a spokesman told Russia's Interfax. In some areas, free food and discounts in local shops were on offer near polling stations. Video recordings from polling stations showed irregularities in a number of towns and cities across Russia. Several showed election officials stuffing boxes with ballot papers. Mr Navalny was excluded from the election because of an embezzlement conviction that he said was manufactured by the Kremlin. In his first reaction to the news, Mr Navalny indicated he had been unable to contain his anger. \"Now is the season of Lent. I took it upon myself never to get angry and not to raise my voice.

President Vladimir Putin would make a final decision and \"won't take long\" to respond, his spokesman said. The UK took its action after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on a former spy and his daughter in the UK. Russia denies it was involved.

UK to build new chemical defence centre On Thursday, the leaders of France, Germany, the US and UK issued a joint statement on the attack, condemning the \"first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War\". What have the Russians actually said? Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been speaking on the issue at an event in Moscow, although Russian media reports of what he has said have been conflicting. The RIA Novosti agency quoted him as saying Russia would \"definitely\" expel UK diplomats \"soon\". But he was quoted by others as saying that Russia would inform British authorities first before any media announcement. \"This is, in my view, being polite; this is how gentlemen behave,\" he said. Mr Lavrov was also quoted by Tass as saying he hoped the former spy, Sergei Skripal, would recover so he could shed light on events. Interfax quoted the foreign minister as saying a motive behind the UK's actions might be to complicate Russia's hosting of Fifa's World Cup this summer.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned what she said were \"absolutely insane accusations made by the UK prime minister against Russia\", adding that the UK had failed to provide any factual information about the case. She said diplomatic notes sent to the Foreign Office had received replies that \"made no sense\". What is the latest from the UK?

Moscow wanted to \"simultaneously deny it and at the same time to glory in it\", he said, adding the nerve agent was chosen \"to show that it is Russia\". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia \"should go away and should shut up\". How did we get here? Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March and remain critically ill in hospital. The chemical used in the attack has been identified as part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia known as Novichok, Mrs May said.

Media caption, Theresa May announces measures to send a \"clear message\" to Russia over the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury The prime minister, who visited Salisbury on Thursday , said there was \"no alternative conclusion\" than to believe Russia was \"culpable\" for the poisonings. She had given Russia a deadline of last Tuesday evening to explain the use of the nerve agent. Mr Lavrov then said Moscow would co-operate if the UK submitted a formal request under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which gives a 10-day time limit to respond. But after Tuesday's deadline passed, the UK announced the expulsions. In addition, the UK has announced measures that include increased checks on private flights, customs and freight as well as a boycott of this year's Fifa World Cup in Russia by ministers and the Royal Family. How have other nations reacted? Thursday's four-nation joint statement said the western allies shared the UK's view that Russia was responsible. \"Russia's failure to address the legitimate request by the UK government further underlines its responsibility,\" it said. \"We call on Russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security.\" Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would announce unspecified \"measures\" in the coming days over the poisoning. He said: \"I condemn in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable attack. Everything leads us to believe that responsibility can be attributed to Russia.\" On Wednesday, the White House said it \"stands in solidarity\" with \"its closest ally\" the UK and supported its decision to expel the Russian diplomats.

{"year":"2018","month":"05","event_desc":"5 May  Thousand Protest rally in 97 cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, against Vladimir Putin for winning a fourth term in the Russian President Election.","text":"World Protesters detained as thousands rally against Putin's government Opposition politician Alexei Navalny called on demonstrators to gather in cities around Russia. Russian police arrest a protester at an opposition rally organized by Alexei Navalny in Moscow on May 5, 2018. Sergei Ilnitsky \/ EPA \/ Updated By Yuliya Talmazan and Elena Holodny MOSCOW \u2014 Riot police moved in at a rally in Moscow Saturday afternoon as thousands of people took to the streets to voice their discontent with the government of Vladimir Putin, just days before his inauguration for a fourth presidential term. Thousands took part in the rally in Moscow's Pushkinskaya Square, where some protesters were detained by police and thrown into buses as the crowd chanted anti-Putin slogans. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist who was barred from running in the 2018 presidential election, was detained within minutes of showing up to the rally and dragged away by police. Navalny called on people demonstrate in nearly a hundred cities across the world's largest country to convey to Putin, who won a landslide victory in the March presidential election with over 76 percent of the vote , that he won't be allowed to rule \"as a czar.\" At the rally in Moscow, people in the crowd were seen holding up banners saying \"I've had enough\" and \"I am against corruption,\" chanting \"Putin is a thief\" and \"away with the czar.\" Many also waved Russian flags as police stood by and helicopters hovered above. Opposition supporters rally in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Saturday. Anton Vaganov \/ Reuters \"I want to live free in Russia where everyone will be equal,\" high school student Daniel, 17, who didn't want to reveal his last name, told NBC News when asked why he joined the protests. As the crowd swelled, police swept in. Some protesters told Russia's TV Rain the detentions seemed random and heavy-handed. Protesters were shouting \"shame on you\" at police officers as people were being taken away. Artist Ekaterina, 36, who also didn't want her last name shared, said she hoped the government would hear them. \"There is a big chunk of people who don\u2019t agree with what\u2019s happening in the country, who didn\u2019t go out to vote, and who don\u2019t consider the elections legitimate,\" she said. \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u2014 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 2 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442! pic.twitter.com\/qdDRmUv8jj \u2014 \u042d\u0445\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b (@EchoMskRu) May 5, 2018 Many told the media they were inspired by the events in Armenia, where a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience caused the long-time leader of the small Eastern European state to step down. \"Armenia has shown the people get to decide,\" one protester in Pushkinskaya Square told TV Rain. Navalny had previously said Armenia should set \"a good example for Russia\" on how the persistence of people taking to the streets can drive change. In a YouTube video viewed by nearly 3 million people ahead of the protests, the 41-year-old lawyer said 53 million Russians didn't vote for Putin in March and their interests need to be taken into consideration. Pro-government and opposition supporters clash during Saturday's protest in Moscow. Kirill Kudryavtsev \/ AFP - Getty Images \"They are different people, with different views, but as a whole, they have thoughts and ideas about Russia's future that differ from that of Putin,\" Navalny said. \"Their opinions must be heard because they are the citizens of Russia too. Right now, they... we... are being ignored.\" Rallies were expected to take place in 97 cities around Russia, with a number of them unsanctioned by authorities \u2014 including the protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Navalny claims the rallies comply with the Russian constitution, but have been \"illegally banned\" by authorities. Russian media reported Saturday that detentions took place at rallies throughout the country before the protest in the capital even began. Interfax news agency reported a number of Navalny's supporters were detained on Friday \u2014 a day ahead of the protests. Overall, nearly 1,600 people were detained at anti-government rallies across Russia on Saturday, according to OVD-Info \u2014 a group that monitors political repression in Russia. Navalny tweeted overnight that he was released from custody until his pending court date. He said he stands accused of organizing a protest rally and resisting police. But while thousands took to the streets, the Kremlin was getting ready for Putin's inauguration on Monday in a ceremony that will likely be heavy on pomp and circumstance. Putin's election victory extended his lock on power to 24 years \u2014 longer than any Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. Latest polls show the 65-year-old continues to enjoy an approval rating of over 80 percent , with many crediting him with having restored national pride and expanded Moscow\u2019s global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine. Critics like Navalny accuse Putin of overseeing a corrupt authoritarian system, while the financial well-being of millions of Russians continues to deteriorate. Related news news Russian election: Navalny rallies army of observers to counter Putin Putin has dismissed Navalny as a troublemaker bent on sowing chaos on behalf of Washington. The rally in Moscow brought back memories of violent clashes in 2012 \u2014 also ahead of Putin's inauguration. Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested then, with many ending up in prison after trials that dragged on for years, resulting in Russian lawmakers passing new severe penalties for anyone taking part in unauthorized protests. Saturday's protests also followed a peaceful rally attended by more than 12,000 people in Moscow earlier this week to protest the ban of popular messaging app Telegram. The app was banned by Russia's communication watchdog last month over an encryption dispute, prompting an outcry from many Russians who felt the government was infringing on the free Internet. The ban was enforced after app developers refused to comply with a court order to grant state security services access to its users\u2019 encrypted messages for security purposes. Protesters chanted slogans against Putin's government as they launched paper planes -- a reference to the app\u2019s logo. Navalny attended the rally and took to the stage, accusing the current government of rampant corruption and infringement of basic freedoms. \"I won't take it,\" Navalny yelled out to the excited crowd. \"We don't need a csar. Away with the csar,\" he said. Yuliya Talmazan reported from London, Elena Holodny from Moscow.

The victims were slashed when they tried to tackle two teenage boys who burst into a classroom wielding knives. Two suspects, both 16, were detained by police and the incident is being treated as attempted murder. Surgeons operated on 47-year-old teacher Natalya Shagunina and on four of the children, RIA Novosti news said. The teacher remains critically ill, the others' injuries are less severe. Most of the injured children are aged 10-12 and have knife cuts to the head and neck. The school was evacuated and will remain shut on Tuesday as police pursue a criminal investigation there. EPA Classes were abandoned because of the emergency at the school Conflicting reports Some witnesses quoted on social media contradicted reports from local security officials about what happened. The witnesses said the two boys with knives had attacked the teacher and slashed pupils who rushed to defend her. One, quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda daily, said the two boys were clad in black, armed with hunting knives and acted together. Earlier, a security source quoted by Interfax news agency said two boys had started a knife fight in a corridor, then burst into a classroom where younger children were studying. Interfax quoted another local source as saying one of the boys had been expelled from the school, because of drugs and mental health issues, but got in after telling a guard outside that he was a pupil. There are reports that one assailant, or both, had been angered by personal comments on social media. Children said they saw blood on the floor as they were led out.

making the study of minority languages, including Tatar, optional rather than compulsory. Prior to the bill, Tatar was a mandatory subject in schools in Tatarstan, reflecting the region's ethnic and linguistic identity. However, the new legislation emphasized the primacy of the Russian language in the education system across the country, allowing parents to choose whether their children would study regional languages.

For all its possession and territory, the former world champion was far from convincing against a disciplined Russian side.

Putin's approval rating has fallen by around 10 percentage points since the proposed reforms were announced [Sergei Karpukhin\/Reuters] Published On 2 Sep 2018 2 Sep 2018 Thousands of Russians have joined protests against plans to raise the retirement age, despite a recent move by President Vladimir Putin to soften the deeply unpopular measure. Large crowds on Sunday gathered close to the Kremlin in the capital, Moscow, with many demonstrators carrying the red flags and banners of the opposition KPRF Communist Party, the main organiser of the rally. Around 9,000 people took to the streets, a ccording to White Counter, an NGO that counts participants at rallies. Moscow police put the number of participants at 6,000. A large banner reading \u201cWe do not trust United Russia\u201d, was held up by protesters and featured a drawing of a red fist punching the white polar bear logo of Putin\u2019s ruling party, according to Reuters news agency. \u201cToday we are holding an all-Russia protest against this cannibalistic reform,\u201d Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, told protesters. A separate Moscow gathering, organised by the Just Russia party, drew some 1,500 people, police said. Protests also took place in other Russian cities, including Siberia\u2019s Novosibirsk and Vladivostok. Advertisement They were the latest in a series of demonstrations against the government proposal, announced in June, to gradually raise the pension age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women in a change that would also affect the age at which Russians can receive state retirement pensions. Following the public outcry, Putin took personal responsibility for the reform for the first time in a televised address on Wednesday, describing it as a financial necessity and asking Russians for their understanding. {articleGUID} During his speech, Putin offered to lower the proposed retirement age for women from 63 to 60, women currently retire at 55. The proposed raise for men would remain unchanged. The measure is intended to address workplace shortages and boost the economy. However, unions and activists have raised concerns that, should the proposal be accepted, many Russians may not live long enough to claim a state pension. According to the World Health Organization , Russian men have an average life expectancy of 66 years, while for women the figure is 77. Critics say in some regions, the new retirement age would exceed life expectancy. Putin\u2019s approval rating has fallen by around 10 percentage points since the proposed reforms were announced, according to the Levada Center, an independent Moscow-based polling organisation, although it still stands at around 70 percent. Critics of the proposal say in some regions, the new retirement age would exceed life expectancy [Pavel Golovkin\/The Associated Press] \u2018Whoever stays at home enables the thieves\u2019 Anna Borschevskaya, a fellow at The Washington Institute focusing on Russia\u2019s foreign and domestic policy, told Al Jazeera that, despite the concession, many Russians feel Putin is to blame for the proposals. Advertisement \u201cH e presented himself as this fatherly figure who is stepping in at the last minute to intervene to save everyone, but ultimately the public holds him responsible,\u201d she said. \u201cThese reforms demonstrate Russia\u2019s economic decline and the government\u2019s inability to handle development because Russia is a system that is not geared towards development of the country \u2026 \u00a0For example, the government had stopped contributing to the pension fund to finance the Crimea annexation, so it\u2019s prioritising political motives, funding foreign adventures over domestic development.\u201d {articleGUID} The economy has been suffering for several years, burdened by sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and a drop in oil prices . In late August, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, a key figure in arranging Sunday\u2019s protests, was arrested in Moscow. Navalny\u2019s spokesperson linked his detainment to his call for protests against the pension reform. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you will be able to do it without me. The protest will be held in almost 100 cities in the country, you must join,\u201d the opposition politician said in an Instagram post from detention last week. \u201cSwindlers and thieves will not quit by themselves and no one except for us can defend our pensions and our present and future. Whoever stays at home enables the thieves,\u201d he said.

Almost 3 million people have signed an online petition against the unpopular reform [The Associated Press] Published On 28 Jul 2018 28 Jul 2018 Tens of thousands of people have joined demonstrations in several Russian cities to protest against government plans to raise the retirement age. More than 10,000 people attended a rally in the capital, Moscow, on Saturday. The event was one of several approved rallies arranged by Russia\u2019s Communist Party, with demonstrations also taking place in the country\u2019s second-biggest city of St Petersburg and other large urban centres. The government has proposed gradually raising the pension age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women. The change would also affect the age at which Russians can receive state retirement pensions. Demonstrators carried banners with slogans such as \u201cWe want to live on our pensions not die at work\u201d, according to Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty . Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, said the proposed reform would be \u201ca blow to every citizen\u201d and accused President Vladimir Putin \u2018s ruling United Russia party\u00a0of attempting to pass unpopular legislation.

Unions and activists have raised concerns that, should the proposal be accepted, many people may not live long enough to claim a state pension. {articleGUID} According to the World Health Organization , Russian men have an average life expectancy of 66 years, while for women the figure is 77. Critics say in some regions, the new retirement age would exceed life expectancy. Protesters are calling for a national referendum to be held before the parliament considers further readings of the bill, after it resumes in September. Earlier this month, Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament gave its first-reading approval to the measure, which is intended to address workplace shortages and boost the economy. \u2018Common robbery\u2019 The Russian economy has been suffering for several years, burdened by sanctions imposed after the country\u2019s annexation of Crimea and a drop in oil prices . Natalya Poklonskaya, the only United Russia MP to vote against the bill, has faced calls for her resignation after party members were told to sign a pledge promising not to criticise the unpopular wage rise, a ccording to The Moscow Times , a weekly English-language newspaper. {articleGUID} On July 1, smaller protests took place in around 30 Russian cities to oppose the bill, which was announced the day before the World Cup began. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said on Twitter at the time that the proposed rise was a \u201ccrime\u201d. \u201cIt is common robbery of tens of millions of people under the guise of \u2018much-needed\u2019 reform,\u201d he said. Protests were banned in World Cup host cities during the competition, which ended on July 15.

November 29, 2018. \u00a9 2018\/AP Photo\/Anton Basanayev (Moscow) \u2013 Russian authorities have been interfering with performances of rappers and other musicians popular with younger audiences, forcing them to cancel concerts in acts of censorship that violate freedom of expression, Human Rights Watch said today. According to Meduza , an independent online media outlet, from October to December 2018, at least 36 performances in cities across Russia were cancelled due to official intervention. Many of the targeted performers are part of Russia\u2019s rap and hip-hop scene, and several are punk rock or electronic groups. In most cases, the authorities claimed they were upholding laws protecting children from the promotion of suicide, narcotics, and other harmful substances. In some cases, they claimed performances risked violating Russia\u2019s ban on \u201cgay propaganda.\u201d \u201cRussia\u2019s authorities are censoring music under the guise of protecting children,\u201d said Tanya Lokshina , Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch. The concerts were cancelled or broken up by police, Federal Security Service (FSB) agents, local prosecutors\u2019 offices, municipal authorities, and Rospotrebnadzor, Russia\u2019s consumer protection bureau. Typically, the authorities pressured venue managers to cancel performances by issuing official warnings citing child protection or threatening to close the sites if the concerts went ahead. Officials also used such pretexts as alleged bomb scares and sanitation violations. In some cases, complaints filed by groups of concerned citizens apparently triggered the authorities\u2019 actions. Play Video Human Rights Watch interviewed six lawyers and one tour manager for artists who had particularly serious problems. Human Rights Watch also examined six warnings issued by the authorities to performance sites in six cities and gathered information regarding forced cancellations of concerts from the recording artists\u2019 social media pages and the news media. One of the hardest hit was Husky, one of Russia\u2019s most popular rappers. Venues in Togliatti, Volgograd, Vologda, and Samara cancelled his concerts under pressure from the authorities. Police in Rostov-on-Don broke up his concert. In Krasnodar, one site cancelled his performance, then police broke up his concert at another site and arrested him as he sang to his fans in the street. Outraged by his arrest, a group of rappers organized a solidarity concert in Moscow. \u201c[Husky\u2019s] freedom to express himself and make a living are [in jeopardy],\u201d said Oxxxymiron, a top Russian rapper, in a video posted on his social media page . \u201cThis is lawlessness. I don\u2019t share some of [Husky\u2019s] views but\u2026 I think it is absolutely necessary to help him in this difficult situation. This is not so much about Husky, but about all of us, and the future of music in Russia.\u201d Authorities in Nizhny Novgorod pressured two sites to cancel performances by IC3PEAK, an electronic duo. Two sites cancelled their bookings in Kazan, and authorities broke up their performance at a third. In Perm, three sites cancelled, and law enforcement officials kept the group under surveillance. A venue cancelled a booking in Novosibirsk, where the police detained IC3PEAK for three hours after they arrived, and another venue cancelled a booking in Krasnoyarsk. In Voronezh, Rospotrebnadzor threatened to close a concert venue and the police attempted to break up their concert. Three sites cancelled bookings by Friendzone, a band popular with teenagers, in Krasnoyarsk. In Kemerovo, police, municipal and prosecutor\u2019s office officials coerced the site management to cancel one hour before a Friendzone performance. They ignored the group\u2019s offers to change the original 12+ age tag to 16+ or 18+. Sites in Vologda and Volgograd also cancelled performances because of official pressure. Friendzone\u2019s manager cancelled the remaining nine concerts on the group\u2019s tour because they did not seem feasible under such circumstances. The cancellations were accompanied by extensive news coverage and a crescendo of government officials and policymakers condemning rappers and other performers popular among younger audiences. Vitaly Khmelnitsky, a senior Interior Ministry official, said during a December 7, 2018 roundtable discussion in the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament that \u201cthis [music] should not expose people\u2019s disgusting and low vices, pushing them to commit crimes, but [instead] cultivate the values of leading a decent, full and healthy life, serving the country...\u201d By late November, several officials had spoken out against the cancellations. President Putin\u2019s Special Representative on Culture compared prohibiting rap music to the ban on certain rock musicians in the USSR in the 1980s. And Sergei Kiriyenko, the deputy head of Russia\u2019s presidential administration said , \u201cWe must be able to work with modern youth culture,\u201d and that banning concerts was \u201cnonsense.\u201d In December, President Vladimir Putin said that rap music was based on drugs, sex, and protest, but suggested that cancelling concerts was \u201cinefficient\u201d and that authorities should instead \u201clead [performers] in the right direction.\u201d In January, the federal prosecutor general\u2019s office instructed its regional branches to determine whether the wave of cancellations was lawful. There has not yet been any public information on actions taken by the offices\u2019 inquiries. Neither Husky, IC3PEAK, nor Friendzone, tried to tour in January and February, so it is not clear whether they will face more interference. However, on February 13, Makroconcert, an arts and entertainment company in Kaliningrad, stated that a concert by Allj , a hip-hop performer, scheduled for February 16, had to be cancelled \u201cdue to pressure\u201d from governmental agencies and nongovernmental actors. The head of Makroconcert, the concert organizers, said that the pressure was triggered, among other things, by a public petition calling on officials to cancel the concert because such art \u201cruns contrary to [Russia\u2019s] cultural policies,\u201d and stating that Allj\u2019s music is a \u201cdamaging influence\u201d on children and adults.\u201d Click to expand Image People cheer during a concert in support of rapper Husky, in Moscow in Moscow, Russia.

In her March 2013 report to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the special rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, noted that \u201cartists should be able to explore the darker side of humanity, and to represent crimes or what some may consider as \u201cimmorality\u201d without being accused of promoting these.\u201d \u201cRussia\u2019s authorities should stop censoring concerts,\u201d Lokshina said. \u201cTheir actions aren\u2019t protecting anyone and are instead violating free expression.\u201d Russian Law The 2010 Law #436-FZ on Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development bans the dissemination among children of information and images pertaining to suicide, drug use, and the like. In 2012, it was expanded through the adoption of Law #139-FZ mandating the creation of a blacklist of internet content harmful to children and a regulation introducing age-specific advisories for publications, broadcasters, films, performances, etc. In 2013, parliament adopted Law #135-FZ , widely known as the \u201cgay propaganda ban,\u201d to prohibit promoting among children \u201cthe denial of traditional family values,\u201d and \u201cnon-traditional sexual relations.\u201d Article 6.17 of Russia\u2019s Administrative Code prohibits dissemination among children of prohibited materials, including those that have obscenities or encourage consumption of alcohol and or prohibited substances. Husky Husky (real name Dmitry Kuznetsov) became widely known among Russian rap and hip-hop fans after the release of his 2011 debut single \u201c 7 October,\u201d coinciding with Putin\u2019s birthday. The song depicted a king at a feast while his subjects live in poverty. In January 2018, Husky was named Russia\u2019s third most popular rapper in an online surve y. His videos and lyrics are rich in metaphors, and include graphic, violent, and sexually explicit imagery. His music videos have garnered millions of views, and he has over 243,000 followers on VKontakte (VK), a prominent social media site. On October 26, Husky\u2019s planned concert in Togliatti was cancelled. According to social media posts by Husky and the concert\u2019s organizers, the cancellation allegedly followed a warning from the prosecutor\u2019s office to the concert site. Husky wrote on his VK page that the prosecutor\u2019s office objected to his song \u201cPoem about the Motherland,\u201d which included the line, \u201cRemember how you died and we ate your flesh?\u201d Two weeks before a November 4 Husky concert in Samara, the local prosecutor\u2019s office inspected the venue to ensure \u201c compliance with the rights and lawful interests of minors and youth \u201d and issued a written warning because it used a 16+ age marker on ads for the concert, rather than an 18+ age marker. The venue informed the concert organizers that it could not accommodate the event. In mid-November, YouTube blocked one of Husky\u2019s popular music videos, \u201cJudas,\u201d for users accessing it from Russia \u201c upon [government] demand .\u201d On January 9, Russia\u2019s media and communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, clarified that the Interior Ministry issued the order to block the video because it contained information about drugs. The video includes some images of people rolling and smoking cigarettes. It remains inaccessible on YouTube in Russia. On November 20 in Rostov-on-Don, two policemen and several nonuniformed officials appeared at a venue just before the start of Husky\u2019s concert. Husky\u2019s tour VK page said that they handed Husky\u2019s manager a written warning about extremism and regulations on public gatherings . The venue administration asked Husky and his team to leave and stopped admitting people into the hall. The electricity in the hall was cut and the microphones stopped working. Husky entertained his audience in the dark without a microphone. Husky\u2019s concert in Krasnodar was scheduled for November 21, but the club cancelled at short notice after a warning from the local prosecutor\u2019s office that some of Husky\u2019s songs included \u201c calls to suicide, violent actions, manifestations of extremism, and propaganda of narcotics .\u201d Husky\u2019s managers moved the concert to another site, but just after the sound check ended the electricity cut out. Eventually, Husky went outside, where his fans gathered, and he jumped on the roof of a car and started performing. The police pulled Husky off the car and dragged him away. Husky\u2019s lawyer, Alexey Avanesyan told Human Rights Watch: The [concert] organizers called me at 7:30 p.m. and said that there were Cossacks, some militia, and policemen gathered by the club and a big crowd of people with tickets waiting by the entrance but\u2026the electricity got cut off \u2026 They asked me to come and sort things out, and when I arrived\u2026 I saw him [Husky] climbing on the car... He began singing and everyone started singing along\u2026 It was 8:40, and by 8:42, the police \u2026 dragged him by his feet, they twisted his arms behind his back.\u201d Husky spent the night in custody. On November 22, a court in Krasnodar sentenced him to 12 days in detention on charges of \u201cminor hooliganism.\u201d Husky\u2019s managers had to cancel his concerts planned in six other cities . On November 26, the court annulled the sentence and Husky was released . Margarita Simonyan, chief editor of RT, the Russian government\u2019s television network, tweeted that Husky\u2019s early release was the result of \u201ctwo, three\u201d Kremlin officials who liked his music personally intervening in the case. Husky\u2019s troubles did not stop after his release. Agents arranged a concert in Vologda on December 2, but several days before the event, media reports said the administration for the club where he was to perform contacted his manager saying they had to cancel the performance as the prosecutor\u2019s office and police threatened to close the club down. Friendzone Friendzone\u2019s music is influenced by acoustics, pop, rap, and punk. The music is primarily aimed at teenagers and covers themes of adolescent angst, with references to high school discos, sexual frustration, alcohol, and smoking. Their music videos and promotional materials are infused with candy colors and \u201cbubble gum pop\u2019\u201d visuals. The group\u2019s rising popularity is evident from their fast-growing page on VK. The page was created in April 2018 and now has nearly 360,000 subscribers. Their biggest hit to date, \u201cBoychik,\u201d has over 11 million views on YouTube. Anastasia Zaytseva, the group\u2019s tour manager, told Human Rights Watch that Friendzone\u2019s November-December tour was ruined because local authorities had issued warnings to the venues, alleging that because Friendzone\u2019s performance was marketed as open to ages 12+ (16 is the age of consent in Russia) it could put them in violation of child protection laws, including the gay-propaganda ban . In the warnings, four of which are on file with Human Rights Watch, local authorities allege that the group\u2019s music incites children to drink alcohol, use other banned substances, contemplate suicide, disrespect traditional family values, and engage in \u201cnon-traditional sexual relations.\u201d Zaytseva said that in their communications with the venue owners, the authorities invariably exhibited special concern about Friendzone\u2019s song \u201cThe Bottle,\u201d which involves a group playing \u201cspin the bottle,\u201d the bottle pointing at two girls, and the girls kissing. The lyrics of the song include, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t forget her lips on my lips, Spin the bottle!\u201d and \u201cLove is independent of sex.\" Zaytseva told venues the band would exclude that song from the program, as well as any other songs the authorities thought inappropriate. She also suggested changing the concerts\u2019 age tag to 18+. However, the venues were sufficiently intimidated by the warnings and believed that there would be repercussions for hosting a Friendzone performance. In some cases, venues cancelled the concerts at the last minute. In one case, they contacted the manager in advance of the scheduled performance. On November 12, the group was scheduled to give a concert in Krasnoyarsk, but the venue administration suddenly cancelled . The group found another site, but it also cancelled. The tour manager found a third, but one hour before the soundcheck, Zaytseva found out that the prosecutor\u2019s office called the venue\u2019s manager for \u201ca meeting.\u201d Zaytseva told Human Rights Watch that she rushed there. Officials did not allow Zaytseva into the meeting, but afterwards one official showed Zaytseva a copy of the official warning that had been handed to the venue manager, which said that holding the concert would amount to several violations of Russia\u2019s child protection laws. The document, which Zaytseva photographed, and which Human Rights Watch reviewed, states that the local children\u2019s ombudsperson had filed a complaint alleging that Friendzone\u2019s songs \u201cpropagates alcohol, suicide, etc.\u201d and that concert tickets were sold \u201cwith the 12+ age marker.\u201d A local anti-drug group, \u201cAnti-Dealer,\u201d applauded the cancellation and claimed that it had alerted the authorities in Krasnoyarsk that Friendzone is an \u201cabomination\u201d and that \u201csinging to children about drugs, same-sex love, and debauchery is a crime against the nation.\u201d They also called on \u201cother cities in Siberia\u201d to ban Friendzone\u2019s scheduled performances. On November 13, Friendzone was preparing for a concert in Kemerovo. Less than an hour before the performance, the venue\u2019s manager told Zaytseva, \u201cWe received a phone call from the [city\u2019s] administration. Your age requirements aren\u2019t appropriate.\u201d Zaytseva suggested raising the concert\u2019s age requirement to 18+. But after a municipal official arrived at the site with a written warning , along with numerous officials from the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office, the manager told Zaytseva and the band to leave. The day before a Friendzone concert in Vologda scheduled for December 4, the venue\u2019s management received a written warning from the local prosecutor\u2019s office about the 12+ age marker. The management rejected Zaytseva\u2019s proposal to raise the entry age to 18+ and cancelled the performance. The warning indicated that the prosecutor\u2019s office had received an alert about the planned concert from the local children\u2019s rights ombudsperson. Several days before a Friendzone concert scheduled in Yaroslavl for December 5, the local prosecutor\u2019s office contacted the organizers, claiming the program was inappropriate for children. The organizers responded by marking the event as 16+ and excluded several songs. However, Zaytseva said on December 5, the venue\u2019s management received calls from \u201cabout 10 official agencies,\u201d including the prosecutor\u2019s office, the fire department, and the anti-extremism police , announcing ad hoc inspections of the venue and \u201ceven the food control agency, which suddenly needed to inspect the kitchen.\u201d Friendzone did not want to put the venue in jeopardy and cancelled the concert. Friendzone also cancelled a concert scheduled for December 6 in Ivanovo, alleging \u201cpressure and threats by law enforcement agencies.\u201d \u201c Going ahead with a concert under these circumstances is simply impossible ,\u201d the group posted on its VK page. Then, the rest of tour was cancelled. IC3PEAK IC3PEAK, a duet of Anastasia Kreslina and Nikolay Kostylyov, describe their style as \u201c Russian horror hip hop .\u201d Their songs typically deal with topics deemed controversial, including politics, LGBT issues, and drugs. Their recent videos are gothic in style. Some of the images seem intended to shock. IC3PEAK\u2019s VK page has 167,198 subscribers. Their most recent album, Fairytale, includes their biggest hit, \u201c Death No More ,\u201d which was issued at the end of October 2018 and had close to 19 million views by mid-February. In the video for \u201c Death No More ,\u201d Kreslina drenches herself in kerosene on the steps of the Russian government headquarters and Kostylyov lights a match; then they are shown pretending to eat raw liver in front of Lenin\u2019s mausoleum and playing patty-cake while sitting on the shoulders of two men in riot police uniform outside FSB headquarters in Moscow. The clip also includes images of them drowned and burned to ashes. The lyrics include references to police round-ups, suicide, destruction, and drugs. Following the release of \u201cDeath No More,\u201d IC3PEAK faced interference by authorities with their concerts in at least 10 Russian cities. A few days before IC3PEAK\u2019s scheduled November 22 performance in Nizhny Novgorod , local Emergencies Ministry officials arrived at the site and pressured the management to cancel the event. On November 19, the tour organizers made arrangements with another venue, but fire safety inspectors arrived there and demanded that the concert be cancelled, threatening to close down the club for supposed violations of fire safety regulations. At the last minute, the organizers found another site, where IC3PEAK eventually performed. Human Rights Watch spoke with Timur Miftakhutdinov, a lawyer with Agora human rights network, who represented IC3PEAK in Kazan. Miftakhutdinov described the pressure brought to cancel IC3PEAK\u2019s concert in Kazan, scheduled for November 23 . Miftakhutdinov said the municipality called the club and pressured the management. IC3PEAK moved the concert to another site outside the city center. However, shortly before the sound check, municipal officials, FSB, and police arrived and demanded that they cancel. IC3PEAK moved the concert to yet another site, but 30 minutes into the performance, Miftakhutdinov said, authorities arrived, made the club shut off the electricity and forced everyone to leave. Police claimed there had been a bomb scare, but Miftakhutdinov, who was at the concert, said the police at the venue did not behave as if they were genuinely responding to a bomb scare. The electricity was turned off, so Nastia [Kreslina] sang \u201cDeath No More\u201d a capella [and in the dark ]. Once the track finished, people started leaving. By the time police entered the venue almost everyone left\u2026 As we were leaving, a police colonel walked in saying \u201cOut! Out!\u201d If there were reasons to fear an explosion, it\u2019s a demining specialist, a canine team who should be coming in, not a police colonel\u2026 In Perm, where IC3PEAK had a concert scheduled for November 27, two venues cancelled due to pressure by authorities, said Olga Bederson, another lawyer with Agora who represented IC3PEAK in Perm. She said the group managed to line up a third site, but at about 7:30 p.m., an hour before the performance, an FSB agent accompanied by police officials entered the club and met privately with the club\u2019s manager. When the meeting ended, the manager told IC3PEAK the concert would not take place. Police officials ordered the fans to leave, threatening those reluctant to leave with public disturbance charges. People started leaving. Bederson said that some law enforcement officers in civilian clothes forced IC3PEAK into the club\u2019s fenced-in backyard and one claimed he had orders to \u201ctake them outside the city limits.\u201d Bederson, who arrived at the venue at around 8 p.m., said: [I said] \u201cThe guys have train tickets from Perm [by train] for tomorrow. Why take them outside the city?... What are they accused of?... And the man said, \u201cThey are not accused of anything,\u201d but he needed to accompany them \u201cin the interests of their safety.\u201d Eventually the group was allowed to leave the premises. Bederson, who maintained contact with the group until their departure from Perm the next day, said that security officials followed IC3PEAK\u2019s taxi, parked by their lodging, waited there all night, and followed the group to the train in the morning. On November 29, the prosecutor\u2019s office in Tyumen issued a warning to the site Dom Pechati, where IC3PEAK was scheduled to perform on November 30, alleging that the concert could violate child protection laws, and also noting that it had not undergone a terrorism safety check, mandatory for a place where large numbers of people gather, and that because it lacked a security certificate it could not hold \u201ca mass event\u201d (i.e. a concert). Dom Pechati went ahead with the concert. On November 28, according to media reports, a venue in Novosibirsk informed IC3PEAK\u2019s tour manager, Oleg Mitrofanov, they were canceling the concert planned there for December 1. The venue\u2019s administration refused to comment on the reasons behind the cancellation . The tour manager found another venue. On December 1, police detained IC3PEAK at around 6:00 p.m. when they arrived in Novosibirsk. Police approached the group when they got off the train and claimed that the police dog smelled something suspicious in IC3PEAK\u2019s luggage. Police handcuffed Kostylyov and took him and Mitrofanov to a nearby precinct. Kreslina immediately called their local Agora-affiliated lawyer, Valentin Demidenko, who arrived promptly. Demidenko told Human Rights Watch that police detained Kostylyov and Mitrofanov in connection with an alleged \u201canonymous alert about drugs.\u201d The police searched both men and their luggage, found nothing, and released them without charge three hours later. Demidenko said police at the station were polite but did not provide any information as to the identity and affiliation of the officers who had arrested the men. After IC3PEAK\u2019s release, they performed at the second venue without disruption. On December 2, IC3PEAK had a concert scheduled in Krasnoyarsk, but the site management cancelled the day before , alleging wiring problems. Shortly after IC3PEAK and Mitrofanov arrived in Krasnoyarsk, local anti-extremism police called them and suggested a meeting. The tour manager met with police, together with Vladmir Vasin, an Agora-affiliated lawyer in Krasnoyarsk. Vasin told Human Rights Watch that the police were polite, said they would be monitoring the concert, and promised that as long the 16+ age restriction was observed, IDs checked, and alcohol consumption not excessive, \u201cthere would not be any problems.\u201d Several other venues refused to host the concert, which eventually took place without incident. On December 6, in Voronezh, a Rospotrebnadzor official arrived at the club where IC3PEAK was scheduled to perform that evening, saying he had to run tests due to an alleged food poisoning complaint. According to IC3PEAK\u2019s local lawyer, Nikita Chermashentsev, the official then left without drawing up any documents. Police arrived there about an hour later, shortly before the performance was scheduled to start. They told the management that the Rospotrebnadzor official had filed a complaint alleging that the club had prevented him from carrying out his duties. Police also showed a Rospotrebnadzor order to temporarily close the bar. \u201cI spoke to one of the officers privately,\u201d Chermashentsev told Human Rights Watch. \u201cHe explained that they received an order to prevent the event from happening.\u201d Police blocked the fans from entering the club, but Mitrofanov led 50 to 70 fans through the back door, and the group played almost a complete album for them. \u201cIf a Rospotrebnadzor [official] were prevented from conducting an inspection\u2026 I very much doubt that [police] would come,\u201d Chermashentsev said. \u201cAnd even if they did, there wouldn\u2019t be so many of them, and not as quickly [as in this case].\u201d IC3PEAK\u2019s remaining four concerts in December took place without disruption. On December 23, IC3PEAK wrote on their VK page : Thanks to the publicity in the media and the help of human rights defenders, the last few concerts of the tour in Russia avoided the censors and were held without problems. When it became clear that the security forces would interfere with us absolutely everywhere, we could have simply cancelled the tour. But we decided to see it through until the end, to be an example and show that you cannot ban music.

The charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, Tass said. A criminal case was opened against Khodorkovsky in September regarding comments he made online about payments for Russian soldiers killed in the war in Ukraine, Tass said. Khodorkovsky already spent a decade in prison in Russia on charges widely seen as political revenge for challenging President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule in the early 2000s. He now lives in London and has frequently criticized Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine on his social media accounts. In December, Khodorkovsky said Russia is a \u201cfully-fledged totalitarian dictatorship\u201d and that he wants to \u201cfight for a Russia governed by the rule of law and political pluralism.\u201d Khodorkovsky was previously put on Russia\u2019s wanted list in 2015 after Russian authorities accused him of involvement in the 1998 killing of a Siberian mayor, accusations which he dismissed as a sham.

Als dat daadwerkelijk zo is, betekent dat niet alleen een gevoelige klap voor de exportcapaciteit van de Russische olie- en gasindustrie, maar is het ook een teken dat de reikwijdte van dit soort Oekra\u00efense aanvallen toeneemt en dat grotere delen van Rusland kwetsbaar zijn.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of \u201cplaying with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners\u201d over the crash of a military transport plane that Moscow blamed on Ukraine. The Ilyushin Il-76 came down in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Wednesday, killing everyone on board. The Russian Ministry of Defence said 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were on the plane in preparation for a prisoner swap, as well as six Russian crew and three Russian soldiers. \u201cIt is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday evening address. He did not confirm or deny Russia\u2019s claims, but said it had been a \u201cvery difficult day\u201d. \u201cWe need to establish all the clear facts. As much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,\u201d he said. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was hit as it was travelling from a military aerodrome near Moscow to Belgorod. Close to the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has been targeted in recent weeks by Ukrainian air strikes. The ministry claimed, without offering evidence, that radars had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.    \u201cOn board were 65 captured Ukrainian army servicemen being transported to the Belgorod region for exchange, six crew members and three escorts,\u201d state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the defence ministry as saying. It did not provide any evidence for the claim. A few hours afterwards, the Ukrainian military said it had noticed more Russian military transport aircraft landing in Belgorod, something it linked to continued Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. \u201cUkraine has the right to defend itself and destroy the means of the aggressors\u2019 aerial attack,\u201d said Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. The Kremlin told reporters that it was investigating the reports on the plane, as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying Russia aimed to establish \u201cthe reasons behind the Ukrainian criminal act\u201d. A French spokesperson at the UN said the meeting would be held at 5pm (22:00 GMT) on Thursday. Zelenskyy also called for an international investigation into the crash. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency said in a statement it had no \u201creliable or comprehensive information\u201d on who was on board the plane or in what number\u201d. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defence, said that an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine had been prepared for Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing Radio Free Europe, a media outlet based in the Czech Republic. Yusov added that the prisoner exchange would not be going ahead. Military intelligence also said that Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod in contrast to previous swaps and had not been informed about what means of transport would be used and which routes. \u201cOn this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state,\u201d it said in a statement on Telegram. A video posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling and exploding in a fireball. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media that investigators and emergency workers had already arrived at a site in the Korochansky, a district in Belgorod Oblast. \u201cThe plane fell in a field near a populated area. Everyone on board died,\u201d Gladkov said on his Telegram channel. The Il-76 is designed to airlift troops, cargo, military equipment and weapons. It usually has a crew of five and can carry as many as 90 passengers.  Kharkiv and Kyiv came under Russian aerial assault on Tuesday, killing at least 18 people . In December, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d on civilians in the city of Belgorod, after 25 people were killed. Last week, the Kremlin accused Kyiv of killing 27 people in an attack on the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Ukraine has denied the claim.

{"year":"2024","month":"01","event_desc":"31 January  Russia and Ukraine conduct a prisoner exchange on their border with 195 soldiers being returned to Russia, and 207 military personnel and civilians being returned to Ukraine, respectively. The deal is facilitated by the United Arab Emirates.","text":"Ukraine and Russia complete first prisoner swap since plane crash 31 January 2024 Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv & Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford in Kyiv BBC News Share Save @V_Zelenskiy_official One Ukrainian soldier was seen kissing the country's national flag after the reported exchange Russia and Ukraine say they have exchanged captured soldiers - the first swap since the crash of a Russian plane that Moscow claimed had 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) on board. Russia's military says each side got 195 soldiers back on Wednesday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says 207 Ukrainian soldiers were returned. Kyiv questions Moscow's claims that Ukrainian PoWs were on the plane that came down last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday that the Il-76 military transport plane had been downed by Ukraine in the western Belgorod region using an American Patriot system. He provided no proof. The Russian military had previously said that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers were on the plane, which was heading to the area for a prisoner exchange. It said six Russian crew members and three escorting officials were also on board, adding that there were no survivors. Russia has as yet produced no firm evidence of its claims and officials there have a long and proven history of lies and disinformation. Kyiv has not directly denied the Russian statements but says that nothing has been confirmed. Last week, a spokesman for military intelligence in Kyiv told the BBC that he \"does not exclude\" the possibility that PoWs were on the Il-76 plane. Other official statements talk about Ukraine's right to defend itself from Russian missiles, particularly fired from Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border. But many in Ukraine wonder why Russia has not shown images of dozens of dead bodies after the plane crash to back up its assertions. None of the details have been independently verified and both sides have called for an international investigation. Downed Russian plane leaves unanswered questions Wednesday's exchange is the 50th PoW swap since President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In a brief statement, the Russian defence ministry said the exchange was completed after negotiations. \"The released military personnel will be transported by military transport aircraft... to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation,\" it said. Russian Defence Ministry\/Handout via REUTERS Russia's defence ministry released a video purportedly showing exchanged Russian soldiers boarding a bus \"All those released are provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance,\" the statement said. Footage released by the ministry purportedly shows those exchanged Russian soldiers boarding a bus before their flight to Moscow. Meanwhile, President Zelensky wrote in a post on social media: \"Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what. \"We remember every Ukrainian in captivity. Both warriors and civilians. We must bring all of them back,\" he said, thanking Ukraine's top security officials for making the latest exchange possible. Videos filmed by the Ukrainian authorities show the released PoWs spilling off buses, with big grins and shouts of \"Glory to Ukraine!\" One soldier drops to the ground, rolling in the snow, so overjoyed to be back. The men are wearing Russian prison uniforms, their heads are close-shaven and many look gaunt after their time in captivity. Some are in tears, talking to relatives by phone. At the end of the video they all stand, wrapped in Ukraine's national blue-and-yellow flags, and singing the country's anthem. The exchange was kept secret until it happened, for security. Ukraine confirms that the United Arab Emirates was involved as a mediator, as it was earlier this month, but we do not know any details about the negotiations. Ukraine's co-ordination centre for PoWs said among those released were National Guard members, border guards as well as one police officer. The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region Ukraine has said that none of the 65 men who were due for release last week, and who Russia claims were killed, are among the latest to be swapped. However, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence told the BBC some of the other soldiers who did return on Wednesday, had been due to be swapped in the last exchange. The BBC has spoken to friends and relatives of the 65 still unaccounted for. They do not want to comment publicly, but stress that there is no evidence of anything at this point - and they remain hopeful. \"Of course, we're worried,\" a friend of one prisoner said. \"But there is no information, no proof.\" There are still thousands of Ukrainian PoWs being held in Russia. Their families usually have no contact with them at all, and can know nothing about the men's fate until they are suddenly freed in a prisoner swap. One woman, Tetyana, whose son was captured in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Mariupol in 2022, told the BBC she had heard nothing from her son directly ever since. The last confirmation he was even alive was more than a year ago, when a prisoner who was released confirmed that they had shared a cell. Tetyana described the agony of living with such uncertainty and having to convince herself each day that her son was still alive.

In a separate proceeding, a Moscow court convicted a former leader of separatist rebels in Ukraine who called President Vladimir Putin a coward of extremism and sentenced him to four years. Darya Trepova , 26, was convicted by a court in St. Petersburg of carrying out a terrorist attack, illegal trafficking of explosive devices and forging documents in the April 2 blast at the cafe in which Vladlen Tatarsky was killed and 52 others were injured. Tatarsky, 40, was an ardent supporter of the Kremlin\u2019s military action in Ukraine and filed regular reports on the fighting from the front lines. Related stories Flight recorders reportedly found from the plane that Russia says crashed with Ukrainian POWs aboard Russia\u2019s top diplomat accuses US, South Korea and Japan of preparing for war with North Korea NATO signs key artillery ammunition contract to replenish allied supplies and help Ukraine Trepova was seen on video presenting Tatarsky with the bust moments before the blast at the riverside cafe in the historic heart of Russia\u2019s second-largest city where he was leading a discussion. She insisted that she didn\u2019t know the bust contained a bomb. Russian authorities have blamed Ukrainian intelligence agencies for orchestrating the bombing. Authorities in Kyiv have not directly responded to the accusation. The court also convicted Trepova\u2019s acquaintance Dmitry Kasintsev of concealing a grave crime for sheltering her after the blast and sentenced him to 21 months in prison. The Moscow court imposed a four-year sentence on Igor Girkin, who used the surname alias of Strelkov (shooter), was the most prominent leader of Russian-backed separatist fighters in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region in 2014, when rebellion arose after the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s Russia-allied president. He briefly became the self-declared separatist government\u2019s defense minister, but left the post in August 2014 after rebel forces shot down a Malaysian passenger airliner over Donetsk, killing all 298 people aboard. He was convicted in absentia of murder in the Netherlands, where the flight had originated, for his role. He returned to Russia and became a nationalist commentator and activist. He supported launching Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, but sharply criticized authorities for being inept and indecisive in carrying out the fight. Girkin called Putin a \u201cnonentity\u201d and a person of \u201ccowardly mediocrity.\u201d He was arrested in July on extremism charges and remained in custody since then. His conviction reflects the high sensitivity of Russian authorities to criticism and opposition. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, that sensitivity intensified sharply, with the passage of laws criminalizing statements and news reports that allegedly discredit the Russian military. Two protesters calling for Girkin to be freed were detained by police outside the court building, Russian news agencies said. Girkin\u2019s sentence was considerable less harsh than those handed to some figures who have denounced the war, notably the 25-year sentence imposed on opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza . Treopva\u2019s sentence is the longest imposed on a woman in modern Russia, according to the Mediazona website that reports on human rights and justice issues. Tatarsky, who had filed regular reports from Ukraine, was the pen name for Maxim Fomin, who had accumulated more than 560,000 followers on his Telegram messaging app channel. Born in eastern Ukraine, Tatarsky worked as a coal miner before starting a furniture business. When he ran into financial difficulties, he robbed a bank and was sentenced to prison. He fled from custody after a Russia-backed separatist rebellion arose in 2014, then joined separatist rebels and fought on the front line before turning to blogging. Tatarsky was known for his blustery pronouncements and ardent pro-war rhetoric.","question":"What was Darya Trepova sentenced for in January 2024?","answer":"Darya Trepova was sentenced to 27 years in prison for carrying out a terrorist attack, illegal trafficking of explosive devices, and forging documents in the bombing that killed pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time information or events occurring after my last update in October 2023.

Many of the protesters were sitting in cars, while thousands stood outside despite freezing temperatures, chanting, \"Free Fail Alsynov,\" \"Fail, we are with you,\" and \"We are ordinary people and there will be more of us.\" The protesters read out a statement to President Vladimir Putin requesting he fire Bashkortostan's leader, Radiy Khabirov.

The trial is being held behind closed doors. The court announced that on January 17 it will pronounce its verdict and sentence of the ex-leader of the banned Bashqort group, which for years promoted the Bashkir language and culture. Last week, prosecutors asked the court to convict Alsynov and sentence him to four years in prison. The charge against Alsynov stems from a speech he gave at a rally in late April 2023 in the village of Ishmurzino, where he criticized the local government's plans to start goldmining near the village, as it would bring in migrant laborers. Investigators say Alsynov's speech \"negatively assessed people in the Caucasus and Central Asia, humiliating their human dignity.\" The investigation of Alsynov was initiated by Khabirov, who accused the activist of inciting ethnic hatred as well as \"calling for anti-government rallies and extremist activities\" and \"discrediting the Russian armed forces.\" In the end, Alsynov was charged only with inciting hatred. Bashkortostan's Supreme Court banned Alsynov's Bashqort group in May 2020, declaring it \"extremist.\" Bashqort was banned after staging several rallies and other events challenging the policies of both local and federal authorities, including Moscow's move to abolish mandatory indigenous-language classes in regions with large populations of indigenous ethnic groups.

KYIV -- Russia launched a major missile-and-drone assault on multiple locations around Ukraine flattening residential buildings in Kyiv, killing at least nine people, and wounding scores of others across the country. The April 24 overnight attack -- one of the largest in months -- came just hours after the White House presented Ukrainian officials with what amounted to an ultimatum about a US proposal to end the 38-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine. Western efforts to try and resolve the Ukraine war -- or even a temporary cease-fire -- have sputtered in recent days, as Russia shows no indication it will ease its assault, and Ukraine pushes back on US proposals. Foreign ministers and top diplomats were scheduled to meet in London on April 23 for talks on the war. But they were effectively downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out of the meetings at the last minute. That decision was reportedly prompted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejecting a US proposal that Washington might formally recognize Russian control over the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. That would be a major reversal of longstanding US policy. It is also seen as potentially political suicide for any Ukrainian officials. \u201cThere is nothing to talk about. This violated our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the London talks. Late April 23, US President Donald Trump lashed out directly at Zelenskyy, on social media and in remarks to reporters. He also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin was open to the US proposals. Trump's lead envoy for Russia, Steve Witkoff, is set to fly to Moscow on April 25 for expected meetings with Putin. \"I think Russia is ready and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \u201cI thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far it\u2019s harder.\u201d In a post to X, Zelenskyy responded to Trump, and included a copy of a 2018 US State Department statement that called on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea. Trump had vowed to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office. But the negotiations have proven difficult, as Russia targets both civilian and military sites across the country, while pressing its advantage on the battlefield. Ukraine's military said more than 210 missiles and drones were launched in the overnight assault, including ballistic missiles and cruise missiles launched by heavy bombers and Black Sea naval ships. More than 100 missiles were downed or intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, the military claimed . \"Kyiv and its region, Zhytomyr, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytsky, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhya regions were under a massive combined Russian attack,\" Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram . A number of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the capital Kyiv, and officials said at least nine people were killed and scores of people were wounded. Rescuers rushed to pull survivors from building debris, listening for cell phones ringing to try and locate people. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, was also hit by at least several missiles, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. It was no immediately clear if there were casualties. Ukraine's foreign minister, who traveled to London despite the downgraded meetings, lashed out at Putin, criticized the Trump administration. \u201cPutin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war,\" Andrii Sybiha said on X . \u201cRussia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace. Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied,\u201d he wrote. The downgrading of the London meetings highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talk amid Trump's complaints of a lack of progress in the negotiations. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you.\" Ukrainian and US officials were also set to sign a deal this week that would give US companies access to Ukraine's valuable mineral resources. That agreement has also been the subject of difficult negotiations, and resulted in an acrimonious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February. With reporting by Reuters and AFP Read more April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL's Belarus Service Lithuania Accuses Russia, Belarus Of Plotting Violent Attacks On Belarusian Exiles Members of the Belarusian diaspora celebrate the Day of Freedom in Vilnius, Lithuania, on March 25. Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD) says it has uncovered a covert operation by Russian and Belarusian intelligence services aimed at inciting violence against Belarusian exiles living in Lithuania. The plot, involving staged provocations and disinformation campaigns, was revealed in a statement released by the VSD and reported by the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT. According to Lithuanian authorities, foreign intelligence services have been orchestrating increasingly dangerous incidents targeting the Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania, which numbered more than 57,000 people as of early 2025. Authorities say foreign agents have attempted to simulate clashes between so-called \"Litvinist\" Belarusians -- followers of an ideology tying Belarusian identity to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania -- and fabricated Lithuanian nationalist groups. \"The organizers are trying to stage conflicts between opposing forces -- Belarusians who advocate for Litvinist ideas and so-called Lithuanian groups who appear to resist them,\u201d the VSD said. Recent Provocations Officials stressed that no real extremist Litvinist groups have been identified in Lithuania, and that they believe the narrative is being manipulated in Belarusian and Russian propaganda to stir mistrust and division. Recent provocations include fake video messages allegedly from Belarusian soldiers, anti-Belarusian graffiti, threats against Lithuanian lawmakers and Vilnius-based exiles, and social media campaigns spreading pseudohistorical claims about the region's past. The VSD warned residents not to fall for such provocations, noting that \"participation in these activities could lead to administrative or criminal liability.\" Meanwhile, there has been growing scrutiny of Belarusian nationals living in Lithuania. Many face increasingly strict visa checks, difficulties extending residence permits, and even deportation due to past affiliations with Belarusian state institutions or the military. Lithuanian media have labeled the disinformation campaign \u201cLitvinism.\u201d Authorities emphasize that the real danger lies not in the ideology itself, but in its exploitation to destabilize communities.

(file photo) A federal court judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to reverse its efforts aimed at forcing the closure of Voice of America (VOA), which was shut down last month in a move the broadcaster had called illegal. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled late on April 22 to grant a preliminary injunction that says officials must \"take all necessary steps\" to restore employees and contractors to their positions at VOA and to restore Congress-approved funding to two other U.S.-government funded broadcasters -- Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks -- and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts. Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees the federal broadcasters, also ordered the media outlets to provide monthly status reports showing the USAGM was complying with the order to allow the outlets to \"provide news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive.\" The USAGM has not responded publicly to the court decision. VOA last month filed a lawsuit saying the Trump administration has taken \u201ca chainsaw\u201d approach to the USAGM through an executive order that directed it and six other federal agencies to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\u201d The USAGM subsequently placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and terminated some 600 contractors, forcing VOA to stop its broadcasts for the first time since it was founded in 1942. The USAGM had argued in the case that no \"final decision\" on VOA's future had been made and that the lawsuits should be treated as \"employment disputes\" with those workers who had been terminated. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty has also filed a lawsuit against the USAGM \u201cto avoid irreparable harm\u201d to the broadcaster over the withholding of its Congress-approved grant as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to terminate RFE\/RL\u2019s funding. RFE\/RL's case continues to be pursued in court. Read more April 23, 2025 By Ray Furlong and Mike Eckel Officials Call Ukraine Peace Talks 'Substantive' Despite Last-Minute No-Shows (From left to right) British Defense Minister John Healey, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov after talks in London on April 23, 2025. Officials from Ukraine, the United States, and Europe said a meeting in London was \"substantive\" despite the last-minute postponement of a broader set of talks with foreign ministers. The April 23 talks, which were aimed at trying to resolve Russia's 38-month war on Ukraine, were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting and casting a major pall over ongoing peace efforts. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy also opted to skip the meetings, leaving a Ukrainian delegation that included Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top aide -- to meet with lower-level officials and US Ukraine envoy Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. In the end, the talks involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said. Zelenskyy said emotions had \"run high\" during the meeting but it was good that the representatives of five countries met to bring peace closer. \"The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . Speaking to reporters at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he thought the London talks went well. He also said he thinks he has a deal with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the war. But he also implied that a deal with Zelenskyy remained elusive, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been more difficult to deal with than Putin. Putin was quoted as saying he viewed the deal on the table positively and hoped that Ukraine feels the same way. Trump and Zelenskyy are both scheduled to attend the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on April 25. There has been no announcement of a meeting between the two. The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain at the London talks highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talks. It also came after Trump complained of a lack of progress in the negotiations, prompting him to threaten to make a deal soon or Washington will walk away from the table. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you, we have other things to do.\" Last week, Rubio and other Ukrainian and European officials met in Paris for talks that yielded what many saw was minor progress toward a resolution of the war. But Rubio later signaled US impatience with the status of the talks and suggested the United States might pull out entirely from all involvement in the negotiations. Trump again warned Ukraine that it needs to make a deal to end the fighting while sharply criticizing Zelenskyy for saying Kyiv sees any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia -- reportedly a condition the United States has put on the table in the talks -- is a red line for Ukraine. \"It\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\" Trump said in a social media post in which he denied anyone is asking Ukraine recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire -- He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\" Trump added. Zelenskyy in his post on X included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day during a trip to India, US Vice President JD Vance said Washington had issued a \u201cvery explicit proposal\u201d to Russia and Ukraine, though he gave no details. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance said. \u201cThe current lines, somewhere close to them is where you\u2019re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,\u201d he said. SEE ALSO: Trump Talk Of Imminent Deal Sharpens Focus On Ukraine Diplomacy Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and CNN reported that US negotiators had presented Ukraine with a list of possible concessions. Included among them was potential US recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, and a definitive rejection of Ukraine's aspiration to join NATO. The Kremlin on April 23 refused to comment on rumored proposals and said the downgrading of the London talks showed that the countries involved still needed to narrow their differences as there were \"a lot of nuances\" that still need resolving. Britain's Defense Secretary John Healy told lawmakers on April 22 there was no evidence that Russia had let up its attacks on Ukraine, chiding Putin as someone who says he wants peace but \"has rejected a full cease-fire...and continues to play for time in the negotiations.\" Healy and Lammy held talks with the Ukrainian delegation during the day on April 23, with Kellogg also in attendance. He called the talks \"substantial,\" while Lammy wrote in a social media post that \"we are working at pace with US, Ukraine, and European allies to end the war and secure a just and lasting peace.\" RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report Read more Updated April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Deadly Russian Drone Strike Hits Bus In Wave Of Attacks On Ukraine's Regions Ukrainian rescuers evacuate a wounded person from a bus damaged by a Russian drone strike in the town of Marhanets, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, on April 23. A Russian drone attack hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian town of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens of others, local authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, saying that Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacks on civilians are 'commonplace' in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions, as well as the frontline cities of Kupyansk and Pokrovsk. \"Russians struck a bus which was transporting workers of a mining and processing plant.

Speaking at a meeting of the State Military-Industrial Commission on April 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than 1.5 million drones of various types had been produced in Russia last year. Putin added that this amount included about 4,000 FPV drones. A wave of Russia's attacks also targeted civilian infrastructure across other Ukrainian regions. At least five people were reported injured in the Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Odesa. \"Residential buildings, business facilities, warehouses, and garages have been damaged,\" Ukraine's emergency service said . Large-scale fires had also broken out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said . The emergency service said the attack targeted 'solely the city's civilian infrastructure.' Meanwhile, in the Yelabuga district of Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, two fires broke out following a reported drone attack, local authorities confirmed on April 23. The Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over Tatarstan by air defense systems on duty. Officials have not released further details on the type of drone or its intended target. Rustem Nuriyev, head of the Yelabuga district administration, said in a statement that there were no casualties or injuries as a result of the incident. In response to the drone activity, temporary flight restrictions were imposed on Kazan and Nizhnekamsk airports. Kyiv has not commented on the incident. Also, a fire that had been burning at an ammunition depot on a military base -- where a large explosion occurred a day earlier -- in the Kirzhach district of Russia's Vladimir region, northeast of Moscow, has been \u201cgradually ending,\u201d regional Governor Aleksandr Avdeyev said. Four people were injured when ammunition exploded, prompting an evacuation order, Avdeyev said , adding that ammunition caught fire and shells exploded in the storage area. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that the fire had been caused by a breach of safety protocols and had resulted in the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse. \"As a result of a fire on the territory of a military unit in the Vladimir region, ammunition stored in a warehouse detonated,\" the Defense Ministry said. \"According to preliminary information...the cause of the fire was a violation of safety standards in work with explosive materials.\" A state of emergency was declared in the Kirzhach district, which is about 130 kilometers northeast of the Russian capital. The base was evacuated along with about 450 people from at least seven nearby settlements, the governor said. The ammunition depot is one of the largest of the Russian armed forces. It is more than 500 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. There had been no reports of drone attacks in the Vladimir region prior to the explosion. Yan Matveyev, a Russian military analyst, told Current Time that the ammunition stored at the depot could range from typical 155-millimeter artillery shells to Iskander-M missiles. \"This depot is close to the capital, close to Moscow, so it's easy to transport all this [ammunition] around the country,\" Matveyev said. Unverified video published earlier on Telegram channels showed a huge fire ball, a loud blast, and clouds of thick smoke rising into the sky. Baza, a Telegram channel close to security services, said 10 to 11 explosions had occurred and firefighters from neighboring regions had been called in to contain the blaze. It said a special commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire.

(file photo) Farmers in Uzbekistan say the government is forcing them to surrender land to Chinese businesses under the guise of state-backed development, taking thousands of hectares of fertile cotton and wheat fields out of the hands of locals. Concerned over the fate of the lush lands of the Ferghana Valley, they told Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty that large patches of land have been taken into the state reserve and transferred to Chinese businessmen. Official documents say the land transfers are voluntary. But dozens of accounts given to RFE\/RL from those who signed over their land appear to describe a different reality: coercion, threats, and intimidation by Uzbek law enforcement officers acting on orders from local officials. \"The governor told me: 'This is a presidential order. Either give up the land or go to jail,'\" said one farmer who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal for commenting publicly on the issue. Creeping Influence? Land transfers in the Ferghana Valley, which is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, are the latest flashpoint in what is becoming an increasingly visible and volatile undercurrent across Central Asia -- a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment driven by land disputes, debt dependency, labor market tensions, and fears of creeping influence.

Neither the local government nor the prosecutor can take it away. According to the legislation, the land can only be seized by the state by court decision. Farmers, though, say and seizures are being carried out based on a verbal order from Shuhrat Abdurahmonov, the head of the region. \"I did not want to give up my land and put up some resistance, but in response, the district governor called more than 20 police officers and the National Guard to the district administration building and ordered them to arrest me and my wife,\" a farmer from Qurgonteppa district told RFE\/RL. \"That is why none of the farmers resist now; otherwise, they could be imprisoned. It is unlikely that any of us would be able to get out of there alive and well.\" Regional administrations failed to comment on the claims by farmers when contacted by RFE\/RL. Concerns over China taking over the use of large swaths of land extend beyond the farming community. Beijing's economic presence in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. As of early 2025, China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion. Over 3,400 Chinese firms operate in the country, surpassing even the number of Russian entities. Similar patterns have emerged in other Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan.

But experts warn of a darker side. Uzbek political analyst Nargiza Muratalieva points out that Central Asian countries are increasingly falling into what she calls China's \"economic trap:\" easy access to credit -- often with opaque terms -- that can eventually leave weaker states vulnerable to political pressure or asset forfeiture. Muratalieva points out that Beijing gained over 1,100 square kilometers of land in Tajikistan in 2011 in exchange for debt relief, a clear example of the potential consequences of falling into this \"trap.\" China is already the largest lender in Uzbekistan, with outstanding loans totaling $3.8 billion. \"The general characteristics of Chinese lending for all countries in the region are the ease of obtaining debts, their difficult repayment, as well as the lack of transparency of procedures and specific conditions,\" according to Muratalieva.

The harsh treatment of Uyghurs and other non-Han indigenous ethnic groups in China's Xinjiang Province strikes a deep chord with Central Asians, who share linguistic, cultural, and religious ties with them. Whether it's propaganda or not, the fear that China could one day treat Kazakhs or Uzbeks the same way has further sown seeds of opposition to Beijing's expanding presence. \"It turns out that the Chinese really like my land; they want to take the land from other farmers too. Naturally, we are against it, but the district governor, the prosecutor, and the police chief continue to put pressure on us,\" one farmer from Uzbekistan's western Andijon region told RFE\/RL. \"What worries us most is that they can subsequently seize our country and do to us the same as they did to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\" SEE ALSO: Trump's Tariffs, Like Russian Sanctions, Benefit Chinese EVs In Central Asia Read more April 22, 2025 By Ray Furlong , RFE\/RL's Russian Service and Current Time Russia Issues Warrant For Film Critic Turned War Critic Yekaterina Barabash in court. In a baggy red blouse and matching glasses, Yekaterina Barabash was pictured apparently blowing kisses from behind a bulletproof glass screen when she stood in the dock at a Moscow court. A well-known film critic, she was sentenced to two months of house arrest for allegedly spreading \u201clies\u201d about the Russian military\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. Now, Russian authorities have issued a wanted note for her and she faces up to 10 years in prison after they found the 63-year-old wasn\u2019t home during a check on April 13. On April 21, the Russian prison agency issued a statement saying that she wasn\u2019t home when they called several days earlier. Subsequently, a Moscow court changed her sentence, meaning that she now faces prison. Friends of Barabash contacted by RFE\/RL declined to comment on her disappearance amid fears for her safety. Barabash has been an occasional guest on RFE\/RL\u2019s Russian Service programs for some years and has often criticized the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip on society. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, she immediately condemned it. Russian forces \u201chave bombed the country, levelled whole cities to the ground,\u201d she wrote a few weeks into the conflict. Words such as these were a direct challenge to the Kremlin\u2019s narrative, which banned the word \u201cwar\u201d and denied that civilians were being targeted in attacks despite evidence to the contrary. Shortly after the invasion began, Russia passed new legislation providing jail sentences for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the armed forces. It has been used to jail hundreds of people since the war began, and has led to many others keeping silent. Barabash in court. Moscow, February 26, 2025. In a recent case , a 19-year-old woman in St. Petersburg received a nearly three-year prison sentence for gluing a short verse to a statue of a Ukrainian poet. The same law eventually led to Barabash\u2019s arrest in February 2025. In court, prosecutors said she had distributed \u201cintentionally false information about the activities of the Russian military\u201d on social media. After receiving her sentence, she emerged from the court declaring \u201cat least I\u2019ll have two months of freedom,\u201d suggesting perhaps that she expected a jail sentence in the future. Describing the moment of her arrest, she said it was \u201csurprising.\u201d \u201cThe doorbell rings and [you expect] a kind person, you open the door and there are men in masks.\u201d Her case led to an outpouring of support from leading cultural figures.

Massive Russian aerial strikes hit residential buildings in several Ukrainian cities, leaving at least one dead and more than two dozen injured, including several children, in attacks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"deliberate terror.\" Two guided aerial bomb strikes hit the city of Zaporizhzhya on April 22, killing one woman and injuring 38 others -- four of whom were children and a pregnant woman, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone attacks were also seen in the city of Kharkiv, though casualty figures were unknown. The daytime strikes came after a drone attack overnight sparked massive fires in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, where a a housing block in a densely inhabited area was hit. The attack left one woman dead and at least three other residents injured. The attack came amid ongoing diplomatic activity to secure a cease-fire in the Ukraine war, following Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. \"All of this is absolutely deliberate Russian terror that can be stopped by a single order, an order in Russia and for the Russian Army,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \"Our proposal for a cease-fire regarding civilian buildings also remains in force. Russia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this.

Avdeyev did not provide details but said emergency services were on site. Telegram channels reported the blast happened in the village of Barsovo, near military unit 11785, also known as the 51st arsenal of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, which stores ammunition. Residents reported several explosions. A \"powerful attack\" was reported, prompting evacuations in Barsovo and nearby villages within a 5 km radius. Roads to Kirzhach from Moscow were blocked. Local authorities announced a state of emergency in the area. Russia also launched large-scale missile strikes on Easter Monday on April 21, following the expiry of a self-declared 30-hour Easter truce. Kyiv claimed Russian forces violated the truce 3,000 times. On April 22, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot dismissed the truce as a \u201cmarketing operation\u201d by Putin aimed primarily at US President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at continuing Russian attacks as he pushes diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said he spoke to Barrot the previous evening to coordinate positions ahead of a meeting in London on April 23. The London meeting was set to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, following a gathering in Paris on April 18 -- the first joint talks in this format since Trump took office. Barrot told FranceInfo that the European countries used that meeting to tell Washington what their red lines were for a deal. Trump has said he\u2019s hopeful an agreement can be wrapped up this week, which feels ambitious to many observers. But in another sign that diplomacy is picking up steam, Putin said on April 21 that he was ready for direct talks with Zelenskyy -- something that he had until recently refused.

Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin's proposal but said Ukraine \"was ready for any conversation\" about a cease-fire that would stop strikes on civilians. \"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure.\" SEE ALSO: Zelenskyy Demands Russia Return Ukrainian Children In New International Campaign Ukraine and Russia are facing pressure from the United States to make progress on negotiations to end the war.

Ukrainian authorities reported dozens of Russian missile and drone attacks on April 21, while a Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. Russian forces attacked Ukraine's northeastern region, killing one person in a border village, according to regional prosecutors. The report on Telegram said a Russian drone struck and killed a man on a scooter in the village of Ivashki. Russian forces also launched a late night drone attack on residential areas of Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, triggering fires and damaging many apartments, local officials said early on April 22. A day earlier US President Donald Trump voiced hope that an agreement would be reached between the two countries this week. Trump told reporters at the White House on April 21 that he plans to comment on the war in Ukraine and mediation efforts in the next three days. He made the comment in response to a question about whether the United States had proposed that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014 and then annexed it in violation of international law. \"So I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,\" Trump said. \"But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,\" he added without providing details. In his comments earlier on April 21, Putin said Russia was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv. \"We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude toward any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,\" Putin said on state TV. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when Putin said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, he meant bilateral negotiations. There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week.

Unlike some 20,000 other Ukrainian youths, Rudenko was rescued by the NGO Save Ukraine and returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after nine months in captivity. It's the fate of those thousands, many of whom remain in Russian-occupied areas -- in what Moscow calls \u201crehabilitation centers\u201d -- that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials say they are now focused on. \"This crime must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held accountable,\" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said over the weekend as part of the launch of the ChildrenAreNonNegotiable campaign. \"A just and lasting peace requires the return of all these Ukrainian children home.\" SEE ALSO: Amid Interrogations And Threats, Ukrainian Civilians Flee Russian Occupation US President Donald Trump has made ending Europe's longest conflict since World War II a top foreign policy priority since taking office three months ago.

Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of orchestrating what some groups have called a \"systematic deportation\" of children out of Ukraine and into Russia-controlled parts of the country, or even further to destinations in Russia and its ally, Belarus. Evidence gathered last year by RFE\/RL's Belarus Service and Schemes , the investigative unit of RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service, indicated camps were being used to teach young Ukrainians to identify with concepts that both Moscow and Minsk promote.

According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab more than 8,400 children from Ukraine have been systematically relocated to at least 57 facilities: 13 facilities in Belarus and 43 facilities in Russia and Russia-occupied territory. According to Ukraine\u2019s official government portal childrenofwar.gov.ua , a much higher number -- around 20,000 -- have been taken away and only 1,300 children have been successfully returned. \u201cWe remind the world that without the return of the children abducted by Russia, the war cannot truly be considered over,\u201d a statement published by Zelenskyy's office during Easter said. Washington has supported Kyiv on the issue of repatriating children, saying last month it remains committed to supporting the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. However, Ukrainian officials are worried recent budget cutting moves by the Trump administration could significantly hinder investigations into where the children have been moved and efforts to enable their return. Meanwhile, Karolina Hird, deputy team leader and an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, warned that Ukrainian teenagers forced to accept Russian citizenship may face conscription into the Russian army and could be forced to fight against their own people, a violation of international law. \u201cNegotiations and an end to the fighting without consideration for the deported children will empower Russia to continue to commit these crimes with absolute impunity,\u201d Hird wrote .

Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. A Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. On the diplomatic front, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week. But he welcomed a comment by US envoy Keith Kellogg saying Ukraine would not be able to join NATO. Further talks are expected in London this week between European, Ukrainian, and US officials following a gathering in Paris on April 18.

Despite his illness, his death came as a shock after he had been driven around St. Peter's Square to greet cheering crowds on Easter Sunday. \"Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vatican's TV channel on April 21. \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father,\" he said. Francis, who had also delivered a blessing at this year's Easter services a day before his death, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first pontiff born outside Europe in over a millennium. At the Vatican, locals, tourists, and pilgrims visiting for Easter expressed their shock and grief. \"This is something that really hits you hard,\" Rome resident Emanuela Tinari told Reuters. \"He was a pope who brought so many people closer to the church. He was not appreciated by everyone. But he definitely was by ordinary people.\" Embed share Around The World, People Mourn The Pope Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:02:20 0:00 Tributes have also been pouring in for the late pontiff from leaders around the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin published a statement saying Francis \"enjoyed great international authority as a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious statesman, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice.\" \"Throughout his pontificate, he actively contributed to the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive interaction between Russia and the Holy See,\" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also praised the pope's tenure, describing the pontiff as someone who \"knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\" \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,\" he added. \"We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!\" 'Painful And Shameful' -- Pope Francis On The Ukraine War Pope Francis, who died on April 21, Easter Monday, did not deliver his final annual Angelus address in person. But the text of his address said the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 was \u201ca painful and shameful occasion for all of humanity.\" He went on to voice \u201csolidarity with the martyred Ukrainian people.\" The Pontiff\u2019s death-bed statement was his last attempt to give the Vatican a voice in the conflict. While he was clearly sympathetic to the plight of Ukrainians, Pope Francis\u2019 previous interventions were not always welcomed by Kyiv. He raised particular ire in March 2024 by calling on Ukraine to find \"the courage of the white flag\u201d to enter peace talks with Russia. He later said that the \u201cfirst condition\u201d for peace was that Russia \u201cput an end to its aggression.\u201d But earlier, his avoidance of specific criticism of Russia was a cause of frustration. In June 2022, he condemned the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Russian forces while also suggesting the war was \u201cperhaps somehow provoked.\u201d This echoed a Kremlin argument, repeatedly made without evidence, that it was forced to attack. -- By Ray Furlong, senior international corresponden t \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Trump announced later on the same social media platform that he and first lady Melania Trump would attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome. Trump's predecessor also praised Frances on social media. \"He promoted equity and an end to poverty and suffering across the globe,\" said Joe Biden, himself a devout Roman Catholic. US Vice President JD Vance, who met with the pontiff on April 20, said his heart \"goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis,\" adding that \"he inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.\" Moldovan President Maia Sandu also expressed regret at the news of Francis's death, saying that he had \"tirelessly promoted compassion and social justice\" and \"led with love, stood by the vulnerable, and called for unity in times of division.\" Her comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the pope had been \"a man of humility, on the side of the most vulnerable and the most fragile.\" Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Francis would be remembered for his \"tireless commitment to the weakest in society.\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tweeted that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Francis's death. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to the news with a short a Facebook post that included a picture of him with the late pontiff. \"Thank you for everything, Holy Father,\" he said. \"We bid you farewell.\" An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman voiced sadness over Francis's death, saying that he offered \"condolences to all Christians around the world.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Francis was \"a spiritual leader who gave importance to dialogue between different faith groups and took the initiative in the face of humanitarian tragedies, especially the Palestinian issue and the genocide in Gaza.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev , Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani , Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze , and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajic also posted tributes to the pope. A Papacy Focused On Social Justice Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis worked as a chemical technician before entering the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a priest in 1969 and became the provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed archbishop of Buenos Aires. Three years later, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Elected Pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, reflecting his commitment to humility and the poor. Images From Francis's Years As Pope No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:01 0:00 His papacy was marked by a focus on mercy, social justice, and environmental stewardship. In 2015, Pope Francis issued the encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019,\u201d calling for global action on climate change and care for the environment. He also emphasized interfaith dialogue, notably signing the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Ahmed el-Tayeb, in 2019, a landmark agreement promoting peace and coexistence among different faiths. 'A Poor Church For The Poor' Pope Francis was known for his pastoral approach, advocating for a \u201cpoor Church for the poor\u201d and reaching out to marginalized communities. He made efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s financial systems and address alleged clerical sexual abuse within the church. In 2025, he published his autobiography, \u201cHope,\u201d offering insights into his life and papal mission. In his later years, Pope Francis faced several health challenges. In 2021, he underwent colon surgery to address diverticulitis, and in 2023, he had abdominal surgery to repair a hernia. He also experienced chronic knee and back pain, often using a wheelchair for mobility. Despite these issues, he maintained a rigorous schedule, continuing his pastoral duties and international travels. In early 2025, Pope Francis was hospitalized with a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, which developed into double pneumonia. His condition remained complex, requiring an extended hospital stay. He had been discharged from hospital on March 23.

In a Telegram post , Zelenskyy noted that Moscow had ignored both a proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire and a call to halt air strikes on civilian infrastructure, including missile and drone attacks. \u201cThe nature of Ukrainian actions will remain mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, and any Russian attacks will be met with our own.

They will show whether Russia is serious about peace or Putin's statements from yesterday were simply manipulations,\" Sybiha added. The US State Department earlier said it would welcome an extension to the Easter cease-fire that was set to expire a few hours later. \"We have seen President Putin's announcement of a temporary cease-fire due to Easter. We remain committed to achieving a full and comprehensive cease-fire,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to news media. \"As we assess their seriousness in this instance, we would welcome it extending beyond Sunday,\" the statement added.

Kyiv had no immediate comment on the claim about retaking the Kursk region village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine. If confirmed, however, it would move Russian troops closer to fully expelling Ukrainian troops from Kursk, which has been a persistent embarrassment for the Kremlin. With Orthodox and Western Easter falling on the same day -- April 20 -- this year, Putin used a televised meeting with his top military commander to announce he was calling a two-day truce. The cease-fire, Putin said, would begin at 5 p.m. CET on April 19 and run until midnight on Easter Sunday, April 20. \"We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example,\" he said while meeting General Valery Gerasimov. \"At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel any possible violations of the truce or provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions.\" Zelenskyy quickly labeled the call \"yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives.\" Attack \"drones in our skies reveal Putin's true attitude toward Easter and toward human life,\" Zelenskyy said in a post to X .

CNN \u2014 Jailed Russian opposition figure and outspoken Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny , who made global headlines when he was poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020, has died aged 47, the Russian prison service said. The cause of his reported death remained unclear, but the news drew a forceful reaction from Western leaders Friday, including US President Joe Biden, who pinned the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that \u201cwhat has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin\u2019s brutality.\u201d Navalny had returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival, Navalnvy was swiftly arrested on charges he dismissed as politically motivated. He has been incarcerated ever since, with longstanding concerns for his welfare\u00a0growing more intense\u00a0after he was transferred to a penal colony\u00a0north of the Arctic Circle. The Russian prison service on Friday said Navalny \u201cfelt unwell after a walk\u201d and \u201calmost immediately\u201d lost consciousness. It said it was investigating his \u201csudden death.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had been informed of the reports and that it is for doctors to determine the cause of Navalny\u2019s death. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, center, addresses supporters and journalists after arriving from Kirov at a railway station in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, July 20, 2013. Navalny returned to Moscow on Saturday after his surprise release from jail and vowed he will push forward in his campaign to become mayor of the Russian capital. Navalny was sentenced to five years in prison on an embezzlement conviction on Thursday in the city of Kirov, but prosecutors unexpectedly asked for his release the next morning. (AP Photo\/ Dmitry Lovetsky) Dmitry Lovetsky\/AP Related article Navalny is the latest in a long line of Putin critics who met an early death \u201cAs far as we\u2019re aware, in accordance with all the rules, the prison service is carrying out checks and clarifications,\u201d Peskov told reporters. Asked about reports that the death involved a blood clot, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Doctors must find it out.\u201d The announcement shocked his family and supporters as Navalny had appeared in court via video link as recently as Thursday, joking with the judge about how he was running short of money. Navalny\u2019s spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, initially said the Putin critic\u2019s lawyer was traveling to Kharp, where Navalny had been held since December. \u201cAs soon as we have any information, we will report it,\u201d Yarmysh wrote on X. She later said the reports of Navalny\u2019s death were \u201cmost likely true.\u201d Navalny\u2019s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, meanwhile, called for Putin to be brought to justice. \u201cI want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country, with my family, and with my husband,\u201d she said in emotional remarks that prompted a standing ovation at the Munich Security Conference (MSC), adding that she did not have confirmation of her husband\u2019s death. \u201cThey will be brought to justice and this day will come soon.\u201d An ambulance crew tried to resuscitate Navalny\u00a0for more than half an hour on Friday, Labytnang City Hospital told state-run media RIA Novosti. It added the ambulance team reached the prison in less than seven minutes, and doctors reached the patient two minutes later. \u201cThe doctors who arrived at the scene continued the resuscitation measures that the prison\u2019s doctors had already provided. They carried them out for more than half an hour. However, the patient died,\u201d the agency\u2019s interlocutor said, according to RIA. Lyudmila Navalnaya, Navalny\u2019s mother, told Russian independent news outlet Novaya Gazeta she had last seen her son on February 12 \u2013 four days before his death \u2013 when he had been \u201calive, healthy and cheerful.\u201d She said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any condolences.\u201d Dozens detained At least 100 people were detained across the country for attending vigils and rallies for Navalny on Friday, according to OVD-Info, a group that monitors Russian repression. In Moscow, a crowd of mourners lay flowers in the snow before a monument to victims of political repression in a growing tribute to the late opposition figure, according to video from the scene. Navalny was \u201ca symbol of opposition, a symbol of hope for some brighter future for Russia. And there\u2019s a feeling that with his death, this hope dies,\u201d Valeria, a 23-year-old tour guide, told Agence France-Presse in Moscow. \u201cIf there had been still been any hope left, it is even less now than it was before,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there had been still been any hope left, it is even less now than it was before,\u201d she said. The Moscow prosecutor\u2019s office had warned that protesting in the capital\u2019s city center was unauthorized, saying that participation in a \u201cmass event\u201d could lead to arrest. Navalny returned to Russia from Germany in 2021, after spending months recovering from a poisoning attack. Kirill Kudryavtsev\/AFP\/Getty Images \u2018I\u2019m not afraid\u2019 Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison in August, after he was found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes. He was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he denies. Four months later, his lawyers said they had lost contact with Navalny , who was believed to be imprisoned in a penal colony about 150 miles east of Moscow. He failed to appear at several scheduled court hearings in December. His legal team said on December 22 that he\u2019d been missing for 17 days. After filing 680 requests to locate Navalny, his team announced on December 25 that they had \u201cfound\u201d him more than a thousand miles away at the IK-3 penal colony in Kharp, known as \u201cPolar Wolf.\u201d US Vice President Kamala Harris addresses the audience during the Munich Security Conference at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich, Germany, on Friday, February 16, 2024. Matthias Schrader\/AP Related article Harris says reports of Navalny\u2019s death are another sign of Putin\u2019s brutality Navalny joins a long list of Russian dissidents who died after challenging Putin\u2019s legitimacy. Many questioned why he continued his campaign despite the clear risks to his safety. Navalany\u2019s reported death comes shortly before Russia\u2019s presidential election , set to take place on March 17, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power. Even from detention, Navalny had continued to agitate against Putin\u2019s government. In one of his final court appearances on February 8, Navalny urged prison service workers to \u201cvote against Putin.\u201d A fierce Putin critic Navalny posed one of the most serious threats to Putin during his rule, which has spanned more than two decades. He organized anti-government street protests and used his blog and social media to expose alleged corruption in the Kremlin and in Russian business. His struggle earned him global fame when he was poisoned with Novichok in 2020. Navalny was airlifted from the Siberian city of Omsk and arrived comatose at a hospital in Berlin. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny\u2019s poisoning. The investigation found that the FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Navalny for more than three years. Navalny later duped one of the spies, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, into revealing how he was poisoned . He posed as a senior official from Russia\u2019s National Security Council tasked with carrying out an analysis of the poisoning operation, and phoned Kudryavtsev, who provided a detailed account of how the nerve agents was applied to a pair of Navalny\u2019s underpants. Russia denied involvement in Nalvany\u2019s 2020 poisoning. Putin said at the time that if the Russian security service had wanted to kill Navalny, they \u201cwould have finished\u201d the job. Navalny, pictured here in Moscow, Russia in 2013, campaigned against alleged corruption in the Kremlin. Dmitry Lovetsky\/AP Western condemnation of the Kremlin was swift and fierce following news of Navalny\u2019s death. Biden laid the blame for Navalny\u2019s death at Putin\u2019s feet while speaking to reporters at the White House. \u201cMake no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny\u2019s death,\u201d Biden said Friday, adding that the Russian opposition figure was \u201cbrave,\u201d and \u201cwas dedicated to building a Russia where the rule of law existed.\u201d NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia has \u201cserious questions\u201d to answer. \u201cAlexey Navalny has been a strong voice for freedom, for democracy for many years and NATO allies have called for his immediate release for a long time,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters in Germany ahead of the MSC. Biden previously told reporters in 2021 that he warned Putin that the consequences would be \u201c devastating for Russia ,\u201d if Navalny died in prison during the US-Russia summit in Geneva, Switzerland. In his remarks Friday, Biden said the US was \u201ccontemplating what else can be done\u201d to punish Russia in the wake of Navalny\u2019s apparent death. Regarding his 2021 message to Putin, he told reporters, \u201cthat was three years ago. In the meantime they\u2019ve faced a hell of a lot of consequences.\u201d \u201cThis tragedy reminds us of the stakes of this moment,\u201d Biden added, urging Republicans to agree to a new round of funding for Ukraine in their war against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Putin must be held accountable for Navalny\u2019s death at a joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \u201cPutin does not care who dies as long as he stays in his position.\u201d Navalny was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison during various trials last year. Alexander Nemenov\/AFP\/Getty Images \u2018Freezing\u2019 conditions Navalny spent his last weeks in a Siberian prison north of the Arctic Circle, where he said he slept under a newspaper for warmth and had to eat his meals within 10 minutes. He told a Moscow court of \u201cfreezing\u201d conditions inside his prison, as he appeared via a video link in January to outline his case against the authorities at the penal colony where he had been held since December.

Pavel Golovkin\/AP Related article Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny had long been a thorn in Putin\u2019s side Yarmysh, Navalny\u2019s spokesperson, said the conditions at the Siberian prison were \u201cmuch worse\u201d than they had been near Moscow, where he had originally been kept. \u201cIt is in the north, so it is very cold there. Even today the light there is for two hours per day,\u201d she said in January. \u201cThey definitely tried to isolate Alexey and to make it more difficult to assess him there.\u201d On Valentine\u2019s Day, two days before Russian authorities said he died, Navalny posted a message on social media to Yulia. \u201cBaby, everything is like in a song with you: there are cities between us, the take-off lights of airfields, blue snowstorms and thousands of kilometers.

A Russian military transport plane caught fire and crashed in the Ivanovo region northeast of Moscow, Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday. Footage circulating on social media showed the IL-76 aircraft descending toward the ground with one of its engines on fire. Other footage showed a column of black smoke rising from the crash site. \"At about 1:00 p.m. Moscow time, an IL-76 military transport aircraft crashed during takeoff for a scheduled flight in the Ivanovo region,\" the Defense Ministry was quoted as saying by the state-run TASS news agency. Eight crew members and seven passengers were said to have been on board the aircraft. \"According to reports from the scene, the cause of the disaster was a fire in one of the engines during takeoff of the aircraft,\" the Defense Ministry added. It did not say if there were any casualties. TASS, citing an anonymous emergency service official, reported that all 15 people on board the plane were believed to have died. The crash comes weeks after an IL-76 plane that Moscow claimed had been carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war crashed in a Russian region bordering Ukraine. The Ivanovo region is located more than 700 kilometers from the Ukrainian border.

The crowds who thronged to honor Navalny outside a church and cemetery in a snowy southeastern suburb of the capital chanted slogans for him and against Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine, turning the event into one of the largest recent displays of dissent. But police did not act against them. At least 91 people were detained at events across Russia in Navalny\u2019s memory, said OVD-Info, a rights group that tracks political arrests, with most stopped while trying to lay flowers at monuments dedicated to victims of Soviet repression. When his death was announced Feb. 16, police detained hundreds who tried to leave flowers. Navalny was buried after a short Russian Orthodox ceremony, with vast crowds waiting outside the church and then streaming to the fresh grave with flowers. Navalny\u2019s widow, Yulia, who was not seen at the funeral but has vowed to continue his work, lovingly thanked him for \u201c26 years of absolute happiness.\u201d AP AUDIO: Putin foe Alexei Navalny is buried in Moscow as thousands attend under heavy police presence. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to live without you, but I will try to do it in a way that you up there are proud of me and happy for me,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. Navalny\u2019s 23-year-old daughter, Daria, also shared a tribute to her father. \u201cEver since I was a child, you taught me to live by certain principles. To live with dignity. You gave your life for me, for mum, for (my brother) Zakhar, for Russia,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cI promise you that I will live my life in the way that you taught me, in a way that will make you proud \u2014 and most importantly, with a smile on my face.\u201d The funeral followed a battle with authorities over the release of his body. His team said several Moscow churches refused to hold the funeral for the man who crusaded against official corruption and organized massive protests. Many Western leaders blamed the death on the Russian leader , an accusation the Kremlin angrily rejected. Navalny\u2019s team eventually got permission from the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, which was surrounded by crowd-control barriers. As his coffin was removed from the hearse and taken inside the church, the crowd waiting outside broke into respectful applause and then chanted: \u201cNavalny! Navalny!\u201d Some also shouted, \u201cYou weren\u2019t afraid, neither are we!\u201d and later \u201cNo to war!\u201d \u201cRussia without Putin!\u201d and \u201cRussia will be free!\u201d People watch as workers carry the coffin of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, in Moscow, Russia, Friday, March 1, 2024.

Also paying respects were Boris Nadezhdin and Yekaterina Duntsova , anti-war politicians who wanted to run against Putin in this month\u2019s presidential election but were not allowed on the ballot. Inside the church, Navalny\u2019s open casket showed him covered with red and white flowers. His parents, Lyudmila and Anatoly, sat beside it. Navalny\u2019s closest associates live outside Russia and offered commentary on a livestream of the funeral on his YouTube channel, their voices occasionally cracking with emotion.

A large crowd gathered at the cemetery\u2019s gates, chanting: \u201cLet us in to say goodbye!\u201d The coffin was lowered into the ground. In keeping with his irreverent sense of humor, music from the \u201cThe Terminator 2\" was played, a movie his allies said he considered \u201cthe best in the world.\u201d Mourners streamed by his open grave, tossing handfuls of soil onto the coffin as a large crowd waited at the cemetery\u2019s entrance. As dusk fell, workers shoveled dirt into the grave while Lyudmila Navalnaya watched. A mound of flowers, funeral wreaths, candles and a portrait of Navalny sat nearby. Mourners continued to stream into the cemetery until it was closed by police shortly after 10 p.m. local time. Lyudmila Navalnaya had spent eight days trying to get authorities to release her son\u2019s body following his Feb. 16 death at Penal Colony No. 3 in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow. Even on Friday, a Moscow morgue delayed releasing the body, according to Ivan Zhdanov, Navalny\u2019s close ally and director of his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Authorities near the penal colony originally said they couldn\u2019t release the body because they needed to conduct post-mortem tests. Lyudmila Navalnaya made a video appeal to Putin to release it so she could bury her son with dignity.

(AP Photo) Russian authorities still haven\u2019t announced the cause of death for Navalny, who was 47. His team cited paperwork that Lyudmila Navalnaya saw that listed \u201cnatural causes,\u201d although the day before his death he had appeared in court via video link joking with officials. At least one funeral director said he had been \u201cforbidden\u201d to work with Navalny\u2019s supporters, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on social media. They also struggled to find a hearse. \u201cUnknown people are calling up people and threatening them not to take Alexei\u2019s body anywhere,\u201d Yarmysh said Thursday. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021 , when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his regional offices were designated as \u201cextremist organizations\u201d by the Russian government that same year.

Moscow authorities refused permission for a separate memorial event Friday for Navalny and slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, citing COVID-19 restrictions, according to former presidential hopeful Duntsova. Nemtsov, a 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, was shot to death as he walked on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin on the night of Feb. 27, 2015. Yarmysh also urged Navalny\u2019s supporters around the world to turn out.

Six alleged members of the Islamic State group were killed in a shootout in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, in what was described by security forces as a \u201ccounterterrorism operation.\" According to the Russian National Anti-Terrorism Committee (NAC), on Saturday,\u00a0six men barricaded themselves in a third-floor apartment in Karabulak, a town of about 30,000 in Russia\u2019s semi-autonomous Republic of Ingushetia. A shootout with security services followed, as surrounding streets were blocked off and residents of the apartment block evacuated to a nearby school, the Russian Interfax news agency reported. Heavy gunfire and blasts appearing to come from inside an apartment block could be heard in videos posted by Karabulak residents on social media. The NAC did not immediately name the alleged Islamic State militants, but said three were on Russia\u2019s wanted list. All six had been involved in violent acts, including an attack on a traffic police unit last March that killed three officers, it added. The local branch of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB), the country\u2019s main security agency, announced at 7:30 pm local time on Saturday emergency measures were being introduced due to an ongoing \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d operation. The restrictions were lifted shortly after midday on Sunday. The NAC claimed security services found automatic weapons, ammunition, hand grenades and homemade explosives inside the apartment where the men were hiding out. The agency said that no local residents were hurt. However, Baza - a Russian Telegram channel set up by journalists critical of the Kremlin - reported a man walking by was killed in the shootout. Euronews could not verify either side's claim. Islamic rebels have fought two full-scale wars with Russian troops in Chechnya , a region neighbouring Ingushetia, over the past 20 years. Although the insurgency has been largely suppressed, sporadic attacks persist. Ingushetia also suffers frequent violence attributed to insurgents, and both regions have seen unrest following Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine and a deeply unpopular mobilisation order in September 2022.

The Russian government claims to have repelled the attacks.","text":"Ukraine-based Russian armed groups claim raids into Russia 12 March 2024 Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save Telegram\/Freedom of Russia Legion The Freedom of Russia Legion said Russia must be \"freed from Putin's dictatorship\" Three Ukraine-based Russian paramilitary groups say they have crossed into Russia and are now fighting government troops there. The Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) and Siberian Battalion (SB) posted videos purportedly showing their fighters in Russia's Belgorod and Kursk regions. The FRL and an exiled Russian politician claimed two villages were now in control of \"liberation forces\". Russia's defence ministry said the breakthrough attempts were thwarted. It claimed more than 234 Ukrainian troops had been killed and several tanks had been destroyed. According to Belgorod's regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, one member of Russia's territorial defence forces was killed and 10 civilians were injured. These numbers have not yet been verified by the BBC. Ukraine's military denied any involvement in Tuesday's cross-border raids. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the country's military intelligence, said the paramilitary groups were \"independent organisations\" of Russian nationals, and therefore operating \"at home\". In a separate development, Russia said Ukraine had launched 25 drones on targets across Russia, but the attack was thwarted. However, videos have emerged which appear to show several Russian oil facilities on fire. In the Ivanovo region, just east of Moscow, an Il-76 military transport plane with eight crew and seven passengers crashed shortly after take-off, Russia's defence ministry was quoted as saying by Russian state-run news agencies. The ministry said an engine fire caused the crash. It gave no details of survivors. Videos have emerged purportedly showing the plane on fire circling in the sky, and later plumes of black smoke from the crash site. Elsewhere, at least three people were killed and 38 injured on Tuesday night when a Russian missile struck two apartment buildings in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the minister of internal affairs. Ihor Klymenko said children were among the victims and that the number of deaths may go up as the search and rescue operation is continuing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country would \"inflict losses on the Russian state in response - quite rightly\". The Ukrainian sea drones hunting Russian warships Is Europe doing enough to help Ukraine? Ukraine war in maps: Russia makes limited advances A full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin is now in its third year, with no signs that the biggest war in Europe since World War Two could end soon. On Tuesday, the FRL posted what it said was a video from the Russian-Ukrainian border. \"Like all our fellow citizens, in the Legion we dream of a Russia freed from Putin's dictatorship. But we don't just dream: we make every effort to make these dreams come true. We will take our land away from the regime, centimetre by centimetre,\" an armed FRL soldier in the footage is heard saying. Meanwhile, the SB said \"fierce fighting is going on the Russian Federation territory\", publishing a clip purportedly showing its fighters engaging with Russian government forces. It also condemned Russian presidential elections on 15-17 March, in which Mr Putin is widely expected to be declared the winner. \"Ballots and polling stations in this case are fiction. You can really change your life for the better only with weapons in your hands,\" the SB said. Another Ukraine-based Russian group, the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK), also published footage of what it said were its fighters engaging with Russian government troops. \"The army of the Kremlin regime lays down its weapons without even starting the battle,\" it said. The videos have not been independently verified. The border village of Tetkino in the Kursk region appeared to be one of the targets in Tuesday's raids, with the FRL claiming that \"liberating forces\" now had full control over the settlement. The BBC has verified the authenticity of FRL footage depicting a strike on an armoured personnel carrier in Tetkino. Kursk Mayor Igor Kutsak ordered all schools in the regional capital to be put on remote learning from 13 to 15 March \"in connection with recent events\". He also warned that the \"missile alert\" regime was still in place in the city, which has a population of more than 400,000. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine-based Russian opposition politician Illya Ponomarev claimed that the border village of Lozovaya Rudka, Belgorod region, was \"under full control of liberating forces\". Who are the fighters infiltrating Russia from Ukraine? In a statement later on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry said its forces together with border guards and FSB security service units \"thwarted an attempt by the Kyiv regime to make a breakthrough\" into Russia. It said enemy fighters - backed by tanks and armoured personnel carriers - had tried to invade Russia \"simultaneously in three directions in the areas of the settlements of Odnorobovka, Nekhoteevka and Spodaryushino, Belgorod region\". It added that another four attacks had targeted Tetkino, but were \"repulsed\". The Ukraine-based Russian armed groups have made several cross-border raids since the full-invasion of Ukraine began. Last May, Russia's military said a similar attack in the Belgorod region was rebuffed and armed insurgents defeated.

But when election officials said results gave him more than 87% of the vote, he said Russia's democracy was more transparent than many in the West. In truth no credible opposition candidate was allowed to stand. Supporters of dead Putin critic Alexei Navalny did stage symbolic protests. Their \"Noon against Putin\" initiative meant that long queues of voters formed at midday in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg and in even greater numbers outside many embassies abroad, but it was never going to have any impact on the result. Monitoring group OVD-Info said at least 80 Russians were arrested. There was no repeat of the sporadic attacks on some polling stations that happened on Friday. LIVE: West condemns Russia's 'pseudo-election' Predicting Putin's landslide was easy, but what comes next? Western countries lined up to condemn the vote as neither free nor fair. Germany called it a \"pseudo-election\" under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship, repression and violence. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron condemned \"the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory\". Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said \"the Russian dictator is simulating another election\". In the words of Navalny ally Leonid Volkov, savagely beaten with a meat hammer in exile in Lithuania last week: \"The percentages drawn for Putin have, of course, not the slightest relation to reality.\" Ukrainecast on BBC Sounds: Putin claims victory - what next for Russia? Russians had three days to vote and people in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine had even longer, in an attempt to persuade residents to take part. One election commission official was reported killed in the occupied town of Berdyansk on Sunday and residents spoke of pro-Russian collaborators going from home to home with ballot boxes accompanied by armed soldiers. Anadolu\/Getty Images Officials said turnout was greater than 74% in the election But on Russia's carefully controlled state TV channels the result was hailed as a triumph. \"This is an incredible level of support and unity around the figure of Vladimir Putin,\" said one correspondent excitedly, \"and a signal to Western countries\". President Putin was more subdued as he took questions from reporters, but he did hail Russia's presidential campaign as far more advanced than the US, citing Russia's use of online voting, which officials said brought in eight million voters. Mr Putin had earlier been filmed performing a single keystroke to exercise his democratic right. \"It's transparent and absolutely objective,\" he suggested, \"not like in the US with mail-in voting... you can buy a vote for $10\". The Russian leader made the same false claim about US elections earlier this year but never offered any evidence. Meanwhile, independent Russian watchdog Golos, which has been branded a foreign agent, said that Russia had never before \"seen a presidential campaign that fell so far short of constitutional standards\". Why Putin's fifth term as Russian leader was never in doubt Rosenberg: Russia's stage-managed election Putin: From Russia's KGB to a presidency defined by war Vladimir Putin is now set to stay in power until at least 2030, and has ruled Russia since 2000 - the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Golos was barred from observing the vote but reports of irregularities have emerged, as well as pressure on public sector employees to vote either in polling stations or online. Voters were not able \"to form and express their free will, or to establish the true outcome of the vote\", it said. President Putin praised opposition campaigners for encouraging voters to turn out in greater numbers, although he condemned those who spoilt their ballots and said action would be taken against them. For the first time he referred to Alexei Navalny by name, a month after his most vocal critic died in a penal colony inside the Arctic Circle. In a remark possibly aimed at rebutting widespread allegations that he had Navalny killed, Mr Putin confirmed reports that he had explored exchanging him for prisoners held in the West, but on the condition that his rival never returned. \"I said I'm for it but, unfortunately, what happened happened. What can you do? That's life.\" Yulia Navalnaya described queuing for six hours outside the Russian embassy in Berlin as part of the protest vote campaign. She said she had written her late husband's name on her ballot paper, and praised everyone who turned up, for giving her \"hope that everything is not in vain\". Sean Gallup\/Getty Images Yulia Navalnaya had backed calls for anti-Putin voters to turn up at polling stations at midday One protest voter in London said she had queued for more than seven hours before casting her ballot. Activist and lawyer Lyubov Sobol said in Washington DC that the protest votes would not be reflected in the Kremlin's results, \"but this solidarity, this symbol, is nonetheless important\". Russia's presidential election was never going to be a level playing field. The Kremlin tightly controls the political system, the media and elections. Communist Party candidate Nikolai Kharitonov managed little more than 4% of the vote and his fellow candidates even less. None of the three were serious candidates and Mr Kharitonov even praised the president ahead of the election for \"trying to consolidate the nation for victory in all areas\". Millions of Russians will have voted for a fifth Putin presidential term partly because they see no credible alternative. But that is purely because the Kremlin has removed any possible challenger from the political landscape. Opponents have either been jailed, or they have fled into exile, or they have lost their lives. For a few short weeks there was a suggestion that an anti-war politician called Boris Nadezhdin might be allowed to stand. But last month he was ruled out by the election commission as increasing numbers of Russians warmed to his message and queued to register their support.

It was travelling between the UK and Poland when its satellite signal was temporarily interfered with on both legs of the journey. It happened near Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic, on Wednesday. A security source told the BBC it is not unusual for interference to occur in airspace near the region. They said the jamming of the GPS signal - which is used to determine location - did not endanger the safety of the aircraft. Mobile phones were unable to connect to the internet during the interference, the Times reported. Journalists accompanying Mr Shapps on his visit to Poland - where he discussed support for Ukraine with his Polish counterpart - were on board at the time. A Western official told the BBC that Kaliningrad \"has got significant sort of electronic warfare capabilities\" and it \"wouldn't be surprising, alas, if an aircraft fell foul of that in some way\". A Downing Street spokesperson confirmed the plane \"experienced GPS jamming when they flew close to Kaliningrad\". They added: \"It didn't threaten the safety of the aircraft and it is not unusual for aircraft to experience GPS jamming near Kaliningrad, which is of course Russian territory.\" According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, Russia's use of GPS interference across Poland and the Baltic has proliferated in recent months. The aim may be to disrupt Nato military exercises but it is also interfering with commercial shipping and aircraft.

They are brought to Basmanny District court in Moscow, where they are ordered to be held in pre-trial detention until at least 22 May.","text":"Russian court charges four men with act of terrorism in Moscow attack 25 March 2024 Share Save Graeme Baker & Robert Greenall BBC News Share Save Watch: Russia attack suspects dragged into courtroom Russia has charged four men it says attacked a Moscow concert hall and killed at least 137 people. All four appeared to have been beaten and one was brought to court in a wheelchair. They were charged with committing an act of terrorism. The Islamic State group, or IS, said it carried out Friday's outrage at Crocus City Hall and posted video evidence. Russian officials have claimed, without evidence, Ukrainian involvement. Kyiv says the claim is \"absurd\". On Monday - three days after the attack - Russian President Vladimir Putin told senior officials \"we know that the crime was committed by the hands of radical Islamists, followers of an ideology that the Islamic world itself has been fighting against for centuries\". But he also insisted that the attackers were linked to the Ukrainian government. He had said so in his first reaction, on Saturday, claiming Kyiv had \"prepared a window\" to allow them to cross the border and escape into its territory. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky angrily dismissed that claim, saying it was \"absolutely predictable\" that Vladimir Putin would blame it on Ukraine \"instead of dealing with his Russian citizens, addressing them\". On Monday Mr Putin claimed Kyiv - what he called \"the neo-Nazi regime\" - was behind the attack because it wanted to \"sow panic in our society and at the same time show their own population that all is not lost for the Kiev [Kyiv] regime\". Graphic video released by IS, showing attackers firing on the crowd inside the concert hall, has been verified as genuine by the BBC. On Friday night, four gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk, a northern Moscow suburb, and began firing on some of the estimated 6,000 people who were attending a rock concert. The attackers also set fires which engulfed the venue and caused the roof to collapse. Russian authorities said 137 people were killed and more than 100 injured, with 60 still in a serious condition. Rescuers are continuing to search the rubble of the concert hall for victims, and regional officials said the operation would carry on through Tuesday afternoon. The men who appeared in court on Sunday were arrested in the Bryansk region around 14 hours after the attack, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said. Bryansk is around 400km (250 miles) south-west of Moscow. Reuters The men identified as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev (left) and Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda The four suspects were named by Russian authorities as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov. Video showed three of them being marched bent double by masked police into Basmanny district court in the Russian capital. Videos of brutal interrogation sessions were apparently leaked by Russian security forces, and reports suggest at least one had suffered electric shocks. Asked about the alleged torture, Mr Peskov refused to comment. The men the court identified as Mirzoyev and Rachabalizoda had black eyes and the latter's ear was heavily bandaged - reportedly from it being partially severed during his arrest. Mirzoyev also appeared to have a torn plastic bag wrapped around his neck. The face of the man identified as Fariduni was badly swollen, while the man named as Fayzov appeared to lose consciousness as he was brought into court in a wheelchair wearing a thin hospital gown. He appeared to have an eye missing, according to the Reuters news agency. All were held in a glass-panelled booth and guarded by masked police during their time in court. A court statement on the Telegram messaging service said Mirzoyev had \"admitted his guilt in full\", while Rachabalizoda also \"admitted guilt\". The court also said the four will be held in pre-trial detention until at least 22 May, The men were identified as citizens of Tajikistan, Russia's state news agency Tass said. Ten other people have been arrested in Russia suspected of aiding the attack, including three on Monday afternoon. Reuters The men identified as Shamsidin Fariduni (left) and Muhammadsobir Fayzov Russia in IS crosshairs The US warned Moscow earlier this month of a possible attack in Russia aimed at large gatherings before issuing a public advisory to citizens in the country. The alert was roundly dismissed by the Kremlin as propaganda and an attempt to meddle in its presidential election. Washington said after the attack that it had no reason to doubt the IS claim. It would not be the first time IS and its allies have attacked Russia or its interests abroad. The group claimed the bombing of a Russian aircraft over Egypt in 2015 with 224 people on board, most of them Russian citizens. It also claimed a 2017 bomb attack on the St Petersburg metro, which killed 15 people. Security analysts say the group considers Russia a primary target for a number of reasons, including the country's role in destroying IS's powerbase in Syria while securing President Bashar al-Assad's rule, Moscow's two brutal wars in Muslim-majority Chechnya in 1994-2009 and the Soviet-era invasion of Afghanistan. The US and other Western intelligence agencies have said the attack was probably carried out by the Khorasan branch of IS, known as Isis-K, which chiefly operates in Afghanistan and parts of Central Asia. It is among the most able and active of the IS offshoots, and was responsible for deadly suicide attacks at Kabul airport during the chaotic American withdrawal of August and September 2021. Isis-K frequently criticises President Vladimir Putin in its propaganda.

De Russen hadden het woord oorlog eerder nog in de ban gedaan en president Poetin sprak altijd van een 'speciale militaire operatie'. Maar de woordvoerder van Poetin, Dmitri Peskov, noemde vandaag in het populaire pro-Kremlinweekblad Argumenty i Fakty nu wel het woord oorlog. \"Ja, we zijn in oorlog\", zei hij. Volgens hem is de speciale militaire operatie een oorlog geworden door de massale steun van het Westen voor Oekra\u00efne. Volgens Peskov moet \"iedereen dit begrijpen\" voor de \"interne motivatie\". Later herhaalde hij de term nog eens tegen andere journalisten. Peskov maakte zijn opmerkingen vijf dagen na de herverkiezing van president Poetin. Van vrije verkiezingen was geen sprake, en de uitkomst stond al vast. Politieke tegenstanders waren verdwenen, uitgesloten van deelname of overleden. Peskov geeft \"het collectieve Westen\" de schuld van de oorlog: 0:27 Rusland noemt 'speciale militaire operatie' in Oekra\u00efne voor het eerst 'oorlog' Lange tijd was 'oorlog' een verboden term, op straffe van vervolging. President Poetin beweerde in het verleden dat het Westen \"een hybride oorlog\" tegen Moskou is gestart, maar hij noemde de Russische invasie in Oekra\u00efne steevast een speciale militaire operatie. Peskov zei ook dat zijn gebruik van het woord \"oorlog\" een andere context had dan het gebruik ervan door mensen die ervoor vervolgd zijn. Wat die andere context is, zei hij niet. Rusland heeft zeer strikte militaire censuur ingesteld in de dagen na de start van de invasie. Voor critici dreigen jarenlange celstraffen als blijkt dat zij \"valse informatie hebben verspreid\" of de strijdkrachten \"in diskrediet\" hebben gebracht. Volgens mensenrechtenorganisatie OVD-Info zijn er de afgelopen twee jaar meer dan 900 zaken geopend tegen mensen die zich hebben verzet tegen de oorlog. Rusland-correspondent Geert Groot Koerkamp: \"Dmitri Peskov is lang niet de eerste die in Rusland ongestraft de term 'oorlog' bezigt, in plaats van een 'speciale militaire operatie'. Eerder hebben we dat gehoord van Russische parlementsleden en van diverse deelnemers aan talkshows op televisie. Dat had voor de betrokkenen geen gevolgen, terwijl veel mensen die kritiek hebben geuit op het Russische optreden in Oekra\u00efne en daarbij het woord 'oorlog' gebruikten, wel specifiek daarvoor zijn vervolgd. President Poetin heeft zelf meermalen gezegd dat het Westen in Oekra\u00efne een oorlog is begonnen \"die Rusland nu be\u00ebindigt\". Peskov heeft zijn opmerkelijke uitspraak inmiddels met soortgelijke woorden verdedigd, door te zeggen dat er 'de facto' sprake is van een oorlog, maar 'de jure' van een 'speciale militaire operatie'.\" Grote aanval Rusland op energiesector Oekra\u00efne, ruim miljoen mensen zonder stroom EU wil wapens en munitie voor Oekra\u00efne met Russische rente financieren Poetin staat stil bij annexatie van de Krim, en feliciteert zichzelf Buitenland Deel artikel: X E-mail Facebook WhatsApp Link gekopieerd!

Ramaphosa held a phone call with Vladimir Putin on Monday, stating that the two leaders had affirmed \"strong bilateral relations\" and a commitment to work together toward a peaceful end to the war. 07:36:12 'Mobile phones heard ringing under ruins' in Kyiv A \"major rescue operation\" is underway in Kyiv following Russia's overnight drone and missile attack. \"Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins,\" Ukraine's interior minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram. \"The search will continue until everybody is got out.\" Klymenko said engineering forces, climbers and search dogs were all being used to help emergency services in the rescue operation. More than 70 people suffered injuries from the attack, with nine people so far confirmed to have died. 07:21:03 'Massive combined strike' shows 'Russian peace in all its glory' As well as hitting Kyiv with overnight attacks, Russian missile and drone strikes were also reported in various other regions of Ukraine. The country's interior minister said Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were all hit in the \"massive combined strike,\" but Kyiv was hit hardest. The capital's military chief, Tymur Tkachenko, described the attack as \"Russian peace in all its glory.\" In response to the attack, Poland's air force scrambled allied fighter jets to protect the country's own airspace from missiles that may stray into Polish territory. 06:56:40 Trump says peace deal is 'very close' - but Zelenskyy is 'prolonging' war Before Russia launched its overnight attacks, Donald Trump had suggested a peace deal in Ukraine was \"very close\". JD Vance had earlier laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would freeze the frontlines \"close to where they are today\", adding that Ukraine and Russia would both have to \"give up some of the territory they currently own\". The deal is also slated to include US recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, the Ukrainian region Moscow illegally annexed in 2014. That point appears to be a sticking point for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly said that Ukraine would not accept giving up Crimea as part of peace negotiations. That's irked Trump, who suggested in the Oval Office last night he found it easier to deal with Russia than he did Zelebskyy. \"I think Russia is ready and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \"I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it's been harder. But, I think we have a deal with both.\" In an earlier post on Truth Social yesterday, Trump said Zelenskyy's stance over Crimea will \"do nothing but prolong the 'killing field', and nobody wants that\". Watch: Is Trump really 'close' to securing a deal for Ukraine? 06:38:50 Ukraine: 'Putin only shows desire to kill' We're starting to get some political reaction to Russia's overnight missile and drone attacks on Kyiv. Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff, says the attacks prove that Vladimir Putin is not interested in peace. \"Russia is attacking Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities with missiles and drones right now,\" Yermak said on X. \"Putin only demonstrates a desire to kill.  The fire must cease. The attacks on civilians must stop.\" 06:30:19 In pictures: Explosions in sky as Putin's missiles hit Kyiv We can now bring you a series of images showing how Russia's overnight missile and drone attack on Kyiv unfolded. Explosions were initially heard in the capital at around 1am local time (10pm UK time), with further explosions coming around three hours later. Authorities said nine people were killed, while Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko added that six children, as well as a pregnant woman, were among the injured. 06:15:20 Nine dead after Russian missiles hit Kyiv, authorities say A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack hit Kyiv overnight, killing nine people and injuring another 63, Ukrainian authorities said. Kyiv's military administration said on its Telegram channel this morning that Russia struck the capital with drones and ballistic missiles. Fires were reported in several residential buildings, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the administration. 06:15:06 Welcome back to our live coverage Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. The authorities in Kyiv have reported a large-scale Russian attack on the capital overnight that killed nine people - we'll bring you more on that in a moment. The deadly attack comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war ramped up yesterday as a US-backed, seven-point peace plan emerged while Western officials met for talks in London. Donald Trump said those talks \"went well\" and that he \"thinks we have a deal\" with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin - but he also hit out at the Ukrainian president and accused him of preventing peace. Before we resume our updates, here's a look at how the last 24 hours unfolded: Foreign ministers from the UK, US, France, Germany and Ukraine scrapped a plan to meet in London for high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine; David Lammy, the UK's foreign secretary, and John Healey, defence secretary, still met their Ukrainian counterparts, but somewhat sidelined Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg led the US delegation; It was held after reports revealed Trump's seven-point peace plan, which most notably mentioned that the US would formally recognise Russian sovereignty over annexed Crimea; But Trump once again ramped the pressure up on Zelenskyy to agree to a peace deal, saying his opposing stance on Crimea \"will do nothing but prolong the killing field\"; Those comments came after JD Vance said an \"explicit\" proposal had been given to Russia and Ukraine, reiterating \"it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process\". 23:00:01 We're pausing our coverage Thanks for following our coverage throughout the day. We're pausing our live updates for now, but we'll be back with more tomorrow. Before we go, here's a summary of the day's key developments: Downgraded talks in London Foreign ministers from the UK, US, France, Germany and Ukraine scrapped plans to meet in London for high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Ukraine's delegation consisting of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak, defence minister Rustem Umerov and foreign minister Andrii Sybiha held talks with the UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey. That's something that was hailed as \"significant progress\" by the British Foreign Office. But the US delegation was almost completely changed after Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio - Donald Trump's top negotiators - pulled out, while the somewhat sidelined Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg took over as leader of the delegation. French and German foreign ministers also pulled out, and were instead represented by advisers. Trump's seven-point peace plan The London meeting was held on the backdrop of Trump's reported seven-point peace plan. Most notably, the plan mentions that the US would formally recognise Russian sovereignty over annexed Crimea. Russia took over Crimea in 2014 but Ukraine has always maintained it is part of its territory, with most of the international community refusing to recognise Russia's illegal seizure of the area. But Trump once again ramped the pressure up on Zelenskyy to agree to a peace deal, saying his stance on Crimea \"will do nothing but prolong the killing field\". It came after US vice president JD Vance said an \"explicit\" proposal had been given to Russia and Ukraine, reiterating \"it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process\".

Over the succeeding days, floods also caused by the spring thaw occur in Tyumen, Tomsk and Kurgan Oblasts.","text":"Cities in Russian Urals, West Siberia Brace for Worst Floods in Decades By AFP April 8, 2024 A school in a flooded street of Orsk. Yegor Aleyev \/ TASS The Russian city of Orenburg, near the Kazakh border, braced on Monday for flooding\u00a0not seen in decades, as officials evacuated locals to escape rising rivers in the Urals and western Siberia. Moscow declared a federal emergency on Sunday over floods in the Orenburg region, where the Ural River left much of the city of Orsk covered in water, forcing thousands to leave their homes. The river is now reaching dangerous levels in the regional capital of Orenburg, a city of 550,000 people. The Kremlin has also warned of \"inevitable\" floods in western Siberia's Kurgan and Tyumen regions. Thousands of people have already been evacuated from flooded areas. The Kremlin said on Monday that over 10,000 residential buildings had been flooded, mostly in the Urals, Volga area and western Siberia. Emergency services warned of a \"rise in air temperature, active snow melting and the overflow of rivers.\" Much of the city of Orsk was underwater after torrential rain caused a nearby dam to burst. Orenburg region authorities said that while the Ural River \"went down by nine centimeters (3.5 inches)\" in Orsk, water levels in the city of Orenburg were rising fast. \"In Orenburg, in a day there was a rise by 16 centimeters to 872 centimeters,\" in the water level, the regional government said. Its Mayor Sergei Salmin told Russian television that the city \"has not seen so much water\" in decades. \"The highest [water] mark was in 1942. That was 946 centimeters,\" Salmin said. \"Since then there have been no floods. This is unprecedented.\" The Kremlin has said President Vladimir Putin is being briefed on areas affected by \"nature anomalies\" in real-time. On Monday, it said Putin ordered a government commission to be established on the floods. 'No time for convincing' Orenburg Mayor Salmin said authorities had evacuated 736 people in the city, as they expect the water to rise further. Over the weekend he warned of forced evacuations if people did not cooperate, saying: \"There is no time for convincing.\" Russia's weather monitor Rosgidromet said it did not expect the flood in Orenburg to peak until Wednesday and warned that many districts of the city would be affected. The Ural River flows through Orenburg and into Kazakhstan, where President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the floods were one of the worst natural disasters to affect the area in decades. After evacuating over 6,000 people in the Orenburg region, authorities also began relocating some residents of the Siberian city of Kurgan, where the Tobol River is expected to rise. Kurgan is a city of around 300,000 people near northern Kazakhstan. Emergency services in Kurgan said 571 people were moved away from areas expected to be flooded in what it said were \"preventative evacuations.\" Local authorities said reinforcements of some 100 rescuers arrived in the western Siberian region from the Urals to prepare for the floods. Emergency authorities also warned that the Irtysh River was \"very likely\" to flood parts of Tobolsk, one of Russia's oldest Siberian cities. Putin, who has been a vocal climate skeptic for much of his rule, has in recent years ordered his government to do more to prepare Russia for extreme weather events. The country has seen severe floods and fires in recent springs and summers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses troops from the defense ministry, National Guard, FSB security service and interior ministry in central Moscow on June 27, 2023. Sergei Guneyev | Afp | Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree setting out the routine spring conscription campaign, calling up 150,000 citizens for statutory military service, a document posted on the Kremlin's website showed on Sunday. All men in Russia are required to do a year-long military service, or equivalent training during higher education, from the age of 18. In July Russia's lower house of parliament voted to raise the maximum age at which men can be conscripted to 30 from 27. The new legislation came into effect on Jan. 1, 2024. Compulsory military service has long been a sensitive issue in Russia, where many men go to great lengths to avoid being handed conscription papers during the twice-yearly call-up periods. Conscripts cannot legally be deployed to fight outside Russia and were exempted from a limited mobilisation in 2022 that gathered at least 300,000 men with previous military training to fight in Ukraine - although some conscripts were sent to the front in error. In September Putin signed an order calling up 130,000 people for the autumn campaign and last spring Russia planned to conscript 147,000.

Russia\u2019s turnaround on the U.N. monitoring reflects how Moscow\u2019s growing animosity with the U.S. and its Western allies since the start of the Ukraine war has made it difficult to reach consensus on even issues where there has been longstanding agreement. The veto came during a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have extended the mandate of a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on North Korea for a year, but which will now halt its operation when its current mandate expires at the end of April. The vote in the 15-member council, with 13 in favor, Russia against, and China abstaining, has no impact on the actual sanctions against North Korea, which remain in force. Russia had never before tried to block the work of the panel of experts, which had been renewed annually by the U.N. Security Council for 14 years and reflected global opposition to North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear weapon program.

He accused the panel of experts of \u201cincreasingly being reduced to playing into the hands of Western approaches, reprinting biased information and analyzing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos.\u201d Therefore, he said, it is \u201cessentially conceding its inability to come up with sober assessments of the status of the sanctions regime.\u201d But U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood called the panel\u2019s work essential and accused Russia of attempting to silence its \u201cindependent objective investigations\u201d because it \u201cbegan reporting in the last year on Russia\u2019s blatant violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.\u201d He warned that Russia\u2019s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardizing global security through development \u201cof long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts.\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby condemned Russia\u2019s veto as a \u201creckless action\u201d that undermines sanctions imposed on North Korea, while warning against the deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia, particularly as North Korea continues to supply Russia with weapons as it wages its war in Ukraine. \u201cThe international community should resolutely uphold the global nonproliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal aggression,\u201d Kirby told reporters. Britain\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia\u2019s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, including \u201cthe transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year.\u201d \u201cThis veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.\u201d \u201cThis panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,\u201d Woodward said. France\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere added that \u201cNorth Korea has been providing Russia with military material in support of its aggression against Ukraine, in violation of many resolutions which Russia voted in favor of.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky responded, calling these \u201cunfounded insinuations\u201d that \u201conly strengthened our conviction that we took the right decision to not support the extension of the panel of experts.\u201d The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking \u2014 so far unsuccessfully \u2014 to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches. The Security Council established a committee to monitor sanctions and the mandate for its panel of experts to investigate violations had been renewed for 14 years until Thursday. In its most recent report circulated last month, the panel of experts said it is investigating 58 suspected North Korean cyberattacks between 2017 and 2023 valued at approximately $3 billion, with the money reportedly being used to help fund its development of weapons of mass destruction. The experts said North Korea continues to flout sanctions, including by further developing its nuclear weapons, and producing nuclear fissile materials \u2014 the weapons\u2019 key ingredients. It also continues to import refined petroleum products in violation of council resolutions.","question":"How did the UN Security Council vote on the resolution to extend the mandate of the panel monitoring North Korea sanctions in March 2024?","answer":"The vote resulted in 13 members in favor, Russia against, and China abstaining, leading to the panel's mandate not being renewed.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future information.

KYIV -- Russia launched a major missile-and-drone assault on multiple locations around Ukraine flattening residential buildings in Kyiv, killing at least nine people, and wounding scores of others across the country. The April 24 overnight attack -- one of the largest in months -- came just hours after the White House presented Ukrainian officials with what amounted to an ultimatum about a US proposal to end the 38-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine. Western efforts to try and resolve the Ukraine war -- or even a temporary cease-fire -- have sputtered in recent days, as Russia shows no indication it will ease its assault, and Ukraine pushes back on US proposals. Foreign ministers and top diplomats were scheduled to meet in London on April 23 for talks on the war. But they were effectively downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out of the meetings at the last minute. That decision was reportedly prompted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejecting a US proposal that Washington might formally recognize Russian control over the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. That would be a major reversal of longstanding US policy. It is also seen as potentially political suicide for any Ukrainian officials. \u201cThere is nothing to talk about. This violated our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the London talks. Late April 23, US President Donald Trump lashed out directly at Zelenskyy, on social media and in remarks to reporters. He also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin was open to the US proposals. Trump's lead envoy for Russia, Steve Witkoff, is set to fly to Moscow on April 25 for expected meetings with Putin. \"I think Russia is ready and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \u201cI thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far it\u2019s harder.\u201d In a post to X, Zelenskyy responded to Trump, and included a copy of a 2018 US State Department statement that called on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea. Trump had vowed to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office. But the negotiations have proven difficult, as Russia targets both civilian and military sites across the country, while pressing its advantage on the battlefield. Ukraine's military said more than 210 missiles and drones were launched in the overnight assault, including ballistic missiles and cruise missiles launched by heavy bombers and Black Sea naval ships. More than 100 missiles were downed or intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, the military claimed . \"Kyiv and its region, Zhytomyr, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytsky, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhya regions were under a massive combined Russian attack,\" Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram . A number of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the capital Kyiv, and officials said at least nine people were killed and scores of people were wounded. Rescuers rushed to pull survivors from building debris, listening for cell phones ringing to try and locate people. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, was also hit by at least several missiles, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. It was no immediately clear if there were casualties. Ukraine's foreign minister, who traveled to London despite the downgraded meetings, lashed out at Putin, criticized the Trump administration. \u201cPutin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war,\" Andrii Sybiha said on X . \u201cRussia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace. Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied,\u201d he wrote. The downgrading of the London meetings highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talk amid Trump's complaints of a lack of progress in the negotiations. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you.\" Ukrainian and US officials were also set to sign a deal this week that would give US companies access to Ukraine's valuable mineral resources. That agreement has also been the subject of difficult negotiations, and resulted in an acrimonious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February.

Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD) says it has uncovered a covert operation by Russian and Belarusian intelligence services aimed at inciting violence against Belarusian exiles living in Lithuania. The plot, involving staged provocations and disinformation campaigns, was revealed in a statement released by the VSD and reported by the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT. According to Lithuanian authorities, foreign intelligence services have been orchestrating increasingly dangerous incidents targeting the Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania, which numbered more than 57,000 people as of early 2025. Authorities say foreign agents have attempted to simulate clashes between so-called \"Litvinist\" Belarusians -- followers of an ideology tying Belarusian identity to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania -- and fabricated Lithuanian nationalist groups. \"The organizers are trying to stage conflicts between opposing forces -- Belarusians who advocate for Litvinist ideas and so-called Lithuanian groups who appear to resist them,\u201d the VSD said. Recent Provocations Officials stressed that no real extremist Litvinist groups have been identified in Lithuania, and that they believe the narrative is being manipulated in Belarusian and Russian propaganda to stir mistrust and division. Recent provocations include fake video messages allegedly from Belarusian soldiers, anti-Belarusian graffiti, threats against Lithuanian lawmakers and Vilnius-based exiles, and social media campaigns spreading pseudohistorical claims about the region's past. The VSD warned residents not to fall for such provocations, noting that \"participation in these activities could lead to administrative or criminal liability.\" Meanwhile, there has been growing scrutiny of Belarusian nationals living in Lithuania. Many face increasingly strict visa checks, difficulties extending residence permits, and even deportation due to past affiliations with Belarusian state institutions or the military. Lithuanian media have labeled the disinformation campaign \u201cLitvinism.\u201d Authorities emphasize that the real danger lies not in the ideology itself, but in its exploitation to destabilize communities. In recognition of its reporting on this issue, the Lithuanian government's Department of National Minorities recently presented an award to RFE\/RL\u2019s Belarus Service for an investigative piece that shed light on the actors behind the campaign and its broader geopolitical implications. Read more April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Judge Orders Steps To Reverse Shutdown Of US Government Funded Broadcaster VOA A sign for the US broadcaster Voice of America is seen in Washington, D.C. (file photo) A federal court judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to reverse its efforts aimed at forcing the closure of Voice of America (VOA), which was shut down last month in a move the broadcaster had called illegal. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled late on April 22 to grant a preliminary injunction that says officials must \"take all necessary steps\" to restore employees and contractors to their positions at VOA and to restore Congress-approved funding to two other U.S.-government funded broadcasters -- Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks -- and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts. Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees the federal broadcasters, also ordered the media outlets to provide monthly status reports showing the USAGM was complying with the order to allow the outlets to \"provide news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive.\" The USAGM has not responded publicly to the court decision. VOA last month filed a lawsuit saying the Trump administration has taken \u201ca chainsaw\u201d approach to the USAGM through an executive order that directed it and six other federal agencies to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\u201d The USAGM subsequently placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and terminated some 600 contractors, forcing VOA to stop its broadcasts for the first time since it was founded in 1942. The USAGM had argued in the case that no \"final decision\" on VOA's future had been made and that the lawsuits should be treated as \"employment disputes\" with those workers who had been terminated. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty has also filed a lawsuit against the USAGM \u201cto avoid irreparable harm\u201d to the broadcaster over the withholding of its Congress-approved grant as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to terminate RFE\/RL\u2019s funding. RFE\/RL's case continues to be pursued in court. Read more April 23, 2025 By Ray Furlong and Mike Eckel Officials Call Ukraine Peace Talks 'Substantive' Despite Last-Minute No-Shows (From left to right) British Defense Minister John Healey, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov after talks in London on April 23, 2025. Officials from Ukraine, the United States, and Europe said a meeting in London was \"substantive\" despite the last-minute postponement of a broader set of talks with foreign ministers. The April 23 talks, which were aimed at trying to resolve Russia's 38-month war on Ukraine, were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting and casting a major pall over ongoing peace efforts. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy also opted to skip the meetings, leaving a Ukrainian delegation that included Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top aide -- to meet with lower-level officials and US Ukraine envoy Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. In the end, the talks involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said. Zelenskyy said emotions had \"run high\" during the meeting but it was good that the representatives of five countries met to bring peace closer. \"The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . Speaking to reporters at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he thought the London talks went well. He also said he thinks he has a deal with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the war. But he also implied that a deal with Zelenskyy remained elusive, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been more difficult to deal with than Putin. Putin was quoted as saying he viewed the deal on the table positively and hoped that Ukraine feels the same way. Trump and Zelenskyy are both scheduled to attend the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on April 25. There has been no announcement of a meeting between the two. The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain at the London talks highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talks. It also came after Trump complained of a lack of progress in the negotiations, prompting him to threaten to make a deal soon or Washington will walk away from the table. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you, we have other things to do.\" Last week, Rubio and other Ukrainian and European officials met in Paris for talks that yielded what many saw was minor progress toward a resolution of the war. But Rubio later signaled US impatience with the status of the talks and suggested the United States might pull out entirely from all involvement in the negotiations. Trump again warned Ukraine that it needs to make a deal to end the fighting while sharply criticizing Zelenskyy for saying Kyiv sees any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia -- reportedly a condition the United States has put on the table in the talks -- is a red line for Ukraine. \"It\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\" Trump said in a social media post in which he denied anyone is asking Ukraine recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire -- He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\" Trump added. Zelenskyy in his post on X included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day during a trip to India, US Vice President JD Vance said Washington had issued a \u201cvery explicit proposal\u201d to Russia and Ukraine, though he gave no details. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance said. \u201cThe current lines, somewhere close to them is where you\u2019re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,\u201d he said. SEE ALSO: Trump Talk Of Imminent Deal Sharpens Focus On Ukraine Diplomacy Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and CNN reported that US negotiators had presented Ukraine with a list of possible concessions. Included among them was potential US recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, and a definitive rejection of Ukraine's aspiration to join NATO. The Kremlin on April 23 refused to comment on rumored proposals and said the downgrading of the London talks showed that the countries involved still needed to narrow their differences as there were \"a lot of nuances\" that still need resolving. Britain's Defense Secretary John Healy told lawmakers on April 22 there was no evidence that Russia had let up its attacks on Ukraine, chiding Putin as someone who says he wants peace but \"has rejected a full cease-fire...and continues to play for time in the negotiations.\" Healy and Lammy held talks with the Ukrainian delegation during the day on April 23, with Kellogg also in attendance. He called the talks \"substantial,\" while Lammy wrote in a social media post that \"we are working at pace with US, Ukraine, and European allies to end the war and secure a just and lasting peace.\" RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report Read more Updated April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Deadly Russian Drone Strike Hits Bus In Wave Of Attacks On Ukraine's Regions Ukrainian rescuers evacuate a wounded person from a bus damaged by a Russian drone strike in the town of Marhanets, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, on April 23.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, saying that Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacks on civilians are 'commonplace' in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions, as well as the frontline cities of Kupyansk and Pokrovsk. \"Russians struck a bus which was transporting workers of a mining and processing plant.

Speaking at a meeting of the State Military-Industrial Commission on April 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than 1.5 million drones of various types had been produced in Russia last year. Putin added that this amount included about 4,000 FPV drones. A wave of Russia's attacks also targeted civilian infrastructure across other Ukrainian regions. At least five people were reported injured in the Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Odesa. \"Residential buildings, business facilities, warehouses, and garages have been damaged,\" Ukraine's emergency service said . Large-scale fires had also broken out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said . The emergency service said the attack targeted 'solely the city's civilian infrastructure.' Meanwhile, in the Yelabuga district of Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, two fires broke out following a reported drone attack, local authorities confirmed on April 23. The Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over Tatarstan by air defense systems on duty. Officials have not released further details on the type of drone or its intended target. Rustem Nuriyev, head of the Yelabuga district administration, said in a statement that there were no casualties or injuries as a result of the incident. In response to the drone activity, temporary flight restrictions were imposed on Kazan and Nizhnekamsk airports. Kyiv has not commented on the incident. Also, a fire that had been burning at an ammunition depot on a military base -- where a large explosion occurred a day earlier -- in the Kirzhach district of Russia's Vladimir region, northeast of Moscow, has been \u201cgradually ending,\u201d regional Governor Aleksandr Avdeyev said. Four people were injured when ammunition exploded, prompting an evacuation order, Avdeyev said , adding that ammunition caught fire and shells exploded in the storage area. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that the fire had been caused by a breach of safety protocols and had resulted in the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse. \"As a result of a fire on the territory of a military unit in the Vladimir region, ammunition stored in a warehouse detonated,\" the Defense Ministry said. \"According to preliminary information...the cause of the fire was a violation of safety standards in work with explosive materials.\" A state of emergency was declared in the Kirzhach district, which is about 130 kilometers northeast of the Russian capital. The base was evacuated along with about 450 people from at least seven nearby settlements, the governor said. The ammunition depot is one of the largest of the Russian armed forces. It is more than 500 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. There had been no reports of drone attacks in the Vladimir region prior to the explosion. Yan Matveyev, a Russian military analyst, told Current Time that the ammunition stored at the depot could range from typical 155-millimeter artillery shells to Iskander-M missiles. \"This depot is close to the capital, close to Moscow, so it's easy to transport all this [ammunition] around the country,\" Matveyev said. Unverified video published earlier on Telegram channels showed a huge fire ball, a loud blast, and clouds of thick smoke rising into the sky. Baza, a Telegram channel close to security services, said 10 to 11 explosions had occurred and firefighters from neighboring regions had been called in to contain the blaze. It said a special commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire.

(file photo) Farmers in Uzbekistan say the government is forcing them to surrender land to Chinese businesses under the guise of state-backed development, taking thousands of hectares of fertile cotton and wheat fields out of the hands of locals. Concerned over the fate of the lush lands of the Ferghana Valley, they told Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty that large patches of land have been taken into the state reserve and transferred to Chinese businessmen. Official documents say the land transfers are voluntary. But dozens of accounts given to RFE\/RL from those who signed over their land appear to describe a different reality: coercion, threats, and intimidation by Uzbek law enforcement officers acting on orders from local officials. \"The governor told me: 'This is a presidential order. Either give up the land or go to jail,'\" said one farmer who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal for commenting publicly on the issue. Creeping Influence? Land transfers in the Ferghana Valley, which is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, are the latest flashpoint in what is becoming an increasingly visible and volatile undercurrent across Central Asia -- a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment driven by land disputes, debt dependency, labor market tensions, and fears of creeping influence.

Neither the local government nor the prosecutor can take it away. According to the legislation, the land can only be seized by the state by court decision. Farmers, though, say and seizures are being carried out based on a verbal order from Shuhrat Abdurahmonov, the head of the region. \"I did not want to give up my land and put up some resistance, but in response, the district governor called more than 20 police officers and the National Guard to the district administration building and ordered them to arrest me and my wife,\" a farmer from Qurgonteppa district told RFE\/RL. \"That is why none of the farmers resist now; otherwise, they could be imprisoned. It is unlikely that any of us would be able to get out of there alive and well.\" Regional administrations failed to comment on the claims by farmers when contacted by RFE\/RL. Concerns over China taking over the use of large swaths of land extend beyond the farming community. Beijing's economic presence in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. As of early 2025, China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion. Over 3,400 Chinese firms operate in the country, surpassing even the number of Russian entities. Similar patterns have emerged in other Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan. SEE ALSO: Is China Exporting Its Political Model To The World? A New Report Says Yes. 'Economic Trap' Chinese investments promise infrastructure, jobs, and technology. But experts warn of a darker side. Uzbek political analyst Nargiza Muratalieva points out that Central Asian countries are increasingly falling into what she calls China's \"economic trap:\" easy access to credit -- often with opaque terms -- that can eventually leave weaker states vulnerable to political pressure or asset forfeiture. Muratalieva points out that Beijing gained over 1,100 square kilometers of land in Tajikistan in 2011 in exchange for debt relief, a clear example of the potential consequences of falling into this \"trap.\" China is already the largest lender in Uzbekistan, with outstanding loans totaling $3.8 billion. \"The general characteristics of Chinese lending for all countries in the region are the ease of obtaining debts, their difficult repayment, as well as the lack of transparency of procedures and specific conditions,\" according to Muratalieva. SEE ALSO: Uzbek President In China Seeking New Era Of Relations And Investments Debt repayments, land transfers, and rising Chinese economic control also feed local perceptions of \"neocolonialism,\" especially when local communities are excluded from decision-making processes. The harsh treatment of Uyghurs and other non-Han indigenous ethnic groups in China's Xinjiang Province strikes a deep chord with Central Asians, who share linguistic, cultural, and religious ties with them. Whether it's propaganda or not, the fear that China could one day treat Kazakhs or Uzbeks the same way has further sown seeds of opposition to Beijing's expanding presence. \"It turns out that the Chinese really like my land; they want to take the land from other farmers too. Naturally, we are against it, but the district governor, the prosecutor, and the police chief continue to put pressure on us,\" one farmer from Uzbekistan's western Andijon region told RFE\/RL. \"What worries us most is that they can subsequently seize our country and do to us the same as they did to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\" SEE ALSO: Trump's Tariffs, Like Russian Sanctions, Benefit Chinese EVs In Central Asia Read more April 22, 2025 By Ray Furlong , RFE\/RL's Russian Service and Current Time Russia Issues Warrant For Film Critic Turned War Critic Yekaterina Barabash in court. In a baggy red blouse and matching glasses, Yekaterina Barabash was pictured apparently blowing kisses from behind a bulletproof glass screen when she stood in the dock at a Moscow court. A well-known film critic, she was sentenced to two months of house arrest for allegedly spreading \u201clies\u201d about the Russian military\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. Now, Russian authorities have issued a wanted note for her and she faces up to 10 years in prison after they found the 63-year-old wasn\u2019t home during a check on April 13. On April 21, the Russian prison agency issued a statement saying that she wasn\u2019t home when they called several days earlier. Subsequently, a Moscow court changed her sentence, meaning that she now faces prison. Friends of Barabash contacted by RFE\/RL declined to comment on her disappearance amid fears for her safety. Barabash has been an occasional guest on RFE\/RL\u2019s Russian Service programs for some years and has often criticized the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip on society. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, she immediately condemned it. Russian forces \u201chave bombed the country, levelled whole cities to the ground,\u201d she wrote a few weeks into the conflict. Words such as these were a direct challenge to the Kremlin\u2019s narrative, which banned the word \u201cwar\u201d and denied that civilians were being targeted in attacks despite evidence to the contrary. Shortly after the invasion began, Russia passed new legislation providing jail sentences for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the armed forces. It has been used to jail hundreds of people since the war began, and has led to many others keeping silent. Barabash in court. Moscow, February 26, 2025.

After receiving her sentence, she emerged from the court declaring \u201cat least I\u2019ll have two months of freedom,\u201d suggesting perhaps that she expected a jail sentence in the future.

Massive Russian aerial strikes hit residential buildings in several Ukrainian cities, leaving at least one dead and more than two dozen injured, including several children, in attacks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"deliberate terror.\" Two guided aerial bomb strikes hit the city of Zaporizhzhya on April 22, killing one woman and injuring 38 others -- four of whom were children and a pregnant woman, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone attacks were also seen in the city of Kharkiv, though casualty figures were unknown. The daytime strikes came after a drone attack overnight sparked massive fires in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, where a a housing block in a densely inhabited area was hit. The attack left one woman dead and at least three other residents injured. The attack came amid ongoing diplomatic activity to secure a cease-fire in the Ukraine war, following Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. \"All of this is absolutely deliberate Russian terror that can be stopped by a single order, an order in Russia and for the Russian Army,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \"Our proposal for a cease-fire regarding civilian buildings also remains in force. Russia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this. There are no obstacles on the Ukrainian side and there will be none.\" Across the country, the Ukrainian Air Force reported dozens of drone attacks overnight. Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhaniv wrote on social media on April 22 that many apartments had been damaged and that \u201cthe residents are in shock.\u201d Emergency services posted photos and videos of fire crew battling blazes at what they said was civilian infrastructure. The renewed attacks came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that his forces were attacking civilian targets in Ukraine. Speaking on April 21 about an attack on the northern city of Sumy last week, in which 35 people were killed, he said the target was a civilian building \u2013- but that soldiers were present there, making it a legitimate target.

There was also a fire at a construction site,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Later, air raid sirens sounded again amid renewed sightings of Russian drones. Meanwhile, the governor of Russia's Vladimir region, Aleksandr Avdeyev, said on April 22 that an explosion occurred in the region's Kirzhach district. Avdeyev did not provide details but said emergency services were on site. Telegram channels reported the blast happened in the village of Barsovo, near military unit 11785, also known as the 51st arsenal of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, which stores ammunition. Residents reported several explosions. A \"powerful attack\" was reported, prompting evacuations in Barsovo and nearby villages within a 5 km radius. Roads to Kirzhach from Moscow were blocked. Local authorities announced a state of emergency in the area. Russia also launched large-scale missile strikes on Easter Monday on April 21, following the expiry of a self-declared 30-hour Easter truce. Kyiv claimed Russian forces violated the truce 3,000 times. On April 22, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot dismissed the truce as a \u201cmarketing operation\u201d by Putin aimed primarily at US President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at continuing Russian attacks as he pushes diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire. SEE ALSO: Ukraine Stands By Proposal To End Attacks On Civilian Targets, Zelenskyy Says \"The Easter truce, which he announced somewhat unexpectedly, was a marketing operation, an operation of charm, aimed at preventing President Trump's impatience and anger,\" Barrot was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying on FranceInfo television. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said he spoke to Barrot the previous evening to coordinate positions ahead of a meeting in London on April 23. The London meeting was set to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, following a gathering in Paris on April 18 -- the first joint talks in this format since Trump took office. Barrot told FranceInfo that the European countries used that meeting to tell Washington what their red lines were for a deal. Trump has said he\u2019s hopeful an agreement can be wrapped up this week, which feels ambitious to many observers. But in another sign that diplomacy is picking up steam, Putin said on April 21 that he was ready for direct talks with Zelenskyy -- something that he had until recently refused. This was met with skepticism by Ukrainian political analyst Ihor Reiterovich, who told RFE\/RL's Current Time that it was \"standard manipulation -- an attempt to portray Russia in a peace-making light, which frankly looks extremely cynical.\" Read more April 22, 2025 By RFE\/RL Ukraine Stands By Proposal To End Attacks On Civilian Targets, Zelenskyy Says A woman walks in front of an apartment building damaged in the course of Russia-Ukraine war.

Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on April 21 that Ukraine stood by its proposal for an end to attacks on civilian targets and was ready for any form of discussion to achieve it. \"Ukraine stands by its offer...not to strike civilian infrastructure. And we expect a clear answer from Moscow,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We are ready for any conversation on how to ensure this.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on April 21 proposed bilateral talks with Ukraine for the first time since the early days of the war. Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin's proposal but said Ukraine \"was ready for any conversation\" about a cease-fire that would stop strikes on civilians. \"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure.\" SEE ALSO: Zelenskyy Demands Russia Return Ukrainian Children In New International Campaign Ukraine and Russia are facing pressure from the United States to make progress on negotiations to end the war.

This must be the starting point,\" he said. Both sides said fighting had resumed after an Easter cease-fire, which Putin announced unilaterally on April 19. Ukrainian authorities reported dozens of Russian missile and drone attacks on April 21, while a Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. Russian forces attacked Ukraine's northeastern region, killing one person in a border village, according to regional prosecutors. The report on Telegram said a Russian drone struck and killed a man on a scooter in the village of Ivashki. Russian forces also launched a late night drone attack on residential areas of Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, triggering fires and damaging many apartments, local officials said early on April 22. A day earlier US President Donald Trump voiced hope that an agreement would be reached between the two countries this week. Trump told reporters at the White House on April 21 that he plans to comment on the war in Ukraine and mediation efforts in the next three days. He made the comment in response to a question about whether the United States had proposed that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014 and then annexed it in violation of international law. \"So I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,\" Trump said. \"But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,\" he added without providing details. In his comments earlier on April 21, Putin said Russia was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv. \"We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude toward any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,\" Putin said on state TV. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when Putin said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, he meant bilateral negotiations. There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week.

At age 16, Vladyslav Rudenko was captured by Russian forces and held in children\u2019s camps in Russia-occupied Crimea and Kherson for nine months. Unlike some 20,000 other Ukrainian youths, Rudenko was rescued by the NGO Save Ukraine and returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after nine months in captivity. It's the fate of those thousands, many of whom remain in Russian-occupied areas -- in what Moscow calls \u201crehabilitation centers\u201d -- that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials say they are now focused on. \"This crime must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held accountable,\" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said over the weekend as part of the launch of the ChildrenAreNonNegotiable campaign. \"A just and lasting peace requires the return of all these Ukrainian children home.\" SEE ALSO: Amid Interrogations And Threats, Ukrainian Civilians Flee Russian Occupation US President Donald Trump has made ending Europe's longest conflict since World War II a top foreign policy priority since taking office three months ago. While the talks have lurched between several contentious issues, Ukrainian officials have kept the repatriation of all of those taken from Ukraine a major negotiating point. Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of orchestrating what some groups have called a \"systematic deportation\" of children out of Ukraine and into Russia-controlled parts of the country, or even further to destinations in Russia and its ally, Belarus. Evidence gathered last year by RFE\/RL's Belarus Service and Schemes , the investigative unit of RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service, indicated camps were being used to teach young Ukrainians to identify with concepts that both Moscow and Minsk promote. That came after a November 2023 study by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab that deemed Ukrainian schoolchildren's escorted trips to Belarus were coordinated by Belarus and Russia as part of the two countries' so-called Union State. SEE ALSO: Abducted Ukrainian Children: Calls Made To Continue Search For Kids Taken By Russia As US Closes Investigation Team The study said the process involves \"re-education,\" which it defined as \"the promotion of cultural, historical, societal, and patriotic messages or ideas that serve the political interests\" of both regimes. Military training, including by Interior Ministry troops, occurred with \"at least six groups of children,\" according to the report. Rudenko told RFE\/RL's Ukrainian service earlier this month that during the time he was held by Russian authorities his daily routine had an obvious orientation. \u201cWe woke up to the Russian anthem, raised the flag, did exercises. After breakfast, they told us what had happened in Russia overnight. Literally. Then we went to watch Russian movies,\" he said, recalling his regiment while held in camps. According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab more than 8,400 children from Ukraine have been systematically relocated to at least 57 facilities: 13 facilities in Belarus and 43 facilities in Russia and Russia-occupied territory. According to Ukraine\u2019s official government portal childrenofwar.gov.ua , a much higher number -- around 20,000 -- have been taken away and only 1,300 children have been successfully returned. \u201cWe remind the world that without the return of the children abducted by Russia, the war cannot truly be considered over,\u201d a statement published by Zelenskyy's office during Easter said. Washington has supported Kyiv on the issue of repatriating children, saying last month it remains committed to supporting the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. However, Ukrainian officials are worried recent budget cutting moves by the Trump administration could significantly hinder investigations into where the children have been moved and efforts to enable their return. Meanwhile, Karolina Hird, deputy team leader and an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, warned that Ukrainian teenagers forced to accept Russian citizenship may face conscription into the Russian army and could be forced to fight against their own people, a violation of international law. \u201cNegotiations and an end to the fighting without consideration for the deported children will empower Russia to continue to commit these crimes with absolute impunity,\u201d Hird wrote .

Francis, who had also delivered a blessing at this year's Easter services a day before his death, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first pontiff born outside Europe in over a millennium. At the Vatican, locals, tourists, and pilgrims visiting for Easter expressed their shock and grief. \"This is something that really hits you hard,\" Rome resident Emanuela Tinari told Reuters. \"He was a pope who brought so many people closer to the church.

In June 2022, he condemned the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Russian forces while also suggesting the war was \u201cperhaps somehow provoked.\u201d This echoed a Kremlin argument, repeatedly made without evidence, that it was forced to attack. -- By Ray Furlong, senior international corresponden t \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Trump announced later on the same social media platform that he and first lady Melania Trump would attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome.

A Papacy Focused On Social Justice Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis worked as a chemical technician before entering the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a priest in 1969 and became the provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed archbishop of Buenos Aires. Three years later, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Elected Pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, reflecting his commitment to humility and the poor. Images From Francis's Years As Pope No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:01 0:00 His papacy was marked by a focus on mercy, social justice, and environmental stewardship. In 2015, Pope Francis issued the encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019,\u201d calling for global action on climate change and care for the environment. He also emphasized interfaith dialogue, notably signing the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Ahmed el-Tayeb, in 2019, a landmark agreement promoting peace and coexistence among different faiths. 'A Poor Church For The Poor' Pope Francis was known for his pastoral approach, advocating for a \u201cpoor Church for the poor\u201d and reaching out to marginalized communities. He made efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s financial systems and address alleged clerical sexual abuse within the church. In 2025, he published his autobiography, \u201cHope,\u201d offering insights into his life and papal mission. In his later years, Pope Francis faced several health challenges. In 2021, he underwent colon surgery to address diverticulitis, and in 2023, he had abdominal surgery to repair a hernia. He also experienced chronic knee and back pain, often using a wheelchair for mobility. Despite these issues, he maintained a rigorous schedule, continuing his pastoral duties and international travels. In early 2025, Pope Francis was hospitalized with a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, which developed into double pneumonia. His condition remained complex, requiring an extended hospital stay. He had been discharged from hospital on March 23.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said Moscow's actions following the midnight end to the truce will indicate the Kremlin's real attitude toward any initiatives to end the war. \"Regarding the so-called 'Easter Cease-fire,' we have still not heard Moscow\u2019s response to our proposal to extend it to 30 days,\" he wrote on X. \"Russia's actions after midnight, tomorrow, and throughout the week will reveal Russia\u2019s true attitude toward US peace efforts and the 30-day full cease-fire proposal. They will show whether Russia is serious about peace or Putin's statements from yesterday were simply manipulations,\" Sybiha added. The US State Department earlier said it would welcome an extension to the Easter cease-fire that was set to expire a few hours later. \"We have seen President Putin's announcement of a temporary cease-fire due to Easter. We remain committed to achieving a full and comprehensive cease-fire,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to news media. \"As we assess their seriousness in this instance, we would welcome it extending beyond Sunday,\" the statement added. In the early morning hours of April 21, Zelenskyy accused Russia of 2,935 violations following Putin's call for the Easter truce, although he added that there had been \"no air raid alerts\" during the period. \"Either Putin does not have full control over his army or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on April 20.

Meanwhile, in a further sign of heightened international tensions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain's Defense Ministry reported recently intercepting Russian warplanes over the Baltic Sea. It cited two incidents, on April 15 and 17, in which British jets were scrambled to intercept Russian aircraft.

After more than three years of war, the talk of an Easter truce in fighting between Russia and Ukraine was met with some skepticism, and it does indeed seem to have failed to materialize. A unilateral truce was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 19, running from 6 p.m. that day until midnight on April 20. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agency TASS that the cease-fire would not extend beyond midnight. Ukrainian officials have said it has not been observed anyway. \"Either Putin does not have full control over his army or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X on April 20. Zelenskyy had said his country would observe the truce and suggested extending it to 30 days. Both sides, however, have reported that attacks by the other continued on Easter Sunday, though it was not possible to independently confirm battlefield claims. Video sent to RFE\/RL by a Ukrainian humanitarian organization appeared to show a drone attack on vehicles evacuating civilians near Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Russian Attack On Humanitarian Mission Vehicle No media source currently available 0:00 0:00:45 0:00 Yevhen Tkachev from the Proliska organization and a civilian woman were injured. She and her husband, who was suffering from shock, were taken to a hospital. Zelenskyy posted on social media on April 20 that \"the highest level of Russian combat activity this Easter is in the Pokrovsk direction,\" which is located some 50 kilometers southwest of Kostyantynivka. \"Putin's words about a 'cease-fire' have also proven empty in the Kursk region, the Siversk direction, and other directions in the Donetsk region,\" Zelenskyy added. The Ukrainian general staff reported shelling, assaults, and drone attacks. Russian authorities reported at least three explosions in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine early on April 20. The Defense Ministry claimed Kyiv launched 48 drone attacks on targets in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine overnight. Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s forces were acting \"in a fully symmetrical manner\" to Moscow's. Meanwhile, in a further sign of heightened international tensions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Britain's Defense Ministry reported recently intercepting Russian warplanes over the Baltic Sea. It cited two incidents, on April 15 and 17, in which British jets were scrambled to intercept Russian aircraft. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard said on April 20 that \"Russian aggression\" was growing and that British jets were working with the Swedish Air Force to defend NATO airspace.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country will abide by a 30-hour Easter cease-fire called by Moscow, but he accused Russia of already violating the truce by launching drone and artillery attacks on Ukrainian cities. Separately, Kyiv and Moscow announced a major swap of prisoners of war on April 19, with more than 200 men being exchanged by each side.

Kyiv had no immediate comment on the claim about retaking the Kursk region village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine. If confirmed, however, it would move Russian troops closer to fully expelling Ukrainian troops from Kursk, which has been a persistent embarrassment for the Kremlin. With Orthodox and Western Easter falling on the same day -- April 20 -- this year, Putin used a televised meeting with his top military commander to announce he was calling a two-day truce. The cease-fire, Putin said, would begin at 5 p.m. CET on April 19 and run until midnight on Easter Sunday, April 20. \"We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example,\" he said while meeting General Valery Gerasimov. \"At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel any possible violations of the truce or provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions.\" Zelenskyy quickly labeled the call \"yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives.\" Attack \"drones in our skies reveal Putin's true attitude toward Easter and toward human life,\" Zelenskyy said in a post to X . SEE ALSO: Russian Forces Are Advancing In The Donbas. Ukraine's Response? Invade Russia. Zelenskyy said the short timeframe for the truce indicated Putin was not serious about ending the fighting and suggested the cease-fire be extended for 30 days instead. \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly -- mirroring Russia\u2019s actions,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X . \"If the complete cease-fire truly holds, Ukraine proposes an extension beyond April 20,\" Zelensky wrote. \"That is what will reveal Russia\u2019s true intentions, because 30 hours is enough to make headlines but not for genuine confidence-building measures. Thirty days could give peace a chance,\" the Ukrainian leader added. Anitta Hipper, the European Commission's lead spokeswoman for foreign affairs and security, said \"Russia has a track record as an aggressor, so first we need to see any actual halt of the aggression and clear deeds for a lasting cease-fire.\" \"Russia could stop this war at any moment if it really wanted to.... We continue to support Ukraine for a long, just and comprehensive peace,\" she added.

Zelenskyy dismissed the Russian call as playing for time to regroup its forces. While Russian troops claimed painstaking progress against Ukrainian troops in Kursk, further to the east, Ukrainian troops continued to hold small slices of territory in Belgorod, another Russian border region. Zelenskyy and his top military commander, General Oleksandr Syrskiy, announced the incursion into Belgorod last week. With the weather turning, and sodden battlefield soil firming up, both Russia and Ukraine have launched small-scale spring offensives. SEE ALSO: Russia Launches Spring Offensive As Ukraine Invades Belgorod Region Russia's Defense Ministry also said on April 19 that its troops were trying to push Ukrainian forces out of Gornal, another Kursk region village some 11 kilometers to the south of Oleshnya. Despite a tentative agreement on a limited cease-fire, Kyiv and Moscow have continued to pound one another with missiles and drones. Over the past week, Russian ballistic missiles have hit several civilian targets, killing or wounding scores of civilians. In Kupyansk, a city east of Kharkiv that Russian troops have been struggling to advance on, Russian jets reportedly dropped more than a half-dozen \"glide\" bombs on targets in and around the city . The city's military administrator said at least five people were wounded. SEE ALSO: Swarmed By Drones, Ukrainian Troops Fight To Hold Ground Near Kupyansk Glide bombs are heavy bombs that are retrofitted with guidance systems, allowing them to be dropped by aircraft well out of range of Ukrainian air defense systems. Russian forces have used the weapons to devastating effect on Ukrainian defenses. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched nearly eight dozen drones overnight on April 19. More were either intercepted or jammed electronically, the military claimed. Russia's Defense Ministry said air-defense systems shot down two Ukrainian drones overnight. Ukrainian and Russian officials also announced a major prisoner swap, with each side handing back more than 240 men, according to Russian authorities. Zelenskyy said 277 Ukrainian \"warriors\" were returned from Russian captivity.

In a conference call with journalists, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed reports of the withdrawal but did not give further details. Hikmet Hajiyev, the head of foreign policy in Azerbaijan\u2019s presidential administration, also confirmed the withdrawal, saying it was agreed to by both countries. Hajiyev did not say why the forces were being withdrawn, but their presence appeared superfluous after Azerbaijan regained full control of the region last year. The Karabakh region had been under the control of ethnic Armenians until a war in 2020 that resulted in Azerbaijan regaining control of parts of the region. That war ended with a Russia-brokered cease-fire that called for placing about 2,000 peacekeeping troops in the parts of Karabakh that were still held by Armenians. The forces\u2019 duties were to include ensuring free passage on the sole road connecting Karabakh with Armenia. But Azerbaijan began blocking the road in late 2022, alleging Armenians were using it for weapons shipments and to smuggle minerals, and the Russian forces did not intervene.

In a statement , the FSB stated that, along with Russia's Ministry of Defense, it had \"foiled a landing of sabotage groups of special forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine planned by British special services on the Tendrovskaya spit of Kherson region.\" The Tendrovskaya or Tendrivska spit is a sandbar in the Black Sea area of the Kherson region. The FSB said the Ukrainian \"landing group\" was destroyed during the operation to thwart the plot and took one member of the group as prisoner of war. The agency claimed the POW provided \"detailed information\" about the \"sabotage\" operation, alleging that it was planned against the MSP-17 drilling rig in the Shtormove gas field in the Black Sea. The FSB did not present evidence for its claims and it's unclear whether information was extracted under duress. A drilling pipe hangs from a structure on a new offshore jack-up rig in the Black Sea, Ukraine in 2013.

The station in the main city Dnipro came under attack, and several homes were hit further east in Synelnykove. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack showed that all Ukrainian cities needed more advanced air defences. In a separate strike, Ukraine said that for the first time it had downed a strategic long-range bomber in Russia. Officials said a boy aged eight and a girl of 14 were among five people killed when private homes were targeted by Russian strikes on the town of Synelnykove. A six-year-old boy, who had earlier been reported killed, was in a critical condition and several other people were wounded, Dnipropetrovsk regional head Serhiy Lysak said. Another two people were killed in the regional capital, Dnipro, when the train station and a five-storey building were hit. More than 30 people were injured in Friday's attack in the region. Rail operator Ukrzaliznytsia said a woman who was on duty at the time was killed and seven other railway workers were hurt. Rescue services were continuing to search the rubble and warned that the number of victims would rise, the ministry added. A maternity hospital was also hit. President Zelensky said that Ukraine and its allies \"must defeat Russian terror\", urging Kyiv's partners to urgently provide more advanced air defence systems. He added that he visited Ukrainian troops close to the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region on Friday. Ukraine has for months warned that it is running low on weapons capable of bringing down Russian missiles and drones, and Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has spoken of an \"urgent, critical need\" for fresh military aid. Earlier this week, the northern city of Chernihiv was struck in Russia's deadliest attack for some time, leaving 18 dead and dozens wounded. Three Iskander cruise missiles hit residential buildings close to the centre of the city, the regional leader said. For months, a US military aid package worth $60.8bn (\u00a349bn) has been blocked by Republican representatives in Congress. However, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has said he is determined to bring the matter to a vote, which could take place as early as Saturday. Will US Congress pass long-awaited Ukraine aid bill? Meanwhile, the air force in Kyiv said it had brought down a Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bomber 300km (186 miles) from Ukrainian territory. It said the plane eventually went down in Russia's Stavropol region after it had launched a missile strike on Ukraine. Vladimir Vladimirov Regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov said the plane had gone down in a district to the north of Stavropol Ukraine's defence intelligence described the strike as a special operation similar to an earlier attack on a Russian long-range radar plane. In January, Ukraine's military said it had brought down an A-50 spy plane and a control centre plane over the Sea of Azov. A source in Ukrainian intelligence later told the BBC the Russian bomber was shot down using a Soviet-era S-200 air defence system, which is believed to have been upgraded. Unverified video on Friday showed a plane on fire spiralling out of control to the ground and Stavropol regional governor Vladimir Vladimirov said only that the plane had crashed in a Russian field some distance north of the main city. Russia's defence ministry blamed a technical malfunction after the bomber had carried out a \"combat task\". Two pilots had been found alive, a third crew member was killed and rescue services were looking for a fourth, the governor said. Ukrainian air force chief Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk said Russia had fired six Kh-22 cruise missiles overnight and two of them had been destroyed for the first time. The Tu-22M3 is described as a supersonic bomber and the air force commander said the planes were used to carry Kh-22 missiles for attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The draft resolution, put forward by the US and Japan, sought to reaffirm a principle already set out in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The US has warned that Russia is believed to be developing a space-based, anti-satellite nuclear weapon. Russia said it was \"firmly committed\" to the existing treaty. The draft, put forward on Wednesday, called on \"all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space.\" It also called on countries to uphold the Outer Space Treaty , under which all parties agreed \"not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\". Of the council's 15 members, 13 voted in favour, while Russia - one of five permanent members with a veto - voted against and China abstained. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, called the move \"baffling\". \"Russia has vetoed a straightforward resolution that affirms a legally binding obligation,\" she said. \"President Putin himself has said publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. \"So today's veto begs the question, why? Why, if you are following the rules, would you not support a resolution that reaffirms them? What could you possibly be hiding?\" In February, White House spokesperson John Kirby said Russia was developing a \"troubling\" new anti-satellite weapon, though added that the weapon was not yet operational. The weapon was space-based and armed with a nuclear weapon to target satellites, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in response that Moscow was \"categorically against\" the use of nuclear weapons in space. More than any of its potential global adversaries, the US depends on satellite communications for everything from military operations and surveillance to civilian uses like GPS systems and financial transactions. On Wednesday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan reiterated that the US assessed that \"Russia is developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device\". Details of the intelligence behind the claim have not been made public. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: \"Russia is firmly committed to its international legal obligations, including 1967 The Outer Space Treaty.\" Russia's envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, described the US-Japanese resolution as a \"cynical ploy\" with \"hidden motives\".

Since succeeding President Boris Yeltsin in the waning hours of 1999, Putin has transformed Russia from a country emerging from economic collapse to a pariah state that threatens global security. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has become Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II, Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran and North Korea for support.

(Sergey Savostyanov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File) The question now is what the 71-year-old Putin will do over the course of another six years in the Kremlin, both at home and abroad. Russian forces are gaining ground in Ukraine, deploying scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv grapples with shortages of men and ammunition. Ukraine has brought the battle to Russian soil through drone and missile attacks, especially in border regions. In a speech in February, Putin vowed to fulfill Moscow\u2019s goals in Ukraine , and do what is needed to \u201cdefend our sovereignty and security of our citizens.\u201d Shortly after his orchestrated reelection in March, Putin suggested that a confrontation between NATO and Russia is possible, and he declared he wanted to carve out a buffer zone in Ukraine to protect his country from cross-border attacks. The Russian government has now been dissolved so that Putin can name a new prime minister and Cabinet. One key area to watch is the Defense Ministry. Last month, Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov \u2014 a protege of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu \u2014 was detained on charges of bribery amid reports of rampant corruption. Some analysts have suggested Shoigu could become a victim of the government reshuffle but that would be a bold move, with the war still raging. At home, Putin\u2019s popularity is closely tied to improving living standards for ordinary Russians. Putin on Tuesday once again promised Russians a prosperous future, but since the invasion of Ukraine, many have seen the cost of living rise. Putin began his term in 2018 by promising to get Russia into the top five global economies, vowing it should be \u201cmodern and dynamic.\u201d Instead, Russia\u2019s economy has pivoted to a war footing , and authorities are spending record amounts on defense. Analysts say now that Putin has secured another six years in power, the government could take the unpopular steps of raising taxes to fund the war and pressure more men to join the military. In the years following the invasion, authorities have cracked down on any form of dissent with a ferocity not seen since Soviet times. Putin indicated Tuesday that he would continue to silence critics. He told his audience in the Grand Kremlin Palace to remember the \u201ctragic cost of internal turmoil and upheaval,\u201d and said that Russia \u201cmust be strong and absolutely resistant to any challenges and threats.\u201d Putin enters his fifth term with practically no opposition inside the country. Laws have been enacted that threaten long prison terms for anyone who discredits the military. The Kremlin also targets independent media, rights groups, LGBTQ+ activists and others who don\u2019t hew to what Putin has emphasized as Russia\u2019s \u201ctraditional family values.\u201d His greatest political foe, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony in February. Other prominent critics have either been imprisoned or have fled the country, and even some of his opponents abroad fear for their security . Navalny\u2019s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, released a video ahead of the inauguration in which she said Putin\u2019s promises \u201care not only empty, they are false.\u201d Russia, she said, is \u201cruled by a liar, a thief and a murderer.\u201d EMMA BURROWS Burrows covers security, defense and intelligence for The Associated Press in Europe.

The 68-year-old had been in the role since 2012 and will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, an economist with little military experience. Mr Shoigu is to be appointed secretary of Russia's Security Council. The Kremlin said the defence ministry needed to stay \"innovative\". Reshuffles in Russia don't happen very often so this is a big moment at the top of Russian politics. But Vladimir Putin remains the person who ultimately calls the shots. It was his decision to start the war in Ukraine and all the big decisions are taken by him. The appointment of Mr Belousov as defence minister will come as a surprise to many, given his previous experience. But analysts suggest President Putin is seeking to align the Russian economy more closely with the war effort. The decision to put an economist in charge of the Ministry of Defence reflects the changing priorities of the Kremlin and the huge amounts of money the Russian authorities are now pouring into the war in Ukraine - and Russia's need to boost efficiency in the armed forces. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the proposed appointment of a civilian showed the role of defence minister called for \"innovation\". Who is Andrei Belousov, Russia's new minister of defence? He said Russia was becoming more like the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when a high proportion of GDP went on military spending. As a result, it was necessary to make sure that military expenditure was better integrated into Russia's overall economy, he added. \"The one who is more open to innovations is the one who will be victorious on the battlefield,\" he said. In recent months, there had been rumours that Mr Shoigu's position was growing weaker and that he could lose his job. In April, one of his deputies - Timur Ivanov - was arrested on corruption charges in a rare move against such a senior official. And Russia's campaign in Ukraine was meant to last a few weeks at most. Instead, it is now in its third year and has been plagued by military setbacks and big losses in men and materiel. Although Mr Shoigu will remain in a powerful role as secretary of the Security Council, the move appears to be a demotion for him. It's not yet clear what will happen to the council's current head, Nikolai Patrushev. AFP Vladimir Putin and Sergei Shoigu used to go fishing together in less troubled times Mr Shoigu has close links with President Putin, often taking him on fishing trips in his native Siberia. He was given the defence portfolio despite having no military background, which rankled with some of his top brass. A civil engineer by profession, Mr Shoigu rose to prominence as the head of the emergencies and disaster relief ministry in the 1990s. Who's in Putin's inner circle and running the war? In 2023, Mr Shoigu became embroiled in a public feud with Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin over Russia's conduct of the war. Prigozhin, who led a short-lived mutiny against Moscow, accused Mr Shoigu of being a \"dirtbag\" and \"elderly clown\" in audio messages that went viral. The mercenary chief died in a plane crash while flying from St Petersburg to Moscow in August 2023. The Kremlin denied it was to blame. Reuters Andrei Belousov is a civilian economist and becomes Russia's new defence minister According to unnamed government officials quoted by independent Russian website The Bell, Mr Belousov is seen as a \"hard-line defender of the state, who believes that Russia is encircled by enemies\". Like President Putin, he is close to the Russian Orthodox Church. He is said to be a martial arts enthusiast - as is President Putin - who practised karate and the Russian combat sport sambo in his youth.

His charges carry up to 15 years of jail time.","text":"Yuri Kuznetsov, the second senior official arrested in the case, is accused of bribery after being found holding $1m. Russian police have arrested a senior Ministry of Defence official on bribery charges. The Investigative Committee of Russia announced on Tuesday the arrest of Yuri Kuznetsov, head of personnel. He is the second senior official from the ministry to be arrested in what appears to be a widening corruption case, which coincides with an apparent tightening of oversight of the military by the Kremlin amid its war on Ukraine. The HR chief was arrested after $1m in roubles and foreign currency, as well as gold coins, watches and luxury items were discovered at his properties, investigators said. \u201cAccording to the investigation, in 2021-2023, as the head of the 8th Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Kuznetsov received a bribe from representatives of commercial structures for performing certain actions in their favour,\u201d the committee said. The charges against him carry a jail term of up to 15 years. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Kuznetsov\u2019s arrest, saying the authorities were looking into the matter. Kuznetsov\u2019s detention follows the arrest of Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov on April 23. At least five people have since been arrested, according to reports. Ivanov denies accusations that he received bribes worth $11m in the form of property services from a construction company in return for military contracts. A Moscow court last week rejected an appeal against his detention. The other men arrested were Alexander Fomin, co-founder of a construction company that allegedly paid the bribes, and Anton Filatov, former head of several companies subordinate to the Defence Ministry, who is suspected of large-scale embezzlement. The Kremlin is moving to tighten its oversight of the military amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Peskov suggested. Two new Kremlin aides were announced on Tuesday amid a reshuffle following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s re-election. Alexei Dyumin will oversee the defence industry, and Nikolai Patrushev will have a remit for shipbuilding. Putin has also unexpectedly removed Sergei Shoigu as defence minister. He is being replaced by Andrei Belousov, an economist and former deputy prime minister with no military background. Peskov said the Kremlin did not believe that a change of defence minister and ongoing corruption scandals within the ministry would negatively affect Moscow\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation\u201d as it calls the war in Ukraine. The former defence minister has a wide range of tasks in his new role as secretary of the Security Council that are of great importance to Russia, the spokesman said.

TASS news agency quoted the missile's chief designer Yuri Solomonov as saying its adoption was announced in a decree dated May 7, the same day that President Vladimir Putin began a new six-year term in the Kremlin. Sign up here. Putin has warned the West since the start of the war in Ukraine that direct intervention by NATO troops there could trigger a nuclear conflict. In March he said he did not believe the United States was \"rushing\" towards this, but that Russia's nuclear forces were technically ready . The Bulava was developed under a programme that started in the 1990s, and is designed to be deployed on Russia's Borei-class submarines. Last November, the defence ministry said one of those submarines had successfully test-launched the Bulava, firing it from an underwater position in the White Sea off northern Russia and hitting a target thousands of kilometres away on the Kamchatka peninsula in the far east. TASS said Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets now include seven Borei submarines and each carries 16 Bulavas. Solomonov is chief designer at the Moscow Institute of Thermal Engineering that also developed Russia's Topol-M and Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles. According to the Missile Defense Project at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, the Bulava has a range of 8,300 km (5,160 miles) and a payload of up to 10 multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles or MIRVs, capable of delivering nuclear warheads to different targets.

He identified the emergence of enclaves as a significant migration-related problem in Russia, noting that these enclaves form as migrants gather in specific areas.

A court in Russia has sentenced a man to 25 years in jail for plotting an arson attack against a military recruitment office. Ilya Baburin, 24, was sentenced by a court in Novosibirsk on Monday, on charges including treason. Prosecutors had claimed that he had plotted to burn down the recruitment office in Siberia on instruction from Ukraine in 2022, the year Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour. The prosecutors claimed that the attack, which did not happen, was being planned at the behest of an unidentified person from Ukraine. They accused Baburin of seeking to help the Azov battalion, a branch of the Ukrainian military branded a terror organisation in Russia. Russia saw a wave of arson attacks on army offices after the Kremlin announced an unpopular military mobilisation drive in September 2022, the month Baburin was arrested. The court also found him guilty of setting fire to a local music school, which it categorised as a terrorist act. Rights groups say the sentence is a record length, and stressed that the arson never happened. The Perviy Otdel (First Department) legal association rights group cited his lawyer as saying there was no evidence of Baburin\u2019s involvement in the incidents, in which no casualties were reported. \u201cBaburin does not look like a spy giving out state secrets and did not have or hand out state secrets,\u201d his lawyer Vasily Dubkov said, according to a transcript of a statement delivered in court. Zona Solidarnosti (Solidarity Zone), a Telegram channel that provides information about Russian antiwar activists, quoted Dubkov as saying: \u201cNo, he [Baburin] did not kill, rape or rob anyone. Even according to the indictment, no one was harmed by his actions\u201d. \u201cDoes a person really deserve to spend half his life in a prison or colony for such crimes?\u201d he asked. The court argued that Baburin had \u201ccreated a plan to set the military commissariat in Novosibirsk on fire\u201d. It said he had recruited somebody to throw a Molotov cocktail at the army office but the unnamed person instead reported him to Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB). It alleged that he was acting on Ukrainian orders and that he had \u201cestablished contact\u201d with members of the Azov battalion. The Russian TASS news agency published footage of Baburin in court, smiling inside a glass cage for defendants. \u201cI did not set anything on fire,\u201d he said, according to the independent Dozhd TV channel. Baburin accused the FSB of trying to \u201cgain points\u201d during Moscow\u2019s Ukraine campaign and of \u201cinvestigating absurd crimes\u201d. More than 20,000 people have been detained in Russia for their antiwar stance since the start of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to Russian rights group OVD-Info. Some 900 people have been charged with criminal offences.

Sergei Bobylov\/Pool\/AFP\/Getty Images Hong Kong CNN \u2014 Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in Beijing on Thursday, in a stark show of their growing alignment as Moscow\u2019s troops advance in Ukraine . Putin \u2014 whose delegation includes top defense and security officials \u2014 was welcomed\u00a0by Xi to Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of the Russian president\u2019s two-day state visit . A sweeping joint\u00a0statement released by the two leaders laid out their countries\u2019 alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine, Taiwan and conflict in the Middle East. The visit \u2014 Putin\u2019s symbolic first overseas foray since starting a new term as Russia\u2019s president last week \u2014 is the latest sign of tightening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy friction with the West. The statement proclaimed that China-Russian relations have stood \u201cthe test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,\u201d the two leaders calling each other \u201cpriority partners.\u201d Putin, whose country\u2019s economy has become increasingly reliant on China since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, hailed the countries\u2019 \u201cpractical cooperation\u201d in meetings with Xi, noting their record bilateral trade last year, while stressing the importance of bolstering energy, industrial, and agriculture cooperation, according to Russian state media Tass. Their meeting is Putin and Xi\u2019s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine \u2014 weeks after the two declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. This week\u2019s state visit comes amid mounting international concern about the direction of the war in Ukraine amid delays to aid for Kyiv and as Russia\u2019s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions \u2014 a situation that United States officials have alleged is linked to Chinese support, which Beijing denies. Putin says he and Xi will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening, which are expected to include Russia\u2019s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Kyiv earlier this week to reaffirm the Biden administration\u2019s support for Ukraine after months of Congressional delay in approving American military aid to the embattled country.

White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base \u2014 in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and microelectronics exported from China. Beijing has slammed the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia. Beijing has never condemned Russia\u2019s invasion, rather it claims neutrality in the conflict and has released a vaguely articulated 12-point position on its resolution. Ahead of an expected peace conference in Switzerland next month, Xi has called for peace talks that take both sides\u2019 positions into account. \u201cChina hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role,\u201d Xi said in a joint press appearance with Putin. On Ukraine, Russia said in Thursday\u2019s joint statement that it welcomed the readiness of China \u201cto play a constructive role\u201d in the political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict and that \u201cit is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,\u201d in an apparent allusion to their shared view that NATO is responsible for the conflict in Ukraine.

Zhou Chengfeng\/VCG\/Getty Images Alignment on shared frictions This week\u2019s visit marks the leaders\u2019 43rd meeting in the more than one decade that Xi has been in power. Xi and Putin, known for their close personal chemistry, have steadily expanded their countries\u2019 diplomatic coordination and economic and security cooperation in that time \u2014 as both faced mounting frictions with the US and its allies. Even as Xi seeks to repair frayed relations with Europe and stabilize his country\u2019s ties with the US, he is widely seen as unwilling to sacrifice his partnership with Putin, who the Chinese leader sees as an indispensable partner in reshaping a world order both believe is unfairly dominated by the US and seeking to contain them. This shared worldview was also on show Thursday as Xi, speaking alongside Putin, decried a lingering \u201cCold War mentality,\u201d and said \u201cunilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country\u201d \u2014 using language typical of Beijing and Moscow\u2019s criticisms of the US and its allies. The two leaders said in the joint statement they will \u201cdeepen trust and cooperation\u201d in the military field by expanding the scope of joint exercises and combat training, regularly conducting joint sea and air patrols and improving the \u201ccapabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.\u201d Putin nodded to Xi\u2019s concerns about rising engagement between NATO and like-minded countries in Asia, calling for a \u201creliable and adequate architecture of security in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there will be no place for closed military-political alliances.\u201d \u201cWe think the creation of such alliances to be counterproductive and harmful,\u201d Putin said following meetings Thursday. In the statement, the two countries also expressed \u201cvery deep concern\u201d over what they described as US military activity with allies \u201cthat have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation,\u201d calling the actions \u201cextremely destabilizing.\u201d The two leaders \u201creaffirmed there can be no winners in\u00a0a nuclear war and it should never be fought,\u201d and called for revisions to global security arrangements to prevent military confrontation. Besides engagements in Beijing, which are expected to include a \u201cgala\u201d marking the two countries\u2019 75 years of diplomatic ties, Putin is also expected to attend trade and cooperation forums in Harbin, the capital of China\u2019s northeastern Heilongjiang province bordering Russia\u2019s Far East. The region is historically a site of long-simmering border tensions between the two neighbors, which erupted in conflict between China and the Soviet Union in 1969. It has seen increasing connectivity with parts of Russia\u2019s Far East in recent years. Putin is also expected to meet with the students and faculty of the Harbin Institute of Technology, a university sanctioned by the US government in 2020 for its alleged role in procuring items for China\u2019s military.

A Soyuz rocket blasted off from Russia\u2019s Plesetsk launch site, about 800km (500 miles) north of Moscow, on Thursday, deploying in low Earth orbit at least nine satellites, including COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military \u201cinspector\u201d spacecraft US officials have long condemned as exhibiting reckless space behaviour. \u201cWe have observed nominal activity and assess it is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\u201d a spokesperson for US Space Command, part of the US Department of Defense, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cRussia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\u201d it said. COSMOS 2576 resembles previously deployed counterspace payloads from 2019 and 2022, the statement added, referring to past Russian tactics of deploying satellites close to sensitive US spy satellites. US intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a US official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits. \u201cThis mix of military and civilian payloads was totally unexpected. Never seen that before on a Russian launch,\u201d said Bart Hendrickx, an analyst tracking Russia\u2019s space programme. On Wednesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov denied the US assertion, saying Moscow opposed the deployment of weapons in orbit, Russia\u2019s TASS and Interfax news agencies reported. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\u201d he said. Ryabkov said Russia was still complying with quantitative restrictions on nuclear weapons set by the New START treaty between Moscow and Washington. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia acted in full accordance with international law. \u201cWe are not violating anything. We have repeatedly advocated a ban on the deployment of any weapons into space.\u201d The Russian satellite launched in 2019 ejected an object into space and closely followed a satellite from the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), an intelligence agency overseeing spy satellites. As of Tuesday, COSMOS 2576 had not gone near a US satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in 2021. The Russian satellite appears to be trailing USA 314\u2019s orbital path at a faster speed, suggesting the two will eventually come into closer proximity, according to a review by the Reuters news agency of orbital data in Space Command\u2019s public satellite catalogue. The satellite was deployed as the US alleges Russia to be developing a space-based nuclear weapon capable of destroying entire networks of satellites. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in February that Moscow had no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space, insisting that his country has only developed space capabilities similar to those of the US. US officials believe Russia has launched at least one satellite, COSMOS 2553, related to its nuclear space weapon programme, according to officials familiar with the intelligence. However, US officials have said Russia has not deployed a nuclear weapon in space. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has shrouded much of its space activities in secrecy and threatened to attack US satellites aiding the Ukrainian defence, such as SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, a network of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit that provide internet service. The US and Russia have been sparring in the United Nations Security Council over satellite weapons. In 2020, Russia dismissed accusations from the US and the United Kingdom that it had tested an antisatellite weapon in space as \u201cpropaganda\u201d. At the time, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs insisted on Moscow\u2019s \u201ccommitment to obligations on the nondiscriminatory use and study of space with peaceful aims\u201d.

(Image credit: Fatih Aktas\/Anadolu via Getty Images) The United Nations Security Council has voted against a resolution introduced by Russia and China that would ban member states from placing weapons of any kind in outer space. This isn't the first time these two countries have suggested such an idea. In late April, the United States and Japan introduced a resolution of their own that sought specifically to ban the deployment of weapons of mass destruction; at the time, Russia and China introduced an amendment to this resolution that had similar tones to their recent resolution that's been struck down. That Russian-Chinese amendment sought to \"prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space, and the threat of use of force in outer space.\" Votes were counted for the American-Japanese resolution last month; 13 countries voted \"yes,\" while China abstained and Russia voted \"no.\" The resolution was ultimately vetoed. The latest Russian-Chinese resolution, introduced on May 20 and now shot down as well, was largely the same as the one vetoed in April. However, it also proactively included the amendment these countries proposed for the previous one. When voting on this new resolution, seven countries voted in favor, seven voted against, and one \u2014 Switzerland \u2014 abstained.

Neither the capabilities nor the intended mission of the Russian satellite, known as Cosmos 2576, are known, according to SpaceNews . But observers have noted that it appears to be in the same orbit as USA 314, believed to be a spy satellite , according to satellite tracker Marco Langbroek.

The arrest of Lt. Gen. Vadim Shamarin followed the arrest earlier in the week of Maj. Gen. Ivan Popov, a former top commander in Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine, also on bribery charges. In April, Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov was arrested for bribery. Ivanov was a close associate of Sergei Shoigu, whom President Vladimir Putin dismissed as defense minister soon after Putin\u2019s inauguration to a new term in May. Lt. Gen. Yury Kuznetsov, head of the Defense Ministry\u2019s personnel directorate, was arrested on bribery charges two days after Shoigu was replaced. Shamarin, the latest officer to be arrested, is also the head of the Defense Ministry\u2019s main communications directorate. He is being held in custody for two months, Russian news agencies cited a military garrison court as saying, but other details of the case were not reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the wave of arrests of defense officials did not indicate a campaign against the military.

White-haired Maslov, 77, stood in a glass box in the St Petersburg courtroom and listened attentively without showing emotion, as the judge read the verdict after a trial that was closed to the press. He had protested his innocence. Sign up here. Maslov is one of three scientists from the same Siberian institute , all specialists in hypersonics, who have been arrested since 2022 on treason charges. The other two, Alexander Shiplyuk and Valery Zvegintsev, are awaiting trial. The trio, and a number of other scientists accused in similar cases, had conducted theoretical work in areas relevant to the development of hypersonic missiles - cutting-edge weapons capable of carrying payloads at up to 10 times the speed of sound to punch through air-defence systems. President Vladimir Putin has said repeatedly that Russia is a world leader in these weapons, which it has acknowledged using in the Ukraine war. Lawyer Yevgeny Smirnov of Pervy Otdel (First Department), an association that specialises in defending people in cases of treason and espionage, said the charges against all the accused scientists were similar - divulging information considered a state secret while participating in an international conference or research. \"Any conviction against Maslov is a gross violation of the law,\" he said. \"I am sure that Maslov is not guilty of the acts accused of him and is a victim of the policies of the Russian authorities.\" SHOCKED BY SENTENCE Maslov's lawyer Olga Dinze told reporters her client, who has serious heart problems, was shocked by the sentence but was \"holding firm\" and would appeal. She described him as a man who lived modestly and had dedicated his life to Russian science, turning down numerous invitations to leave the country and join a western university. In a rare open letter published last year, colleagues at the Siberian institute said Maslov, Shiplyuk and Zvegintsev were innocent and the scientific papers they had published or presented to international conferences had been vetted to ensure they did not include restricted information. They said the cases were having a chilling effect on Russian academia and making it impossible for scientists to do their jobs. In response, the Kremlin said at the time that the men faced \"very serious accusations\" and their cases were a matter for the security services. Maslov's lawyer Dinze said Maslov had come under investigation after a defendant in another case testified against him in return for a shorter sentence of seven years. She was apparently referring to the jailing of Alexander Kuranov , another scientist in the same field, who was sentenced last month. Dinze said the spate of arrests of top Russian academics by the FSB security service was regretful and ironic at a time when Putin was speaking of the need to invest in Russian science. \"Maybe the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing,\" she said. Smirnov of Pervy Otdel told Reuters: \"It is obvious that the persecution of scientists is an exclusively political step by the Russian authorities, by which they seek to show that intelligence services around the world are trying to steal the secrets of Russian weapons.\" Smirnov said the detained scientists were not working directly on weapons, but studying physical processes associated with high speeds. The so-called secrets they had passed on were \"openly published and available to anyone\", he said.

However, following comments made by Baltic members of NATO, including Finland and Lithuania, the ministry retracts the proposal.","text":"Baltic concerns over Russian plan to move sea borders 22 May 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby BBC News Share Save Finnish Gulf Coast Guard Finland shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border with Russia, including the Gulf of Finland There have been calls for calm in Finland and the Baltic states after a draft Russian decree proposed revising its borders in the Baltic Sea. Latvia said it was trying to clarify the situation, but Lithuania warned that the Kremlin was aiming to intimidate its neighbours with a \"deliberate, targeted escalatory provocation\". Finnish President Alexander Stubb said political leaders were watching the situation closely and Helsinki \"acts as always: calmly and based on facts\". The draft Russian defence ministry decree suggested moving the sea borders around Russian islands in the Gulf of Finland and around the exclave of Kaliningrad. The decree was first highlighted on Tuesday, when Russia's Tass news agency and other media reported on its proposal to redraw old borders dating back to the Soviet era in January 1985. It was not immediately clear if the draft proposed extending its borders into Finnish waters in the Baltic or Lithuanian waters near Kaliningrad. However, it would have included territory in the eastern Gulf of Finland, several islands close to the Finnish coast and areas near the two cities of Baltiysk and Zelenogradsk in Kaliningrad. Finland and the Baltic states are all members of the EU and Nato and the military alliance is committed to defending their borders. Finland's defence and foreign committees held emergency meetings on Wednesday and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said the political leadership was \"monitoring the situation closely\". \"Right now I don't see any reason for greater concern,\" he said. The Russian proposals were no longer visible on Wednesday with only the message \"draft deleted\" remaining on the page. A Russian source later told Tass and other news agencies there were no plans to revise Russia's territorial waters in the Baltic. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred all enquiries to the defence ministry, pointing out that \"there is nothing political here\", while making the point that the political situation had changed since the 1980s: \"You can see the level of confrontation, especially in the Baltic region.\" Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs said the Russian plan was clearly trying to appear as a bureaucratic, technical exercise. But it was also a very typical Russian approach of \"probe everywhere and then if you get pushback, say it was nothing\". Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on X that it was \"an obvious escalation against Nato and the EU and must be met with an appropriately firm response\". The Russian revelations also coincided with a call for vigilance from Sweden's armed forces chief, Gen Micael Byden. \"Putin's goal is to gain control of the Baltic Sea,\" he told Germany's RND website . \"The Baltic Sea must not become Putin's playground where he can strike fear into Nato members.\" Sweden joined Nato in March, becoming the alliance's 32nd member, and it has beefed up its military presence on the Baltic island of Gotland in the past two years.

Alexander Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack. Kyiv has dismissed the allegation as absurd. Sign up here. \"The investigation is ongoing, but it is already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,\" state news agency TASS quoted Bortnikov as saying. Four attackers gunned down concertgoers at the Crocus City Hall near Moscow on March 22 and then set fire to the venue, in the deadliest attack in Russia for 20 years. While pointing the finger at Ukraine, Bortnikov also said, according to Russian news agencies, that the preparation, financing, the actual attack and the attempted flight of the gunmen were coordinated over the internet by Islamic State Khorasan, the Afghan branch of the militant group. Andriy Yusov, spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence agency, said on national television on Thursday: \"Russian propaganda did not forget about the Crocus story. It will continue trying to promote the absurd point about Ukraine's alleged complicity even though it can't stand up to any criticism and it's completely illogical.\" The suspects held by Russia include the four suspected gunmen, all citizens of Tajikistan, whose detention was extended last week until Aug. 22.

{"year":"2024","month":"05","event_desc":"The European Union allows Ukraine to use interest funds from frozen Russian bank accounts, totaling \u20ac2.5 billion ($2.7 billion) per year.","text":"Ukraine wants to use $300bn in Russian central bank money held abroad to defeat it; Europe isn\u2019t enthusiastic. A landmark EU decision this week\u00a0to send Ukraine the interest earned by hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian central bank accounts on its territory is adding urgency to a debate over what will happen to those accounts. The difference between the two sums is enormous. Ukraine wants to use the estimated 210 billion euros ($228bn) of Russian central bank money held in European institutions to defeat Russia on the battlefield. The EU froze those assets in February 2022, immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine. Another 50 billion euros ($54bn) are frozen around the world. \u201cIf the world has $300bn, why not use it?\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said. After years of debate, the bloc decided on Tuesday to allow Ukraine to use just the interest earned by those accounts, which the EU believes would amount to about 2.5 to 3 billion euros ($2.7bn-$3.3bn) a year. \u201cThis decision was the result of a lot of discussion and soul-searching,\u201d an EU diplomatic source familiar with Ukrainian issues told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. International legal experts agree it is a big step. \u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for the freezing of assets on this scale, and therefore the issue of what to do with the interest was never this acute,\u201d Anton Moiseienko, a lecturer in international law at Australian National University, told Al Jazeera. \u201cIn this sense, new ground is being broken.\u201d  The EU decision is to tap the interest twice a year and send it to Ukraine in the form of cash and weapons. This money is over and above weapons EU members have already contributed, or plan to contribute through bilateral agreements, European Commission sources told Al Jazeera. It is also separate from the 12.5 billion euros ($13.6bn) a year in financial assistance they have pledged for the next four years. A first payment is to be made in July, representing interest earned since February, when the EU ordered financial institutions to separate profits from the principal. The institutions will keep any interest earned between February 2022 and February 2024, possibly for reconstruction purposes, European Commission sources said. But what about the rest? \u201cRight now it doesn\u2019t seem as though the EU is in any way prepared to move on to a discussion about using the principal for Ukraine,\u201d the diplomatic source said. \u201cThere are European institutions that are against it and a lot of member states that are against it. The EU doesn\u2019t want to risk its reputation and its prosperity.\u201d The European Central Bank has been especially vocal about leaving other central banks\u2019 assets alone, worried about reputational damage to the euro. And some EU members like Hungary and Slovakia maintain strong economic ties with Russia and have made known their unease about alienating Moscow. That leaves matters on a plateau, said Moiseienko. \u201cIt is a placeholder, an intermediate step. But a placeholder for what?\u201d Moiseienko said. \u201cTransfer of those assets to Ukraine, or continue in this wait-and-see game? In terms of the overall direction of travel, it\u2019s very unclear.\u201d \u201cThe EU keeps saying that Russia must pay but keeps taking steps that prevent that from happening,\u201d he added.    The EU could be testing the waters for international reactions to its first move. Philippa Webb, a professor of international law at King\u2019s College London, said that Russia had a clear obligation under the law to pay Ukraine reparations for launching an aggressive war against it, but it also enjoyed immunity from most forms of enforcement. But that immunity was not absolute, she advised the European Parliament in a research paper last February. It is just a question of finding the right legal avenue to seizing the entire principal \u2013 something that would break new legal ground. Over the past two years, several ideas have been presented. One approach is to issue a loan using the Russian assets as collateral, but it would amount to much less than the assets. Another is to use a legal concept known as countermeasures, whereby a country takes a step normally considered unlawful, such as seizing sovereign assets, but is justified as a response to a previous unlawful action by the other state. In this case, Russia\u2019s unlawful act was to wage a war of aggression, against the statutes of the United Nations Charter and its recognition of Ukraine\u2019s borders in 1991. More ambitiously, the United Nations could vote to lift Russia\u2019s immunity from enforcement, creating a new international legal standard. That would require a large majority in the General Assembly, legal experts believe. Shortly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, 141 out of 193 UNGA members demanded a Russian withdrawal, marking a high point of empathy with Ukraine. As Al Jazeera has reported, Ukraine has been unable to recreate that majority to indict Russian President Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression, and it is unlikely the world would show a greater appetite for remaking international law to seize Russian assets. The EU has invited Ukraine to become a future member, and therefore assumes the greatest responsibility for its reconstruction, pointed out political scientist Theodoros Tsikas. Unwillingness or inability to harness an aggressor\u2019s assets would not only be perceived as weakness \u2013 it would not match up to the EU\u2019s claim to uphold the rule of law, he said. \u201cThe reconstruction of Ukraine and the healing of its wounds is seen as a key task for the EU,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cLike all aggressors, Russia will have to pay war reparations to Ukraine,\u201d Tsikas said. How that happens without global enthusiasm is now the subject of an intensifying debate.

Azarov and Komarova\u2019s back-to-back resignations are seen as regular cadre changes ahead of those races. news Governor of Russia\u2019s Oil-Rich Khanty-Mansi Region Resigns Ahead of Elections Read more Political analysts were widely expecting Azarov\u2019s removal as governor in the near term given his conflicts with both regional and federal officials, namely with lower-house State Duma lawmaker\u00a0Alexander Khinshtein, whose constituency is in the Samara region. Like Komarova, who was accused by pro-war activists of \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the Russian military for saying \u201cwe didn\u2019t need\u201d to invade Ukraine in 2022, Azarov\u2019s seven-year tenure as governor was plagued by local scandals. In 2021, his Instagram account was temporarily blocked after a young woman posted a selfie with him on a private jet with the caption \u201cI love him.\u201d The woman claimed that the photo was \u201cmade as a joke,\u201d according to the Kommersant business daily. Following the start of his second term in office last year, authorities charged two senior members of Azarov\u2019s administration with corruption. Two more senior Samara region officials have been reportedly arrested in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Azarov was accused of falsely identifying a local official as a \u201cconcerned resident\u201d who was lobbying to cut down a forest and build a road. Putin later on Friday named former Tula region Deputy Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev as Azarov\u2019s replacement. Kommersant, citing anonymous officials in the Samara region, reported that the former governor has not yet received a new job offer in government, while law enforcement sources suggested Azarov may soon be targeted in a criminal investigation.

A Berlin spokesman said Germany was convinced Ukraine had the right to defend itself from Russia, especially from cross-border attacks on its second largest city Kharkiv. US officials said American-supplied weapons could be used to counter Russian fire near the Kharkiv region, either where Russian forces were \"hitting them or preparing to hit them\". Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the decision would help protect civilians living in villages close to the Russian border. Biden allows Ukraine to hit some targets in Russia with US weapons Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Nato countries, especially the US and several European countries, had \"entered a new round of escalating tension and they are doing this deliberately\", in remarks quoted by the Tass news agency. \"They are in every possible way provoking Ukraine to continue this senseless war.\" Russian forces have made gains in the Kharkiv region in recent weeks after a surprise offensive in the area, close to the border with Russia. The UK and France had already signalled they were open to easing restrictions on Ukraine striking military sites on Russian territory, before US President Joe Biden said on Thursday night that American-supplied weapons could be used. However a US official told the BBC: \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of Army Tactical Missile System [ATACMS] or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed.\u201d German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Friday that Berlin was \"jointly convinced\" that Ukraine had the right to defend itself from Russian attack. \"To do this, it can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations; including those supplied by us,\" he said. Germany has not yet given Ukraine its powerful Taurus missiles, whereas the UK has provided Storm Shadow missiles and France has handed over its Scalp cruise missiles. Russia claimed on Friday that it had pushed Ukrainian forces back by up to 9km (6 miles) from the border in the Kharkiv region, adding that it now controlled hills near the village of Lyptsi. Kharkiv is little more than 30km from the Russian border. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated his message from earlier this week, that the US would continue doing what it had done until now, \"which is, as necessary, adapt and adjust\". He was speaking to reporters at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague, where the alliance's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine's use of weapons. Questions have also been raised by Nato allies about the possibility of US-made F-16 warplanes being deployed across the Russian border. Ukrainian pilots have been training on F-16s in recent months and the first planes are expected to reach Ukraine this summer. Denmark's Defence Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, has said that its F-16s could be used to target weapons depots in Russia which he described as legitimate targets. Denmark is due to hand over 19 F-16s to Ukraine over the summer and Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen made clear: \"This is not a carte blanche for Ukraine to use the F-16 to make arbitrary attacks into Russia.\" On Friday Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen refused to confirm that Danish F-16s could be used over Russian territory. She said the planes were very close to flying over Ukraine, but \"we are not going to go into further detail\". The Netherlands has avoided making any clear declaration on F-16s. Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot merely confirmed that the Dutch government would \"allow Ukraine to use arms on Russian soil if it's in full self-defence\", in line with the United Nations charter. Belgium's Alexander De Croo ruled out allowing Ukraine to use its F-16s over Russia when he met President Zelensky earlier this week. Mr De Croo was meeting President Biden at the White House on Friday. Russian officials have made clear their anger at the prospect of F-16s being used over their territory. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that F-16s would be destroyed just like anything else supplied by Nato, and would not change the situation at all. However, as F-16s had long been used in Nato's \"so-called joint nuclear missions\", he warned that supplying them to Kyiv could only be seen \"as a deliberate signal from Nato concerning nuclear weapons\".

Lavrov has made a series of visits to Africa since the start of the war in Ukraine as Russia, hit by Western sanctions, seeks new trade partners and tries to rally developing countries behind its vision of a \"multipolar world\" no longer dominated by the United States and former European colonial powers. Growing Russian security ties with Africa, including countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger where military leaders have seized power in coups, are a source of concern to the U.S. and other Western governments.

Stringer \/ AFP Russian peacekeepers on Wednesday completed their withdrawal from the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Baku recaptured last year from Armenian separatists, officials in Baku said. Azerbaijan and Armenia had fought two wars\u00a0\u2014 first from 1988 to 1994 and then again in 2020\u00a0\u2014 for control of the then-breakaway enclave. \"The process of the full withdrawal of the manpower, weapons, and equipment of Russia's peacekeeping contingent [in Karabakh] from Azerbaijan was completed on June 12,\" Azerbaijan\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers had been stationed in Karabakh, in accordance with a ceasefire agreement between Yerevan and Baku, signed in November 2020. The Russian troops had a mandate to remain until 2025, but Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine is putting pressure on the country\u2019s armed forces. The withdrawal, which began in April, had been agreed between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev. news A Life in One Suitcase\u0589 The Karabakh Armenians Who Continued Onward to Russia Read more Last September, Baku took over the territory in a lightning offensive that triggered a refugee crisis. Almost the entire local population of around 100,000 ethnic Armenians left for Armenia, fearing reprisals and repression. The peacekeeping contingent did not intervene. The territory is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan despite historically being home to a majority Armenian population. It was controlled by pro-Yerevan separatists for nearly three decades. The conflict has seen ties sour between traditional allies Russia and Armenia, with Yerevan accusing the Kremlin of failing to protect it in the face of a security threat from Azerbaijan. After the loss of Karabakh, Yerevan has sought to forge new security alliances by deepening ties with the West. On Tuesday, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan and the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia James O'Brien issued a joint statement saying Washington and Yerevan have agreed to \"upgrade the status of our bilateral dialogue to a Strategic Partnership Commission\". Last month, Yerevan returned to Azerbaijan four frontier villages that it had captured in the 1990s. The move, which Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has defended as aimed at securing a definitive peace deal with Baku, sparked a wave of mass protests in Armenia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more territory. Putin\u2019s remarks came as Switzerland prepared to host scores of world leaders -- but not from Moscow -- this weekend to try to map out first steps toward peace in Ukraine. They also coincided with a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Italy and after the U.S. and Ukraine this week signed a 10-year security agreement that Russian officials, including Putin, denounced as \u201cnull and void.\u201d Putin blasted the Switzerland conference as \u201cjust another ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention, reverse the cause and effect of the Ukrainian crisis (and) set the discussion on the wrong track.\u201d His demands came in a speech at the Russian Foreign Ministry and was aimed at what he called a \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of the conflict rather than \u201cfreezing it,\u201d and stressed the Kremlin is \u201cready to start negotiations without delay.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Polish foreign minister denounces Russian aggression: \u2018Don\u2019t you have enough land?\u2019 Trump says Zelenskyy is prolonging war in Ukraine by resisting calls to cede Crimea to Russia Zelenskyy pushes back on ceding Ukrainian land in potential peace deal ahead of London talks Broader demands for peace that Putin listed included Ukraine\u2019s recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, keeping the country\u2019s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population. All of these should be part of \u201cfundamental international agreements,\u201d and all Western sanctions against Russia should be lifted, Putin said. \u201cWe\u2019re urging to turn this tragic page of history and to begin restoring, step-by-step, the unity between Russia and Ukraine and in Europe in general,\u201d he said. Putin\u2019s remarks, made to a group of somber Foreign Ministry officials and some senior lawmakers, represented a rare occasion in which he clearly laid out his conditions for ending the war in Ukraine, but it didn\u2019t include any new demands. The Kremlin has said before that Kyiv should recognize its territorial gains and drop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in Italy for the G7 meeting, said Putin\u2019s proposal was not new and was in the form of an \u201cultimatum,\u201d comparing it to actions by Adolf Hitler in seizing territory that led to World War II. \u201cWhat Putin demands is to give them a part of our territories, those occupied and not occupied, talking about several regions of our country,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry called Putin\u2019s plan \u201cmanipulative,\u201d \u201cabsurd\u201d and designed to \u201cmislead the international community, undermine diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a just peace, and split the unity of the world majority around the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.\u201d Besides seeking to join NATO, Ukraine wants Russian forces out of its territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that was illegally annexed in 2014; the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity; and that Russia be held accountable for war crimes and for Moscow to pay reparations to Kyiv. Russia launched its a full-scale invasion in February 2022. After Ukrainian forces thwarted a Russian drive to the capital, much of the fighting has focused in the south and east, where Moscow illegally annexed four regions, although it doesn\u2019t fully control any of them. Zelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on social media there was nothing new from Putin and that the Russian leader \u201cvoiced only the \u2018standard aggressor\u2019s set,\u2019 which has been heard many times already.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak wrote on X. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that Putin \u201chas illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory. He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace.\u201d Austin added that Putin \u201cstarted this war with no provocation. He could end it today if he chose to do that.\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg added that \u201cthis is not a peace proposal. This is a proposal of more aggression, more occupation, and it demonstrates in a way that that Russia\u2019s aim is to control Ukraine.\u201d Putin insisted that Kyiv should withdraw from all four annexed regions entirely and essentially cede them to Moscow within their administrative borders. In Zaporizhzhia in the southeast, Russia still doesn\u2019t control the region\u2019s administrative capital with a pre-war population of about 700,000; in the neighboring Kherson region, Moscow withdrew from its biggest city and capital of the same name in November 2022. Putin said if \u201cKyiv and Western capitals\u201d reject his offer, \u201cit is their business, their political and moral responsibility for continuing the bloodshed.\u201d The Kremlin has repeatedly aired its readiness for peace talks with Kyiv and blamed the West for undermining its efforts to end the conflict. Putin went further Friday and claimed his troops never intended to storm Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, even though they approached the city. \u201cIn essence, it was nothing other than an operation to force the Ukrainian regime to peace. The troops were there to push the Ukrainian side to negotiate, to try and find an acceptable solution,\u201d he said. Moscow withdrew from Kyiv in March 2022 and described it a goodwill gesture as peace talks between the two began, but the pullback took place amid fierce Ukrainian resistance that significantly slowed down Russia\u2019s battlefield advances. Putin also claimed that in that same month, he told a foreign official he wasn\u2019t ruling out withdrawing forces from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and ceding occupied parts of them back to Ukraine, as long as Kyiv allowed Russia to have a \u201cstrong land connection\u201d to Crimea. He said the official planned on bringing that proposal to Kyiv \u2014 which Moscow \u201cwelcomed,\u201d as it generally welcomed \u201cattempts to find a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\u201d But the Kremlin then annexed both regions, along with the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, citing the results of sham \u201creferendums\u201d it staged there. Putin mentioned those and said, \u201cThe matter is closed forever and is no longer up for discussion.\u201d In Friday\u2019s fighting, Russian defenses shot down 87 Ukrainian drones, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said, most of them launched against the Rostov region, home to Russia\u2019s southern military command, but no deaths or damage were reported in one of the biggest Ukrainian drone barrages of the war . In Russia\u2019s Belgorod region on the border, part of a residential building collapsed in the town of Shebekino after Ukrainian shelling, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Three people were injured, he said. Ukraine\u2019s military has been on the back foot in recent months, with its troops outnumbered by the Kremlin\u2019s forces and running short of ammunition and weaponry due to delays in promised Western military aid. Russia has battered Ukraine with drones, especially its power grid. It fired 14 missiles and 17 Shahed drones overnight, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Air defense systems downed all the drones as well as seven missiles, it said. The attacks injured six people in the Donetsk region, where residential buildings were hit, officials said. A Russian drone struck a bus near the village of Esman in the northern Sumy region, injuring three women. Authorities say 20 passengers were in the bus at the time. Also Friday, Russia returned to Ukraine the bodies of 254 of its soldiers, Kyiv said. Once identified, the bodies will be returned to relatives, according to Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War \u2014- Associated Press writers Jim Heintz in Tallinn, Samya Kullab and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Barry Hatton in Lisbon, Portugal, contributed. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine DASHA LITVINOVA Litvinova is an Associated Press correspondent covering Russia, Belarus, Central Asia and the Caucasus.

The arrest was announced just as France hosted world leaders on the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday. Russia wasn\u2019t invited. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said the suspect, whom it didn\u2019t identify, is accused of failing to register with authorities as a foreign agent while collecting \u201cinformation about military and military-technical activities of the Russian Federation.\u201d It added that the information could be used to the detriment of the country\u2019s security. Russia\u2019s state news agency Tass identified the arrested French citizen as Laurent Vinatier, an employee of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), a Geneva-based nongovernment organization. HD confirmed Vinatier\u2019s detention in a statement released to The Associated Press. \u201cWe are aware that Laurent Vinatier, an adviser at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), has been detained in Russia,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are working to get more details of the circumstances and to secure Laurent\u2019s release.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Georgian-Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, known for his gigantic and controversial work, dies at 91 Countries shore up their digital defenses as global tensions raise the threat of cyberwarfare How war, money and the quest for discovery entwined the US government and universities French President Emmanuel Macron told French television Thursday night that the French citizen was \u201cin no way...working for France\u201d and that he \u201cworks for a Swiss NGO founded by former UN chief Kofi Annan and which carries out diplomacy of working discussions.\u2033 He is receiving consular protection, Macron said. Vinatier\u2019s LinkedIn page, which describes him as a \u201cconversationalist,\u201d says he has worked for the center for over a decade and indicates that he has had a focus mostly on former Soviet republics, Turkey and the Middle East over the years. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee posted a video showing officers detaining the suspect at a cafe and driving him to the committee\u2019s Moscow offices for interrogation. The charges carry a penalty of up to five years in prison. The arrest comes during a strain in Russian-French ties that followed French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s statements about the possibility of deploying the country\u2019s troops in Ukraine . Moscow has warned that French soldiers would be legitimate targets for Russia if they are sent to Ukraine. The charges against the French citizen are based on a recently approved law that requires anyone who collects information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other newly endorsed legislation as part of a multi-pronged Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to muzzle criticism of its actions in Ukraine. Arrests on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Recent high-profile arrests include Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested on espionage charges in March 2023, and U.S.-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who was taken into custody in October 2023 for failing to register as a \u201cforeign agent.\u201d __ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.","question":"What charges did the Russian Investigative Committee bring against the French citizen arrested in Moscow in June 2024?","answer":"The French citizen was accused of failing to register as a foreign agent while collecting information on Russia's military and military-technical activities.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future information.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"Germany vetoes a European Union sanction package that would prevent EU members from re-exporting Russian liquefied natural gas from EU ports and prevent EU companies from selling sanctioned products to Russia.","text":"This audio is created with AI assistance European Union countries failed to approve a new sanctions package targeting the Russian gas industry after German authorities intervened to block the deal at the last minute. The measures would have banned EU member states from re-exporting Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) from EU ports and financing planned Arctic and Baltic LNG terminals. German officials reportedly expressed concern about an expanded measure that would force EU companies to guarantee their customers cannot go on to sell sanctioned goods to Russia. This restriction previously only applied to firearms, military equipment, and dual-use goods with both a military and civilian application. Berlin is concerned that the expansion of this measure to non-dual-use civilian products, such as chemicals or metalworking equipment, could harm German small businesses. Belgium was forced to split talks on the new sanctions package into two separate discussions following Germany's opposition to new sanctions against Belarus. Both France and Germany opposed EU sanctions on Belarus , which were introduced to close a trade loophole that has allowed Russia to import luxury cars and other banned goods produced in Western countries. This latest package would have been the 14th round of EU sanctions against Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. An anonymous source told Politico that the European Commission is now working with the German chancellery to convince Berlin to lift the veto. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin has become Ukraine's second-largest military donor after the U.S. , although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles . FT: US proposes $50 billion Ukraine loan conditional on EU extending sanctions against Russia until end of war The U.S. has proposed that a $50 billion loan to Ukraine could be repaid by profits from frozen Russian assets, on the condition that the EU agrees to extend sanctions against Russia until the end of the war, the Financial Times reported on June 5, citing a leaked EU discussion paper.

The measures would have banned EU member states from re-exporting Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) from EU ports and financing planned Arctic and Baltic LNG terminals. German officials reportedly expressed concern about an expanded measure that would force EU companies to guarantee their customers cannot go on to sell sanctioned goods to Russia. This restriction previously only applied to firearms, military equipment, and dual-use goods with both a military and civilian application. Berlin is concerned that the expansion of this measure to non-dual-use civilian products, such as chemicals or metalworking equipment, could harm German small businesses. Belgium was forced to split talks on the new sanctions package into two separate discussions following Germany's opposition to new sanctions against Belarus. Both France and Germany opposed EU sanctions on Belarus , which were introduced to close a trade loophole that has allowed Russia to import luxury cars and other banned goods produced in Western countries. This latest package would have been the 14th round of EU sanctions against Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. An anonymous source told Politico that the European Commission is now working with the German chancellery to convince Berlin to lift the veto. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin has become Ukraine's second-largest military donor after the U.S. , although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles .

A powerful storm rumbled through the Russian capital on Thursday afternoon, carrying heavy rains and winds that ripped hundreds of trees from the ground and killed at least two people, local authorities said. Russia\u2019s Emergency Services Ministry said a man was killed near Park Dubki in northern Moscow when wind gusts of around 18-23 meters per second uprooted a tree that then crushed him. State media later reported a second person had been killed during the storm, which meteorologists said was brought in by a strong cold front, while at least 10 others were injured . Videos shared on social media showed people in Moscow running for cover as the storm ripped through city streets, tossing loose debris into the sky and flooding some roadways.

Both leaders described it as a major upgrade of their relations, covering security, trade, investment and cultural and humanitarian ties. The two met as Putin visited North Korea for the first time in 24 years. The summit came as the U.S. and its allies express growing concerns over a possible arms arrangement in which the country provides Moscow with badly needed munitions for its war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile program. Kim said the two countries had a \u201cfiery friendship,\u201d and that the deal was the \u201cstrongest ever treaty\u201d between them, putting the relationship at the level of an alliance. He vowed full support for Russia 's war in Ukraine. Putin said that it was a \u201cbreakthrough document\u201d reflecting shared desire to move relations to a higher level.

Try again 06:27 North Korea and the former Soviet Union signed a treaty in 1961, which experts say necessitated Moscow\u2019s military intervention if the North came under an attack. The deal was discarded after the collapse of the USSR, replaced by a pact in 2000 that offered weaker security assurances. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the new deal provides a similar level of protection as the 1961 treaty. Kim gave Putin a lavish welcome, meeting him at the airport, where the two shook hands, hugged twice and rode together in a limousine. The huge motorcade rolled through the capital\u2019s brightly lit streets, where buildings were decorated with giant Russian flags and portraits of Putin. After spending the night at a state guest house, Putin was welcomed in a ceremony at the city\u2019s main square, filled with what appeared to be tens of thousands of spectators, including children with balloons and people wearing coordinated T-shirts in the red, white and blue national colors of both countries. Huge crowds lined the streets, chanting \u201cWelcome Putin\u201d and waving flowers and North Korean and Russian flags. Putin and Kim saluted an honor guard and walked across a red carpet. Kim introduced key members of his leadership including Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui; top aide and ruling party secretary Jo Yong Won; and the leader\u2019s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong . As the talks began, Putin thanked Kim for North Korea\u2019s support in Ukraine, part of what he said was a \u201cfight against the imperialist hegemonistic policies of the U.S. and its satellites against the Russian Federation.\u201d Putin hailed ties that he traced back to the Soviet army fighting the Japanese military on the Korean Peninsula at the end of World War II, and Moscow\u2019s support for Pyongyang during the Korean War. What kind of support was promised in the agreement was not spelled out. Kim has used similar language in the past, consistently saying North Korea supports what he describes as a just action to protect Russia\u2019s interests and blaming the crisis on the U.S.-led West\u2019s \u201chegemonic policy.\u201d Read more Putin vows 'indivisible security in Eurasia' ahead of North Korea visit North Korea is under heavy U.N. Security Council sanctions over its weapons program, while Russia also faces sanctions by the United States and its Western partners over its aggression in Ukraine. U.S. and South Korean officials accuse the North of providing Russia with artillery, missiles and other military equipment for use in Ukraine, possibly in return for key military technologies and aid. On Tuesday, a U.S. State Department spokesman said that in recent months, Washington has seen North Korea \u201cunlawfully transfer dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to aid Russia\u2019s war effort.\u201d Both Pyongyang and Moscow deny accusations of weapons transfers, which would violate multiple U.N. Security Council sanctions that Russia previously endorsed. Along with China, Russia has provided political cover for Kim\u2019s efforts to advance his nuclear arsenal, repeatedly blocking U.S.-led efforts to impose fresh U.N. sanctions on the North over its weapons tests. In March, a Russian veto at the United Nations ended monitoring of U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, prompting Western accusations that Moscow is seeking to avoid scrutiny as it buys weapons from Pyongyang. Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Pyongyang that the leaders exchanged gifts after the talks. Putin presented Kim with a Russian-made Aurus limousine and other gifts, including a tea set and a naval officer\u2019s dagger. Ushakov said Kim's presents to Putin included artwork depicting the Russian leader. Russia media said Kim would give a reception for Putin before he leaves for Vietnam . In addition to security, Putin said the partnership includes cooperation in political, trade, investment, cultural and humanitarian fields. He added that Russia would not rule out developing military-technical cooperation with North Korea under the deal. According to the Kremlin\u2019s website, they also signed an agreement on building a road bridge on their border, and another on cooperation in health care, medical education and science. Kim was quoted as saying the agreement \"will become a driving force accelerating the creation of a new multipolar world.\u201d In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea illustrates how Russia tries, \u201cin desperation, to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine.\u201d Koo Byoungsam, spokesperson of South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the Seoul government was still interpreting the results of the summit, including what Russia's response might be if the North comes under attack. China is North Korea\u2019s biggest ally and economic lifeline, accounting for most of the country\u2019s trade. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said high-level exchanges between Moscow and Pyongyang are \u201cbilateral arrangements between two sovereign states,\u201d without giving a specific assessment of the agreements. Sam Greene of the Center for European Policy Analysis said Putin\u2019s trip to Pyongyang is an indication of how beholden he is to some other countries since invading Ukraine. Previously, \u201cit was always the North Koreans coming to Russia. It wasn\u2019t the other way around,\u201d he said. The trip is a good way to make \u201cthe West nervous\u201d by demonstrating Moscow has interests and clout beyond Ukraine, Greene added. The North could also seek to increase labor exports to Russia and other activities to get foreign currency in defiance of U.N. sanctions, according to a report by the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea\u2019s main spy agency. There will likely be talks about expanding cooperation in agriculture, fisheries and mining and further promoting Russian tourism to North Korea, the institute said. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with the pace of both Kim\u2019s weapons tests and combined military exercises involving the U.S., South Korea and Japan intensifying in a tit-for-tat cycle. The Koreas also have engaged in Cold War-style psychological warfare that involved North Korea dropping tons of trash on the South with balloons, and the South broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda with its loudspeakers.

Foodborne botulism is a rare illness caused by a toxin produced by a type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. Eating foods contaminated with the toxin can cause paralysis, breathing difficulties and sometimes death. Improperly canned, preserved or fermented foods are common sources. Symptoms typical of botulism can include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision, a dry mouth, difficulty in swallowing or speaking, and neurological symptoms. More than 300 people have been hospitalized with botulism in Russia in a fairly big outbreak. The U.S. on average records 110 cases of botulism a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and only 82 cases were recorded in the European Union in 2021, a 2023 report by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says. Russian authorities blame the outbreak on ready-to-eat salads that contained canned beans and were made by a popular delivery service. Since mid-June, officials in Moscow, the outlying Moscow region, Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan have been reporting cases of botulism.

Kuznetsov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that 218 people remained in the hospital as of Monday, including 38 people on ventilators, while 151 people have been discharged. A 21-year-old man died in a hospital in the city of Kostroma, local officials reported Monday. According to the authorities, the man had traveled to Nizhny Novgorod, roughly 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Kostroma, to visit relatives and ordered the salad with beans there. Health officials initially linked at least some of the cases in Moscow to two brands of ready-made salads. Rospotrebnadzor, Russia\u2019s public health agency, halted the sale of the salads pending investigation after the first cases of poisoning were reported. Within days, the authorities named one of the two salads as the culprit \u2014 the one made and sold by popular delivery service Kukhnya Na Rayone, which operates in Moscow, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and several other cities. Kukhnya Na Rayone has suspended operations, saying in an online statement that it no longer offered the salad with canned beans in it, and would check its other products as well. A criminal investigation has been launched on the charges of making and distributing products in violation of safety standards. The authorities detained two top managers of Kukhnya Na Rayone, as well as the head of a company that makes canned beans and a man who worked as a cook there. The cook was placed in custody pending investigation and trial, while the three others were put under house arrest.

In the city of Makhachkala, about 125 km (75 miles) north on the Caspian Sea shore, attackers shot at a traffic police post and attacked a church. Gun battles erupted around the Assumption Cathedral in Makhachkala and heavy automatic gunfire rang out late into the night. Footage showed residents running for cover as plumes of smoke rose above the city. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

President Vladimir Putin , who has long accused the West of trying to stoke separatism in the Caucasus , has yet to comment. Dagestan is a mainly Muslim republic of Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, a patchwork of ethnic groups, languages and regions that live in the shadow of the Caucasus mountains between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. Authorities in Russia's Dagestan region declared three days of mourning following coordinated attacks on Orthodox churches, a synagogue and a police station on June 23. \u00a9 FMM graphics studio The attack on Christian and Jewish places of worship stoked fears Russia may be facing a renewed militant Islamist threat just three months after a deadly attack in Moscow. In the Moscow attack, 145 people were killed at the Crocus concert hall, an attack claimed by Islamic State group. In October, after the war in Gaza broke out, rioters waving Palestinian flags broke down glass doors and rampaged through Makhachkala airport to look for Jewish passengers on a flight arriving from Tel Aviv. In Israel , the foreign ministry said the synagogue in\u00a0Derbent had been burned to the ground and shots had been fired at a second synagogue in Makhachkala. The statement said it was believed there were no worshippers in the synagogue at the time. Derbent, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities on earth, is home to an ancient Jewish community and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Russian investigators said it was a \u201cterrorist\u201d attack but did not give details of the attackers. Russia\u2019s state media cited law enforcement as saying two sons of Magomed Omarov, the head of central Dagestan\u2019s Sergokala district, were among the attackers in Dagestan. They were killed and their father was detained, state media said. June 24 to 26 have been declared days of mourning in Dagestan, Melikov said, with flags lowered to half-mast and all entertainment events cancelled. The Russian empire expanded into the Caucasus in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but an insurgency after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union led to two wars. In August 1999, Chechen fighter Shamil Basayev led fighters into Dagestan in a bid to aid Dagestani Wahhabist fundamentalists, triggering a major bombing campaign by the Russian military ahead of the Second Chechen War.

Emergency officials told the state-owned Tass news agency that just one person was rescued from the blaze at the burning building in Fryazino, about 25km (15.5 miles) north-east of the capital. Two people were killed after they jumped from a window, while six died when the interior of the office collapsed in the blaze, Mr Voroyov wrote in a post to social media. Footage online showed thick smoke billowing from the upper floors of the eight-storey complex. There are conflicting reports about the building's purpose. It once homed the Platan Research Institute and defence industry, according to Tass. A statement to the agency from Ruselectronics, a Russia-owned electronics organisation, said the building has been privately owned since the 1990s. However, opposition media outlets recently reported that Platan was based in the building as late as 2023. Mr Vorobyov said that a 34-year-old man had been taken to hospital in a serious condition, while two firefighters were also being treated for injuries sustained in the blaze. Local emergency services said the man was the only person rescued from the blaze. Reuters Emergency ministry officials said over 130 people and two helicopters were working to fight the fire, but that much of it had been \"localised\" by 20:00 local time (18:00 BST). It is not immediately clear what caused the fire, but one eyewitness told Tass that it broke out on the sixth floor before spreading. Mr Vorobyov said that around 30 companies rented office space in the building, with the fate of two employees in the building remaining unknown. Mr Vorobyov added that a criminal case has been opened and prosecutors are investigating what sparked the blaze.

The last exchange took place on May 31, when each side handed over 75 prisoners of war, also with the UAE acting as a go-between. That was the first exchange in nearly four months. Sign up here. Russia said prisoners brought home on Tuesday had faced mortal danger in captivity. Ukraine said returnees had included soldiers who had defended the Azovstal steel mill in a three-month siege in 2022 and others taken prisoner when Russian forces briefly seized the defunct Chornobyl nuclear power station. The UAE said its action as a go-between had been made possible by maintaining good contacts with both sides. The Russian Defence Ministry, in a posting on the Telegram messaging app, said: \"As a result of negotiations, 90 Russian prisoners of war who risked death in captivity are being returned from areas under Kyiv's control.\" It said the Russian prisoners were able to return home \"with the United Arab Emirates participating as an intermediary in a humanitarian capacity\". The freed Russian prisoners were being flown to Moscow, where they would undergo medical checks, the ministry said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said most of the freed servicemen were privates and sergeants, and the swap was another step in the process of bringing all detainees home. \"We will return all others in the same way,\" he said in his nightly video address. \"We are seeking the truth about everyone -- where a person is, in what condition, what is needed for their return.\" He thanked the UAE for facilitating the exchange and pledged to press on with efforts to bring home those still being held. Ukraine's parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said those returning from captivity would undergo medical checks and receive help in resuming their lives. Video posted on the president's Telegram channel showed men stepping off a bus to be greeted and handed blue and yellow national flags to drape over their shoulders. The UAE Foreign Ministry, in a statement quoted by the state news agency WAM, said mediation had proved successful because it had leveraged \"its distinct ties and partnership with both sides, including as a reliable mediator among both parties\". Since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, the UAE has maintained neutral rhetoric on the conflict and continued mediating between the two sides to exchange prisoners.

Valery Gerasimov prior to a meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin with the top military brass in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Tuesday, June 25, 2024 for Russia\u2019s former defense minister and its military chief of staff for attacking civilian targets in Ukraine. (Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File) By MIKE CORDER Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 The International Criminal Court said Tuesday it issued arrest warrants for Russia\u2019s former defense minister and its military chief of staff for attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power plants , the third time the global court has accused senior Russian leaders of war crimes. There is no immediate likelihood of either former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu or chief of staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov being detained to face charges of war crimes and the crime against humanity of inhumane acts. Russia isn\u2019t a member of the court, doesn\u2019t recognize its jurisdiction and refuses to hand over suspects. Still, the move heaps more moral condemnation on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The warrant is the global court\u2019s latest effort to intervene in a major conflict. Earlier this year, the court\u2019s chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister and three leaders of the Hamas militant group over the militants\u2019 deadly attacks in southern Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Last year, the court issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin , accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. That has occasionally complicated his travel though the practical implications have been limited. Related stories Dialysis patients struggle to get treatment in blockaded Gaza. Officials say hundreds have died Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels fire a missile at northern Israel, the first time for the group to reach there UN to review the impact of its agency helping Palestinian refugees in Gaza and elsewhere Russia\u2019s Security Council dismissed the arrest warrants as \u201cnull and void\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThat is empty talk, considering that the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction does not include Russia and the decision has been made as part of the West\u2019s hybrid warfare against our country,\u201d it said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies. The court said in a statement that warrants were issued Monday because judges considered there were reasonable grounds to believe that Shoigu and Gerasimov are responsible for \u201cmissile strikes carried out by the Russian armed forces against the Ukrainian electric infrastructure \u201d from Oct. 10, 2022, until at least March 9, 2023. Judges who approved the prosecutors\u2019 request for warrants said the suspects are charged with inhumane acts because there is evidence they \u201cintentionally caused great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health\u201d of civilians in Ukraine. Under the leadership of Shoigu and Gerasimov, the Russian military has launched waves of missile and drone strikes that have killed thousands and damaged the country\u2019s energy system and other vital infrastructure. Moscow has insisted that it only has targeted military facilities despite daily casualties in civilian areas. The court alleged missile attacks covered in the warrant targeted civilian installations. It added that in the case of any installations that could have been considered military targets \u201cthe expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the warrants in a post on social platform X, saying both men are accused of \u201cheinous crimes against civilians in Ukraine during Russia\u2019s reckless bombing of Ukrainian critical civilian infrastructure. These barbaric missile and drone strikes continue to kill people and inflict damage across Ukraine.\u201d He added: \u201cEvery criminal involved in the planning and execution of these strikes must know that justice will be served. And we do hope to see them behind bars.\u201d Details of the warrants were kept under seal to protect witnesses, the court said. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement that the decision to issue warrants \u201creflects my office\u2019s continued commitment to give meaningful effect to the protection that the law provides to civilians and protected objects.\u201d Khan said his prosecution office \u201cremains focused in pursuing multiple, interconnected lines of investigation in Ukraine.\u201d Putin removed Shoigu as defense minister in a Cabinet shakeup in May as he began his fifth term as president. Shoigu, 69, has been widely seen as a key figure in Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine. Russia had expected the operation to quickly overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s much smaller and less-equipped army. Instead, the conflict galvanized Ukraine to mount an intense defense, dealing the Russian army humiliating blows, including the retreat from an attempt to take the capital, Kyiv, and a counteroffensive that drove Moscow\u2019s forces out of the northeastern region of Kharkiv and from around Kherson in the south in the fall of 2022. Shoigu, who had personal ties with Putin, got a soft landing with the high-profile post of secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council. At the same time, Shoigu\u2019s entourage faced purges . A longtime associate and deputy, Timur Ivanov, and several other senior military officers were arrested on corruption charges, and other senior Defense Ministry officials lost their jobs. Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff since 2012, has so far kept his job. The 68-year-old career military officer has directly overseen Russian military operations in Ukraine. In addition to the warrant against Putin, the court issued arrest warrants in March for two high-ranking Russian military officers on charges linked to attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine that judges said happened \u201cpursuant to a state policy.\u201d Last year, Russia announced indictments in absentia for a judge and prosecutor at the International Criminal Court who issued a warrant against Putin. ___ Find more coverage at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine","question":"What charges did the International Criminal Court issue arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov in June 2024?","answer":"The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity related to attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure from 2022 to 2023.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future information as my training only includes data up to October 2023.

NASA\/Handout via REUTERS\/FILE PHOTO Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - A defunct Russian satellite has broken up into more than 100 pieces of debris in orbit, forcing astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter for about an hour and adding to the mass of space junk already in orbit, U.S. space agencies said. There were no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the RESURS-P1 Russian Earth observation satellite, which Russia declared dead in 2022. Sign up here. U.S. Space Command, tracking the debris swarm, said there was no immediate threat to other satellites. The event took place at around 10 a.m. Mountain Time (1600 GMT) on Wednesday, Space Command said. It occurred in an orbit near the space station, prompting U.S. astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for roughly an hour, NASA's Space Station office said. Russian space agency Roscosmos, which operated the satellite, did not respond to a request for comment or publicly acknowledge the event on its social media channels. U.S. Space Command, which has a global network of space-tracking radars, said the satellite immediately created \"over 100 pieces of trackable debris.\" By Thursday afternoon, radars from U.S. space-tracking firm LeoLabs had detected at least 180 pieces, the company said. Large debris-generating events in orbit are rare but of increasing concern as space becomes crowded with satellite networks vital to everyday life on Earth, from broadband internet and communications to basic navigation services, as well as satellites no longer in use. The satellite's breakup was at an altitude of roughly 355 km (220 miles) in low-Earth orbit, a popular region where thousands of small to large satellites operate, including SpaceX's vast Starlink network and China's that houses three of its astronauts. \"Due to the low orbit of this debris cloud, we estimate it\u2019ll be weeks to months before the hazard has passed,\" LeoLabs said in a statement to Reuters. The some 25,000 pieces of debris bigger than four inches (10 cm) in space caused by satellite explosions or collisions, have raised concerns about the prospect of a Kessler effect - a phenomenon in which satellite collisions with debris can create a cascading field of more hazardous junk and exponentially increase crash risks. Russia sparked strong criticism from the U.S. and other Western countries in 2021 when it struck one of its defunct satellites in orbit with a ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile launched from its Plesetsk rocket site. The blast, testing a weapon system ahead of Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine , created thousands of pieces of orbital debris. In the roughly 88-minute window of RESURS-P1's initial break-up, the Plesetsk site was one of many locations on Earth it passed over, but there was no immediate indication from airspace or maritime alerts that Russia had launched a missile to strike the satellite, space-tracker and Harvard astronomer Jonathan McDowell said. \"I find it hard to believe they would use such a big satellite as an ASAT target,\" McDowell said. \"But, with the Russians these days, who knows.\" He and other analysts speculated the break-up more likely could have been caused by a problem with the satellite, such as leftover fuel onboard causing an explosion. WHAT HAPPENS TO OLD SATELLITES Dead satellites either remain in orbit until they descend into Earth's atmosphere for a fiery demise years later, or in widely preferred - but less common - circumstances they fly to a \"graveyard orbit\" some 36,000 km (22,400 miles) from Earth to lower the risk of crashing into active satellites. Roscosmos decommissioned RESURS-P1 over onboard equipment failures in 2021, announcing the decision the following year. The satellite has since appeared to be lowering its altitude through layers of other active satellites for an eventual atmospheric reentry. The six U.S. astronauts currently on the space station were alerted by NASA mission control in Houston around 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday (0100 GMT on Thursday) to execute \"safe haven\" procedures, where each crew member rushes into the spacecraft they arrived in, in case an emergency departure is required. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams boarded their Starliner spacecraft, the Boeing-built capsule that has been docked since June 6 in its first crewed test mission on the station . Three of the other U.S. astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut went into SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule that flew them to the station in March, while the sixth U.S. astronaut joined the two remaining cosmonauts in their Russian Soyuz capsule that ferried them there in September last year. The astronauts emerged from their spacecraft roughly an hour later and resumed their normal work on the station, NASA said. The prospect of satellite collisions and space warfare have added urgency to calls from space advocates and lawyers to have countries establish an international mechanism of managing space traffic, which does not currently exist.

The European Union said in May it was suspending the distribution of what it described as four \"Kremlin-linked propaganda networks,\" stripping them of their broadcasting rights in the bloc. Sign up here. It said at the time that the ban applied to Voice of Europe, to the RIA news agency, and to the Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers. The Russian Foreign Ministry hit back on Tuesday, releasing a list of 81 media outlets from 25 EU member states, as well as pan-European outlets, whose broadcasts it said would no longer be available on Russian territory. It accused the outlets of \"systematically distributing inaccurate information\" about what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine . France's Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, Austria's ORF state TV company, Ireland's RTE broadcaster, digital outlet Politico, and Spain's EFE news agency were among the outlets affected by the move, along with many other national broadcasters and newspapers. \"The Russian Federation has repeatedly warned at various levels that politically motivated harassment of domestic journalists and unjustified bans on Russian media in the EU will not go unanswered,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement. \"In spite of this, Brussels and the capitals of the bloc's countries preferred to follow the path of escalation, forcing Moscow to adopt mirror and proportional countermeasures.\" It said it would review its ban if the EU lifted its restrictions on RIA, Izvestia and the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, all of which it described as Russian media outlets. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament, said in May that the EU move had shown that the West refused to accept any alternative point of view and was destroying freedom of speech. 'UNJUSTIFIED MEASURE' Italy's foreign ministry on Tuesday condemned the Russian decision to ban access to outlets including Italian broadcasters Rai and La7 and newspapers La Repubblica and La Stampa. \"We regret the unjustified measure taken against these Italian broadcasters and newspapers, which have always provided objective and unbiased information on the conflict in Ukraine,\" the ministry said. AFP declined to comment and RTE did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the measures, announced a day before the Russian trial of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges is due to begin. Jamil Anderlini, Politico's Editor-in-Chief for Europe, described the measures as \"completely unacceptable\" and said in a statement that it was \"not the first time press freedoms have been restricted through politically motivated attacks\". \"We call for the immediate lifting of these restrictions and continue to call for Evan's immediate release,\" he wrote. The first American journalist to be detained on spy charges in Russia since the Cold War more than three decades ago, Gershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, has denied he is a Central Intelligence Agency spy. The Journal says Gershkovich was doing his job and denies he is a spy. Many Western news organisations pulled staff out of Russia after it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and passed laws soon afterwards that set long prison sentences for \"discrediting\" the armed forces. Russian officials say large parts of the Western media spread false, unbalanced stories about Russia, and that Western media organisations are waging an information war.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"A Russian satellite breaks up into over 100 pieces of debris near the International Space Station.","text":"Russian satellite breaks up in space, forces ISS astronauts to shelter By Joey Roulette June 27, 2024 9:37 PM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link The comet NEOWISE streaks above Earth, in this image taken aboard the International Space Station (ISS),  July 5, 2020. NASA\/Handout via REUTERS\/FILE PHOTO Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - A defunct Russian satellite has broken up into more than 100 pieces of debris in orbit, forcing astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter for about an hour and adding to the mass of space junk already in orbit, U.S. space agencies said. There were no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the RESURS-P1 Russian Earth observation satellite, which Russia declared dead in 2022. Sign up here. U.S. Space Command, tracking the debris swarm, said there was no immediate threat to other satellites. The event took place at around 10 a.m. Mountain Time (1600 GMT) on Wednesday, Space Command said. It occurred in an orbit near the space station, prompting U.S. astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for roughly an hour, NASA's Space Station office said. Russian space agency Roscosmos, which operated the satellite, did not respond to a request for comment or publicly acknowledge the event on its social media channels. U.S. Space Command, which has a global network of space-tracking radars, said the satellite immediately created \"over 100 pieces of trackable debris.\" By Thursday afternoon, radars from U.S. space-tracking firm LeoLabs had detected at least 180 pieces, the company said. Large debris-generating events in orbit are rare but of increasing concern as space becomes crowded with satellite networks vital to everyday life on Earth, from broadband internet and communications to basic navigation services, as well as satellites no longer in use. The satellite's breakup was at an altitude of roughly 355 km (220 miles) in low-Earth orbit, a popular region where thousands of small to large satellites operate, including SpaceX's vast Starlink network and China's that houses three of its astronauts. \"Due to the low orbit of this debris cloud, we estimate it\u2019ll be weeks to months before the hazard has passed,\" LeoLabs said in a statement to Reuters. The some 25,000 pieces of debris bigger than four inches (10 cm) in space caused by satellite explosions or collisions, have raised concerns about the prospect of a Kessler effect - a phenomenon in which satellite collisions with debris can create a cascading field of more hazardous junk and exponentially increase crash risks. Russia sparked strong criticism from the U.S. and other Western countries in 2021 when it struck one of its defunct satellites in orbit with a ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile launched from its Plesetsk rocket site. The blast, testing a weapon system ahead of Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine , created thousands of pieces of orbital debris. In the roughly 88-minute window of RESURS-P1's initial break-up, the Plesetsk site was one of many locations on Earth it passed over, but there was no immediate indication from airspace or maritime alerts that Russia had launched a missile to strike the satellite, space-tracker and Harvard astronomer Jonathan McDowell said. \"I find it hard to believe they would use such a big satellite as an ASAT target,\" McDowell said. \"But, with the Russians these days, who knows.\" He and other analysts speculated the break-up more likely could have been caused by a problem with the satellite, such as leftover fuel onboard causing an explosion. WHAT HAPPENS TO OLD SATELLITES Dead satellites either remain in orbit until they descend into Earth's atmosphere for a fiery demise years later, or in widely preferred - but less common - circumstances they fly to a \"graveyard orbit\" some 36,000 km (22,400 miles) from Earth to lower the risk of crashing into active satellites. Roscosmos decommissioned RESURS-P1 over onboard equipment failures in 2021, announcing the decision the following year. The satellite has since appeared to be lowering its altitude through layers of other active satellites for an eventual atmospheric reentry. The six U.S. astronauts currently on the space station were alerted by NASA mission control in Houston around 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday (0100 GMT on Thursday) to execute \"safe haven\" procedures, where each crew member rushes into the spacecraft they arrived in, in case an emergency departure is required. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams boarded their Starliner spacecraft, the Boeing-built capsule that has been docked since June 6 in its first crewed test mission on the station . Three of the other U.S. astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut went into SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule that flew them to the station in March, while the sixth U.S. astronaut joined the two remaining cosmonauts in their Russian Soyuz capsule that ferried them there in September last year. The astronauts emerged from their spacecraft roughly an hour later and resumed their normal work on the station, NASA said. The prospect of satellite collisions and space warfare have added urgency to calls from space advocates and lawyers to have countries establish an international mechanism of managing space traffic, which does not currently exist.

The charges brought against Yulia Navalnaya, who lives outside Russia, in absentia are to do with her alleged \"participation in an extremist society\", Tass news agency said. Navalny was Russia's most significant opposition leader of the past decade. He died in February in an Arctic Circle jail. Russian authorities said he died of natural causes - but his widow said Navalny had been \"tortured, starved, cut off and killed\" by Russia's president Vladimir Putin. Navalny had been serving 19 years on extremism charges that were widely seen as politically motivated. Responding to the arrest warrant against her, Yulia Navalnaya posted on X: \"When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal. \"His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cosy cell with a TV, but in Russia - in the same colony and the same two-by-three-metre cell in which he killed Alexei.\" The Moscow court ruled that Ms Navalnaya, who has vowed to continue the work of her husband, should be remanded in custody and she was declared wanted. The decision means she would face arrest if she set foot in Russia. The charges may be linked to a Moscow court ruling in June 2021 which outlawed three organisations linked to Navalny, labelling them \"extremists\". Ms Navalnaya was unable to attend his funeral in March . She has since met a number of Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden. This month, she was elected to chair the US-based Human Rights Foundation - a non-profit organisation working to promote and protect human rights across the world.

Baza, a Telegram news channel believed to have links to Russia\u2019s security services, said a manhunt was underway for a serviceman armed with a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and 70 rounds of ammunition. It was not possible to independently confirm the report and Baza did not say how many people were killed. Baza later said two soldiers were killed and one wounded after the shooting late Thursday. The outlet posted a blurred photograph of a man claimed to be the shooter, identified as 29-year-old Alexei from the republic of Chuvashia in central Russia. His last name was not provided. The weapon and ammunition he was thought to have taken near the military site where the shooting took place, Baza added. The Belgorod region has been frequently targeted by Ukrainian attacks since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Regional authorities, who have not commented on the reported shooting, say more than 250 people have been killed in cross-border shelling and drone strikes.

The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort, these sources said.\u00a0The\u00a0plan to kill Armin Papperger,\u00a0a white-haired\u00a0goliath who\u00a0has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature. When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.\u00a0A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US. For more than six months,\u00a0Russia has\u00a0been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe,\u00a0largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism \u2014\u00a0all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv. But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west. Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German\u00a0manufacturer of the\u00a0vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine\u2019s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine in the coming weeks , an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow\u2019s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel.

Fabian Bimmer\/Pool\/Getty Images The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign \u2014\u00a0one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing sabotage, we\u2019re seeing assassination plots, we\u2019re seeing arson. We\u2019re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,\u201d a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI believe very much that we\u2019re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN\u2019s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it\u00a0shows how Russia is \u201cwaging a hybrid war of aggression\u201d on European allies. \u201cWe have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,\u201d Baerbock said. In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin\u00a0\u201cwill not be intimidated by the Russian threats\ufeff,\u201d emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at \u201cundermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.\u201d A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment. \u201cThe necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,\u201d Hoffman said. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion\u00a0among\u00a0NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country. But the campaign \u2014\u00a0and in particular Russia\u2019s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil \u2014 has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all. Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a\u00a0shotgun\u00a0approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine;\u00a0Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland, CNN has reported , a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company. Some analysts have referred to the effort as a \u201chybrid\u201d campaign, one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia\u2019s sabotage efforts that way. \u201cI fundamentally reject the idea that what we\u2019re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of \u2018hybrid\u2019, I think of \u2026 defacing monuments,\u201d the senior NATO official said. \u201cThings that meet that traditional definition of \u2018below the threshold of armed conflict.\u2019\u201d Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations \u2014\u00a0lethal action \u2014\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that \u2018hybrid\u2019 implies,\u201d the official said. It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy. Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat\u2019s car:\u00a0US military bases across Europe were placed on a heightened state of alert last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed\u00a0actors were\u00a0considering carrying out\u00a0sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And\u00a0French authorities last month detained a Russian-Ukrainian man who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow.

{"year":"2024","month":"06","event_desc":"The European Court of Human Rights unanimously finds Russia guilty of systematic violations of human rights in the Crimean peninsula.","text":"Ukraine wins its first interstate case against Russia over systematic violations of human rights on its occupied peninsula. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has found Russia guilty of systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine\u2019s occupied Crimean peninsula. The verdict on Tuesday in the first interstate case brought by Ukraine against Russia over Crimea said that the rights breaches starting in February 2014, when Moscow occupied and annexed the peninsula , included violations of the right to life, inhuman or degrading treatment, the prohibition of freedom of religion and freedom of expression, among others. The court based in Strasbourg, France, said in its unanimous judgement that there was sufficient evidence \u2013 corroborated by a range of witness testimony and reports from nongovernmental organisations \u2013 to find Russia guilty \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. It said the \u201cincidents had been sufficiently numerous and interconnected\u201d and amounted to a \u201csystem of violations\u201d. The court ordered Russia \u201cto take measures as soon as possible for the safe return of the relevant prisoners transferred from Crimea to penal facilities located on the territory of the Russian Federation\u201d. The impact of the decision is likely to be limited as Russia refuses to recognise the judgements of the court. The country was expelled from the Council of Europe in the wake of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As a result, it is no longer a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the court in Strasbourg enforces. However, the court can still rule on incidents that occurred before Russia\u2019s expulsion. The case in question on Tuesday dates back to March 2014. A top Ukrainian presidential official hailed the ruling as \u201ca great achievement\u201d of international jurisprudence. \u201cUkraine has become closer to restoring justice,\u201d Iryna Mudra, deputy head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office, said on X. Margarita Sokorenko, Ukraine\u2019s representative for the ECHR, said the ruling \u201cessentially nullified Russia\u2019s ten-year narrative that human rights are respected in Crimea\u201d. \u201cThis is a crushing decision of the ECHR for the aggressor! The ECHR recognised that the government of Ukraine has proven the existence of systematic violations of our citizens since the beginning of Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea in February 2014,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. The government of Ukraine argued in this case that since February 27, 2014, Russia exercised a campaign of repression against non-Russians in Crimea that included disappearances, illegal detentions, ill-treatment, the inability to renounce Russian citizenship, the suppression of the Ukrainian media and the functioning of the Ukrainian language in schools, as well as the transfer from Crimea to remote prisons in Russia. Russia had previously denied accusations it violated human rights and oppressed political opponents on the peninsula. It stopped participating in the ECHR proceedings in 2022.

Putin signed the bill into law two days after it was approved by both houses of parliament. The legislation, which envisages a progressive tax on personal income, is a major change from the flat-rate tax that was widely credited with improving revenue collections after it was introduced in 2001. The new law imposes a 13% tax for incomes of up to 2.4 million rubles ($27,500) a year. For incomes over that amount, a steadily higher tax rate would apply, with the maximum rate of 22% for incomes exceeding 50 million rubles ($573,000). Putin has said that the tax increase would affect no more than 3.2% of Russia\u2019s taxpayers. The bill also calls for an increase in the company income tax rate from 20% to 25%. The tax reform is estimated to bring 2.6 trillion rubles ($29 billion) in additional federal revenues in 2025. A 13% flat tax was put into effect quickly after Putin\u2019s first election in 2000 in an attempt to fight widespread tax evasion and boost state revenue. In 2021, Russia modified the system so that people earning more than 5 million rubles a year would pay 15% on the amount above the threshold.

Gershkovich, 32, denied the charges and pleaded not guilty during the secretive court proceedings in Yekaterinburg, mostly held behind closed doors. His employer, the Wall Street Journal , described the verdict as a \u201cdisgraceful, sham conviction\u201d. The trial was concluded with unusual haste, raising hopes of a prisoner swap involving the journalist, something that has long been the subject of private discussions between Russian and US officials. Footage from the courtroom showed Gershkovich, dressed in a T-shirt, watching impassively from inside a glass defendant\u2019s box, as the judge read out the sentence of \u201cimprisonment for a term of 16 years in a penal colony with a strict regime\u201d. The court ordered his mobile phone and reporter\u2019s notebook to be destroyed. Earlier on Friday, the prosecution had asked for an 18-year jail term. President Joe Biden said the US government was pushing hard for Gershkovich\u2019s release, adding: \u201cThere is no question that Russia is wrongfully detaining Evan. Journalism is not a crime.\u201d The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the sentence \u201cdespicable\u201d. Gershkovich was arrested while reporting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg last March, becoming the first US journalist since the cold war to be accused of spying in Russia. He had been held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, but was returned to Yekaterinburg for trial. The prosecutors claimed Gershkovich was collecting secret information about a military factory in the Urals involved in Moscow\u2019s war effort in Ukraine on the orders of the CIA, a claim he, the Wall Street Journal and the US state department have dismissed as ludicrous. He had been granted official accreditation to work as a journalist by the Russian foreign ministry. \u201cThis disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist,\u201d the Wall Street Journal said in a statement released after the verdict. \u201cWe will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan\u2019s release and to support his family. Journalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he\u2019s released. This must end now.\u201d . The press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders described the sentence as \u201coutrageous\u201d and called for Gershkovich to be released immediately. The US embassy in Moscow said: \u201cRegardless of what Russian authorities claim, Evan is a journalist. He did not commit any illegal actions. Russian authorities have been unable to provide evidence that he committed a crime or justification for Evan\u2019s continued detention.\u201d The United Nations human rights office said it had serious concerns with the sentencing. \u201cJournalists should be able to perform their essential professional functions work in a safe environment without fear of reprisals - in line with Russia\u2019s international human rights obligations,\u201d it said in a statement. The trial was held behind closed doors, which is common in espionage cases. Journalists were allowed briefly into the courtroom when the hearings began last month. Gershkovich appeared with a shaved head, in line with Russian regulations. View image in fullscreen The media congregate in court in preparation for the verdict on Evan Gershkovich. Photograph: EPA Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed on Wednesday that Moscow had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d Gershkovich was involved in espionage, but gave no details. Russian authorities have made nothing public that would suggest guilt, and many see the arrest as an attempt to use jailed Americans as bargaining chips in an exchange for Russian intelligence operatives and assassins held in western jails. The speed of the case, with this week\u2019s hearings brought forward by more than a month and the prosecution racing through witness testimony in one afternoon, may indicate that a long-discussed swap deal is close. Russia usually concludes court proceedings in such instances before a swap. Vladimir Putin, in an interview in February with the US broadcaster Tucker Carlson , said discussions on a swap were under way. \u201cThe special services are in contact with one another. They are talking \u2026 I believe an agreement can be reached,\u201d the president said. He hinted that Russia would like to exchange Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, who is serving time in a German jail for assassinating a Chechen exile in Berlin in 2019 .

Alexei Golenishchev \/ TASS Russia\u2019s Supreme Court has upheld a 19-year prison sentence for Alexei Navalny, state media reported on Monday, more than five months after the opposition activist died in an Arctic prison. In a closed-door hearing held on July 2, the court rejected an appeal by Navalny\u2019s defense team against a nearly two-decade sentence for creating an \u201cextremist community.\u201d The late activist began serving that sentence in December at the\u00a0notorious \u201cPolar Wolf\u201d penal colony, where he died under unclear circumstances on Feb. 16. \u201cThe verdict of the Moscow City Court was left unchanged, and the cassation appeal was dismissed,\" a spokesperson for the Supreme Court told reporters, referring to the August 2023 ruling against the activist on a string of charges\u00a0his supporters described as an attempt to keep him out of politics forever. Russia\u2019s Supreme Court also ruled against an appeal by Daniel Kholodny, the former technical director of Navalny\u2019s YouTube channel.\u00a0Kholodny was sentenced to eight years in a penal colony in the same \u201cextremism\u201d trial as Navalny. Russia designated Navalny\u2019s activist network, including the disbanded Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), as \u201cextremist\u201d in 2021, placing employees, volunteers and supporters at risk of criminal prosecution. Most of\u00a0Navalny\u2019s associates fled the country following the designation. Since then, authorities in Russia have handed down lengthy prison sentences to the few Navalny allies who chose to remain in the country. In May, a Siberian court upheld the nine-year prison sentence for Ksenia Fadeyeva, a former coordinator for Navalny in the Tomsk region. Lilia Chanysheva, another Navalny coordinator in the republic of Bashkortostan, was sentenced in April to nine-and-a-half years on \u201cextremism\u201d charges.

Alexei Soldatov, who served as deputy minister of communications in 2008-2010, was convicted Monday on charges related to a deal to transfer a pool of IP addresses to a foreign-based organization. Soldatov and his lawyers rejected the charges as unfounded. Moscow\u2019s Savyolovsky District Court also convicted and sentenced Soldatov\u2019s business partner Yevgeny Antipov to 1 1\/2 years in the same criminal case. In 1990, Soldatov, a nuclear physicist by training, led the Relcom computer network that made the first Soviet connection to the global internet. After the 1991 Soviet collapse, Soldatov helped establish other organizations that provided the technical backbone of the Russian internet ever since. Russian media reports suggested that the charges against Soldatov were rooted in a dispute over an internet domain name and initiated by a senior government official. Soldatov\u2019s son, Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist who lives abroad and faces criminal charges in Russia linked to his criticism of Russian military actions in Ukraine, denounced the verdict. He argued that the court had no legal right to put his 72-year-old father behind bars because he\u2019s terminally ill.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo\u00a0Podolyak told independent Russian media that Kyiv\u00a0\u201chad nothing to do with\u201d the car explosion in Moscow earlier in the day. \u201cAs far as I know, there was a malfunction with the gas equipment in the car, \u201d\u00a0Podolyak said. Later on Wednesday, Federal Security Service (FSB) chief Alexander Bortnikov told reporters that the man suspected of carrying out the bomb attack had managed to flee to Turkey, where Russian authorities were seeking his extradition. \u201cWe are working with the Turks, but we will see,\u201d Bortnikov said in a video posted by the Telegram news channel Shot. A number of car explosions have rocked Russia since the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. The daughter of conservative Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin was killed in a bomb attack in the summer of 2022, with Moscow laying the blame on Ukraine. And in May 2023, prominent pro-Kremlin writer and Russian nationalist Zakhar Prilepin survived a car blast in the Nizhny Novgorod region.

The United States said on July 10 that it would start deploying long-range missiles , opens new tab in Germany from 2026 in preparation for a longer-term deployment that will include SM-6, Tomahawk cruise missiles and developmental hypersonic weapons. Sign up here. In a speech to sailors from Russia, China, Algeria and India to mark Russian navy day in the former imperial capital of St Petersburg, Putin warned the United States that it risked triggering a Cold War-style missile crisis with the move. \"The flight time to targets on our territory of such missiles, which in the future may be equipped with nuclear warheads, will be about 10 minutes,\" Putin said. \"We will take mirror measures to deploy, taking into account the actions of the United States, its satellites in Europe and in other regions of the world.\" Putin, who sent his army into Ukraine in 2022, casts the war as part of a historic struggle with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after Soviet Union fell in 1991 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence. Ukraine and the West say Putin is engaged in an imperial-style land grab. They have vowed to defeat Russia, which currently controls about 18% of Ukraine, including Crimea, and parts of four regions in eastern Ukraine. Russia says the lands, once part of the Russian empire, are now again part of Russia and that they will never be given back. COLD WAR? Russian and U.S. diplomats say their diplomatic relations are worse even that during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and both Moscow and Washington have urged de-escalation while both have made steps towards escalation. Putin said that the United States was stoking tensions and had transferred Typhon missile systems to Denmark and the Philippines, and compared the U.S. plans to the NATO decision to deploy Pershing II launchers in Western Europe in 1979. The Soviet leadership, including General Secretary Yuri Andropov, feared Pershing II deployments were part of an elaborate U.S.-led plan to decapitate the Soviet Union by taking out its political and military leadership. \"This situation is reminiscent of the events of the Cold War related to the deployment of American medium\u2013range Pershing missiles in Europe,\" Putin said. The Pershing II, designed to deliver a variable yield nuclear warhead, was deployed to West Germany in 1983. In 1983, the ailing Andropov and the KGB interpreted a series of U.S. moves including the Pershing II deployment and a major NATO exercise as signs the West was about to launch a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union , opens new tab . Putin repeated an earlier warning that Russia could resume production of intermediate and shorter range nuclear-capable missiles and then consider where to deploy them after the United States brought similar missiles to Europe and Asia.

Water washed away the temporary barrier between two locks of the White Sea-Baltic Canal in the republic of Karelia, regional head Artur Parfenchikov wrote on the Russian social media website VKontakte. Parfenchikov said that more than 100 firefighters and emergency workers were sent to the area impacted by the flooding. Authorities declared a state of emergency in response to the incident. On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s Emergency Services Ministry said the bodies of a man and a woman killed in the previous day\u2019s flooding had been found. Ten others were reported injured. The state-run TASS news agency, citing emergency service officials, reported that 13 homes were destroyed and three people were rescued. Nine people had initially been reported missing, but rescuers later found seven of them, including children. Videos shared on social media showed water rushing over what appeared to be the area where the cofferdam was placed. A woman in one of the videos shouts: \u201cThe dam is gone, it\u2019s simply gone\u2026 homes were washed away with the people inside.\u201d The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects northwestern Russia\u2019s White Sea with Lake Onega and has an outlet to the Baltic Sea. According to Parfenchikov, the cofferdam was installed for reconstruction work on the canal. Law enforcement authorities opened a criminal investigation into the dam break, which they are treating as a violation of construction safety rules. Monday\u2019s dam break marks the second such incident in Russia in recent days. On Friday, heavy rains led to the collapse of a dam in the Ural Mountains region of Chelyabinsk, where at least one person was killed by flooding in nearby villages. In April, the collapse of a dam in the southern Orenburg region led to historic flooding throughout the region, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes.

The rescue operation involved heavy equipment and over 550 emergency workers, the ministry said.

There\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Remember who the hell we are. We\u2019re the United States of America. Three Americans \u2014 Evan Gershkovich, a reporter of The Wall Street Journal; Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor for RFE\/RL; and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine \u2014 were freed in a prisoner exchange with Russia. Credit Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times Pinned Anton Troianovski and Mark Mazzetti The seven-nation exchange is the largest in decades. Here\u2019s the latest. Three Americans freed from Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrived late Thursday night at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where they were greeted by President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris after their release was secured in a deal whose size and complexity have little precedent in the post-Soviet era. The deal involving seven countries \u2014 which came together after an elaborate web of negotiations behind the scenes \u2014 was a diplomatic victory for Mr. Biden, who has long pledged to bring home imprisoned Americans and to support Russia\u2019s embattled pro-democracy movement. Mr. Biden said at an earlier news conference that the prisoners had left Russia and were on their way home. \u201cTheir brutal ordeal is over, and they\u2019re free,\u201d he said, surrounded by family members of the released prisoners. For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Moscow freed prominent dissidents as part of a swap; 16 people in total were released from Russian custody. In exchange, eight people were freed by the West. The exchange took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital, and involved seven planes ferrying 24 prisoners from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia, a Turkish intelligence official said. In a statement, Mr. Gershkovich\u2019s family thanked President Biden and other officials for helping to secure his release. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to give him the biggest hug and see his sweet and brave smile up close,\u201d they said. \u201cMost important now is taking care of Evan and being together again.\u201d Here\u2019s what else to know: The deal freed Mr. Gershkovich, 32, who had spent 16 months in a Russian prison; Alsu Kurmasheva, 47, a Russian American editor for Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty, who was also arrested last year; and Paul Whelan, 54, a former U.S. Marine arrested in 2018. The deal was also a triumph of a different sort for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who can use the deal to highlight his loyalty to Russian agents who get arrested abroad. Germany released Vadim Krasikov , a Russian convicted of murdering a Chechen former separatist fighter in Berlin in 2019 on orders of the Russian government. Mr. Putin \u2014 who does not usually greet foreign leaders when they visit \u2014 embraced the released Russian prisoners as they arrived at an airport in Moscow. Prominent Russian political prisoners were also released. They included Ilya Yashin, 41, perhaps the most popular opposition politician who was still behind bars; Vladimir Kara-Murza, 42, a veteran activist who also writes for The Washington Post; and Oleg Orlov, 71, the co-chairman of Memorial, the Russian human rights group.

That same apprehension was echoed by his party\u2019s House and Senate leaders, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator Mitch McConnell. \u201cWithout serious action to deter further hostage-taking by Russia, Iran, and other states hostile to the United States, the costs of hostage diplomacy will continue to rise.

Erin Schaff\/The New York Times Vice President Kamala Harris said that she and President Biden had \u201cnever stopped fighting\u201d for the release of wrongfully detained Americans like the ones who were released from Russian custody on Thursday. Ms. Harris, who made the remarks after a campaign swing through Houston and after stopping at the memorial of Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, was seeking to establish her part in a monthslong negotiation that ultimately involved 24 prisoners from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia. The Americans involved in the swap included Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter; Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian American editor for Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty; and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine arrested in 2018. They had \u201cshown incredible courage,\u201d Ms. Harris said in brief remarks on the tarmac in Houston before flying back to Washington. \u201cOver many years, President Biden and I and our team have engaged in complex diplomatic negotiations to bring these wrongfully detained Americans home,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWe never stopped fighting for their release. And today, in spite of all of their suffering, it gives me great comfort to know that their horrible ordeal is finally over.\u201d She added that she had spoken with Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who died in custody in February and whose release was under negotiation when he died. His death scrambled the negotiation, and the swap. \u201cAs I told her,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cthe United States stands with all of those who are fighting for freedom in Russia.\u201d Ms. Harris said that securing the release of more people wrongfully held abroad \u201cis my solemn commitment to my fellow Americans, which I will always honor.\u201d The vice president did not stop to take questions from reporters before boarding Air Force Two. Late Thursday evening, Ms. Harris was scheduled to meet the released Americans with President Biden at Joint Base Andrews. For Mr. Biden, the main focus of the day was celebrating the release of the prisoners alongside their family members at the White House, and reminding Americans that the release of wrongfully detained citizens had been a focus of his presidency \u2014 70 have been freed since he took office. Still, with Ms. Harris now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Mr. Biden and his advisers made sure to point to Ms. Harris\u2019s work as a partner in the effort. \u201cI would say they\u2019ve learned from each other,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said of their relationship. Ms. Harris\u2019s aides have often cited her work at the Munich Security Conference as evidence of her growth in foreign policy. Jake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters on Thursday said that she had engaged with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, at the conference to talk about the release of prisoners. Aware the United States had assessed there were two Russian nationals being held in Slovenia who could be key for a potential prisoner swap, Ms. Harris also told her team she wanted to meet with Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia at the conference, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meetings. On Feb. 16, Ms. Harris and her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, met with Mr. Golob to discuss releasing the two Russians in exchange for freeing the detained Americans, including Mr. Gershkovich, the official said. The next day, after her regular scheduled bilateral meeting with Mr. Scholz, Ms. Harris asked Mr. Scholz to stay behind for a more restricted meeting with fewer aides in attendance. The two leaders, each with a staff member alongside them, discussed the potential prisoner exchange. Ms. Harris conveyed that crucial to securing the release of Americans would be releasing Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted of murdering a Chechen former separatist fighter in Berlin in 2019 on orders of the Russian government. Mr. Sullivan praised the vice president as \u201cvery much\u201d a core member of \u201cthe team that helped make this happen.\u201d Show more Aug. 1, 2024, 6:15 p.m. ET Valerie Hopkins Ekaterina Bodyagina and Alina Lobzina The loved ones of some released Russian dissidents had no prior knowledge of the swap.

Mr. Pivovarov was arrested in May 2021, accused of \u201cparticipating in the activities of an undesirable organization.\u201d In June 2022, he was sentenced to four years in prison. Ms. Usmanova said that she found out on Saturday that her husband was no longer in the penal colony where he was serving out his sentence and at the time she did not understand what had happened. By Monday, when it became clear that a number of other political prisoners, including Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza had also disappeared, a sense of optimism started creeping over her. \u201cHonestly, it became easier for me because I started to feel hope that something good could be happening,\u201d she said. On Thursday, she purchased a ticket to Germany and hoped to reunite with Mr. Pivovarov, whom she married while he was behind bars, in July 2023. It would be their first time together outside of a Russian prison as a married couple. Inmates are not allowed to wear wedding rings, so she said she would be carrying her husband\u2019s ring so that he could finally put it on.

Image The Glienicke Bridge in Germany, also known as the Bridge of Spies, was the main crossing point used throughout the Cold War for high-profile exchanges. Credit... Gordon Welters for The New York Times The Glienicke Bridge in Germany, known as the \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d stands out among Cold War landmarks because so many high-profile spies, dissidents and others were exchanged across its span. The long, shadowy history of such trades dates to 1962. Francis Gary Powers, the American pilot of a U-2 spy plane shot down over Russia two years earlier, walked across the bridge from Potsdam on the East German side to western Berlin, as Rudolf Abel, convicted of espionage in the United States, came east. For the next quarter century, the most important operatives from the West and the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union\u2019s military alliance, were exchanged there, until the last one in 1986 involving Natan Sharansky, the Soviet human rights advocate. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent reunification of Germany, the bridge lost its greater purpose. The Havel River it crosses no longer formed part of the Iron Curtain dividing the East and West. So when three Americans, several European nationals and Russian dissidents were swapped on Thursday for eight men and women whom the Kremlin wanted back from multiple countries, it took place at a Turkish airport. Previous exchanges were not always cause for celebration. In March 1985, after a Russian sentry shot dead an American military intelligence officer named Arthur D. Nicholson Jr. in East Germany, his body was sent back across the bridge. The Soviet Union never ceded control of the structure to East Germany. Like Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter sentenced to 16 years in a Russian jail for espionage, many of those swapped on Thursday by the Kremlin were convicted on spurious grounds. Numerous Russian opposition figures let go over the years were labeled spies by their own country, having been convicted of serving foreign governments \u2014 though their real crime was criticizing the Kremlin. This time around, Kremlin sympathizers began trotting out the same reason not to call them \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d as rumors of the exchange began to circulate. One of the largest Cold War trades involved 29 people in June 1985, when 25 Westerners were let go in exchange for four people from the Soviet bloc, including Marian Zacharski, a notorious Polish spy. If in the early decades the exchanges took place in darkness, with minimal publicity, the last one at the bridge occurred under the full glare of the world\u2019s media. In February 1986, Mr. Sharansky was released across the bridge along with three Western operatives in exchange for five Soviet agents. After the Cold War, such exchanges tended to take place in rather mundane locations, far less laden with symbolism. One of the largest, involving 14 people in 2010, transpired on the tarmac at Vienna International Airport in Austria. The 10 people being released by the West included Anna Chapman, who had worked undercover as a real estate executive and socialite in New York, while the Russians let go of Sergei Skripal, a double-agent intelligence officer whom they later tried to poison in Britain in 2018. The intrigue surrounding the exchanges on the Glienicke Bridge inevitably meant it featured often in movies, TV series and spy novels. One example, the 2015 film \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d by Stephen Spielberg, starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, dramatized the Powers-Abel exchange. Perhaps no writer depicted Cold War tensions quite like John Le Carr\u00e9. In the television version of \u201cSmiley\u2019s People,\u201d British spymaster George Smiley, played by Alec Guinness, learns that his Soviet nemesis, Karla, the head of a fictional version of the K.G.B., has decided to defect across the bridge. \u201cThat\u2019s where he would choose, I suppose,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s natural.\u201d Susan C.

Russia-24\/via, Reuters Russian state television presented muted coverage of the prisoner swap on Thursday, emphasizing a message that Russia always recovers those who are loyal to the state and its leadership. The state media also portrayed the Russian opposition activists who were released as agents who served foreign states. Russia-24, the country\u2019s main state-run news channel, reported the news hours after it was first confirmed by Turkish officials. The reports featured commentary by Russian spies and other individuals who had been swapped before. Victor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer known as the \u201cMerchant of Death\u201d who was swapped for the American W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner in 2022, said on Russia-24 that the exchange was \u201ca big victory\u201d for Russia. \u201cOur people returned, our heroes,\u201d he said. The report centered on the theme that Russia always fights to get its citizens back home. Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was sentenced to a lengthy prison term in the United States on cocaine trafficking charges, said that \u201cwe never give up our guys.\u201d The former prisoners, commenting on a video of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan being escorted to a Russian government plane in Moscow ready to depart for Turkey, said that the Americans looked well \u2014 a suggestion that the Americans were treated better than they had been while being held in Western prisons. \u201cPaul Whelan looks great, he doesn\u2019t limp,\u201d said Mr. Yaroshenko, who spent many years in an American prison, where he said he was repeatedly beaten and tortured. \u201cThey look healthy, we are treating everyone in a humane way,\u201d said Yelena Vavilova, a Russian \u201csleeper\u201d agent who had worked undercover in America for decades before getting arrested in 2010 and later getting swapped back to Russia. She added, referring to opposition activists that were released: \u201cEven those who wanted to subvert our society from within.\u201d Sergei A. Markov, a pro-Kremlin analyst, said in a post on Telegram that the Russian side recovered \u201chonest officers\u201d during the swap, while the United States got \u201cpolitical figures who served American interests.\u201d \u201cBy swapping them the U.S. recognized them as its political agents,\u201d Mr. Markov said, referring to Russian opposition activists who were released to Germany. In another post, Mr. Markov said that the swap was unlikely to signify that the bilateral relationship between Moscow and Washington was improving. On the contrary, he said, it meant that the relationship was at the lowest point in decades. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move away from the abyss,\u201d Mr. Markov said.

Vadim Krasikov, the prisoner Germany released , was a Russian intelligence agent whom the Kremlin for years had sought to get back.

Mr. Krasikov had been held in an undisclosed German high-security prison since being convicted in 2021, just months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The returning Germans include one man who was detained at the St. Petersburg airport with six cannabis-laced gummy bears, a 19-year-old high school student and a former German Red Cross employee who had been sentenced to death on espionage charges in Belarus in June. \u201cIn order to give 16 people a new life in freedom, we deported a convicted murderer to Russia,\u201d said Marco Buschmann, Germany\u2019s minister of justice in a statement. Mr. Buschmann ordered the release based on a little-used clause in the penal code, something he called a \u201cbitter concession.\u201d The exchange could spell a rare moment of domestic success for Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who interrupted his summer break to welcome the prisoners. His willingness to engage diplomatically with Russia over the prisoners could boost his popularity among the many Germans who have become increasingly angry at the high sums the government is spending to support Ukraine in the war against Russia. Germany also hosts more than one million Ukrainian refugees. The country\u2019s support for Ukraine has become one of the major issues in three state elections next month, with many voters in the east opposed to it and two populist parties pushing for diplomatic talks with Russia surging in the polls. Mr. Krasikov was found guilty by a Berlin court in 2021 for murdering Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in a park just miles away from the chancellery. The court found that he had shot Mr. Khangoshvili in the back. The court convicted Mr. Krasikov in December 2021. The judge left no doubt that Mr. Krasikov had been sent by Moscow and found that he had been supported by a network in Germany. Shortly after the conviction, the German government called in the Russian ambassador to reprimand him, and it expelled two Russian diplomats. At the time, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the contract killing constituted \u201ca serious violation of German law and the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany.\u201d Show more Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT","question":"Where did the prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia take place in August 2024?","answer":"The exchange took place at Esenbo\u011fa Airport in Ankara, Turkey.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future event information, including events that may occur in August 2024.

We are achieving our strategic goal,\" Mr Zelensky said in his evening address, published on Telegram. Mr Zelensky also appealed to partners to allow long-range strikes on targets inside Russia. \"The bolder the partners' decisions, the less Putin can do,\" he said. Earlier, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine will allow the evacuation of civilians from Russia's Kursk region into Russia and Ukraine and admit international humanitarian organisations to the area where its troops have launched a major offensive. \"Our military forces plan to... open humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians: both in the direction of Russia and of Ukraine,\" she said. Destroyed houses following recent Russian shelling in the village of Loknya, in the Sumy region, near the border with Russia Ukraine was also planning to create a \"buffer zone\" in the Kursk region, to prevent Russia shelling its territory from there. \"The creation of a buffer zone in the Kursk region is a step to protect our border communities from daily hostile shelling,\" Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said on Telegram. Mr Zelensky said earlier that Kyiv's forces were continuing to advance in Russia's Kursk region and that they had moved forward 1-2km in various directions since the start of the day. In a video posted on his Telegram account, Mr Zelensky was shown speaking by video link with his top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, who said Ukrainian forces had captured 100 Russian prisoners of war during the cross-border incursion today. Thousands of Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of 6 August into Russia's western Kursk region in what President Vladimir Putin said was a major provocation that was aimed at gaining a stronger hand in possible future ceasefire talks. In an embarrassment for Russia, Ukraine carved out a slice of Kursk and though Mr Putin said the Russian army would push out the Ukrainian troops, intense battles have so far failed to expel them. \"The situation still remains difficult,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, an influential Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. \"The enemy still has the initiative, and so, albeit slowly, it is increasing its presence in the Kursk region,\" he said.

It said missiles had also been shot down and showed Sukhoi Su-34 bombers pounding Ukrainian positions in Kursk. Russian commanders had said that the front in Kursk had stabilised, though Mr Zelensky said his forces were continuing to advance there and ordered his generals to develop the next \"key steps\" in the operation. US President Joe Biden said US officials are in constant touch with Ukraine over the invasion of Russia, which he said had \"created a real dilemma\" for Mr Putin, who ordered thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022. The White House said Ukraine did not provide advance notice of its incursion and the United States had no involvement in the operation, though Russian officials have suggested Ukraine's Western backers must have known of the attack. A Ukrainian serviceman drives a self-propelled howitzer 2S1 Gvozdika in the Sumy region, near the border with Russia A US official said the goal of the Kursk incursion appeared to be to force Russia to pull troops out of Ukraine to defend Russian territory against the cross-border assault. The Ukrainian assault on Russia, the biggest by a foreign force since World War II, has dramatically changed the narrative around the war. Russia had been advancing since the failure of Ukraine's 2023 counter-offensive to make any major gains against Moscow's forces. President Putin said on Monday that Ukraine \"with the help of its western masters\" was aiming to improve Kyiv's negotiating position ahead of possible peace talks and to slow the advance of Russian forces. But in a sign the attack is hardening the Kremlin's position, Mr Putin questioned what negotiations there could be with an enemy he accused of firing indiscriminately at Russian civilians and nuclear facilities. Russian officials say Ukraine is trying to show its western backers that it can still muster major military operations just as pressure mounts on both countries to agree to talk about halting the war. By bringing the war to Russia, Ukraine has forced nearly 200,000 Russians to evacuate border regions. Governor of Russia's border region of Belgorod Vyacheslav Gladkov declared a regionwide state of emergency, citing continued attacks by Ukrainian forces.

What's in US peace plan? Watch Michael Clarke explain David Blevins: Trump closer to throwing in towel than ending war Ivor Bennett: Moscow's demands set in stone Live reporting by Mark Wyatt 08:37:33 Zelenskyy cutting South Africa trip short after Russian strikes Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just posted on Telegram reacting to Russia's deadly overnight attacks across Ukraine. He says 44 days have passed since Kyiv agreed to a complete ceasefire but says Russia \"continues to kill people and avoid tough pressure and accountability for this\". \"It is very important that everyone in the world sees and understands what is really happening.\" Volodymyr Zelenskyy Reflecting on missile and drone attacks launched by Moscow overnight, Zelenskyy said there is \"a lot of destruction\" and that, as of now, \"more than 80 people have been injured throughout Ukraine\". South Africa visit cut short As we mentioned in a previous post, Zelenskyy is in South Africa this morning, where he will meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa. But, following last night's attacks, Zelenskyy says he will now cut short part of his visit and will immediately return to Ukraine. He says his foreign affairs minister will instead hold \"all necessary meetings\" in South Africa to \"fully inform the country's political and public leaders about the situation\". 08:20:35 Hundreds of Russian drones and missiles fired at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv says Ukraine's air force says Russia launched 215 drones and missiles at the country during its overnight attack. It said the attack involved 11 ballistic missiles, 55 cruise missiles, four glide bombs and 145 drones. Of those, 48 missiles and 64 drones were shot down, it added. It said 68 drones were \"lost in location\", likely as a result of Ukraine's use of electronic warfare to misdirect them. It said the \"main direction of the attack\" was Kyiv, where Ukrainian authorities have reported at least nine people were killed. 08:00:01 Zelenskyy in South Africa to meet president today Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Pretoria last night for talks today with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on bilateral cooperation\nand efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine. Commenting on the visit, Zelenskyy said he would meet Ramaphosa as well as other political and civil representatives. \"It is crucial to bring a just peace closer. We are working to ensure that the G20 countries are actively engaged in diplomatic efforts\" he said. South Africa has remained neutral in the war in Ukraine. Ramaphosa held a phone call with Vladimir Putin on Monday, stating that the two leaders had affirmed \"strong bilateral relations\" and a commitment to work together toward a peaceful end to the war. 07:36:12 'Mobile phones heard ringing under ruins' in Kyiv A \"major rescue operation\" is under way in Kyiv after Russia's overnight drone and missile attack. \"Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins,\" Ukraine's interior minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram. \"The search will continue until everybody is got out.\" Klymenko said engineering forces, climbers and search dogs were all being used to help emergency services in the rescue operation. More than 70 people suffered injuries from the attack, with nine people so far confirmed to have died. 07:21:03 'Massive combined strike' shows 'Russian peace in all its glory' As well as hitting Kyiv with overnight attacks, Russian missile and drone strikes were also reported in various other regions of Ukraine. The country's interior minister said Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were all hit in the \"massive combined strike,\" but Kyiv was hit hardest. The capital's military chief, Tymur Tkachenko, described the attack as \"Russian peace in all its glory.\" In response to the attack, Poland's air force scrambled allied fighter jets to protect the country's own airspace from missiles that may stray into Polish territory. 06:56:40 Trump says peace deal is 'very close' - but Zelenskyy is 'prolonging' war Before Russia launched its overnight attacks, Donald Trump had suggested a peace deal in Ukraine was \"very close\". JD Vance had earlier laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would freeze the frontlines \"close to where they are today\", adding that Ukraine and Russia would both have to \"give up some of the territory they currently own\". The deal is also slated to include US recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, the Ukrainian region Moscow illegally annexed in 2014. That point appears to be a sticking point for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly said that Ukraine would not accept giving up Crimea as part of peace negotiations. That's irked Trump, who suggested in the Oval Office last night he found it easier to deal with Russia than he did Zelebskyy. \"I think Russia is ready and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \"I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it's been harder. But, I think we have a deal with both.\" In an earlier post on Truth Social yesterday, Trump said Zelenskyy's stance over Crimea will \"do nothing but prolong the 'killing field', and nobody wants that\". Watch: Is Trump really 'close' to securing a deal for Ukraine? 06:38:50 Ukraine: 'Putin only shows desire to kill' We're starting to get some political reaction to Russia's overnight missile and drone attacks on Kyiv. Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff, says the attacks prove that Vladimir Putin is not interested in peace. \"Russia is attacking Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities with missiles and drones right now,\" Yermak said on X. \"Putin only demonstrates a desire to kill.  The fire must cease. The attacks on civilians must stop.\" 06:30:19 In pictures: Explosions in sky as Putin's missiles hit Kyiv We can now bring you a series of images showing how Russia's overnight missile and drone attack on Kyiv unfolded. Explosions were initially heard in the capital at around 1am local time (10pm UK time), with further explosions coming around three hours later. Authorities said nine people were killed, while Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko added that six children, as well as a pregnant woman, were among the injured. 06:15:20 Nine dead after Russian missiles hit Kyiv, authorities say A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack hit Kyiv overnight, killing nine people and injuring another 63, Ukrainian authorities said. Kyiv's military administration said on its Telegram channel this morning that Russia struck the capital with drones and ballistic missiles. Fires were reported in several residential buildings, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the administration. 06:15:06 Welcome back to our live coverage Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. The authorities in Kyiv have reported a large-scale Russian attack on the capital overnight that killed nine people - we'll bring you more on that in a moment. The deadly attack comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war ramped up yesterday as a US-backed, seven-point peace plan emerged while Western officials met for talks in London. Donald Trump said those talks \"went well\" and that he \"thinks we have a deal\" with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin - but he also hit out at the Ukrainian president and accused him of preventing peace. Before we resume our updates, here's a look at how the last 24 hours unfolded: Foreign ministers from the UK, US, France, Germany and Ukraine scrapped a plan to meet in London for high-level talks on ending the war in Ukraine; David Lammy, the UK's foreign secretary, and John Healey, defence secretary, still met their Ukrainian counterparts, but somewhat sidelined Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg led the US delegation; It was held after reports revealed Trump's seven-point peace plan, which most notably mentioned that the US would formally recognise Russian sovereignty over annexed Crimea; But Trump once again ramped the pressure up on Zelenskyy to agree to a peace deal, saying his opposing stance on Crimea \"will do nothing but prolong the killing field\"; Those comments came after JD Vance said an \"explicit\" proposal had been given to Russia and Ukraine, reiterating \"it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process\".","question":"What type of weaponry did the United Kingdom allow Ukraine to use inside Russia in August 2024?","answer":"The United Kingdom permitted Ukraine to use British weaponry, including Challenger 2 tanks, for military operations inside Russia.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future information.

The decree allows those who reject gender change, LGBT policies, and criticism of traditional religions to obtain Russian residence permits more easily, bypassing certain standard procedures outlined in Russian legislation. Specifically, they will not be required to provide documentation proving proficiency in the Russian, knowledge of Russian history, or understanding of Russian laws. Applicants can cite their opposition to the policies of their home countries, which impose what they view as \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes that contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values,\" as the reason for their appeal. Under the decree, the Russian Foreign Ministry is tasked with presenting the president with a list of countries that promote these \"destructive neoliberal ideological views\" which are deemed incompatible with Russian spiritual and moral values. In 2013, Russian lawmakers prohibited the promotion of LGBT values, with the law being updated in 2022. It provides for a maximum punishment of fines of up to 5 million rubles ($56,200). In 2023, the international LGBT movement was classified as an extremist organization and banned in Russia.

KYIV -- Russia launched a major missile-and-drone assault on multiple locations around Ukraine flattening residential buildings in Kyiv, killing at least nine people, and wounding scores of others across the country. The April 24 overnight attack -- one of the largest in months -- came just hours after the White House presented Ukrainian officials with what amounted to an ultimatum about a US proposal to end the 38-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine. Western efforts to try and resolve the Ukraine war -- or even a temporary cease-fire -- have sputtered in recent days, as Russia shows no indication it will ease its assault, and Ukraine pushes back on US proposals. Foreign ministers and top diplomats were scheduled to meet in London on April 23 for talks on the war. But they were effectively downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio pulled out of the meetings at the last minute. That decision was reportedly prompted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejecting a US proposal that Washington might formally recognize Russian control over the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. That would be a major reversal of longstanding US policy. It is also seen as potentially political suicide for any Ukrainian officials. \u201cThere is nothing to talk about. This violated our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the London talks. Late April 23, US President Donald Trump lashed out directly at Zelenskyy, on social media and in remarks to reporters. He also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin was open to the US proposals. Trump's lead envoy for Russia, Steve Witkoff, is set to fly to Moscow on April 25 for expected meetings with Putin. \"I think Russia is ready and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,\" Trump told reporters. \u201cI thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far it\u2019s harder.\u201d In a post to X, Zelenskyy responded to Trump, and included a copy of a 2018 US State Department statement that called on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea. Trump had vowed to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office. But the negotiations have proven difficult, as Russia targets both civilian and military sites across the country, while pressing its advantage on the battlefield. Ukraine's military said more than 210 missiles and drones were launched in the overnight assault, including ballistic missiles and cruise missiles launched by heavy bombers and Black Sea naval ships. More than 100 missiles were downed or intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, the military claimed . \"Kyiv and its region, Zhytomyr, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytsky, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhya regions were under a massive combined Russian attack,\" Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram . A number of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the capital Kyiv, and officials said at least nine people were killed and scores of people were wounded. Rescuers rushed to pull survivors from building debris, listening for cell phones ringing to try and locate people. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, was also hit by at least several missiles, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. It was no immediately clear if there were casualties. Ukraine's foreign minister, who traveled to London despite the downgraded meetings, lashed out at Putin, criticized the Trump administration. \u201cPutin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war,\" Andrii Sybiha said on X . \u201cRussia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace. Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied,\u201d he wrote. The downgrading of the London meetings highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talk amid Trump's complaints of a lack of progress in the negotiations. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you.\" Ukrainian and US officials were also set to sign a deal this week that would give US companies access to Ukraine's valuable mineral resources. That agreement has also been the subject of difficult negotiations, and resulted in an acrimonious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February. With reporting by Reuters and AFP Read more April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL's Belarus Service Lithuania Accuses Russia, Belarus Of Plotting Violent Attacks On Belarusian Exiles Members of the Belarusian diaspora celebrate the Day of Freedom in Vilnius, Lithuania, on March 25. Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD) says it has uncovered a covert operation by Russian and Belarusian intelligence services aimed at inciting violence against Belarusian exiles living in Lithuania. The plot, involving staged provocations and disinformation campaigns, was revealed in a statement released by the VSD and reported by the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT. According to Lithuanian authorities, foreign intelligence services have been orchestrating increasingly dangerous incidents targeting the Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania, which numbered more than 57,000 people as of early 2025. Authorities say foreign agents have attempted to simulate clashes between so-called \"Litvinist\" Belarusians -- followers of an ideology tying Belarusian identity to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania -- and fabricated Lithuanian nationalist groups. \"The organizers are trying to stage conflicts between opposing forces -- Belarusians who advocate for Litvinist ideas and so-called Lithuanian groups who appear to resist them,\u201d the VSD said. Recent Provocations Officials stressed that no real extremist Litvinist groups have been identified in Lithuania, and that they believe the narrative is being manipulated in Belarusian and Russian propaganda to stir mistrust and division. Recent provocations include fake video messages allegedly from Belarusian soldiers, anti-Belarusian graffiti, threats against Lithuanian lawmakers and Vilnius-based exiles, and social media campaigns spreading pseudohistorical claims about the region's past. The VSD warned residents not to fall for such provocations, noting that \"participation in these activities could lead to administrative or criminal liability.\" Meanwhile, there has been growing scrutiny of Belarusian nationals living in Lithuania. Many face increasingly strict visa checks, difficulties extending residence permits, and even deportation due to past affiliations with Belarusian state institutions or the military. Lithuanian media have labeled the disinformation campaign \u201cLitvinism.\u201d Authorities emphasize that the real danger lies not in the ideology itself, but in its exploitation to destabilize communities. In recognition of its reporting on this issue, the Lithuanian government's Department of National Minorities recently presented an award to RFE\/RL\u2019s Belarus Service for an investigative piece that shed light on the actors behind the campaign and its broader geopolitical implications. Read more April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Judge Orders Steps To Reverse Shutdown Of US Government Funded Broadcaster VOA A sign for the US broadcaster Voice of America is seen in Washington, D.C. (file photo) A federal court judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to reverse its efforts aimed at forcing the closure of Voice of America (VOA), which was shut down last month in a move the broadcaster had called illegal. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled late on April 22 to grant a preliminary injunction that says officials must \"take all necessary steps\" to restore employees and contractors to their positions at VOA and to restore Congress-approved funding to two other U.S.-government funded broadcasters -- Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks -- and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts. Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees the federal broadcasters, also ordered the media outlets to provide monthly status reports showing the USAGM was complying with the order to allow the outlets to \"provide news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive.\" The USAGM has not responded publicly to the court decision. VOA last month filed a lawsuit saying the Trump administration has taken \u201ca chainsaw\u201d approach to the USAGM through an executive order that directed it and six other federal agencies to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\u201d The USAGM subsequently placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and terminated some 600 contractors, forcing VOA to stop its broadcasts for the first time since it was founded in 1942. The USAGM had argued in the case that no \"final decision\" on VOA's future had been made and that the lawsuits should be treated as \"employment disputes\" with those workers who had been terminated. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty has also filed a lawsuit against the USAGM \u201cto avoid irreparable harm\u201d to the broadcaster over the withholding of its Congress-approved grant as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to terminate RFE\/RL\u2019s funding. RFE\/RL's case continues to be pursued in court. Read more April 23, 2025 By Ray Furlong and Mike Eckel Officials Call Ukraine Peace Talks 'Substantive' Despite Last-Minute No-Shows (From left to right) British Defense Minister John Healey, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov after talks in London on April 23, 2025. Officials from Ukraine, the United States, and Europe said a meeting in London was \"substantive\" despite the last-minute postponement of a broader set of talks with foreign ministers. The April 23 talks, which were aimed at trying to resolve Russia's 38-month war on Ukraine, were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting and casting a major pall over ongoing peace efforts. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy also opted to skip the meetings, leaving a Ukrainian delegation that included Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top aide -- to meet with lower-level officials and US Ukraine envoy Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. In the end, the talks involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said. Zelenskyy said emotions had \"run high\" during the meeting but it was good that the representatives of five countries met to bring peace closer. \"The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . Speaking to reporters at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he thought the London talks went well. He also said he thinks he has a deal with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the war. But he also implied that a deal with Zelenskyy remained elusive, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been more difficult to deal with than Putin. Putin was quoted as saying he viewed the deal on the table positively and hoped that Ukraine feels the same way. Trump and Zelenskyy are both scheduled to attend the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on April 25. There has been no announcement of a meeting between the two. The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain at the London talks highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talks. It also came after Trump complained of a lack of progress in the negotiations, prompting him to threaten to make a deal soon or Washington will walk away from the table. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL. '\"We don't have time for you, we have other things to do.\" Last week, Rubio and other Ukrainian and European officials met in Paris for talks that yielded what many saw was minor progress toward a resolution of the war. But Rubio later signaled US impatience with the status of the talks and suggested the United States might pull out entirely from all involvement in the negotiations. Trump again warned Ukraine that it needs to make a deal to end the fighting while sharply criticizing Zelenskyy for saying Kyiv sees any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia -- reportedly a condition the United States has put on the table in the talks -- is a red line for Ukraine. \"It\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\" Trump said in a social media post in which he denied anyone is asking Ukraine recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire -- He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\" Trump added. Zelenskyy in his post on X included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day during a trip to India, US Vice President JD Vance said Washington had issued a \u201cvery explicit proposal\u201d to Russia and Ukraine, though he gave no details. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance said. \u201cThe current lines, somewhere close to them is where you\u2019re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,\u201d he said.

The Kremlin on April 23 refused to comment on rumored proposals and said the downgrading of the London talks showed that the countries involved still needed to narrow their differences as there were \"a lot of nuances\" that still need resolving. Britain's Defense Secretary John Healy told lawmakers on April 22 there was no evidence that Russia had let up its attacks on Ukraine, chiding Putin as someone who says he wants peace but \"has rejected a full cease-fire...and continues to play for time in the negotiations.\" Healy and Lammy held talks with the Ukrainian delegation during the day on April 23, with Kellogg also in attendance. He called the talks \"substantial,\" while Lammy wrote in a social media post that \"we are working at pace with US, Ukraine, and European allies to end the war and secure a just and lasting peace.\" RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report Read more Updated April 23, 2025 By RFE\/RL Deadly Russian Drone Strike Hits Bus In Wave Of Attacks On Ukraine's Regions Ukrainian rescuers evacuate a wounded person from a bus damaged by a Russian drone strike in the town of Marhanets, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, on April 23. A Russian drone attack hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian town of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens of others, local authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, saying that Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacks on civilians are 'commonplace' in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions, as well as the frontline cities of Kupyansk and Pokrovsk. \"Russians struck a bus which was transporting workers of a mining and processing plant.

Speaking at a meeting of the State Military-Industrial Commission on April 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than 1.5 million drones of various types had been produced in Russia last year. Putin added that this amount included about 4,000 FPV drones. A wave of Russia's attacks also targeted civilian infrastructure across other Ukrainian regions. At least five people were reported injured in the Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Odesa. \"Residential buildings, business facilities, warehouses, and garages have been damaged,\" Ukraine's emergency service said . Large-scale fires had also broken out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said . The emergency service said the attack targeted 'solely the city's civilian infrastructure.' Meanwhile, in the Yelabuga district of Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, two fires broke out following a reported drone attack, local authorities confirmed on April 23. The Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over Tatarstan by air defense systems on duty. Officials have not released further details on the type of drone or its intended target. Rustem Nuriyev, head of the Yelabuga district administration, said in a statement that there were no casualties or injuries as a result of the incident. In response to the drone activity, temporary flight restrictions were imposed on Kazan and Nizhnekamsk airports. Kyiv has not commented on the incident. Also, a fire that had been burning at an ammunition depot on a military base -- where a large explosion occurred a day earlier -- in the Kirzhach district of Russia's Vladimir region, northeast of Moscow, has been \u201cgradually ending,\u201d regional Governor Aleksandr Avdeyev said. Four people were injured when ammunition exploded, prompting an evacuation order, Avdeyev said , adding that ammunition caught fire and shells exploded in the storage area. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that the fire had been caused by a breach of safety protocols and had resulted in the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse. \"As a result of a fire on the territory of a military unit in the Vladimir region, ammunition stored in a warehouse detonated,\" the Defense Ministry said. \"According to preliminary information...the cause of the fire was a violation of safety standards in work with explosive materials.\" A state of emergency was declared in the Kirzhach district, which is about 130 kilometers northeast of the Russian capital. The base was evacuated along with about 450 people from at least seven nearby settlements, the governor said. The ammunition depot is one of the largest of the Russian armed forces. It is more than 500 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. There had been no reports of drone attacks in the Vladimir region prior to the explosion. Yan Matveyev, a Russian military analyst, told Current Time that the ammunition stored at the depot could range from typical 155-millimeter artillery shells to Iskander-M missiles. \"This depot is close to the capital, close to Moscow, so it's easy to transport all this [ammunition] around the country,\" Matveyev said. Unverified video published earlier on Telegram channels showed a huge fire ball, a loud blast, and clouds of thick smoke rising into the sky. Baza, a Telegram channel close to security services, said 10 to 11 explosions had occurred and firefighters from neighboring regions had been called in to contain the blaze. It said a special commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire.

(file photo) Farmers in Uzbekistan say the government is forcing them to surrender land to Chinese businesses under the guise of state-backed development, taking thousands of hectares of fertile cotton and wheat fields out of the hands of locals. Concerned over the fate of the lush lands of the Ferghana Valley, they told Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty that large patches of land have been taken into the state reserve and transferred to Chinese businessmen. Official documents say the land transfers are voluntary. But dozens of accounts given to RFE\/RL from those who signed over their land appear to describe a different reality: coercion, threats, and intimidation by Uzbek law enforcement officers acting on orders from local officials. \"The governor told me: 'This is a presidential order. Either give up the land or go to jail,'\" said one farmer who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal for commenting publicly on the issue. Creeping Influence? Land transfers in the Ferghana Valley, which is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, are the latest flashpoint in what is becoming an increasingly visible and volatile undercurrent across Central Asia -- a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment driven by land disputes, debt dependency, labor market tensions, and fears of creeping influence.

Neither the local government nor the prosecutor can take it away. According to the legislation, the land can only be seized by the state by court decision. Farmers, though, say and seizures are being carried out based on a verbal order from Shuhrat Abdurahmonov, the head of the region. \"I did not want to give up my land and put up some resistance, but in response, the district governor called more than 20 police officers and the National Guard to the district administration building and ordered them to arrest me and my wife,\" a farmer from Qurgonteppa district told RFE\/RL. \"That is why none of the farmers resist now; otherwise, they could be imprisoned. It is unlikely that any of us would be able to get out of there alive and well.\" Regional administrations failed to comment on the claims by farmers when contacted by RFE\/RL. Concerns over China taking over the use of large swaths of land extend beyond the farming community. Beijing's economic presence in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. As of early 2025, China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion. Over 3,400 Chinese firms operate in the country, surpassing even the number of Russian entities. Similar patterns have emerged in other Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan.

Uzbek political analyst Nargiza Muratalieva points out that Central Asian countries are increasingly falling into what she calls China's \"economic trap:\" easy access to credit -- often with opaque terms -- that can eventually leave weaker states vulnerable to political pressure or asset forfeiture. Muratalieva points out that Beijing gained over 1,100 square kilometers of land in Tajikistan in 2011 in exchange for debt relief, a clear example of the potential consequences of falling into this \"trap.\" China is already the largest lender in Uzbekistan, with outstanding loans totaling $3.8 billion. \"The general characteristics of Chinese lending for all countries in the region are the ease of obtaining debts, their difficult repayment, as well as the lack of transparency of procedures and specific conditions,\" according to Muratalieva.

Whether it's propaganda or not, the fear that China could one day treat Kazakhs or Uzbeks the same way has further sown seeds of opposition to Beijing's expanding presence. \"It turns out that the Chinese really like my land; they want to take the land from other farmers too. Naturally, we are against it, but the district governor, the prosecutor, and the police chief continue to put pressure on us,\" one farmer from Uzbekistan's western Andijon region told RFE\/RL. \"What worries us most is that they can subsequently seize our country and do to us the same as they did to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\" SEE ALSO: Trump's Tariffs, Like Russian Sanctions, Benefit Chinese EVs In Central Asia Read more April 22, 2025 By Ray Furlong , RFE\/RL's Russian Service and Current Time Russia Issues Warrant For Film Critic Turned War Critic Yekaterina Barabash in court. In a baggy red blouse and matching glasses, Yekaterina Barabash was pictured apparently blowing kisses from behind a bulletproof glass screen when she stood in the dock at a Moscow court. A well-known film critic, she was sentenced to two months of house arrest for allegedly spreading \u201clies\u201d about the Russian military\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. Now, Russian authorities have issued a wanted note for her and she faces up to 10 years in prison after they found the 63-year-old wasn\u2019t home during a check on April 13. On April 21, the Russian prison agency issued a statement saying that she wasn\u2019t home when they called several days earlier. Subsequently, a Moscow court changed her sentence, meaning that she now faces prison. Friends of Barabash contacted by RFE\/RL declined to comment on her disappearance amid fears for her safety. Barabash has been an occasional guest on RFE\/RL\u2019s Russian Service programs for some years and has often criticized the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip on society. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, she immediately condemned it. Russian forces \u201chave bombed the country, levelled whole cities to the ground,\u201d she wrote a few weeks into the conflict. Words such as these were a direct challenge to the Kremlin\u2019s narrative, which banned the word \u201cwar\u201d and denied that civilians were being targeted in attacks despite evidence to the contrary. Shortly after the invasion began, Russia passed new legislation providing jail sentences for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the armed forces. It has been used to jail hundreds of people since the war began, and has led to many others keeping silent. Barabash in court. Moscow, February 26, 2025. In a recent case , a 19-year-old woman in St. Petersburg received a nearly three-year prison sentence for gluing a short verse to a statue of a Ukrainian poet. The same law eventually led to Barabash\u2019s arrest in February 2025. In court, prosecutors said she had distributed \u201cintentionally false information about the activities of the Russian military\u201d on social media. After receiving her sentence, she emerged from the court declaring \u201cat least I\u2019ll have two months of freedom,\u201d suggesting perhaps that she expected a jail sentence in the future.

Massive Russian aerial strikes hit residential buildings in several Ukrainian cities, leaving at least one dead and more than two dozen injured, including several children, in attacks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"deliberate terror.\" Two guided aerial bomb strikes hit the city of Zaporizhzhya on April 22, killing one woman and injuring 38 others -- four of whom were children and a pregnant woman, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone attacks were also seen in the city of Kharkiv, though casualty figures were unknown. The daytime strikes came after a drone attack overnight sparked massive fires in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, where a a housing block in a densely inhabited area was hit. The attack left one woman dead and at least three other residents injured. The attack came amid ongoing diplomatic activity to secure a cease-fire in the Ukraine war, following Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. \"All of this is absolutely deliberate Russian terror that can be stopped by a single order, an order in Russia and for the Russian Army,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \"Our proposal for a cease-fire regarding civilian buildings also remains in force. Russia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this. There are no obstacles on the Ukrainian side and there will be none.\" Across the country, the Ukrainian Air Force reported dozens of drone attacks overnight. Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhaniv wrote on social media on April 22 that many apartments had been damaged and that \u201cthe residents are in shock.\u201d Emergency services posted photos and videos of fire crew battling blazes at what they said was civilian infrastructure. The renewed attacks came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that his forces were attacking civilian targets in Ukraine.

Avdeyev did not provide details but said emergency services were on site. Telegram channels reported the blast happened in the village of Barsovo, near military unit 11785, also known as the 51st arsenal of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, which stores ammunition. Residents reported several explosions. A \"powerful attack\" was reported, prompting evacuations in Barsovo and nearby villages within a 5 km radius. Roads to Kirzhach from Moscow were blocked. Local authorities announced a state of emergency in the area. Russia also launched large-scale missile strikes on Easter Monday on April 21, following the expiry of a self-declared 30-hour Easter truce. Kyiv claimed Russian forces violated the truce 3,000 times. On April 22, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot dismissed the truce as a \u201cmarketing operation\u201d by Putin aimed primarily at US President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at continuing Russian attacks as he pushes diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said he spoke to Barrot the previous evening to coordinate positions ahead of a meeting in London on April 23. The London meeting was set to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, following a gathering in Paris on April 18 -- the first joint talks in this format since Trump took office. Barrot told FranceInfo that the European countries used that meeting to tell Washington what their red lines were for a deal. Trump has said he\u2019s hopeful an agreement can be wrapped up this week, which feels ambitious to many observers. But in another sign that diplomacy is picking up steam, Putin said on April 21 that he was ready for direct talks with Zelenskyy -- something that he had until recently refused.

Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin's proposal but said Ukraine \"was ready for any conversation\" about a cease-fire that would stop strikes on civilians. \"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure.\" SEE ALSO: Zelenskyy Demands Russia Return Ukrainian Children In New International Campaign Ukraine and Russia are facing pressure from the United States to make progress on negotiations to end the war.

Ukrainian authorities reported dozens of Russian missile and drone attacks on April 21, while a Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. Russian forces attacked Ukraine's northeastern region, killing one person in a border village, according to regional prosecutors. The report on Telegram said a Russian drone struck and killed a man on a scooter in the village of Ivashki. Russian forces also launched a late night drone attack on residential areas of Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, triggering fires and damaging many apartments, local officials said early on April 22. A day earlier US President Donald Trump voiced hope that an agreement would be reached between the two countries this week. Trump told reporters at the White House on April 21 that he plans to comment on the war in Ukraine and mediation efforts in the next three days. He made the comment in response to a question about whether the United States had proposed that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014 and then annexed it in violation of international law. \"So I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,\" Trump said. \"But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,\" he added without providing details. In his comments earlier on April 21, Putin said Russia was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv. \"We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude toward any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,\" Putin said on state TV. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when Putin said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, he meant bilateral negotiations. There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week.

At age 16, Vladyslav Rudenko was captured by Russian forces and held in children\u2019s camps in Russia-occupied Crimea and Kherson for nine months. Unlike some 20,000 other Ukrainian youths, Rudenko was rescued by the NGO Save Ukraine and returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after nine months in captivity. It's the fate of those thousands, many of whom remain in Russian-occupied areas -- in what Moscow calls \u201crehabilitation centers\u201d -- that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials say they are now focused on. \"This crime must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held accountable,\" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said over the weekend as part of the launch of the ChildrenAreNonNegotiable campaign. \"A just and lasting peace requires the return of all these Ukrainian children home.\" SEE ALSO: Amid Interrogations And Threats, Ukrainian Civilians Flee Russian Occupation US President Donald Trump has made ending Europe's longest conflict since World War II a top foreign policy priority since taking office three months ago. While the talks have lurched between several contentious issues, Ukrainian officials have kept the repatriation of all of those taken from Ukraine a major negotiating point. Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of orchestrating what some groups have called a \"systematic deportation\" of children out of Ukraine and into Russia-controlled parts of the country, or even further to destinations in Russia and its ally, Belarus. Evidence gathered last year by RFE\/RL's Belarus Service and Schemes , the investigative unit of RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service, indicated camps were being used to teach young Ukrainians to identify with concepts that both Moscow and Minsk promote. That came after a November 2023 study by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab that deemed Ukrainian schoolchildren's escorted trips to Belarus were coordinated by Belarus and Russia as part of the two countries' so-called Union State. SEE ALSO: Abducted Ukrainian Children: Calls Made To Continue Search For Kids Taken By Russia As US Closes Investigation Team The study said the process involves \"re-education,\" which it defined as \"the promotion of cultural, historical, societal, and patriotic messages or ideas that serve the political interests\" of both regimes. Military training, including by Interior Ministry troops, occurred with \"at least six groups of children,\" according to the report. Rudenko told RFE\/RL's Ukrainian service earlier this month that during the time he was held by Russian authorities his daily routine had an obvious orientation. \u201cWe woke up to the Russian anthem, raised the flag, did exercises. After breakfast, they told us what had happened in Russia overnight. Literally. Then we went to watch Russian movies,\" he said, recalling his regiment while held in camps. According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab more than 8,400 children from Ukraine have been systematically relocated to at least 57 facilities: 13 facilities in Belarus and 43 facilities in Russia and Russia-occupied territory. According to Ukraine\u2019s official government portal childrenofwar.gov.ua , a much higher number -- around 20,000 -- have been taken away and only 1,300 children have been successfully returned. \u201cWe remind the world that without the return of the children abducted by Russia, the war cannot truly be considered over,\u201d a statement published by Zelenskyy's office during Easter said. Washington has supported Kyiv on the issue of repatriating children, saying last month it remains committed to supporting the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. However, Ukrainian officials are worried recent budget cutting moves by the Trump administration could significantly hinder investigations into where the children have been moved and efforts to enable their return. Meanwhile, Karolina Hird, deputy team leader and an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, warned that Ukrainian teenagers forced to accept Russian citizenship may face conscription into the Russian army and could be forced to fight against their own people, a violation of international law. \u201cNegotiations and an end to the fighting without consideration for the deported children will empower Russia to continue to commit these crimes with absolute impunity,\u201d Hird wrote .

Despite his illness, his death came as a shock after he had been driven around St. Peter's Square to greet cheering crowds on Easter Sunday. \"Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vatican's TV channel on April 21. \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father,\" he said. Francis, who had also delivered a blessing at this year's Easter services a day before his death, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first pontiff born outside Europe in over a millennium. At the Vatican, locals, tourists, and pilgrims visiting for Easter expressed their shock and grief. \"This is something that really hits you hard,\" Rome resident Emanuela Tinari told Reuters. \"He was a pope who brought so many people closer to the church. He was not appreciated by everyone. But he definitely was by ordinary people.\" Embed share Around The World, People Mourn The Pope Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:02:20 0:00 Tributes have also been pouring in for the late pontiff from leaders around the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin published a statement saying Francis \"enjoyed great international authority as a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious statesman, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice.\" \"Throughout his pontificate, he actively contributed to the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive interaction between Russia and the Holy See,\" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also praised the pope's tenure, describing the pontiff as someone who \"knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\" \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,\" he added. \"We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!\" 'Painful And Shameful' -- Pope Francis On The Ukraine War Pope Francis, who died on April 21, Easter Monday, did not deliver his final annual Angelus address in person. But the text of his address said the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 was \u201ca painful and shameful occasion for all of humanity.\" He went on to voice \u201csolidarity with the martyred Ukrainian people.\" The Pontiff\u2019s death-bed statement was his last attempt to give the Vatican a voice in the conflict. While he was clearly sympathetic to the plight of Ukrainians, Pope Francis\u2019 previous interventions were not always welcomed by Kyiv. He raised particular ire in March 2024 by calling on Ukraine to find \"the courage of the white flag\u201d to enter peace talks with Russia. He later said that the \u201cfirst condition\u201d for peace was that Russia \u201cput an end to its aggression.\u201d But earlier, his avoidance of specific criticism of Russia was a cause of frustration. In June 2022, he condemned the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Russian forces while also suggesting the war was \u201cperhaps somehow provoked.\u201d This echoed a Kremlin argument, repeatedly made without evidence, that it was forced to attack. -- By Ray Furlong, senior international corresponden t \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Trump announced later on the same social media platform that he and first lady Melania Trump would attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome. Trump's predecessor also praised Frances on social media. \"He promoted equity and an end to poverty and suffering across the globe,\" said Joe Biden, himself a devout Roman Catholic. US Vice President JD Vance, who met with the pontiff on April 20, said his heart \"goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis,\" adding that \"he inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.\" Moldovan President Maia Sandu also expressed regret at the news of Francis's death, saying that he had \"tirelessly promoted compassion and social justice\" and \"led with love, stood by the vulnerable, and called for unity in times of division.\" Her comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the pope had been \"a man of humility, on the side of the most vulnerable and the most fragile.\" Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Francis would be remembered for his \"tireless commitment to the weakest in society.\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tweeted that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Francis's death. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to the news with a short a Facebook post that included a picture of him with the late pontiff. \"Thank you for everything, Holy Father,\" he said. \"We bid you farewell.\" An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman voiced sadness over Francis's death, saying that he offered \"condolences to all Christians around the world.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Francis was \"a spiritual leader who gave importance to dialogue between different faith groups and took the initiative in the face of humanitarian tragedies, especially the Palestinian issue and the genocide in Gaza.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev , Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani , Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze , and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajic also posted tributes to the pope. A Papacy Focused On Social Justice Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis worked as a chemical technician before entering the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a priest in 1969 and became the provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed archbishop of Buenos Aires. Three years later, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Elected Pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, reflecting his commitment to humility and the poor. Images From Francis's Years As Pope No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:01 0:00 His papacy was marked by a focus on mercy, social justice, and environmental stewardship. In 2015, Pope Francis issued the encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019,\u201d calling for global action on climate change and care for the environment. He also emphasized interfaith dialogue, notably signing the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Ahmed el-Tayeb, in 2019, a landmark agreement promoting peace and coexistence among different faiths. 'A Poor Church For The Poor' Pope Francis was known for his pastoral approach, advocating for a \u201cpoor Church for the poor\u201d and reaching out to marginalized communities. He made efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s financial systems and address alleged clerical sexual abuse within the church. In 2025, he published his autobiography, \u201cHope,\u201d offering insights into his life and papal mission. In his later years, Pope Francis faced several health challenges. In 2021, he underwent colon surgery to address diverticulitis, and in 2023, he had abdominal surgery to repair a hernia. He also experienced chronic knee and back pain, often using a wheelchair for mobility. Despite these issues, he maintained a rigorous schedule, continuing his pastoral duties and international travels. In early 2025, Pope Francis was hospitalized with a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, which developed into double pneumonia. His condition remained complex, requiring an extended hospital stay. He had been discharged from hospital on March 23.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would continue to mirror Russia's actions, following reports of further missile strikes by Moscow. In a Telegram post , Zelenskyy noted that Moscow had ignored both a proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire and a call to halt air strikes on civilian infrastructure, including missile and drone attacks. \u201cThe nature of Ukrainian actions will remain mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, and any Russian attacks will be met with our own. Actions always speak louder than words,\u201d he added. An Easter truce in fighting between Russia and Ukraine appeared to reduce some air strikes on Ukrainian cities, but Kyiv angrily claimed nearly 3,000 violations by Moscow\u2019s forces while calls for an extension went unheeded by the Kremlin. Nevertheless, US President Donald Trump said late on April 20 that \"hopefully, Ukraine and Russia will make a deal this week.\" \"Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform without elaboration. A unilateral truce was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 19, running from 6 p.m. that day until midnight on April 20.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said Moscow's actions following the midnight end to the truce will indicate the Kremlin's real attitude toward any initiatives to end the war. \"Regarding the so-called 'Easter Cease-fire,' we have still not heard Moscow\u2019s response to our proposal to extend it to 30 days,\" he wrote on X. \"Russia's actions after midnight, tomorrow, and throughout the week will reveal Russia\u2019s true attitude toward US peace efforts and the 30-day full cease-fire proposal. They will show whether Russia is serious about peace or Putin's statements from yesterday were simply manipulations,\" Sybiha added. The US State Department earlier said it would welcome an extension to the Easter cease-fire that was set to expire a few hours later. \"We have seen President Putin's announcement of a temporary cease-fire due to Easter. We remain committed to achieving a full and comprehensive cease-fire,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to news media. \"As we assess their seriousness in this instance, we would welcome it extending beyond Sunday,\" the statement added. In the early morning hours of April 21, Zelenskyy accused Russia of 2,935 violations following Putin's call for the Easter truce, although he added that there had been \"no air raid alerts\" during the period. \"Either Putin does not have full control over his army or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on April 20.

Kyiv had no immediate comment on the claim about retaking the Kursk region village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine. If confirmed, however, it would move Russian troops closer to fully expelling Ukrainian troops from Kursk, which has been a persistent embarrassment for the Kremlin. With Orthodox and Western Easter falling on the same day -- April 20 -- this year, Putin used a televised meeting with his top military commander to announce he was calling a two-day truce. The cease-fire, Putin said, would begin at 5 p.m. CET on April 19 and run until midnight on Easter Sunday, April 20. \"We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example,\" he said while meeting General Valery Gerasimov. \"At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel any possible violations of the truce or provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions.\" Zelenskyy quickly labeled the call \"yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives.\" Attack \"drones in our skies reveal Putin's true attitude toward Easter and toward human life,\" Zelenskyy said in a post to X .

But the United States and Western powers, eager to avoid direct military confrontation with Russia, said Ukraine had not given advance notice and that Washington was not involved, though weaponry provided by Britain and the U.S. is reported to have been used on Russian soil. Influential veteran Kremlin hawk Nikolai Patrushev dismissed the Western assertions in an interview with the Izvestia newspaper. \"The operation in the Kursk region was also planned with the participation of NATO and Western special services,\" he was quoted as saying, without offering evidence. \"Without their participation and direct support, Kyiv would not have ventured into Russian territory.\" The remarks implied that Ukraine's first acknowledged foray into sovereign Russian territory carried a high risk of escalation. Putin chaired a meeting of Russia's Security Council, including Patrushev, and said the discussion would focus on \"new technical solutions\" being employed in what Russia calls its special military operation. KREMLIN SAYS UKRAINE WILL PAY FOR US INVOLVEMENT \"Washington's efforts have created all the prerequisites for Ukraine to lose its sovereignty and lose part of its territories,\" Patrushev said. Ukraine said on Thursday that it had installed a military commandant in the area it controlled, even as Russia intensified its offensives in Ukraine's east. Russia's defence ministry for its part said it had repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks along the Kursk frontline. Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said Ukraine had destroyed a road bridge over the Seym river in the region's Glushkovsky district. State news agency TASS, citing Russian security officials, said that could hinder an ongoing evacuation of the frontier district's roughly 20,000 inhabitants. While the Ukrainian attack has revealed weaknesses in Russian defences and changed the public narrative of the conflict, Russian officials said Ukraine's \"terrorist invasion\" would not change the course of the war. Russia has been advancing for most of the year in the key eastern sector of the 1,000-km (620-mile) front and has vast numerical superiority. It controls 18% of Ukraine. After more than 10 days of fighting, Ukraine holds at least 450 sq km (175 sq miles) of territory, or less than 0.003% of Russia. But for Putin, the incursion crosses another red line. One Russian source told Reuters the incursion could embolden hardliners in Moscow who advocate a bigger war, but Putin's choice may not be easy. He has sought to portray Europe's biggest war in seven decades both as a limited \"special military operation\" that need not upset daily Russian life and as a historic fight with a West that scorns Moscow's interests and seeks to dismember Russia. The U.S., which has said it cannot allow Putin to win the Ukraine war, so far deems the surprise incursion a protective move that justifies the use of U.S. weaponry, officials in Washington said. But they also expressed worries about complications as Ukrainian troops push further into enemy territory. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if Ukraine started taking Russian villages and other non-military targets using U.S. weapons and vehicles, it could be seen as stretching the limits Washington has imposed, precisely to avoid any perception of a direct NATO-Russia conflict. Russia's defence ministry has published footage that it said showed a Russian drone destroying a U.S.-made Stryker armoured combat vehicle in the Kursk region.

The war, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on Aug. 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers over the border into Russia's western Kursk region. Sign up here. For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - have been rarer. Russia's defence ministry said its air defences destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region. Some of the drones were shot down over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. The city in the Moscow region is some 38 km (24 miles) south of the Kremlin. \"This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever,\" Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday. \"The layered defence of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs.\" Along Moscow's boulevards, the cafes, restaurants and shops of the capital - which has been carefully insulated from the war - were crowded with little sign of concern, while President Vladimir Putin met Chinese premier Li Qiang in the Kremlin. Two Russian citizens who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the foiled drone attack simply showed how well defended Moscow now was, and that Ukraine was \"playing with fire\" by attacking Russia both in Kursk and in Moscow. Russia meanwhile is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18% of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War Two. Russian media showed unverified footage of drones whirring over the dawn sky of the Moscow region and then being shot down in a ball of flame by air defences. Moscow's airports, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky, limited flights for four hours but restarted normal operations from 0330 GMT, Russia's aviation watchdog said. Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported following the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, wrote on Telegram. Russia's RIA state news agency reported that two drones were destroyed over the Tula region, which borders the Moscow region to its north. Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region in Russia's southwest, said air defence forces destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over the region, with no injuries reported. The Russian defence ministry did not mention either Tula or Rostov in its statement listing destroyed Ukrainian air weapons. Ukraine's military said on Wednesday it overnight struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in the Rostov region. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. The drone attack on Moscow was on a par with a May 2023 attack when at least eight drones were destroyed over the capital, a strike Putin said was a Ukrainian attempt to scare and provoke Russia. In Kursk, Russian war bloggers said intense battles were ongoing along the front in the region where Ukraine has carved out at least 450 square km (175 square miles) of Russian territory.

The siege comes two months after Islamic State-linked prisoners took guards hostage in another facility and as ethnic tensions run high following a deadly ISIS-claimed Moscow concert hall attack. Here is everything we know about the hostage situation: What do we know about the attack? The inmate uprising took place at the IK-19 Surovikino penal colony located around 120 kilometers west of the region\u2019s capital city Volgograd. The colony\u00a0can hold over 1,200 prisoners. The Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) said in a statement that \u201cconvicts took employees of the (IK-19) correctional institution hostage. FSIN said later in a statement that \u201cfour criminals took eight prison staff members and four inmates hostage\u201d and confirmed that all four attackers had been killed. At least three prison employees died following the attack. Several guards and inmates were injured. The incident took place during a meeting of the prison's disciplinary commission, FSIN said. news 1 Killed as Inmates in Russia's Volgograd Region Take Prison Guards Hostage Read more Footage circulated on social media appeared to show inmates at the penal colony standing above bloodied prison guards. In another video, a prison guard covered in blood is seen apparently being forced to ask President Vladimir Putin \u201cto fulfill the [attackers\u2019] demands\u201d and saying that he needed medical help. \u201cYour own people have abandoned you, they don't help,\u201d said the man who appears to be recording the video. The Moscow Times could not verify those images. At least four prison staff were hospitalized following the attack, according to Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov. \u201cAn operational headquarters has been set up to coordinate work on releasing the hostages. Law enforcement and security agencies are carrying out operational activities. There is no threat to the civilian population,\u201d Bocharov added. Putin said he had been informed about the hostage siege. Several hours after the hostage crisis first started, the state-run TASS news agency reported that the prison was under the control of security forces and the siege had ended. What do we know about the attackers? TASS said that at least four prisoners were involved in the hostage-taking. Three were convicted of drug trafficking and another was convicted of manslaughter during a fight. Governor Bocharov did not comment on the identity of the hostage-takers but alluded to reports they were citizens of Central Asian countries. \u201cEveryone on our territory is obliged to respect and comply with the laws of Russia. We will not allow anyone to try to incite ethnic discord,\u201d he said in a statement published by the regional administration. Unverified footage circulated online showed the hostage-takers shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and holding knives and flags that resemble that of ISIS. \u201cLaw enforcement officers have been captured. Those who oppressed, humiliated and tortured Muslims have been killed\u2026We treated them in a similar way. No mercy,\u201d a man could be heard saying off-camera in one video. Unconfirmed reports said that the attack was allegedly carried out for \u201cMuslim brothers\u201d and as apparent revenge for the arrested terrorists who attacked a Moscow concert hall in March. The Moscow Times could not independently verify these reports. Previous attacks this year In June, prisoners aligned with ISIS staged a similar siege at a jail in the southern Rostov region. During that incident, Russian special forces killed the hostage-takers and freed the guards following a stand-off. Inter-ethnic tensions are running high in Russia following the March attack on Moscow's Crocus City Hall concert venue that killed 145 people \u2014 the deadliest terror attack in Russia in two decades. A Central Asian branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack and the four suspected gunmen, now in pre-trial detention, are citizens of Tajikistan. In June, at least 21 people were killed in coordinated terrorist attacks in Derbent and Makhachkala, the two largest cities in the North Caucasus republic of Dagestan. Two synagogues, two Eastern Orthodox churches, and a police post were simultaneously attacked by armed men, killing 16 policemen and at least five others, including an Orthodox priest. The attacks in Moscow and Dagestan led to heavy criticism of the authorities and special services for failing to prevent them. ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack, praised the attacks in Dagestan, but no one has officially claimed responsibility for the killings. ISIS has repeatedly pledged to target Russia over its support of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who has waged a military campaign to quash the group in the Middle East. AFP contributed reporting.

Ramazan Rashidov \/ TASS Five men who took part in last year\u2019s airport storming in the North Caucasus republic of Dagestan were handed varying jail sentences, court authorities said Friday. Hundreds of people descended on Dagestan\u2019s Makhachkala International Airport in late October as they searched for Israeli citizens rumored to be onboard a flight arriving from Tel Aviv. The mob paralyzed the airport and led the several law enforcement officers being injured. Nearly 140 of the estimated 1,500 rioters were detained and their trials moved to the neighboring Stavropol and Krasnodar regions given the \u201csensitivity\u201d of the cases, authorities said. The Krasnodar region\u2019s Armavir City Court found all five men standing trial on Friday guilty of rioting and handed them varying prison sentences, with the longest being nine years in a medium-security facility. One of the men was also convicted of using violence against a police officer. President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials claimed at the time that Ukraine and the West were behind calls to storm the Dagestan airport. Kyiv said the wave of violence was a symptom of \u201cdeep-seated anti-semitism\u201d in Russia. The airport riot took place as Israel ramped up its devastating offensive on Gaza that was launched after Hamas militant fighters attacked the country on Oct. 7. In November, a Dagestan court sentenced 15 people to between two and 10 days in prison for their involvement in the riot.

Sokolov said there was no reported damage or disruption to the facility\u2019s operations.

There was no immediate comment from\u00a0Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry about the drone downings. The attack on the Zenit oil depot occurred shortly after Ukrainian drones hit the Atlas oil depot in the southern Rostov region, causing a major fire there. Russian media previously reported that the Atlas depot had supplied fuel to the Russian military during drills. Meanwhile, a third oil depot, Kavkaz, has been burning for 10 days in the Rostov region following a similar drone strike .

{"year":"2024","month":"08","event_desc":"24 August  Arrest and indictment of Pavel Durov The owner and founder of the Telegram and VK social networks Pavel Durov is arrested at ParisLe Bourget Airport in France shortly after arriving from Azerbaijan, in connection with alleged illegal activity on his Telegram app.","text":"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov arrested at French airport 25 August 2024 Share Save Thomas Mackintosh & Will Vernon BBC News Share Save Getty Images Pavel Durov founded Telegram in 2013 Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov has been arrested by French police at an airport north of Paris. Mr Durov was detained after his private jet had landed at Le Bourget Airport, French media reported. According to officials the 39-year-old billionaire was arrested under a warrant for offences related to the popular messaging app. The investigation is reportedly about a lack of moderation, with Mr Durov accused of failing to take steps to curb criminal uses of Telegram. The app is accused of failure to cooperate with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual content and fraud. Telegram has previously denied having insufficient moderation. Pavel Durov was born in Russia and now lives in Dubai, where Telegram is based. He holds dual citizenship of the United Arab Emirates and France. Telegram is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and former Soviet Union states. The app was banned in Russia in 2018, after a previous refusal by him to hand over user data. The ban was reversed in 2021. Telegram is ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and Wechat. Mr Durov founded Telegram in 2013. He left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform, which he sold. On Sunday, the Russian Embassy in France wrote on Facebook that it was seeking to \"clarify the reasons for the detention and to provide for the protection of Mr Durov\u2019s rights and facilitate consular access\". The post added that French authorities had not been cooperating with Russian officials. Russian Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted on Telegram asking whether Western human rights NGOs would be silent on Mr Durov's arrest, after they criticised Russia\u2019s decision to \u201ccreate obstacles\u201d to the work of Telegram in Russia in 2018. Several Russian officials condemned the businessman's arrest, saying it showed the West has double standards when it comes to free speech and democracy. American whistleblower Edward Snowden , who has been living in exile in Russia since 2013, said on X that Mr Durov's arrest \"was an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association\". X owner Elon Musk, who has faced extensive criticism over moderation and material hosted by his own social media site, posted repeatedly about the situation. He hashtagged one post #freepavel, and in another wrote: \"POV [Point of view]: It\u2019s 2030 in Europe and you\u2019re being executed for liking a meme.\" Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which critics have argued makes it easier for misinformation to spread, and for users to share conspiracist, neo-Nazi, paedophilic, or terror-related content. In the UK, the app was scrutinised for hosting far-right channels that were instrumental in organising the violent disorder in English cities earlier this month. Telegram did remove some groups, but overall its system of moderating extremist and illegal content is significantly weaker than that of other social media companies and messenger apps, say cybersecurity experts.

Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin formed the Leningrad Military District, which had existed before it was merged with the Moscow Military District in 2010 to create the now-defunct Western Military District.

The intelligence \u2013 which included a production contract for the new drone, company correspondence on the manufacturing process and financial documents - indicated that IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned weapons maker Almaz-Antey, produced more than 2,500 Garpiyas from July 2023 to July 2024. Sign up here. The existence of the new Russian drone incorporating Chinese technology has not been previously reported. IEMZ Kupol and Almaz-Antey did not respond to requests for comment. The two intelligence sources said that the Garpiya, which means Harpy in Russian, has been deployed against military and civilian targets in Ukraine, causing damage to critical infrastructure as well as both civilian and military casualties. They shared with Reuters what they said were images from Ukraine of the wreckage of a Garpiya, without providing further details. Reuters found information that reinforces this conclusion, but was unable to confirm the images independently. The sources asked that neither they nor their agency be identified due to the sensitivity of the information. They also asked that certain details, such as dates, related to the documents be withheld. Samuel Bendett, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington DC-based think tank, told Reuters that Garpiya, if confirmed, would mark a departure from Russia's reliance on Iranian designs for long-range drones. \"If this is happening, it could indicate that Russia can now rely more on domestic development as well as, obviously, on China, since both sides in this war depend on many Chinese components for drone production,\" he said. Iran, which didn't comment for this story, has supplied more than a thousand Shahed \"kamikaze\" drones to Russia since the start of the invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in May last year. They have been used to exhaust Ukrainian air defences and hit infrastructure far from the front lines. Iran has repeatedly denied sending drones to Russia for use in Ukraine. Russia's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement to Reuters that Beijing strictly controls the export of items with potential military applications, including drones. \"With regard to the Ukrainian crisis, China has always been committed to promoting peace talks and political settlement,\" the statement said. It added that there were no international restrictions on China's trade with Russia. NATO APPEAL NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg last week called on China to stop supporting Russia's war in Ukraine and said Beijing's assistance has been a significant factor in the continuation of the conflict. The Garpiya \"closely resembles the Shahed\" but it has several distinguishing features, including a unique bolt-on fin and Limbach L-550 E engines, the European agency said in a statement to Reuters. The engine, which was originally designed and manufactured by a German company, is now produced in China by a local firm, Xiamen Limbach. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters reviewed a contract worth more than 1 billion rubles (10 million euros) signed in the first quarter of 2023 between the Russian defence ministry and Kupol for the development of a factory to produce the drones. The intelligence sources said a former cement factory situated in Izhevsk, Udmurt Republic, in western Russia \u2013 which was purchased by Kupol in 2020 - is being used to produce the drones. Using a video of a Russian drone production facility , opens new tab posted on the Telegram messaging app, Reuters was able to identify the site as the factory in Izhevsk from the colour and design of the building's beams and internal architecture which matched file imagery of the site. The location of the file imagery was verifiable from nearby buildings, roads, and trees that matched street views and satellite imagery. A prototype of the Garpiya was launched in the first half of 2023, company communications showed. Production reached several hundred in the second half of 2023 and more than doubled to around 2,000 in the first half of 2024, the agency said. Bendett, the defence analyst, said 2,500 drones per year would represent a sizeable chunk of Russia's output. Ukraine's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last month that Russia has fired nearly 14,000 strike drones since it invaded in February 2022, including the Iranian Shahed as well as the Russian-made Geran-2 and Lancet drones. Corporate documents dated from the second quarter of 2023, reviewed by Reuters, showed that supplier TSK Vektor procured parts from Chinese companies for assembly at the Kupol site; 800 Chinese engines were also to be delivered to the new plant where the production line was due to ready by end of the quarter. TSK Vektor did not respond to request for comment. The European intelligence service said in the statement it was concerned that Chinese companies were continuing to provide components that enabled Russian production of large kamikaze drones. \"The export of the essential components to Russia needs to stop,\" it said. UNITED STATES VOICES CONCERN Washington has repeatedly warned Beijing over its support for Russia's defence industry. It has imposed hundreds of sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's ability to exploit certain technologies for military purposes. The State Department and the White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In July, China said it would tighten drone export rules starting on Sept. 1. Beijing has said U.S. sanctions on Chinese entities over the Ukraine war are \"illegal and unilateral\". The Garpiya has a take-off weight of less than 300 kilos and a maximum range of 1,500 kilometres, the production contract between Kupol and the Russian defense ministry said \u2013 roughly similar to Iran\u2019s Shahed-136 drones that Moscow has used extensively in Ukraine. The Washington Post reported in August that Russia aimed to increase production of a domestic version of the Shahed-136, known as the Geran-2, at a plant in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, in Tatarstan. Ukraine said in April it had carried out a drone strike against a drone manufacturing plant at Alabuga. Russia began production last year of a new drone, the Garpiya, at a factory in Izhevsk, Udmurt Republic, in western Russia, according to a European intelligence agency and documents seen by Reuters. A third document reviewed by Reuters - a delivery status update between the intermediary TSK Vektor and the manufacturer Kupol, dated in the first quarter of 2024 - detailed an order for 100 axles, carburettors and other Limbach engine parts supplied by two other Chinese companies: Juhang Aviation Technology and Redlepus Vector Industries, both based in Shenzhen. Juhang, which was placed under British sanctions in February and U.S. sanctions in May for providing Russia with drone equipment, and Redlepus did not respond to requests for comment. Customs data, obtained from a commercial supplier that records and compiles the information, showed that from April 2022 to December 2023, TSK Vektor imported $36.3 million in goods from Chinese Juhang Aviation Technology, and $6.2 million from Redlepus TSK Vector Industrial Shenzhen Co Ltd. According to the customs documents, the goods included aircraft engines, transistors, electronic modules, connectors, plugs and sockets, spare parts and components most of them marked as \"for general civil purpose\", \"for general industrial purpose\", \"for general civil use\".

Video shows drone attack hit apartment building in Russia A woman has been killed near Moscow and dozens of homes in the region have been damaged due to Ukrainian drone strikes, according to Russian officials. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence said its air defences shot down 144 Ukrainian drones overnight in nine regions, with 20 alone over the Moscow region. Moscow regional Governor Andrei Vorobyov said debris from the drone damaged at least two high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district in the early hours of Tuesday, setting several flats on fire. A 46-year-old woman was killed in Ramenskoye after the attack caused a fire on the 11th and 12th floors of the building, Vorobyov said. He said 43 people were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres. Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera\u2019s Yulia Shapovalova said 12 people were injured, including two listed in critical condition. City Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said emergency teams had been sent to a number of locations across the region as well as to the area near the Zhukovo airport and around the Domodedovo district \u2013 the site of one of Moscow\u2019s largest airports. Meanwhile, Moscow region\u2019s Zhukovsky airport resumed operation in normal mode after flights were suspended earlier, to ensure safety after drone attacks, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Russia\u2019s aviation authority Rosaviatsia lifted restrictions in Domodedovo, Zhukovsky and Vnukovo airports earlier on Tuesday, but Zhukovsky remained closed for flights during the investigation of the attack. The Ramenskoye district, some 50km (31 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, has a population of about 250,000, according to official data. The air attacks showed that the \u201cKyiv regime\u201d is Russia\u2019s enemy and Russia needs to keep fighting it, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Russia\u2019s SHOT and Baza Telegram channels, which are close to the security services, posted videos with flames billowing from the multistorey residential building, saying five flats had been destroyed. In the region of Bryansk, close to the border with Ukraine, the Russian Defence Ministry said 72 drones were intercepted. Governor Aleksander Bogomaz described the attack as \u201cmassive\u201d but said there were no casualties or damage, according to a message on the Telegram messaging app. Another 14 drones were intercepted over Kursk, 13 over Tula, and 25 more over five other parts of the country, the ministry said in a statement. More than two and a half years since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine has fast-tracked the development of its domestic drone industry to enable it to attack Russia\u2019s energy, military and transport infrastructure. Ukraine did not comment on the attack, which came as air raid warnings sounded in Kyiv amid another Russian drone assault on the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Tuesday that his country has doubled its production of weapons this year. He said Ukraine planned to build more than a million drones by the end of the year. Yet, Ukraine continues to also lobby for more aid and weapons from its allies. \u201cThe course of the war directly depends on the quality of logistics in supply and the fulfillment of all promises by partners,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

REUTERS\/Roman Baluk Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MOSCOW, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Russian officials threatened the West on Saturday with an uncontrolled escalation of war and Ukraine with the destruction of Kyiv as Western leaders discussed whether to allow Ukraine to use their weapons for strikes deep into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Friday that his plan to achieve victory depended on Washington's decision, a clear reference to the authorisation for long-range strikes that Kyiv has long sought from NATO allies. Sign up here. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskiy's office, said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday: \"Strong decisions are needed. Terror can be stopped by destroying the military facilities where it originates.\" Kyiv has said such strikes are critical for its efforts to restrict Moscow's ability to attack Ukraine, but allies have so far been reluctant to permit them, citing fears Moscow will treat them as an escalation and doubting their efficiency. While no official decision on the matter has been announced so far, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov alleged it had already been made and communicated to Kyiv, and that Moscow would have to respond with actions of its own. \"The decision has been made, the carte blanche and all indulgences have been given (to Kyiv), so we are ready for everything,\" the RIA news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. \"And we will react in a way that will not be pretty.\" 'MELTED SPOT' Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of the country's security council, said the West was testing Russia's patience but it was not limitless. Medvedev said Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region, which Zelenskiy described as a successful operation slowing Russia's advance, already gave Russia formal grounds to use its nuclear arsenal. He said that Moscow could either resort to nuclear weapons in the end, or use some of its non-nuclear but still deadly novel weapons for a large-scale attack. \"And that would be it. A giant, grey, melted spot instead of 'the mother of Russian cities',\" he wrote on the Telegram messaging app, referring to Kyiv.

Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,\" Meta said. In a news bulletin, RT newsreader Eunan O'Neill said the broadcaster \"and Russia as a whole denies the accusations that have been coming en masse against this channel and others in the past number of days\". The bans are expected to come into effect in the next few days. The Russian embassy in Washington and the owner of the Sputnik news agency, Rossiya Segodnya, did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. Russian state media outlets have come under increased scrutiny over claims they have tried to influence politics in Western countries. As well as Facebook, social media giant Meta owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. In a statement to the BBC, RT said: \"It\u2019s cute how there\u2019s a competition in the West \u2014 who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better. \"Don\u2019t worry, where they close a door, and then a window, our \u2018partisans\u2019 (or in your parlance, guerrilla fighters) will find the cracks to crawl through \u2014 as by your own admission we are apt at doing.\" Escalation Meta's move marks an escalation in the world's biggest social media firm's stance towards Russian state media companies. Two years ago, Meta took more limited measures to restrict the spread of Russian state-controlled media, including stopping the outlets from running adverts on its platforms and limiting the reach of their content. After the start of the war in Ukraine, Meta - like other social media platforms - complied with requests from the EU, UK and Ukraine to block some Russian state media in those regions. Earlier this month, the US accused state broadcaster RT of paying a Tennessee firm $10m (\u00a37.6m) to \"create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging\" . An indictment said videos - which often promoted right-wing narratives on issues such as immigration, gender and the economy - were secretly \"edited, posted, and directed\" by two RT employees. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced new sanctions against RT , accusing it of being a \"de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus\". The top US diplomat told reporters on Friday that RT was part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets which have sought to covertly \"undermine democracy in the United States\". He added that the Russian government has \"embedded within RT, a unit with cyber-operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence\".

Mikhail Klimentyev \/ TASS At least two people were killed and several others injured in a shooting incident at the headquarters of Russian online retailer Wildberries in Moscow on Wednesday, with the company reporting that an armed group of men led by Vladislav Bakalchuk, the ex-husband of Wildberries founder Tatiana Bakalchuk, attempted to forcibly enter the building. Law enforcement authorities said they were investigating the incident, which resulted in two police officers being injured and nearly 30 individuals being arrested, according to Interfax news agency. The state-run TASS news agency, citing an unnamed source at Wildberries, reported that two security guards were killed. An altercation reportedly began when a group of men led by Vladislav Bakalchuk attempted to enter the building. A video published by the pro-Kremlin Telegram news channel Mash showed a scuffle outside the office, followed by gunshots and shouting. Vladislav Bakalchuk later claimed he and his \u201cteam\u201d were attacked when they arrived at the Wildberries headquarters \u201cfor negotiations to stop the construction of a warehouse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, and we\u2019re sorting it out.

Under the merger, Russ Group\u2019s Robert Mirzoyan is slated to become the chief managing director of RWB, with Tatiana Bakalchuk as director general. Business news media called the deal \u201cvery strange\u201d for presenting itself as a merger between equal partners. Wildberries is 20 times bigger than Russ Group, with 538.7 billion rubles ($2.7 billion) in revenues last year compared to Russ Group\u2019s 27.9 billion rubles ($300 million).

Try again 01:45 French citizen Laurent Vinatier attends a court session at the Zamoskvoretsky District Court in Moscow on October 14, 2024. \u00a9 Pavel Bednyakov, AP A Russian court on Monday convicted a French citizen of collecting military information and sentenced him to three years in prison. Laurent Vinatier, who was arrested in Moscow in June , earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-tracked trial. His lawyers\u2019 asked the court to sentence him to a fine. In his remarks before the verdict, Vinatier, speaking Russian, reaffirmed that he fully recognized his guilt and asked the judge for clemency. \u201cI'm asking the Russian Federation to forgive me for failing to observe Russian laws,\u201d he said in Russian. He said that he fell in love with Russia 20 years ago when he began studying the country and concluded his comments with a verse by Russian poet Alexander Pushkin about having patience that better days lie ahead. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia and its heavily politicized legal system since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier\u2019s arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d while collecting information about Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary and military-technical activities\u201d that could be used to the detriment of the country\u2019s security. The French Foreign Ministry denounced the \"extreme severity\" of the sentence and called for Vinatier's immediate release. \"The legislation on 'foreign agents' contributes to a systematic violation of fundamental freedoms in Russia, such as freedom of association, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression,\" the ministry said in a statement . \"French authorities remain fully mobilised to provide assistance (to\u00a0Vinatier),\" the statement added. Vinatier is an adviser for the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. It said in June that it was doing \u201ceverything possible to assist\u201d him. The prosecutors charged that Vinatier had collected military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-22. The Russian citizens weren\u2019t named in the indictment. Vinatier\u2019s lawyers argued the sentence sought by prosecutors was too harsh and asked the judge to sentence him to a fine. They pointed at his career as a political scholar who focused on studying Russia and emphasized that his books and articles have been friendly to the country. While asking the judge for clemency, Vinatier pointed at his two children and his elderly parents he has to take care of. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.

{"year":"2024","month":"09","event_desc":"25 September  President Putin revises Russia's nuclear weapons policy to allow their usage in response to an attack from a non-nuclear state supported by a nuclear-armed one.","text":"Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons 26 September 2024 Share Save Frances Mao BBC News Share Save Reuters The Russian president has previously threatened the use of nuclear arms but his new proposal expands those scenarios Vladimir Putin says Russia would consider an attack from a non-nuclear state that was backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a \"joint attack\", in what could be construed as a threat to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. In key remarks on Wednesday night, the Russian president said his government was considering changing the rules and preconditions around which Russia would use its nuclear arsenal. Ukraine is a non-nuclear state that receives military support from the US and other nuclear-armed countries. His comments come as Kyiv seeks approval to use long-range Western missiles against military sites in Russia. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to the US this week and is due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday, where Kyiv's request is expected to be top of the agenda. Ukraine has pushed into Russian territory this year and wants to target bases inside Russia which it says are sending missiles into Ukraine. Responding to Putin's remarks, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Russia \"no longer has anything other than nuclear blackmail to intimidate the world\". Putin has threatened the use of nuclear weapons before. Ukraine has criticised it as  \"nuclear sabre-rattling\" to deter its allies from providing further support. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the comments as \"totally irresponsible\" in an MSNBC television interview. Russian ally China has also called for calm, with reports President Xi Jinping has warned Putin against using nuclear arms. But on Wednesday, after a meeting with his Security Council, Putin announced the proposed radical expansion. A new nuclear doctrine would \"clearly set the conditions for Russia to transition to using nuclear weapons,\" he warned - and said such scenarios included conventional missile strikes against Moscow. He said that Russia would consider such a \"possibility\" of using nuclear weapons if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft and drones into its territory, which presented a \"critical threat\" to the country's sovereignty. He added: \"It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation.\" The country's nuclear arms were \"the most important guarantee of security of our state and its citizens\", the Kremlin leader said. Since the end of World War Two, nuclear-armed states have engaged in a policy of deterrence, which is based on the idea that if warring states were to launch major nuclear strikes it would lead to mutually assured destruction. But there are also tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout. In June, Putin delivered a warning to European countries supporting Ukraine, saying Russia had \u201cmany more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.\u201d \u201cEurope does not have a developed [early warning system],\u201d he added. \u201cIn this sense they are more or less defenceless.\u201d At the time he had hinted of changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine - the document which sets out the conditions under which Moscow would use nuclear weapons. The Kremlin said on Thursday that changes outlined by Putin should be considered a warning to the West. Elaborating on the move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: \"It must be considered a specific signal - a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear.\" Peskov said that Russia would make a decision on whether not to publish the updated nuclear documents, adding that adjustments to the document on state nuclear deterrence were being formulated.

The conflict came up repeatedly at the meeting, which saw the first visit to Russia from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in more than two years and drew an angry reaction from Kyiv. Guterres called for \u201ca just peace\u201d in Ukraine, in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions. He also urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan. At a news conference Thursday night, Putin was asked about former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to end the fighting in Ukraine. \u201cWhat Mr. Trump said recently, what I heard, (is) he spoke about the desire to do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Putin said. \u201cIt seems to me that he said it sincerely. We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.\u201d Putin also was asked about whether any North Korean troops were in Russia, which he neither confirmed nor denied. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. \u201cImages are a serious thing, if there are images, then they reflect something,\u201d he said when asked about satellite photos of troops. Putin noted that lawmakers in Moscow earlier in the day ratified a pact with North Korea on mutual military assistance as part of a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Pyongyang. \u201cWe have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously. What and how we will do within the framework of this article (of the agreement) is our business,\u201d he said. The summit covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. The Kremlin touted the summit as \u201cthe largest foreign policy event ever held\u201d by Russia. Speaking at what was dubbed the \u201cBRICS Plus\u201d session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with \u201cillegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.\u201d \u201cSuch perverse methods and approaches \u2014 to put it bluntly \u2014 lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,\u201d Putin said. \u201cOne example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia\u2019s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.\u201d Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. In a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about \u201cthe disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions\u201d and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. They noted the benefits of \u201cfaster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.\u201d China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc\u2019s role in ensuring global security. Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it. Ukraine has rejected the proposal. \u201cWe should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,\u201d Xi said. Putin and Xi had announced a \u201cno-limits\u201d partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia\u2019s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia\u2019s close ties with India\u2019s rival, China. While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Addressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan. \u201cWe need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,\u201d he said. Russia\u2019s Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout. State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world\u2019s population comprising the \u201cglobal majority\u201d and challenging Western \u201chegemony.\u201d TV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow. \u201cThe West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,\u201d said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.","question":"Where was the 16th BRICS summit held in October 2024?","answer":"The 16th BRICS summit was held in Kazan, Russia.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: The 16th BRICS summit was not held in October 2024.

According to the ban, which was enacted last week Tuesday, \u201cclothing and elements demonstrating the student\u2019s religious affiliation\u2026 are not allowed inside educational institutions,\u201d including hijabs and niqabs. The Vladimir region\u2019s Education Ministry insisted in a statement on Saturday that the ban does not violate students\u2019 rights since Russia\u2019s Constitution establishes the country as a secular state without an official religion. \u201cThe requirements for school dress and the students\u2019 appearance, regardless of their religion, ensure the secular nature of state and municipal educational institutions, as well as the maintenance of religious neutrality,\u201d the ministry said. Local media reported that the Vladimir region was the first in Russia to ban hijabs in schools. However, in 2015, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a hijab ban at schools in the republic of Mordovia, introducing the first legal precedent of its kind. Two years later, a local court lifted a hijab ban for teachers. news For Veiled Muslim Women in Russia, Prejudice and Harassment Are Part of Everyday Life Read more The Vladimir region introduced a dress code for schools in 2017, saying that students must comply with \u201csecular\u201d and \u201cbusiness style\u201d clothing. The latest hijab ban updates that dress code. Calls to ban hijabs in Russia resurfaced earlier this year amid an uptick in discrimination and xenophobia prompted by the deadly attack on a Moscow concert venue in March. The Islamic State jihadist group claimed responsibility for that mass shooting. Another deadly attack in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus republic of Dagestan in June prompted a senior Muslim cleric to temporarily ban the niqab, a full-face veil, for \u201csafety measures.\u201d Though Muslims make up Russia\u2019s second-largest religious group, human rights activists and regional media regularly report instances of discrimination against women wearing Islamic religious dress.

{"year":"2024","month":"10","event_desc":"The Central Bank of Russia raises interest rates to 21%, the highest since 2003, citing inflation and the economic effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Russia hikes interest rates to 20-year high Moscow (AFP) \u2013 Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than two decades as Moscow's Ukraine offensive has triggered rapid price rises at home. Issued on: 25\/10\/2024 - 13:11 Modified: 25\/10\/2024 - 15:35 3 min The increase takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 -- just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine -- to their highest since 2003, with the regulator battling to stem the economic fallout of the conflict. But despite the high inflation and Western hopes sanctions would cripple the Russian economy, the Kremlin is set to ramp up military spending yet again next year and analysts say Moscow has enough money to keep fighting in Ukraine for the foreseeable future. Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the pace of price rises -- running at an annual rate of 8.6 percent in September -- was not slowing and that further rate rises may be necessary. \"Firstly, inflation. In general, we do not see any signs of it slowing down,\" she told reporters in Moscow. \"To contain accelerating price growth, we will need much tighter monetary policy over the next year,\" she added. Without mentioning the Ukraine offensive, the bank directly blamed high government spending for pushing inflation higher. \"Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects,\" it said in a statement announcing the rate rise. The bank also said it would not be able to bring inflation back to its 4.0-percent target until at least 2026. Growth boom, inflation woes Stubborn inflation, a volatile currency and historically high borrowing costs over the last two years have not deterred the Kremlin from ramping up spending on the military campaign. Russia has more than $300 billion in reserves that have not been frozen by the West, a low debt-to-GDP ratio of around 15 percent and is pushing through major tax rises next year to help cover a deficit. Lawmakers voted Thursday to increase military expenditure by almost 30 percent to around $145 billion in 2025. Combined spending on defence and security is set to account for 40 percent of Russia's total budget. Bank governor Nabiullina is a former Putin aide who is highly respected in Moscow and had won plaudits in the West before the conflict \u00a9 Alexander NEMENOV \/ POOL\/AFP The spending boom has powered the economy, with the International Monetary Fund this week raising its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent. But it has also triggered domestic headwinds. Hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by the booming domestic arms industry -- leading to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the central bank has warned undermines stability. Nabiullina acknowledged Friday that higher interest rates were having a less \"pronounced\" impact in cooling the \"overheating\" economy, in part due to the government's spending boom. The Kremlin tasks the central bank with managing the domestic fallout of the Ukraine offensive, and permits it a degree of operational independence. Nabiullina, a former Putin aide who is highly respected in Moscow and had won plaudits in the West before the conflict, has softly criticised the government's economic policies, while being cautious not to comment on the offensive itself. BRICS setback Russia's official borrowing costs have not been above 20 percent since 2003. They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The first years of President Vladimir Putin's rule in the 2000s saw an oil-led boom and rising wealth. But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system. Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the BRICS summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive. But speaking at the summit Thursday, he indicated international payments were one of the \"key problems\" Russia faced and said the group was not creating an alternative to the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging system. The exclusion of some Russian banks from SWIFT due to Western sanctions has made it difficult for Russia to conduct trade. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

Robert Shonov, a Russian citizen and former employee of the U.S. Consulate in Vladivostok, was arrested in May 2023. Russia\u2019s top domestic security agency, the FSB, accused him of \u201cgathering information about the special military operation\u201d in Ukraine, a partial call-up in Russian regions and its influence on \u201cprotest activities of the population in the runup to the 2024 presidential election.\u201d The U.S. Embassy in Moscow condemned the sentence and rejected the charges against him as \u201ccompletely false and unfounded.\u201d \u201cThe criminal prosecution of Mr. Shonov only underscores the campaign of intimidation the Russian government is increasingly taking against its own citizens,\u201d the embassy said in a statement. Shonov was charged under a new article of Russian law that criminalizes \u201ccooperation on a confidential basis with a foreign state, international or foreign organization to assist their activities clearly aimed against Russia\u2019s security.\u201d Kremlin critics and human rights advocates have said it is so broad that it can be used to punish any Russian with foreign connections.

The consulate closed in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and never reopened. The State Department has said that after a Russian government order in April 2021 required the dismissal of all local employees in U.S. diplomatic outposts in Russia, Shonov worked at a company the U.S. contracted with to support its embassy in Moscow. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in May 2023 that Shonov\u2019s only role at the time of his arrest was \u201cto compile media summaries of press items from publicly available Russian media sources.\u201d Shonov was held in the Lefortovo Prison in Moscow, notorious for its harsh conditions, pending investigation, but stood trial in Vladivostok\u2019s Primorsky District Court.

Russian state-run news agencies reported that the country's security service FSB accused the diplomat - whose photo was shared on Russian TV bulletins - of providing false information on his documents and carrying out espionage activities. When asked if a tit-for-tat expulsion would occur, a No 10 spokesman said they were \"considering\" their response. \"To be clear, we refute these allegations\" he said, calling them \"baseless.\" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the ministry had also summoned the British ambassador, Tass news agency reported. Footage shows the British ambassador's car pulling up to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow. According to Tass, the FSB says that the diplomat was a replacement for one of six UK diplomats expelled in August , also on espionage charges. \"This is not the first time that [Vladimir] Putin's government has made malicious, baseless accusations against our staff,\" Downing Street said. \"The UK government is unapologetic about protecting our national interests and will now respond in due course, and our embassy in Moscow will continue its important work in Russia to support UK interests.\" It comes amid worsening relations between the UK and Russia since the latter's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Last week it emerged the UK lifted restrictions on Ukraine using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles on targets inside Russia for the first time. President Vladimir Putin cited the move, alongside the launching of US-supplied longer-range missiles at Russian territory , as being behind Russia's decision to launch a new hypersonic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday. Expulsions of diplomats have become increasingly common since the war began. Earlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia , days after the Russian defence attach\u00e9 was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an \"undeclared military intelligence officer\". More British politicians and press have also been barred from entering the country. On Tuesday, Russia added 30 more to their \"stop list\" for what it called \"hostile actions\". Included in the list are: Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood. Russia has previously banned British politicians and journalists , including from the BBC, Sky News and Channel 4.

{"year":"2024","month":"11","event_desc":"14 November  The Gulag History Museum in Moscow is ordered closed due to \"fire safety\" violations amid a crackdown on dissent by authorities.","text":"Advertising Home Live news Russia shuts Moscow's famed gulag museum Moscow (AFP) \u2013 Russian authorities ordered the closure from Thursday of Moscow's award-winning Gulag History Museum, dedicated to the victims of Soviet-era repression. Issued on: 14\/11\/2024 - 12:07 2 min The gulag was a vast network of prison labour camps set up in the Soviet Union \u00a9 VASILY MAXIMOV \/ AFP\/File The closure was officially put down to alleged violations of fire safety regulations, but comes amid an intense campaign being waged by the Kremlin against independent civil society and those who question the state's interpretation of history. \"The decision to temporarily suspend the activities of the State Gulag Museum was taken for safety reasons,\" the Moscow city culture department told AFP on Thursday. The museum removed content from its website, replacing it with an announcement of the \"temporary\" closure. They declined to comment further when contacted by AFP on Thursday. Established in 2001, the central Moscow museum brings together official state documents with family photographs and objects from gulag victims. Moscow authorities said 46,000 people visited in the first nine months of the year. The gulag was a vast network of prison labour camps set up in the Soviet Union. Millions of alleged traitors and enemies of the state were sent there, many to their deaths, in what historians recognise as a period of massive political repression. The Council of Europe awarded the site its Museum Prize in 2021, saying it worked to \"expose history and activate memory, with the goal of strengthening the resilience of civil society and its resistance to political repression and violation of human rights today and in the future.\" 'Great loss' Outside the museum on Thursday, worker Mikhail, who declined to give his last name, lamented its possible closure. \"It's a strong museum, very impressive. It's disappointing that this happened. It's a loss, a great loss if, God forbid, it's permanent,\" he told AFP. \"We need people to see it, to understand, to know that it must not be repeated.\" But Moscovite Yulia, a musician in her 50s who also declined to give her last name, welcomed the closure. \"I'm against such establishments, I'm not sad,\" she told AFP while walking her dog in a nearby park. \"I'm a Stalinist... people die in every era, right now as well. We can't make monuments for every era.\" Through his 24 years in power, President Vladimir Putin has sought to revise Russia's historical narrative and its relationship with the Soviet Union. While occasionally condemning the vast repression under Joseph Stalin in the 1930s, Putin more often hails him as a great wartime leader. School textbooks pay little attention to the millions of victims of the Great Terror, seen as inconvenient in the promotion of the Soviet Union as a great power that defeated Nazi Germany. Authorities have increasingly targeted individuals and groups who push back against this approach -- a campaign that has stepped up amid the Ukraine offensive. In 2021, authorities ordered the liquidation of Memorial, the Nobel Prize-winning NGO that records victims of both Soviet repression and allegations of human rights violations by the current regime. Last month the Gulag History Museum staged a \"Return of the Names\" event -- when individuals read out the names of people killed during Soviet terror. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

Footage released by Russia's Southern Transport Prosecutor's Office showed the bow of one tanker completely broken off, with streaks of oil visible in the water. Both tankers are believed to have drifted before running aground offshore. At least one crew member was reportedly killed. The incident took place in the Kerch Strait, which separates Russia from Crimea - the Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. A rescue operation involving tugboats, helicopters and more than 50 personnel saw 13 crew members rescued from one tanker, before being suspended due to bad weather. Fourteen crew members who had been stranded aboard a second tanker were also rescued, the Russian emergencies ministry said on Monday. President Vladimir Putin has ordered a working group to be set up to deal with the incident, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Savelyev - and authorities are investigating for criminal negligence. Michelle Bockmann, an analyst at shipping industry journal Lloyd's List, told the BBC the two vessels are owned by the company Volgatanker and were relatively small. They had been carrying around 4,300 dead weight tonnes of oil each, according to Russian officials quoted by Tass news agency. A tanker used for trading Russian crude oil internationally generally has a much larger carrying capacity of around 120,000 dead weight tonnes, Bockmann said, meaning it is likely these tankers were used for transporting oil through Russia's rivers or in coastal waters. The Kerch Strait is a key route for exports of Russian grain and it is also used for exports of crude oil, fuel oil and liquefied natural gas. In 2007, another oil tanker - Volgoneft-139 - split in half during a storm while anchored off the Kerch Strait, spilling more than 1,000 tonnes of oil. Russian oil imports have been heavily sanctioned by allies of Ukraine since the Kremlin ordered the full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. In recent years, Russia has been accused of using a so-called ghost fleet of tankers, which are often poorly maintained and lack proper insurance, to move oil and circumvent sanctions - though Bockmann said it did not appear the tankers involved in Sunday's incident were part of that fleet.

{"year":"2024","month":"12","event_desc":"17 December  Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, the commander of the Russian NBC Protection Troops, is killed along with an assistant in a scooter bombing in Moscow.","text":"General killed in Moscow a legitimate target, says Ukraine 17 December 2024 Share Save Amy Walker & Christy Cooney BBC News Share Save The BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow: \"The blast killed a senior Russian general\" A high-ranking general in the Russian armed forces and his assistant have been killed in Moscow by Ukraine's security service, a Ukrainian source has told the BBC. Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiation, Biological and Chemical Defence Forces, was outside a residential block early on Tuesday when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely, Russia's Investigative Committee (SK) said. A source in Ukraine's SBU security service claimed Kirillov was \"a legitimate target\" and alleged he had carried out war crimes. On Monday, the SBU charged Kirillov, 54, in absentia, saying on Telegram that he was \"responsible for the mass use of banned chemical weapons\". Reuters The Ukrainian government has not yet commented on the general's death. Pictures from the scene in south-eastern Moscow showed the badly damaged entrance to a building with scorch marks on the walls and a number of windows blown out. Two body bags could also be seen on the street. The block was cordoned off on Tuesday morning as Russian investigators continued combing the area. In October, the UK placed sanctions on Kirillov, saying he had overseen the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine and acted as a \"significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation\". Ukraine's SBU has claimed Russia used chemical weapons more than 4,800 times under the general's leadership. Moscow denies the allegations. Ukraine kills Russian general: How will Moscow respond? What verified videos tell us about Igor Kirillov's death Igor Kirillov: Russia's chemical weapons chief and mouthpiece killed in Moscow The SK said it had \"opened a criminal case into the murder of two servicemen\". \"Investigators, forensic experts and operational services are working at the scene,\" it said. \"Investigative actions and operational search activities are being carried out aimed at establishing all the circumstances of the crime.\" Russian state news agencies reported that the explosive device - which killed Kirillov and his aide in Ryazansky Avenue - had an explosive force equivalent to 300g (0.7lb) of TNT. They added that bomb experts and specialist search dogs had inspected the surrounding area and no other explosives had been found. Experts have told BBC Verify that judging from images of the scene, it appears the explosion was caused by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) , a type of homemade bomb which usually contains easily obtainable components, such as nails or glass. AP Assassinations of senior officials have been carried out in Russia before, but attacks in Moscow are rare. Liza, who lives one building away from the site of the blast, told the BBC that while she was not entirely surprised, the killing of Igor Kirillov was a \"shocking\" development. \"It's one thing reading about it in the news, it feels far, but when it happens next door, that's completely different and frightening,\" she tells me. \"Until now, [the war] felt as if it was happening a long way off \u2013 now someone is dead, here, you can feel the consequences,\" Liza said, adding that \"unfortunately, I don't think things will calm down any time soon\". Several other local residents said they initially thought the loud noise they heard had come from a construction site. Student Mikhail Mashkov, who lives in the building next door, told the AFP news agency he was woken up by a \"very loud explosion noise\", thinking \"something fell at the construction site\", before looking outside. Olga Bogomolova said she thought a container had fallen at the construction site but then realised \"it was a very strong explosion\", saw \"broken windows\" and that it was something else. People living in the area told the BBC of their deep sense of shock. Even after nearly three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, for many Muscovites, the war is something that is happening a long way away - something they only see on TV or on their phones. The killing of a Russian general in Moscow is a sign that this war is very real and very close to home. EPA-EFE\/REX\/Shutterstock The explosive was reportedly hidden inside of an electric scooter Under UK sanctions, Kirillov was subject to an assets freeze and travel ban. In May, the US accused Russia of deploying chemical weapons as a \"method of warfare\" in Ukraine, in violation of international laws banning their use. State department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win \"battlefield gains\" over Ukraine. According to the SBU, Russian forces have used drones to drop chemical weapons on Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian Col Artem Vlasiuk had previously said that more than 2,000 Ukrainian service members had been treated in hospital for chemical poisoning over the course of the war and three people had died. The Kremlin rejected the accusations at the time, calling them \"baseless\". Russian general killed by bomb in residential Moscow building Kirillov served in different roles in Russia's military associated with hazardous materials, including the Directorate of the Chief of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops. He was appointed head of his unit in 2017. Reacting to Kirillov's death, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman said: \"Clearly we are not going to mourn the death of an individual who has propagated an illegal invasion and imposed suffering and death on the Ukrainian people.\" Ukraine's Security Services appear to be stepping up their targeting of senior Russian individuals, almost three years into the conflict. Kirillov's death comes less than a week after a prominent Russian weapons expert was shot dead near his home in Moscow. Ukrainian media reported that the assassination of Mikhail Shatsky was carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence service. Senior Russian naval officer Valery Trankovsky and Russian prison boss Sergei Yevsyukov also died after car bombs exploded in Russian-occupied Ukraine in recent weeks.

Share Losing Syria Is A 'Huge Slap In The Face' For Russia share Print When Vladimir Putin took the reins of power in a post-Soviet Russia in shambles a quarter-century ago, he immediately set about restoring Moscow's status as a global power. It took 15 years, but Russia heralded its military intervention in the Syrian civil war as proof of its return as a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. Moscow leveraged that image to expand its influence throughout the Middle East and beyond as a counterweight to the West. Now, the fall of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Moscow, has dealt a serious blow to Russia's great-power ambitions. \"Putin's military adventure in Syria was designed to demonstrate that Russia is a great power and can project its influence abroad,\" said Phillip Smyth, a Middle East expert. \"Losing Syria is a huge slap in the face for Putin.\" SEE ALSO: Syrian Militants' Capture Of Key City A 'Game-Changer' Assad's ouster represents not only a reputational hit to Russia but likely a major strategic setback. Syria is home to two major Russian military installations: an air base in Hmeimim and a naval base in Tartus. The latter is Russia's only warm-water naval base outside the former Soviet Union and provides Moscow access to the Mediterranean Sea. \"Russia has used its bases in Syria to project its power both into the eastern Mediterranean and into the broader Middle East,\" said Smyth. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has Russia's global ambitions at a crossroads. High-Maintenance Asset Russia's military intervention in Syria in 2015 changed the tide of the war. Moscow's devastating aerial campaigns against rebel positions helped the Syrian Army regain swaths of territory and keep Assad in power. Moscow's Syria campaign came a year after its invasion of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula as well as its support for separatist forces in Ukraine's east. Moscow capitalized on its involvement in both Syria and Ukraine to sell itself as a power capable of challenging the United States, NATO, and the West in general while expanding its global reach from the Mediterranean to Africa and Latin America. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Syria became more of an asset for Moscow, analysts say, while also presenting the challenge of maintaining military campaigns on two fronts. With the anticipated fall of Russian military assets in Syria following the collapse of Assad's government, the task has become even more daunting. Russia is already heavily invested in a major counteroffensive to regain captured territory in its southwestern Kursk region that it lost to Ukraine, to the point that it is relying on help from North Korean troops. At the same time, it is trying to take as much territory as it can in Ukraine's east before possible peace talks. Russian military facilities along the Mediterranean coast in western Syria could be overrun by militants led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and its allies. SEE ALSO: The Key Players In Syria's Reignited Civil War Aaron Zelin, senior fellow at the Washington Institute, says Russia simply does not have the same firepower at its disposal to protect its assets in Syria. \"It is important to remember that Russia has to deal with its larger war in Ukraine now compared to when they first went in Syria in 2015,\" Zelin said. \"Russia also has its assets fighting in sub-Saharan Africa, too. And unlike a decade ago, when Russia had the Wagner Group led by [the deceased Yevgeny] Prigozhin...Russia doesn't have the same level of capacity or capability to deal with this now in the same way.\" Zelin said losing the Tartus naval base, in particular, would be an \"extremely huge loss for Russia.\" \"It's Russia's only warm-water port that it can use for its naval activities and power projection,\" he said. \"Losing it would essentially cut Russia out of the core of the Middle East.\" Bashar al-Assad (left) and Vladimir Putin meet in Moscow in July. Moscow did not send ground troops to help Damascus, which fell to the HTS and its allies on December 8. Russia has conducted dozens of air strikes since the militants launched their offensive against Assad's forces in late November, but Moscow's limited intervention did little to stop the rebel advance. Russia will pay a huge price for its failure in Syria, analysts say.

Fourteen others are taken to Cartagena by Spanish rescuers. The ship's owners subsequently blame the sinking on a \"terrorist attack\".","text":"Russian ship under US sanctions sinks after engine room blast 24 December 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe Editor Share Save Reuters Ursa Major was seen listing heavily on Monday afternoon before sinking overnight A Russian cargo ship, Ursa Major, has sunk in the Mediterranean between Spain and Algeria after an explosion in the engine room, Russia's foreign ministry has confirmed. It said 14 members of the crew had been rescued and taken to the Spanish port of Cartagena but that two others were missing. Ursa Major left port in St Petersburg 12 days ago, according to Russian news agency Interfax. The ship's owner said it was on its way to Vladivostok in Russia's Far East carrying two cranes for the port weighing 380 tonnes apiece, although the destination could not be confirmed independently. Before Ursa Major sank, Spain's Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo maritime rescue agency said 14 people were found on a lifeboat and taken safely to Spain and a Russian warship then arrived in the area to take charge of the rescue operation. Ursa Major was in the same area of the Med as another sanctioned Russian ship,  Sparta, when it ran into trouble and the two ships had been spotted heading through the English Channel last week, reportedly under escort. Earlier this month, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) reported that the Sparta was heading to Russia's naval base on the Syrian coast at Tartous to move military equipment out of Syria after the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. A Kremlin official said on Monday that Russia was in contact with Syria's new rulers on the future of its two military facilities, at both diplomatic and military level. Ursa Major's owner Oboronlogistika has been heavily involved in transporting cargo to Tartous, although Sparta's reported destination on Tuesday was Port Said in Egypt. Marine transport monitoring website LSEG told the BBC that Ursa Major's automatic ID system (AIS) showed that its destination since 11 December had been Vladivostok, and that its last call at the port of Tartous had been in July. Rosmorport Ursa Major was placed under US sanction in 2022 On Monday, the HUR reported that the Sparta had broken down off Portugal, but the problem had been fixed. Ursa Major was originally known as Sparta III, so it was not clear which ship the Ukrainians were referring to. However, the Sparta also got into difficulty a week ago, in rough seas off Brittany in the north-west of France. Radio France Inter reported that the Russian cargo ship initially did not respond to French communications on Tuesday 17 December, until acknowledging it had a problem. \"I'm in trouble. My engines are currently down, the tiller isn't responding. We're going to try to repair it in the coming minutes,\" RFI reported the ship's radio as saying . After drifting for 61 minutes, the Sparta said it was back on course. It is not known what caused the explosion on Ursa Major as it passed between Oran in Algeria and the Spanish town of \u00c1guilas on Monday afternoon. However, video filmed from the tanker Ross Sea between 12:00-13:00GMT on 23 December, and verified by the BBC, showed the ship listing badly. It eventually sank at about 01:20GMT on Tuesday. Ursa Major was built in 2009 and placed under sanction after Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine in 2022 because of the ship owner's role in delivering cargo to the Russian military. Oboronlogistika said the cargo ship, which it described as the flagship of its fleet, was carrying 45-tonne hatch covers for icebreakers, as well as the large cranes for the port in Vladivostok.

{"year":"2024","month":"12","event_desc":"27 December  The South Korean National Intelligence Service says that a North Korean soldier has been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces for the first time during the 2024 Kursk offensive. However, the soldier is reported to have died later in the day from injuries sustained in combat.","text":"North Korean soldier captured in Ukraine dies, reports say 27 December 2024 Share Save Koh Ewe BBC News Share Save Getty Images North Korea is believed to have sent more than 10,000 soldiers to support Russia's war in Ukraine An injured North Korean soldier captured by Ukrainian forces has died, Yonhap News Agency has reported, citing a statement from South Korea's spy agency. The soldier is believed to be the first North Korean prisoner of war captured since Pyongyang deployed forces to support Russia's war in Ukraine. Separately, the White House said North Korean forces were experiencing mass casualties, and alleged that 1,000 of their troops had been killed or wounded over the past week in the Kursk region of Russia. North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia, according to Kyiv and Seoul - though Moscow and Pyongyang have neither confirmed nor denied their presence. White House spokesperson John Kirby suggested that Russian and North Korean military leaders were treating the troops as \"expendable\". They were being ordered to carry out \"hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences\" and were being used in \"massed dismounted assaults\", he said. South Korea's National Intelligence Service said it had confirmed through an  \"allied intelligence agency\" that the  captured North Korean soldier had died from \"serious injuries\", Yonhap reported. The spy agency earlier confirmed that Ukrainian forces had captured the soldier after a photo purporting to show the man had been circulating on Telegram. \"This is the first in a string of captures and killings,\" Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC. \"For Ukrainians, it's more beneficial to capture these North Korean troops and try to exchange them with Russians for Ukrainian prisoners of war.\" Recent images emerging from the Russia-Ukraine war confirmed speculations that \"North Korean troops will be deployed in large numbers to the assault by Russian command\", Mr Yang said. He also added, however, that \"it will be challenging to prove their North Korean nationality\". Ukrainian forces say that North Korean soldiers have been issued with fake Russian IDs, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted footage last week which he said showed Russian troops burning the faces of slain North Koreans to conceal their identities. Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence services have said that many of the troops deployed to Russia are some of Pyongyang's best, drawn from the 11th Corps, also known as the Storm Corps. The unit is trained in infiltration, infrastructure sabotage and assassinations. More than 3,000 North Korean troops have died or been wounded while fighting in Russia's Kursk region, Zelensky said Monday. He added that the collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang heightened the \"risk of destabilisation\" around the Korean peninsula. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The recent deployment of North Korean troops to Russia is a sign of a growing alliance between the two pariah states. The development, which comes as North Korea ratchets up tensions with South Korea, has sparked worries in the West. China, a long-standing ally of both sides, is also keeping a cautious eye on the friendship .

The spill occurred on Dec. 15 after two Russian-flagged oil tankers were damaged during a storm, releasing thousands of tons of heavy fuel oil \u2014 known as mazut \u2014 into the Black Sea. Emergency officials reported Monday that the spill had polluted approximately 55 kilometers (34 miles) of coastline. Authorities in affected coastal communities, including the resort city of Anapa, had previously declared local emergencies to address the growing layers of oil washing up on beaches. However, residents and volunteers argued that the spill warranted a national-level emergency, which would unlock additional resources for the cleanup.

According to Kondratyev, initial expert assessments suggested that most of the oil residue would settle on the seabed, making it easier to collect. However, he noted that warmer temperatures were causing the oil to rise to the surface and wash ashore. The regional emergency declaration will allow Krasnodar authorities to allocate additional resources, mobilize emergency services and request federal assistance if needed. At his annual press conference on Thursday, President Vladimir Putin blamed the oil tankers\u2019 captains for the disaster, claiming they ventured out to sea without authorization. Meanwhile, volunteers and activists have criticized regional authorities for their slow and disorganized response to the environmental crisis.

Meanwhile, a declassified report in the US claims that President Putin ordered a campaign to influence last year's election against Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.","text":"Syria conflict: Russia 'withdrawing aircraft carrier group' Published 6 January 2017 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Russian Defence Ministry Image caption, Russian bombers turned the tide decisively in favour of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Russia is starting to withdraw forces from Syria and its aircraft carrier group will be the first to leave, the Russian armed forces chief says. The announcement comes days after Russia and Turkey negotiated a ceasefire in Syria which is largely holding, according to the UN. Russia has carried out air strikes on anti-government rebels since 2015. Moscow's involvement is credited with turning the war in favour of its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russian intervention - five key points How bombing campaign paid off for Putin Russia used Syria as live-fire training - US general \"In accordance with the decision of the supreme commander of the Russian armed forces Vladimir Putin, the Russian defence ministry is beginning the reduction of the armed deployment to Syria,\" Gen Valery Gerasimov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. Tasks set for the carrier group, led by the Admiral Kuznetsov vessel, had been completed, the commander of the Russian force in Syria Col-Gen Andrei Kartapolov was quoted as saying. Col-Gen Kartapolov said Russia still had sufficient air defence capabilities in its S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems deployed in Syria, AFP news agency reported. The force reduction follows an order from President Putin on 29 December, days after Syrian government troops finally ousted rebels from the key battleground city of Aleppo in their biggest victory since the uprising against President Assad began in 2011. Russia, along with Turkey and Iran, is now pushing for peace talks to be held later this month in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana. Russia first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015, saying they were targeting the fighters of so-called Islamic State. Last March, Russia announced it was withdrawing forces but continued air strikes. End of a chapter, not an era - Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News Image source, Reuters Image caption, The naval group led by the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov has played a minor role in the fighting This is not Russia's first \"withdrawal\" from Syria. In March 2016 President Putin announced the start of a pull-out. Some warplanes were flown out. But Russia's military role continued and its air power remained decisive. Russia has aircraft, air defences and artillery deployed in Syria, along with many advisers working with Syrian government forces. But we have never been able to ascertain the exact scale of the Russian forces involved. The initial phase of the Russian \"draw-down\" involves the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and its naval group, which has hardly played a major role in the fighting. Russia's stated intention is to build up its bases in Syria for the long-term, but Mr Putin may be signalling that in Moscow's view, with the fall of Aleppo and the entrenchment of the Assad regime, one important phase of the fighting is over.","question":"When did Russia begin withdrawing its aircraft carrier group from Syria in 2017?","answer":"Russia began withdrawing its aircraft carrier group from Syria on 6 January 2017.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: Russia began withdrawing its aircraft carrier group from Syria on January 6, 2017.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer in terms of the date (6 January 2017 vs. January 6, 2017), which are the same date written in different formats.

{"year":"2017","month":"01","event_desc":"27 January - Russian lawmakers voted, 3803, to decriminalize certain forms of domestic violence. Under the new law, first-time offenses that do not result in \"serious bodily harm\" carry a maximum fine of 30,000 rubles, up to 15 days' administrative arrest, or up to 120 hours of community service.","text":"Russia parliament votes 380-3 to decriminalize domestic violence Doug Stanglin |\u00a0USATODAY Russia's parliament voted 380-3 on Friday to decriminalize domestic violence in cases where it does not cause \"substantial bodily harm\" and does not occur more than once a year. The move, which eliminates\u00a0criminal liability in such cases,\u00a0makes a violation punishable by a fine of roughly\u00a0$500, or a\u00a015-day arrest, provided there is no repeat within 12 months. The bill now goes to the rubber-stamp upper chamber, where no opposition is expected. It then must be signed by President Vladimir Putin, who has signaled his support. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists\u00a0that family conflicts do \"not necessarily constitute domestic violence.\" USA TODAY Kremlin: Trump, Putin to speak by phone Saturday The passage by the parliament, or Duma,\u00a0reverses a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, subsequently backed by\u00a0parliament, that decriminalized\u00a0battery that does not inflict bodily harm, but retained criminal charges involving battery against\u00a0family members. That reform is effectively reversed by Friday's vote. Andrei Isayev of the main Kremlin faction, the United Russia, said lawmakers are \u201cheeding the public call\u201d by correcting a mistake they made last year. Russia is one of three countries in Europe and Central Asia that do not have laws specifically targeting domestic violence, according to The Economist . USA TODAY Reports: Arrested Russian intel officer allegedly spied for U.S. Critics of the new measure warned it would encourage domestic violence and fuel crime. \u201cThis bill would establish violence as a norm of conduct,\u201d Communist lawmaker Yuri Sinelshchikov said during the debate. Women's\u00a0rights lawyer Mari Davtyan told The Moscow Times that the legislative moves are dangerous and \"send a message that the state doesn\u2019t consider familial battery fundamentally wrong anymore.\u201d A survey this month by state-run pollster VTsIOM found\u00a019% of Russians said \u201cit can be acceptable\u201d to hit one\u2019s wife, husband or child \u201cin certain circumstances,\u201d the Associated Press reported. The nationwide poll by phone of 1,800 people was held Jan. 13-15. The survey had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. USA TODAY What Russians are Googling about President Donald Trump In many ways, this reflects the thrust of an old Russian proverb: \u201cIf he beats you it means he loves you.\u201d According to Russian government statistics from the Interior Ministry, 40% of all violent crimes are committed within the family. The figures correlate to 36,000 women being beaten by their partners every day and 26,000 children being assaulted by their parents every year. Last year's revised\u00a0law, when it took in effect\u00a0in July,\u00a0quickly drew opponents, notably ultra-conservative Russian lawmaker Yelena Mizulina, who called it \"anti-family\" and said it undermined\u00a0parents' \"right\" to beat their children. That view was echoed at the time by\u00a0The All-Russian Parents\u2019 Resistance movement\u00a0that warned on its website that \"(p)arents no longer have the right to choose methods of upbringing.\u201d USA TODAY Russian journalist has advice for Americans covering Trump Alyona Popova, activist and women\u2019s rights advocate,\u00a0lamented that this attitude is widespread in Russia, The Moscow Times reported . \u201cTraditional, or rather archaic values have become popular again,\u201d she said. Even Russian police are\u00a0often reluctant to get involved in\u00a0domestic violence cases, which many regard as meddling in family affairs. In November, prosecutors\u00a0began investigating a police officer who took a call from a woman complaining about her boyfriend\u2019s aggressive behavior. Instead of offering help, the officer reportedly told the woman that the police would only come if she got killed. Shortly afterward, the man beat the woman to death, the AP reported.

At least 30 people were reported to have been held in St Petersburg and more than 16 in the southern city of Kemerovo. Activists in some other cities were kept away from protests, reports said. President Putin has not confirmed that he will run in March 2018 but he is widely expected to do so. The rallies - held under the slogan \"We're sick of him\" - were organised by the Open Russia movement founded by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, a fierce critic of President Putin, lives in exile after spending 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. Protesters also held an unauthorised rally in central Moscow on Saturday, but the presidential reception office, to which they planned to submit letters, was blocked off. A journalist with AFP news agency in St Petersburg said about 200 people had gathered for the rally and at least 30 protesters were taken away by authorities. Open Russia put the figure at about 50 people while OVD-Info, which monitors the detentions of political activists, said more than 125 had been detained. Police did not release official figures. Image source, EPA Image caption, Police were out in force for the rally in Moscow \"Putin is an usurper. He has to finally go. We're sick of him,\" said one protester in St Petersburg, quoted by AFP. \"Everything is bad. Education, health - everything has been destroyed. I want changes,\" said another. The protests come days after Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny was taken to hospital when a green antiseptic solution was splashed in his face. Mr Navalny is one of Russia's foremost critics of President Putin and has announced his intention to run for president himself. However, a conviction for embezzlement - which he denies - would bar him from running for office. Mr Putin has been a dominant political figure in Russia since his election as president in 2000. He served two terms and then a four-year stint as prime minister, before resuming the presidency in 2012.

The move, which eliminates\u00a0criminal liability in such cases,\u00a0makes a violation punishable by a fine of roughly\u00a0$500, or a\u00a015-day arrest, provided there is no repeat within 12 months. The bill now goes to the rubber-stamp upper chamber, where no opposition is expected. It then must be signed by President Vladimir Putin, who has signaled his support. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists\u00a0that family conflicts do \"not necessarily constitute domestic violence.\" USA TODAY Kremlin: Trump, Putin to speak by phone Saturday The passage by the parliament, or Duma,\u00a0reverses a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, subsequently backed by\u00a0parliament, that decriminalized\u00a0battery that does not inflict bodily harm, but retained criminal charges involving battery against\u00a0family members. That reform is effectively reversed by Friday's vote. Andrei Isayev of the main Kremlin faction, the United Russia, said lawmakers are \u201cheeding the public call\u201d by correcting a mistake they made last year. Russia is one of three countries in Europe and Central Asia that do not have laws specifically targeting domestic violence, according to The Economist . USA TODAY Reports: Arrested Russian intel officer allegedly spied for U.S. Critics of the new measure warned it would encourage domestic violence and fuel crime. \u201cThis bill would establish violence as a norm of conduct,\u201d Communist lawmaker Yuri Sinelshchikov said during the debate. Women's\u00a0rights lawyer Mari Davtyan told The Moscow Times that the legislative moves are dangerous and \"send a message that the state doesn\u2019t consider familial battery fundamentally wrong anymore.\u201d A survey this month by state-run pollster VTsIOM found\u00a019% of Russians said \u201cit can be acceptable\u201d to hit one\u2019s wife, husband or child \u201cin certain circumstances,\u201d the Associated Press reported. The nationwide poll by phone of 1,800 people was held Jan. 13-15. The survey had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. USA TODAY What Russians are Googling about President Donald Trump In many ways, this reflects the thrust of an old Russian proverb: \u201cIf he beats you it means he loves you.\u201d According to Russian government statistics from the Interior Ministry, 40% of all violent crimes are committed within the family. The figures correlate to 36,000 women being beaten by their partners every day and 26,000 children being assaulted by their parents every year. Last year's revised\u00a0law, when it took in effect\u00a0in July,\u00a0quickly drew opponents, notably ultra-conservative Russian lawmaker Yelena Mizulina, who called it \"anti-family\" and said it undermined\u00a0parents' \"right\" to beat their children. That view was echoed at the time by\u00a0The All-Russian Parents\u2019 Resistance movement\u00a0that warned on its website that \"(p)arents no longer have the right to choose methods of upbringing.\u201d USA TODAY Russian journalist has advice for Americans covering Trump Alyona Popova, activist and women\u2019s rights advocate,\u00a0lamented that this attitude is widespread in Russia, The Moscow Times reported . \u201cTraditional, or rather archaic values have become popular again,\u201d she said. Even Russian police are\u00a0often reluctant to get involved in\u00a0domestic violence cases, which many regard as meddling in family affairs. In November, prosecutors\u00a0began investigating a police officer who took a call from a woman complaining about her boyfriend\u2019s aggressive behavior. Instead of offering help, the officer reportedly told the woman that the police would only come if she got killed. Shortly afterward, the man beat the woman to death, the AP reported.

The Executive Committee unanimously supported the recommendation expressed by the chairman of the independent Audit and Compliance Committee Domenico Scala in his report to the Executive Committee today that the chairmen of the Ethics Committee (both chambers) publish the report on the inquiry into the 2018\/2022 FIFA World Cup\u2122 Bidding Process prepared by the investigatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee. The Executive Committee stressed that such a publication must of course fully adhere to the provisions of the FIFA Code of Ethics (FCE), notably the obligation of confidentiality (art. 36 of the FCE). It also recommended that such a publication should only occur after cases against individuals have been concluded, as also recommended by Mr Scala. Furthermore, the Executive Committee took note of Domenico Scala\u2019s report and legal opinion regarding the 2 December 2010 decisions (i.e. the vote for the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups\u2122), notably that \u201c the members of the FIFA Executive Committee \u2013 given the findings of the report of the chairman and deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee on the inquiry into the 2018\/2022 FIFA World Cup\u2122 Bidding Process \u2013 do not have to revoke the decisions taken by the Executive Committee on 2 December 2010.\u201d The Executive Committee also welcomed the recommendations of the Ethics Committee, supported by the independent Audit and Compliance Committee chairman, regarding future bidding processes, with the aim now being to focus on the 2026 FIFA World Cup\u2122. Following the resignation of the chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, Michael J. Garcia, the Executive Committee appointed the current deputy, Cornel Borb\u00e9ly, to chair the chamber until the next FIFA Congress in May 2015. 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia\u2122 The Executive Committee approved the tournament dates, with the opening game to be played on14 June and the final on 15 July 2018. The FIFA Confederations Cup 2017 will kick off on 17 June and end on 2 July 2017. It also agreed that the AFC and CONCACAF could start their preliminary competitions prior to the Preliminary Draw (scheduled to take place in St Petersburg on 25 July 2015), with the first games kicking off in March next year. Furthermore, thanks to the good financial results of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\u2122, a proposal from the Finance Committee for each member association to receive a contribution of USD 300,000 to the costs of qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup\u2122 \u2013 subject to audit \u2013 was approved. 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar\u2122 The Executive Committee confirmed that the dates of the competition would be decided at their next meeting in March 2015. The Task Force for the International Match Calendar 2018-2024 and the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar\u2122, which is chaired by AFC President Shk. Salman bin Ebrahim al Khalifa, will hold its next meeting in Doha on 24 February. Regarding the issue of labour rights in Qatar, the Executive Committee confirmed its strong support for the creation of an independent body \u2013 as recommended in the relevant DLA Piper report \u2013 to oversee the implementation of the reform programme in the country. It also mandated FIFA President Blatter, with Dr Theo Zwanziger, to discuss this issue with the political authorities of the country and make sure that FIFA was represented on this body. Israel-Palestine The Executive Committee heard a detailed report from Cyprus FA President Costakis Koutsokoumnis, who was appointed to observe the implementation of the approved parameters concerning the movement of players and officials into, out of, and within Palestine (see FIFA circular 1385 ). While the report expressed its satisfaction on the progress achieved during the last six months, it also stressed that FIFA\u2019s ultimate objective was the full implementation of circular 1385 \u2013 which had not yet been achieved \u2013 as soon as possible. As a result, the Executive Committee clearly expects the pace of implementation to accelerate during the coming months. In order to further improve the situation, the Executive Committee has decided to invite the DCO (Palestinian District Coordination Offices) and COGAT (Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories) to participate in the working group together with the Palestinian FA, the Israel FA and FIFA, in order to ensure full implementation of the said circular. Furthermore, FIFA President Blatter stated: \u201cI condemn the recent raid on the offices of the Palestinian Football Association. Such actions are not only a blow for the international football community but it also puts the whole process at risk. Football shall unite. I encourage the Palestinian FA to continue its successful work for football in Palestine, which culminated with their qualification for the upcoming AFC Asian Cup.\u201d Regarding other FIFA member associations , the following decisions were taken: - Cyprus : the Executive Committee commended and expressed its support for the considerable efforts of the President of the Cyprus Turkish Football Association (CTFA) relating to the arrangement signed by the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) and the CTFA last year aiming to unify and facilitate the progress of football within the football communities on the island of Cyprus. It called upon the CTFA to apply for membership of the CFA as soon as possible. - Togo (FTF): appointment of a normalisation committee to revise the FTF statutes and to organise elections by 30 November 2015 at the latest - Iraq : independent group to travel to Iraq with FIFA Vice-President HRH Prince Ali bin al Hussein to assess the security situation in view of the possibility of international matches being played there - Ratification of the recent decisions of the FIFA Emergency Committee on the situation in Maldives and Cameroon . Third-party ownership of players\u2019 economic rights Following its decision of general principle that third-party ownership of players\u2019 economic rights (TPO) shall be banned with a transitional period, the Executive Committee approved the following measures: - The ban will come into force on 1 May 2015 - Existing agreements shall continue to be in place until their contractual expiry - New agreements made between 1 January and 30 April 2015 will be subject to a time limit (one year maximum) Protection of minors In order to strengthen the protection of minors and due to the increased number of international transfers of players younger than 12, the Executive Committee has approved a reduction in the age limit for which an international transfer certificate (ITC) is required to the age of 10. Fight against Ebola The Executive Committee commended the \u201c11 against Ebola\u201d campaign supported by top international players, FIFA, CAF and the World Bank to support the fight against the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Other decisions: - FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup Canada 2015\u2122 : approval of an increase by 50% of the prize money (from USD 10 million in 2011 to USD 15 million for the 2015 edition), with USD 2 million for the winning team - FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup 2017 : appointment of the Bahamas as hosts - Refereeing : regarding the age limit for FIFA international referees, the Executive Committee approved the proposal from the Referees Committee that every FIFA referee over the age of 45 shall be carefully evaluated by the Referees Committee every year according to technical assessments, medical examinations and fitness tests - Futsal : approval of the 2016-2020 Futsal International Match Calendar The next meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee will be held in Zurich on Thursday 19 and Friday 20 March 2015.

Share Siberian Death Toll From Alcohol Poisoning Rises To 76 share Print The death toll resulting from dozens of people drinking poisonous bath lotion in Siberia's Irkutsk region since December 17 has risen to at least 76. Russian regional health officials said on January 9 that three other people are still hospitalized after reportedly poisoning themselves by drinking the poisonous bath lotion despite warning labels on the product saying it is not for internal consumption. Russia's Investigative Committee said the bath lotion contained methyl wood alcohol -- which can be fatal if consumed -- rather than the ethyl grain alcohol contained in alcoholic beverages. The Investigative Committee said 22 people suspected of selling the lotion had been detained since the wave of deaths began. It said eight were later charged, and nine were placed under house arrest, while five others were ordered not to leave the region while investigations continue. On December 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to introduce tougher laws by July 2017 on the production and sale of perfumes, lotions, and household cleaners that contain any type of alcohol. Putin also called for tighter controls on human and veterinary medicines. Poisonings with surrogate alcohol are common in Russia, where people sometimes drink substances with alcohol that are cheaper than alcoholic beverages.

The government also took new steps to stifle, and parliament passed laws further curbing, freedom of online expression and the media. The authorities viciously harassed political and civic activists and upped prosecution for online speech . Chechen security officials, on orders of top local leadership, carried out a large-scale anti-gay purge , while federal authorities have not held those responsible to account. \u201cLast year was a dark year for independent voices in Russia,\u201d said Tanya Lokshina , Russia program director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cAs the March 2018 presidential election approaches, the Kremlin is stepping up on repressive measures to discourage political opposition, independent activism and critical expression.\u201d In the 643-page World Report , its 28th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 90 countries. In his introductory essay , Executive Director Kenneth Roth writes that political leaders willing to stand up for human rights principles showed that it is possible to limit authoritarian populist agendas. When combined with mobilized publics and effective multilateral actors, these leaders demonstrated that the rise of anti-rights governments is not inevitable. In the first six months of 2017 alone, the number of people fined or placed in custody for alleged violations of regulations on public gatherings was two and a half times higher than throughout 2016. In most cases, officials refused to authorize demonstrations, and arbitrarily detained, harassed, and intimidated peaceful protesters , including schoolchildren and university students, and the parents of children who participated. The authorities systematically interfered with the presidential campaign of the opposition politician and anti-corruption activist, Alexei Navalny. Although formally disqualified from running due to a politically motivated criminal conviction, Navalny opened campaign offices in most of Russia\u2019s regions. Police searched Navalny\u2019s offices , arbitrarily seized campaign materials , detained campaigners on groundless charges, and raided the homes of local campaigners and their relatives. Ultra-nationalist groups and pro-Kremlin activists increasingly targeted Navalny campaigners and offices. Attackers vandalized campaign offices or campaigners\u2019 homes, stormed into meetings, and even physically assaulted campaigners. There have also been several violent attacks on independent activists and journalists . As December drew to a close, masked assailants attacked three environmental rights defenders and a journalist in Krasnodar. One of the victims, Andrei Rudomakha, required extensive hospital treatment for a fractured skull and a broken nose. Authorities continued their large-scale smear campaign against independent non-governmental organizations, and penalized seven local groups for supposed cooperation with foreign organizations banned as \u201cundesirable.\u201d Legislation adopted in July banned anonymous use of online messenger applications and software designed to circumvent internet censorship. In November, parliament adopted a law enabling the government to designate any media organization or information distributor of foreign origin as \u201c foreign media performing the functions of a foreign agent \u201d, and requiring it to comply with the restrictive regulations for nongovernment groups set out in the 2012 \u201cforeign agents\u201d law. The law also allows authorities to extrajudicially block websites that have \u201cinformation materials of undesirable organizations\u201d or calls for unauthorized public gatherings and extremist actions, including information accessible through hyperlinks. In December, authorities threatened to block Twitter and YouTube if they failed to remove content by a banned \u201cundesirable\u201d organization. Negotiations are in progress. In early spring, security officials in Chechnya unlawfully rounded up dozens of men they presumed gay, holding and torturing them in unofficial facilities, outing them to their families and encouraging honor killings. Chechnya\u2019s leadership responded to a media outcry by denying that there were any gay people in Chechnya and accusing journalists and human rights defenders of seeking to destabilize the republic. Federal authorities opened an investigation, but have provided no effective remedy. In early January 2018, at leading Russian rights group, Memorial Human Rights Center, Chechen authorities arrested Memorial\u2019s Chechnya director, Oyub Titiev , on fraudulent drug charges. Despite persistently high rates of domestic violence, in February the Russian government enacted a law decriminalizing acts of domestic violence that don\u2019t cause serious bodily harm. Workers on stadiums being built for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup suffered exploitation , including not providing them with contracts, withholding their wages, and retaliating for reporting abuses. Russian authorities stepped up on repression against critics in occupied Crimea, primarily Crimean Tatars , and provided political and material support to armed self-styled separatists in eastern Ukraine while turning a blind eye to their abuses. Syrian and Russian forces carried out unlawful attacks in Syria, including airstrikes on schools and hospitals, and air-dropped cluster munitions and incendiary weapons in populated areas. Russia protected Syria\u2019s government from repercussions for violating the laws of war. It has used its Security Council veto 11 times since 2011 to shield Damascus from consequences like sanctions or referral to the International Criminal Court.

The protesters are believed to be linked to nationalist politician Vyacheslav Maltsev's Artillery Preparation movement. It has been declared extremist and is banned in Russia. Mr Maltsev says a revolution is imminent. Last year in a debate he called for Mr Putin to be impeached.

An AFP photographer said police wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests at one point confronted the protesters in central Moscow. Many of those arrested were reported to be men in their twenties and some are believed to have been released without charge soon afterwards. Mr Maltsev ran for a parliament last year and runs a popular YouTube channel which is frequently critical of the government.

{"year":"2017","month":"10","event_desc":"2 October  Iran nuclear deal cover by Russia official, US ambassador to UN  warns, Russia is backing shield prevent to pass agreement to United States President, Donald Trump.","text":"UNITED NATIONS Russia giving cover to Iran could doom nuclear deal as Trump considers whether to certify By Ben Evansky , Fox News Published October 1, 2017 10:30pm EDT | Updated October 1, 2017 10:43pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Some European leaders vow to stand by Iran nuclear deal President Trump slams the agreement at the United Nations, calls it 'the worst' As President Donald Trump considers whether to certify to Congress the controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, word that the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog can\u2019t verify a crucial part of the agreement could tip the scales with time running out by the middle of next month. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley indicated Thursday that Russia was shielding Iran by blocking the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from verifying part of the deal. The IAEA initially revealed the news to a reporter in a Q&A. Meanwhile, under a requirement from Congress, Trump must choose whether to certify the deal by October 15. Yukiya Amano, the IAEA Director General, told Reuters that his agency\u2019s \u201ctools are limited,\u201d regarding verification of section T in the nuclear deal. Section T of the Iran nuclear deal, which is also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), prohibits activities related to \u201cdesign and development\u201d of a nuclear weapon. Amano told Reuters that the Russians don\u2019t believe the IAEA has a mandate for that particular section of the agreement. In response to his admission, Haley, not referring to Russia by name in her statement, said that for the deal to have meaning, \u201cthe parties must have a common understanding of its terms.\u201d Rouhani slams President Trump over Iran nuke deal Iranian president responds to Trump's U.N. address, claims country is following agreement; senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports from the United Nations \u201cNow it appears that some countries are attempting to shield Iran from even more inspections. Without inspections, the Iran deal is an empty promise,\u201d she said in the statement released Thursday. The United States Mission to the U.N. when asked for further comment on Haley\u2019s views on certification and on whether the deal is failing because of Iranian noncompliance referred Fox News to Haley\u2019s latest statement and a speech she made to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in Washington, D.C. in September. Haley\u2019s AEI speech was broadly interpreted as laying out the administration\u2019s case for not certifying the Iran Nuclear deal. Congress requires the president to certify the Iran deal every 90 days under the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) \u2014 also known as the Corker-Cardin bill \u2014 that was passed in 2015, paving the way for the Iran nuclear deal, a cornerstone of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy legacy. David Albright, who has advised the IAEA in the past, is the founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington D.C. He told Fox News that Russia\u2019s not wanting to let the IAEA verify section T could be problematic. Netanyahu praises Trump, denounces Iran's nuclear ambitions Israel's prime minister echoes President Trump's criticism of the nuclear deal with Iran; senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports from the United Nations \u201cAmano basically said that the IAEA is not implementing the verification of section T and is unsure how to proceed. He wants guidance from the Joint Commission. However, Russia has said it does not want the IAEA to verify section T. If it sticks to that position in the Joint Commission and blocks instructions to the IAEA to proceed with verifying Section T, and the IAEA does not act on its own to verify Section T or find a work around, then the verification of the JCPOA is incomplete and the deal is not fully implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cFull implementation is a requirement for the President to certify under INARA (Corker-Cardin). Lack of verification of Section T would also demonstrate that the deal does not deliver like promised and promoted by deal supporters,\u201d Albright told Fox News. Omri Ceren, a veteran Middle East expert and a leading critic of the Iran deal, said the IAEA\u2019s inability to verify this part of it should make the president\u2019s decision on certification simple. \u201cThere\u2019s no wiggle room here. The law requires the president to tell Congress yes or no, do we know if Iran has \u2018fully implemented\u2019 the deal? The U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog just said they don\u2019t know if Iran has implemented the section of the deal about nuclear weapons\u2019 work, because Iran won\u2019t let them into military bases where that work is likely to occur. Advocates of the Iran deal are saying the president should certify anyway. They\u2019re asking him to lie to Congress on behalf of the deal,\u201d Ceren said. Trump recently hinted that he might not certify when the 90 days is up on October 15. Since taking office he has twice certified the deal as required by Congress.

The fire started around 7 a.m. in the warehouse\u2019s first-floor loading zone and quickly climbed an elevator shaft to the fourth floor, where around 30 workers were finishing their night shift.

REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia further curtailed its cooperation with the United States in nuclear energy on Wednesday, suspending a research agreement and terminating one on uranium conversion, two days after the Kremlin shelved a plutonium pact with Washington. The Russian government said that as counter-measures to the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine, it was putting aside a nuclear and energy-related research pact with the United States. It also said it was terminating for the same reasons an agreement between its nuclear corporation Rosatom and the U.S. Department of Energy on feasibility studies into conversion of Russian research reactors to low-enriched uranium. On Monday, President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons grade plutonium, signalling he is willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria. \"The regular renewal of sanctions against Russia, which include the suspension of Russian-American cooperation in the field of nuclear energy demands the adoption of countermeasures against the U.S. side,\" the Russian government said on its website. In Washington, a State Department spokesman said the United States had not received an official notification from Russia although he had seen media reports of the suspension of the research agreement. \"If they're accurate, we would regret the Russian decision to unilaterally suspend cooperation on what we believe is a very important issue that's in the interest of both of our countries,\" spokesman Mark Toner said at a daily news briefing. \"UNFRIENDLY ACTS\" The Russian Foreign Ministry said the decisions were taken in response to \"unfriendly acts\" by Washington. They came two days after Washington said it was suspending talks with Russia on trying to end the violence in Syria. The agreement on co-operation in nuclear and energy-related scientific research, signed in 2013, provided the legal framework necessary to expand work between U.S. and Russian nuclear research laboratories and institutes in nuclear technology and nonproliferation, among others. The uranium agreement, signed in 2010, provided for feasibility studies into the conversion of six Russian research reactors from dangerous highly enriched uranium to more secure low enriched uranium. \"We can no longer trust Washington in such a sensitive area as the modernization and security of Russian nuclear facilities,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. It said that should Russia decide on the feasibility of the conversion of any research reactors to low-enriched uranium, it will carry the work itself. But it warned the conversion may not be \"an end in itself.\" \"In some cases, including in the production of medical isotopes, highly enriched uranium is the most effective and renouncing its would be technically and economically inexpedient,\" the ministry said. The West imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, followed by a pro-Russian insurrection in the east of the country. The breakdown of a ceasefire in Syria, where Russia backs government forces and the West supports rebel groups, has added to tensions.

REUTERS\/Ivan Sekretarev Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he is willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria. Starting in the last years of the Cold War, Russia and the United States signed a series of accords to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals, agreements that have so far survived intact despite a souring of U.S.-Russian relations under Putin. But on Monday, Putin issued a decree suspending an agreement, concluded in 2000, which bound the two sides to dispose of surplus plutonium originally intended for use in nuclear weapons. The Kremlin said it was taking that action in response to unfriendly acts by Washington. It made the announcement shortly before Washington said it was suspending talks with Russia on trying to end the violence in Syria. The plutonium accord is not the cornerstone of post-Cold War U.S.-Russia disarmament, and the practical implications from the suspension will be limited. But the suspension, and the linkage to disagreements on other issues, carries powerful symbolism. \"Putin's decree could signal that other nuclear disarmament cooperation deals between the United States and Russia are at risk of being undermined,\" Stratfor, a U.S.-based consultancy, said in a commentary. \"The decision is likely an attempt to convey to Washington the price of cutting off dialogue on Syria and other issues.\" U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement on Monday that bilateral contacts with Moscow over Syria were being suspended. Kirby said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under a ceasefire agreement. Western diplomats say an end to the Syria talks leaves Moscow free to pursue its military operation in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but without a way to disentangle itself from a conflict which shows no sign of ending. Russia and the United States are also at loggerheads over Ukraine. Washington, along with Europe, imposed sanctions on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and backed pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine. LIST OF GRIEVANCES Putin submitted a draft law to parliament setting out under what conditions work under the plutonium accord could be resumed. Those conditions were a laundry list of Russian grievances towards the United States. They included Washington lifting the sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine, paying compensation to Moscow for the sanctions, and reducing the U.S. military presence in NATO member state in eastern Europe to the levels they were 16 years ago. Any of those steps would involve a complete U-turn in long-standing U.S. policy. \"The Obama administration has done everything in its power to destroy the atmosphere of trust which could have encouraged cooperation,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on the treaty's suspension. \"The step Russia has been forced to take is not intended to worsen relations with the United States. We want Washington to understand that you cannot, with one hand, introduce sanctions against us where it can be done fairly painlessly for the Americans, and with the other hand continue selective cooperation in areas where it suits them.\" The 2010 agreement, signed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, called on each side to dispose of 34 tonnes of plutonium by burning it in nuclear reactors. Clinton said at the time that there was enough of the material to make almost 17,000 nuclear weapons. Both sides back then viewed the deal as a sign of increased cooperation between the two former Cold War adversaries. Russian officials alleged on Monday that Washington had failed to honor its side of the agreement. The Kremlin decree stated that, despite the suspension, Russia's surplus weapons-grade plutonium would not be put to military use.

A Soyuz rocket crowned by a Fregat upper stage carrying 11 Russian, German and U.S. satellites into orbit lifted off Thursday from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia\u2019s Far East, the first flight from the country\u2019s newest spaceport since a failure in November. The Soyuz-2.1a rocket lifted off at 0207:18 GMT Thursday (9:07:18 p.m. EST Wednesday) from Vostochny, a cosmodrome carved from the forests of Russia\u2019s Amur region near the country\u2019s border with China. Burning a combination of kerosene and liquid oxygen, the Soyuz rocket\u2019s four first stage boosters fell away around two minutes after liftoff, and the Soyuz core engine \u2014 known as its second stage \u2014 fired for around five minutes on a path north from Vostochny. A third stage RD-0110 engine ignited to send the rocket\u2019s Fregat upper stage toward orbit, then separated from the Fregat nearly nine minutes into the mission. The Fregat upper stage was programmed to fire seven times to deploy 11 satellites into two distinct orbits several hundred miles in altitude, then to brake back into Earth\u2019s atmosphere for a destructive re-entry, ensuring the mission does not create unnecessary space junk. The Fregat\u2019s flight sequence was to last more the five hours from blastoff from Russia\u2019s Far East through re-entry over the Pacific Ocean southwest of Mexico. The primary payloads on Thursday\u2019s flight were the Kanopus-V 3 and 4 Earth observation satellites. The two spacecraft, which each weigh about a half-ton, will assist the Russian government in disaster response, mapping, forest fire detection and resource monitoring. Artist\u2019s concept of the Kanopus-V 3 and 4 satellites. Credit: Roscosmos Thursday\u2019s flight profile called for two Fregat main engine firings before separation of Kanopus-V 3 and 4. A statement issued by Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said the twin payloads were deployed into their targeted sun-synchronous orbits around 317 miles (510 kilometers) above Earth around one hour after liftoff. The Kanopus-V 3 and 4 satellites are owned by Roscosmos, and they will provide multiple Russian government agencies with black-and-white and color observations of Earth. Two more Fregat burns guided the rocket into a different orbit for release of nine more payloads launched under a commercial arrangement provided by Glavkosmos, a Russian launch services provider aimed at the international market. All of the satellites on Thursday\u2019s launch were deployed by 0450 GMT (11:50 p.m. EST Wednesday), Roscosmos said in a statement. Four Lemur-2 nanosatellites for U.S.-based Spire Global\u2019s commercial space network were aboard the Soyuz rocket. The Lemur-2 CubeSats will join Spire\u2019s satellite fleet measuring atmospheric weather conditions and tracking global maritime traffic. Thursday\u2019s mission was the third launch with Spire Lemur-2 satellites in three weeks, coming on the heels of an Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle flight and Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron rocket test flight earlier this month. \u201cIn the end, Spire has 10 new Lemur satellites in orbit from three different launch vehicles from three different countries in in under three weeks!\u201d Spire launch director Jenny Barna wrote in a blog post. \u201cLooking forward to many more successes in 2018!\u201d Another four nanosatellites for the Technical University of Berlin launched Thursday will demonstrate an S-band inter-satellite communications package that could allow future constellations of spacecraft to conduct autonomous missions. Each of the S-Net satellites weighs about 18 pounds, or 8.5 kilograms. The quartet will spend a year testing the S-band link technology, primarily a new radio transceiver for inter-satellite communications. The technology could prove useful for future space missions, including projects in environmental and climate research, global early warning, disaster monitoring, orbital traffic tracking, on-orbit servicing, and deep space exploration and planetary robotics, according to the S-Net mission\u2019s website.

It replaces the D-Star One nanosatellite lost on the last launch from Vostochny on Nov. 28. D-Star One was one of 19 satellites, including a Russian weather observatory, lost when a Fregat upper stage burned up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere a few minutes after blastoff on a Soyuz booster. Russian investigators blamed the accident on a programming error in the Fregat guidance computer, which caused the rocket to stray off course and conduct a critical orbital insertion burn pointed in the wrong direction. Thursday\u2019s Soyuz\/Fregat mission was scheduled to conclude with three more Fregat engine burns, including a final de-orbit maneuver just shy of the five-hour mark in the flight. The Soyuz\/Fregat flight marked the 14th space launch to reach Earth orbit since the beginning of 2018.

President Putin said the move would not violate nuclear non-proliferation agreements and compared it to the US stationing its weapons in Europe, according to Russian state media. Moscow would not be transferring control of its arms to Minsk, he added. The US said it did not believe Russia was preparing to use the nuclear weapons after the announcement. \"We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture,\" the US Defense Department said in a statement. \"We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.\" Belarus shares a long border with Ukraine, and with Nato members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. This will be the first time since the mid-1990s that Moscow will have based nuclear arms outside the country. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 meant weapons became based in four newly-independent states - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan - with the transfer of all warheads to Russia completed in 1996. The Belarusian regime is a firm Kremlin ally and supporter of the invasion of Ukraine. President Putin told Russian state television on Saturday that Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko had long raised the issue of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. \"There is nothing unusual here either,\" he said. \"Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries.\" Russia will start training crews to operate the weapons from next week. The construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus will be completed by 1 July, President Putin added. A small number of Iskander tactical missile systems, which can be used to launch nuclear weapons, have already been transferred to Belarus, President Putin said. He did not specify when the weapons themselves would be sent. The announcement to station weapons in Belarus comes only days after Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, during which Russia and China issued a joint statement saying \"all nuclear powers must not deploy their nuclear weapons beyond their national territories, and they must withdraw all nuclear weapons deployed abroad.\" On Sunday, a top security adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's plans are a \"step towards internal destabilisation\" of Belarus and predicted anti-Russian sentiment in the country would grow. \"The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,\" Oleksiy Danilov wrote on Twitter. And exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said that Russia's deployment of tactical nuclear weapons \"grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people\". President Putin's comments come after President Zelensky renewed his plea for more military support from his Western allies. Earlier this week, some 18 countries signed an agreement to supply the war-torn country with at least one million artillery shells over the next year. But in an interview with a Japanese newspaper , President Zelensky said Ukraine could not launch a potential counter-offensive in the east of the country until further ammunition arrived.

{"year":"2023","month":"05","event_desc":"6 May  Russian writer and pro-war nationalist Zakhar Prilepin is injured and his driver is killed when their vehicle is hit by a car bomb in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia.","text":"Zakhar Prilepin: Russian pro-war blogger injured in car bomb 6 May 2023 Share Save Matt Murphy BBC News Share Save Reuters Prilepin's car exploded on a remote road A prominent Russian writer and pro-war blogger has had surgery and is now under sedation after a car bomb attack, officials say. Zakhar Prilepin, a vehement supporter of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, was in a car blown up in a village in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod region. He suffered fractures and his driver was killed. Investigators say they are questioning a suspect named Alexander Permyakov who has admitted operating for Ukraine. That has not been confirmed by Kyiv. Nor has Kyiv denied involvement, or responded to a Russian foreign ministry allegation that Ukraine - backed by the US government - targeted Prilepin as an ideological enemy. Russian reports did not specify Prilepin's injuries. The Investigative Committee (SK), which handles serious crimes including terrorism, accuses Permyakov of having detonated a remote-controlled bomb, wrecking Prilepin's Audi. The SK says the suspect was caught in a neighbouring village. The region is more than 425km (265 miles) east of Moscow. The suspect \"admitted doing an assignment for the Ukrainian secret services\", the SK alleges. Reuters The bomb was allegedly planted on the road and detonated remotely It comes a month after another pro-Kremlin blogger, Vladlen Tatarsky, died in a bombing at a St Petersburg caf\u00e9. Saturday's explosion reportedly took place on a remote road some 80km from the town of Bor. The partisan group Atesh, which is made up of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, claimed it was behind the attack on Prilepin. \"We had a feeling that sooner or later he would be blown up,\" they wrote on Telegram. \"He was not driving alone, but with a surprise on the underside of the car.\" The BBC cannot verify Atesh's claims. As well as being one one of Russia's best-known novelists, Prilepin is known for his involvement with Russian ultra-nationalist politics. A veteran of Russia's bloody wars in Chechnya in the 1990s, the 47-year-old has admitted fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Reuters Prilepin rose to literary fame in the 2000s He has called for the \"return of Kyiv to Russia\". Last year a group founded by Prilepin called on officials to \"purge the cultural space\" of all who oppose the conflict. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the alleged bombing until the investigation was complete. But Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova sought to blame the attack on the UK and the US. \"The fact has come true: Washington and Nato fed another international terrorist cell - the Kiev regime,\" she wrote on Telegram. \"We pray for Zakhar.\" The attack is the latest to target high-profile supporters of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Vladlen Tatarsky was killed last month. The blogger had reported from the Ukraine front line and gained notoriety last year after posting a video filmed inside the Kremlin in which he said: \"We will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone as necessary. Just as we like it.\" Activist Darya Trepova, 26, was later arrested and was charged with terrorism following the publication of a video - believed to have been recorded under duress - in which she admitted bringing a statuette to the caf\u00e9 that later blew up. And in August 2022, Darya Dugina - the daughter of a close ally of Mr Putin - was killed in a suspected car bombing near Moscow. It is thought her father, the Russian ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, who is known as \"Putin's brain\", may have been the intended target of that attack.

This is the result of propaganda.\u201d Human rights activists warn that banning gender reassignment will lead to the emergence of an underground market for surgeries and an increase in cases of gender dysphoria. Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin have frequently cast Western liberal values, particularly gender and sexual freedoms, as a foreign ideology that threatens Russia's so-called \"traditional and spiritual values.\" This rhetoric has correlated with a widening crackdown on LGBT freedoms, particularly in the 15 months since the invasion of Ukraine. In November, Putin signed a law banning the \"propaganda\" of LGBT relationships and lifestyles toward all ages, effectively outlawing public displays and media portrayals of non-heterosexual identities. The Kommersant business daily reported last month, citing a source in the State Duma, that Russian lawmakers were concerned about an \u201cincreasing number of cases\u201d where Russian men \u201cused gender reassignment certificates to avoid being drafted into the military\u201d and being sent to the frontline in Ukraine. The bill banning gender reassignment must now pass its second and third readings in the State Duma as well as a single reading in the upper-house Federation Council before it can be signed into law by Putin.

ISW is publishing an abbreviated campaign update today, April 2. This report discusses the assassination of prominent pro-war Russian milblogger Maksim Fomin (also known as Vladlen Tatarsky) in St. Petersburg on April 2. Fomin was one of the most significant Russian milbloggers with a Telegram platform of 560,000 followers and deep connections with the Wagner Group, the Kremlin, the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR), and the Russian nationalists who have been dominating the Russian information space since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Fomin\u2019s assassination at a Wagner-affiliated bar in St. Petersburg may reveal further fractures within the Kremlin and its inner circle. Fomin was a vocal critic of the Russian military command and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD). Fomin\u2019s death marks the first high-profile assassination of an ultranationalist milblogger in Russia since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Unknown actors killed Russian milblogger Maksim Fomin in a deliberate and targeted attack during an event in a St. Petersburg bar reportedly belonging to Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin on April 2. Social media footage showed Fomin receiving a statue as a gift from a female audience member who introduced herself as a sculptor moments before the explosion. [1] Fomin was making a public presentation at the Street Food Bar #1 Caf\u00e9 in downtown St. Petersburg. Russian authorities reported that the explosion killed Fomin and wounded 30 audience members who had gathered to listen to Fomin discuss his experience as a frontline correspondent. [2] The event was advertised as open to the public and had approximately 100 attendees. Prigozhin confirmed that he had offered his Street Food Bar #1 Caf\u00e9 to the Russian ultranationalist movement \u201cKiber Front Z,\u201d to hold Fomin\u2019s event and other nationalist gatherings. [3] Witnesses stated that the woman who presented the statue to Fomin identified herself as Nastya and told the audience that the event\u2019s security asked her if there was a bomb inside the statue during a Q&A session. [4] Witnesses noted that there was no security when entering the event, however, and that the explosion occurred within three to five minutes after the exchange between Fomin and the woman. [5] Russian Interior Ministry sources told Russian state media that the explosive may have remotely detonated and that the woman or other unknown individuals may have been responsible for this attack. [6] Russian state media published unconfirmed information that Russian police detained St. Peterburg resident Daria Trepova, who had previously been arrested for anti-war protests in February 2022. [7] Russian Interior Ministry sources also revealed that Russian special services had known about assassination plans against Fomin for a long time. Russian officials and propagandists have accused Ukraine of staging a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d to assassinate Fomin. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Kyiv of Fomin\u2019s assassination and praised Russian milbloggers for their war coverage\u2014seemingly ignoring the fact that Fomin and other milbloggers routinely criticize the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the Russian Foreign Ministry (MFA). [8] Russian propagandist Tina Kandelaki stated that Russia needs to punish terrorists who still have \u201cpower, water, working railways, restaurants, and internet\u201d\u2014likely referring to Ukrainians who survived the Russian missile campaigns against the Ukrainian energy infrastructure during the fall of 2022 and the winter of 2023. [9] Russian propagandist Margarita Simonyan echoed Kandelaki\u2019s calls for retribution against Ukraine for this assassination. [10] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian agents have likely been attending similar milblogger events, blaming the attack on Ukrainian special forces and the failures of Russian security. [11] Prigozhin oddly stated on April 2 that he would not \u201cblame the Kyiv regime\u201d for the deaths of Fomin and Russian ultranationalist figure Daria Dugina, suggesting that Ukrainian agents were not in fact responsible. [12] Dugina was assassinated on August 20. Prigozhin noted that a group of radicals unaffiliated with the Ukrainian government may be responsible for such attacks. Advisor to Ukrainian Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak stated that Fomin\u2019s death was a result of infighting and political competition among Russian actors. [13] Fomin was a prominent figure in the Russian pro-war nationalist information space, although not more so than some others. Fomin was a Wagner-affiliated convict who escaped from prison in Donetsk Oblast at the outset of Russia\u2019s invasion of Donbas in 2014. [14] Fomin also claimed to have served in proxy armed formations, regularly expressed ultranationalist views, and balanced his allegiance to Wagner with remaining loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fomin attended Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s event announcing the annexation of four Ukrainian regions on September 30 where he stated: \u201cWe will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone we need; Everything will be as we like.\u201d [15] ISW also uncovered that Fomin had been involved with Islamic jihadist propaganda, likely in order to expand Russian recruitment efforts. [16] Fomin co-hosted a TV show with another prominent milblogger, appeared on Russian state media platforms, and participated in numerous Russian state broadcasts. [17] Fomin had also led numerous crowdfunding and recruitment campaigns, promoted violent militarism, and supported Putin\u2019s ideology and maximalist goals to \u201cdenazify\u201d and \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Ukraine. Fomin shared his ideology and activities with many other Russian milbloggers, however, and does not appear to have been a target worthy of special attention from Kyiv. A number of the milbloggers ISW regularly uses and cites are not only war correspondents, but also participants in efforts to fund, recruit for, and advance the Russian war effort through various parastatal and private organizations. [18] This cadre of milbloggers not only speaks to but also represents a constituency critical for Putin\u2019s war effort. ISW has long assessed that the role these milbloggers play in all their capacities is a key factor explaining the surprising degree of tolerance Putin has hitherto shown them. Fomin\u2019s assassination could be evidence that Putin\u2019s tolerance toward these milbloggers, in general, is waning, but it could also have resulted instead from Fomin\u2019s proximity to Prigozhin. Fomin\u2019s assassination at Prigozhin\u2019s bar is likely part of a larger pattern of escalating Russian internal conflicts involving Prigozhin and Wagner. Fomin had attended another event earlier in the day without incident, so it appears that the attack was deliberately staged in a space owned by Prigozhin. [19] Advisor to Ukrainian Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak stated that Fomin\u2019s death was a result of antifighting and political competition among Russian actors. [20] Some Russian political analysts also speculated that Prigozhin was supposed to attend Fomin\u2019s event, although there is no confirmation of that speculation. [21] Fomin\u2019s assassination may have been intended as a warning to Prigozhin, who has been increasingly questioning core Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and even obliquely signaling an interest in the Russian presidency, whether in competition with Putin or as his successor. [22] Fomin\u2019s biography and behavior bear a resemblance to Prigozhin\u2019s as both became prominent ultranationalist figures after being imprisoned and receiving pardons. Russian officials may be intending to use Fomin\u2019s assassination to drive the self-censorship of a growing Russian civil society questioning the progress of the war in bars. ISW previously observed FSB raids of bars in Moscow and St. Petersburg in March launched on the basis of accusations that individuals in those bars were providing financial assistance to Ukrainian forces and involving minors in \u201canti-social acts.\u201d [23] Putin had instructed the FSB to intensify counterintelligence measures and crackdown against the spread of pro-Ukrainian ideology on February 28\u2014an order that has been used to dismantle gatherings in Moscow and St. Petersburg bars. The Wagner-affiliated Kiber Front Z movement has been spearheading discussions about the war in Prigozhin-owned bars for months, and it is possible this high-profile assassination will discourage people from attending similar events. This attack may also be an effort to intimidate other Wagner-affiliated milbloggers. The assassination is already deepening a divide within the Russian milblogger space, which may ultimately be beneficial to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to consolidate control of the information space. Prominent Russian milbloggers exposed the identity of a smaller milblogger publishing under the handle MoscowCalling who joked that the woman involved in Fomin\u2019s murder was Dugina. [24] The milbloggers claimed that former Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) fighter Andrey Kurshin has been accusing Russia of war crimes in Ukraine using the handle MoscowCalling while residing in Moscow. [25] The milbloggers claimed that the Russian police and FSB have failed to prevent milbloggers such as Kurshin from fostering anti-government attitudes online, thereby allowing Ukrainian intelligence to stage attacks in Russia. The milbloggers also called for the arrests and executions of other milbloggers who have expressed similar views against Putin, his regime, and the conduct of the war. [26] The Kremlin may use such divisions to justify censorship of certain milbloggers who are vocal critics of Putin. Key inflections in ongoing military operations on April 2: Russian forces continued limited ground attacks along the Svatove-Kreminna line. [27] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces made marginal gains northwest of Kreminna. [28] Russian forces continued to attack Bakhmut and its environs. [29] Russian forces likely seized the AZOM plant in northern Bakhmut as ISW has previously assessed. Ukrainian forces conducted a missile strike on the plant on April 2. [30] Russian forces continued to conduct ground attacks along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line. [31] Ukrainian Tavriisk Direction Forces Joint Press Center Spokesperson Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi stated that Russian forces retreated from unspecified positions in the Donetsk direction. [32] Ukrainian forces conducted a HIMARS strike against a rail depot in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, the third strike against the city in the past week. [33] The UK Ministry of Defense assessed that a significant minority of Russia\u2019s 200,000 casualties in Ukraine are due to poor discipline and training outside of combat, including due to excessive alcohol consumption and mishandling of small arms. [34] Former Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) official Rodion Miroshnik denied ISW\u2019s April 1 report citing Miroshnik that Russian authorities are deporting Ukrainian children to Russia under rest-and-rehabilitation schemes. [35] Miroshnik claimed that mothers and children from Horlivka, Donetsk Oblast went to Russian sanitoriums for medical treatment. [36] Miroshnik denied being closely affiliated with the current occupation regime, claiming that he has not served as advisor to the Head of the LNR for a year. [37] LNR People\u2019s Militia Press Service called Miroshnik \u201cadvisor to the LNR Head\u201d as recently as January 29, 2023, however.

Bo Amstrup\/AFP\/Ritzau Scanpix\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Russia said Monday it was suspending its participation in a crucial deal that allowed the export of Ukrainian grain, once again raising fears over global food supplies and scuppering a rare diplomatic breakthrough to emerge from Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. The agreement, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July 2022, was officially set to expire at 5 p.m. ET on Monday (midnight local time in Istanbul, Kyiv, and Moscow). Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that Russia would not renew the pact right now, saying it \u201chas been terminated.\u201d Russia has for some time complained that it is being prevented from adequately exporting its own foodstuffs, and Peskov cited that objection as the reason for pulling out of the deal. \u201cAs soon as the Russian part is completed, the Russian side will return to the implementation of this deal immediately,\u201d he told reporters. Over the weekend, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the main objective of the deal \u2013 supplying grain to countries in need \u2013 \u201chas not been realized,\u201d again complaining that Russia faced obstacles exporting its own food.

Andrew Kravchenko\/AP\/FILE Related article Higher food prices and more hunger: Collapse of Black Sea grain deal poses a massive threat Peskov left the door open to reviving the deal in the future, saying that Russia will comply \u201cas soon as the Russian part (of the deal) is completed.\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week accused Russia of using the grain deal \u201cas a weapon.\u201d And Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CBS on Monday that \u201cRussia has been slowly killing the grain initiative, from one extension to another.\u201d \u201cPrices for grain all across the world will go up, and people in the most vulnerable regions of Asia, Africa, will feel it,\u201d he said. A vital deal for global food security The deal allowed Ukraine to export grain by sea, with ships bypassing a Russian blockade of the country\u2019s Black Sea ports and navigating safe passage through the waterway to Turkey\u2019s Bosphorus Strait in order to reach global markets. Vessels were inspected before they arrived in Ukraine by Russian, Ukrainian and Turkish officials, to ensure weapons were not being smuggled into Ukraine. It proved vital for stabilizing global food prices and bringing relief to the developing countries which rely on Ukrainian exports. The impact of the war on global food markets was immediate and extremely painful, especially because Ukraine is a major supplier of grain to the World Food Programme (WFP). According to the European Commission, Ukraine accounts for 10% of the world wheat market, 15% of the corn market, and 13% of the barley market. It is also a key global player in the market of sunflower oil. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an UN body, warned at the time that as many as 47 million people could be pushed into \u201cacute food insecurity\u201d because of the war. Since its implementation, the Black Sea Grain Initiative has allowed for the export of nearly 33 million metric tons of foodstuffs from Ukraine. The World Food Programme has shipped more than 725,000 tons to support humanitarian operations \u2013 helping to relieve hunger in some of the hardest hit corners of the world, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The rate of exports made under the deal had started to tail off in recent months; UN figures show that May and June were the two months with the fewest metric tons exported since August 2022. In withdrawing from the pact, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that its government was removing guarantees for safe navigation in the Black Sea. There are alternative routes for Ukrainian grain and oilseed exports by rail through eastern Europe, but they can\u2019t readily cope with the volume that Ukraine wants to export. A UN official confirmed to CNN that the UN office in Istanbul, Turkey, received written notice from Russia that they were ending participation on Monday. The UN official said that their main concern the inevitable human suffering that will result from the deal\u2019s termination: \u201cThere is simply too much at stake in a hungry and hurting world.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday spoke with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres after Russia pulled out of the grain deal. \u201cThis is another attempt by Russia to weaponize hunger and destabilize the global food market,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on his Telegram page. He said Russia, by taking such a critical decision, \u201chas endangered the lives of 400 million people in many countries that depend on Ukrainian food exports.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last Thursday, during an on-camera interview, that \u201cnot a single point related to the fact that there are interests of the Russian Federation have not been fulfilled. Despite this, we voluntarily extended this deal many times. Well, listen, that\u2019s enough in the end.\u201d When asked, Peskov denied that Russia\u2019s decision to allow the deal to lapse was related to Ukraine\u2019s claimed strike on the bridge connecting mainland Russia to occupied Crimea on Monday. \u201cThese are absolutely unrelated events,\u201d he said. Moscow had threatened to pull out of the deal on previous occasions. The pact was on the brink of breaking down in late October and early November 2022 when Russia suspended its participation over drone attacks on the city of Sevastopol. However, Moscow decided to reverse course following mediation in those instances. The head of the Ukrainian Grain Association refuted claims from Putin that Ukraine has not fulfilled a vital part of the grain deal in ensuring grain is exported to poorer countries, calling it \u201cmanipulation.\u201d Although 60% of grain exported from Ukraine moves through European ports, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that Europe absorbs this grain as a final consumer,\u201d Nikolay Gorbachov told CNN\u2019s Isa Soares. He said the international community needed to \u201cfind the leverage\u201d to move grain from Ukraine to the global market, adding that he was  \u201csure that Ukraine can export grain without Russia\u201d if it is provided \u201cinternational support.\u201d \u201cThe international community, developed countries have to find the leverage how to move grain from Ukraine to the world market,\u201d the president said. According to Gorbachov, this support could come from the Turkish fleet or insurance guarantees from companies such as Lloyds. Western condemnation Western officials were quick to condemn Russia\u2019s decision to lapse the deal. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday condemned Russia\u2019s decision  \u201cdespite the efforts\u201d by Turkey and the United Nations. \u201cRussia\u2019s illegal war against #Ukraine continues to harm millions of vulnerable people around the world,\u201d he added in a tweet. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly also condemned the Kremlin\u2019s move. \u201cPutin is using food as a weapon,\u201d Cleverly tweeted, stressing that this decision \u201churts the world\u2019s poorest.\u201d Poland\u2019s Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in a tweet described it as \u201cnothing less than an act of economic aggression against the states of the Global South, which are most dependent on the Ukranian grain.\u201d Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said that Russia\u2019s decision is \u201cfurther proof on who is a friend and who is the enemy of the poorest countries.\u201d \u201cUsing the raw material that feeds the world as a weapon is another offense against humanity,\u201d Meloni said in a statement. The deal marked a rare diplomatic breakthrough to emerge from Russia's war in Ukraine. Chris McGrath\/Getty Images \u201cIt is utterly immoral that Russia continues to weaponise food,\u201d Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said on Twitter. \u201cIt is disappointing that #Russia obstructs the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Extending the deal is important to prevent food prices from rising and to avoid market destabilisation.\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union Commission, said that she \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned Russia\u2019s withdrawal, calling it a \u201ccynical move to terminate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, despite UN & T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s efforts.\u201d And Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a pivotal player in broking the deal, said on Monday that he may have a phone call with Putin about the decision, without waiting for their planned visit in August, according to Turkish state media Anadolu and Reuters. The deal had caused some tensions in Europe, after the European Union moved to lift all duties on grain from Ukraine via land, to facilitate exports. To quell the unrest, the EU subsequently adopted a temporary measure that bans wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seed originating in Ukraine from being exported to Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia \u2013 a move that was opposed by Zelensky.

{"year":"2023","month":"07","event_desc":"14 July  The State Duma approves bill banning nearly all medical help for transgender people including gender reassignment surgeries.","text":"A new law banning nearly all medical help for transgender people in Russia passed its final reading at the State Duma on Friday. Alexander Nemenov\/AFP\/Getty Images CNN \u2014 The Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, has voted in favor of a new law banning nearly all medical help for transgender people including gender reassignment surgery, in a raft of new anti-LGBTQ laws in Russia. The bill, which had its third and final reading on Friday, prohibits doctors from conducting gender reassignment surgeries, except in cases related to treating congenital physiological anomalies in children. It also restricts registry offices from amending official documents based on medical certificates of gender change. The law must still be approved by the Federation Council and signed by President Vladimir Putin before it comes into force. Amendments made for its third reading include disqualifying individuals who have undergone gender changes from becoming adoptive parents or guardians, as well as the possibility of annulling a marriage if one or both spouses undergo a gender change and update their civil status records. Putin has toughened anti-LGTBQ legislation in recent months, as the Kremlin clamps down on free speech and human rights amid the war in Ukraine. These recent legal developments in Russia expand the constraints on the LGBTQ community and reflect a tightening of regulations and control over transgender rights in the country. In December 2022, Russia expanded its existing \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law to exert control over public discussions and narratives surrounding non-heterosexual relationships and identities. The package of amendments signed by Putin includes heavier penalties for anyone promoting \u201cnon-traditional sexual relations and\/or preferences,\u201d as well as gender transition. Russia\u2019s first transgender politician, Yulia Alyoshina, has warned of the severe consequences of the proposed transgender bill. \u201cOnce the bill becomes law, the repercussions will be harsh, as transgender individuals will be denied the right for medical care, which is constitutionally guaranteed,\u201d Alyoshina told CNN. \u201cThis bill is not just discriminatory, it is a real genocide of transgender people,\u201d she added. In October, amid the hearings on \u201cLGBTQ propaganda\u201d law amendments and the bill passing its first reading in the State Duma, Alyoshina, who obtained her new passport in 2020, resigned from her position as a regional head of the Civic Initiative party and chose to end her political career. \u2018Politics of terror\u2019 The latest restrictions seem to be closely intertwined with the ongoing dissent on the political and human rights activity in Russia. Notably, on the eve of the final reading, Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) announced it had detained a transgender activist on suspicion of treason. The FSB alleged that the activist, a Russian citizen from the Oryol region, supported the Armed Forces of Ukraine by providing financial assistance through a donation to the independent human rights monitoring group OVD-Info. A new law banning nearly all medical help for transgender people in Russia passed its final reading at the State Duma on Friday.

Vanya Solovey, a trans rights campaigner, said \u201cit is no coincidence\u201d that the law is being read in Russian parliament amid Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. \u201cRussia\u2019s anti-gender discourse and politics have intensified since it started the full-scale war. For months, Putin and other officials have been increasingly targeting trans people in their statements,\u201d Solovey, an advocacy and program officer for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the trans rights group Transgender Europe, told CNN. \u201cThis anti-trans politics is indeed a politics of terror. It affects not only trans people but everyone living in Russia.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sana Noor Haq and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting.","question":"What did the Russian State Duma approve in July 2023 regarding transgender medical care?","answer":"The Russian State Duma approved a bill banning nearly all medical help for transgender people, including gender reassignment surgeries, except for cases involving congenital physiological anomalies in children.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: In July 2023, the Russian State Duma approved a bill that bans gender-affirming medical care for transgender individuals.

{"year":"2023","month":"06","event_desc":"27 June   Russia drops all charges against Wagner Group. The defence ministry also announced that the group will be disarmed.","text":"Wagner mutiny: Group fully funded by Russia, says Putin 27 June 2023 Share Save Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent & Kathryn Armstrong in Warsaw and London Share Save Reuters Wagner mercenaries in Rostov-on-Don on Saturday Russia's president has said members of the Wagner mercenary group were fully funded by the state. According to Vladimir Putin, Wagner was given 86.262bn roubles ($1bn) from May 2022 to May 2023 alone for salaries and bonuses, which came from the defence ministry and state budget. The private army's revolt on Saturday rocked Russia. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, arrived in Belarus on Tuesday after agreeing to leave Russia. His arrival was confirmed by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Earlier, a private jet linked to Prigozhin was tracked landing in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. On Saturday, mercenary troops led by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin took over the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, marched on Moscow and shot down Russian military helicopters and a plane on their way. Their mutiny was later aborted after a deal was struck with the help of Mr Lukashenko. The Russian authorities said Wagner will be disarmed but its members will escape prosecution over its short-lived rebellion. \"We always treated fighters and commanders from this group with great respect, because they really showed bravery and heroism,\" said Mr Putin. He said authorities would look into how the money paid to Wagner and its leader was spent. Preparations are under way for the group to hand over its heavy weapons and equipment to the Russian army, the defence ministry said. Criminal charges have also been dropped against those who took part in the mutiny, according to the FSB security service. What is the Wagner mercenary group? Yevgeny Prigozhin: From Putin's chef to rebel in chief Wagner members were facing prosecution for armed insurrection, but the case has been closed because the mutineers had stopped short of actually committing a crime, the FSB said. Its fighters can either join the regular army, go home or head for Belarus, Mr Putin said on Monday, adding that the fighters were mostly \"patriots\" who had been misled into a criminal adventure. Mr Lukashenko said Belarus has not started building any camps for members of the group, but will accommodate them if they want. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Putin told Russian troops in Moscow their actions during the mutiny had prevented a \"civil war\" and held a minute's silence for those killed. He insisted that the Wagner forces never had the support of the army or the people, although crowds cheered and applauded Wagner troops as they left Rostov-on-Don. The treatment of the mercenaries stands in marked contrast to the treatment of opposition politicians and activists, many of whom are in prison simply for speaking out against the war in Ukraine. Opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, for example, is serving 25 years for treason . By contrast, Wagner chief Prigozhin and the armed men who took part in the rebellion are seemingly being allowed to go free. Prigozhin has defended his actions, insisting the revolt was not meant to be a challenge to the leadership of Mr Putin. Rather, he described it as a bid to save his mercenary group from being absorbed into the Russian army, and to expose the failures of the country's military leadership.

A recent drone attack on an airport in Russia\u2019s northwestern Pskov region was carried out from within Russian territory, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said. The Pskov regional governor said Russian air defence units had \u201cneutralised an unidentified object\u201d spotted flying over the region, just days after a wave of Ukrainian drones destroyed military planes parked at an airfield in the region. A Ukrainian drone hit a building in the Russian town of Kurchatov in the Kursk region, home to one of Russia\u2019s biggest nuclear power stations. The plant was not damaged in the attack. Drone attacks on Russian territory will increase and recent events demonstrate that the war is gradually shifting to Russia, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence said it destroyed 281 Ukrainian drones over the past week, including 29 over western Russia.

Lavrov is scheduled to represent Russia at the September 9-10 Group of 20 (G20) meeting in New Delhi. Invitations to ambassadors from Russia and Belarus to attend this year\u2019s Nobel Prize awards ceremony have sparked anger in Ukraine and elsewhere. Sweden\u2019s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he disagreed with the Nobel Foundation for inviting the Russian ambassador to this year\u2019s Nobel Prize banquet. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Denmark\u2019s demand that it reduce its Copenhagen embassy\u2019s staff was an act of hostility. Denmark has capped the number of Russian diplomats allowed at the Copenhagen embassy to five and administrative staff to 20. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month and also take part in a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine. World leaders will gather in New York on September 18 for the UN General Assembly. Black sea shipping Two more ships have departed the Russian-blockaded Odesa port on the Black Sea. If the port departures are successful, they would be the third and fourth vessels to do so since Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in July. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said work has begun on providing free Russian grain to six African countries, amid criticism that Moscow was responsible for global grain shortages due to its blockade of Ukraine\u2019s sea ports. The plan is to supply up to 50 thousand tonnes of grain to six of the neediest countries in Africa.

Kurmasheva, who works for the US-funded Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty (RFE\/RL) media outlet, was detained by Russian law enforcement officers in the central city of Kazan on Wednesday. The Sovietsky district court in Kazan -- the main city of the Tatarstan republic -- ruled she should be kept in detention as a \"preventative measure\". She faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of the charges. Following Monday's hearing, RFE\/RL called for Kurmasheva to be released immediately. \"We are deeply disappointed by the outcome of today's hearing,\" said RFE\/RL acting President Jeffrey Gedmin. \"We call for Alsu's immediate release so she can be reunited with her family,\" Gedmin said. Kurmasheva is the second US journalist to be arrested in Russia this year. WSJ reporter Gershkovich was detained in March on spying charges -- rejected as false by his lawyers, the WSJ and the White House. 'Harassing US citizens' US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that Kurmasheva's arrest \"appears to be another case of the Russian government harassing US citizens\". The Kremlin on Friday denied it was \"persecuting\" US citizens. \"There is no campaign in Russia to persecute US citizens. There are US citizens who break the law, and appropriate measures are taken against them,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Kurmasheva, editor of the US outlet's Tatar-Bashkir service, lives in Prague with her husband and two teenage daughters. \"Kurmasheva is an accomplished journalist who has long covered ethnic minority communities in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan,\" RFE\/RL said after she was detained last week. Last year, Kurmasheva edited a book titled, \"Saying No to War\" -- a collection of interviews and stories of Russians who oppose Moscow's assault on Ukraine. She returned to Russia in May for a family emergency and was temporarily detained at Kazan airport on June 2 before her return flight. Her US and Russian passports were both confiscated and she was fined for failing to register her US passport with Russian authorities, according to RFE\/RL. The new charges were announced last week while she was still in Russia awaiting the return of her passports. 'Relentless crackdown' Russia has used the \"foreign agent\" label -- which has Soviet-era connotations -- as part of an intense crackdown on independent news outlets and journalists over the past decade. Journalists and outlets designated \"foreign agents\" must register and submit financial reports to Russia's justice ministry. They face fines or imprisonment for non-compliance and attach a disclaimer which states they are a \"foreign agent\" to all of their content, including articles, videos and social media posts. Rights groups said the detention of Kurmasheva marks a new threshold in Russia's campaign against independent media. \"The persecution of Alsu Kurmasheva is an example of the relentless crackdown on journalism and the right to freedom of expression in Russia,\" said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. \"It also marks an alarming escalation in the harassment of media professionals, as it\u2019s the first time this offence has been used to directly target a journalist for their professional activities,\" Struthers added. \u00a9 2023 AFP Share :","question":"Why was Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva detained in Russia in October 2023?","answer":"She was detained for allegedly failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under Russian law.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist working for Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty, was detained in Russia in October 2023 on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent.

Get more news Live on \/ Updated By Jennifer Jett and Stella Kim Kim Jong Un has arrived in Russia for an expected meeting with President Vladimir Putin that has fueled Western concerns the North Korean leader will provide military support for Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine . Kim was seen disembarking from the luxury armored train on which leaders of the reclusive state usually travel, in footage aired on Russian state media. The trip, Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea after three years of pandemic isolation, has drawn warnings of new sanctions from the United States as it seeks to head off a potential arms deal. The South Korean defense ministry said Kim was believed to have entered Russia early Tuesday. \u201cWe are closely monitoring if there will be negotiation between North Korea and Russia over the arms trade and technology transfer,\u201d the ministry said in a briefing Tuesday, noting that Kim was accompanied by multiple military officers. Russian news agency Interfax also confirmed that Kim was in Russia, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The North Korean armored train passes through the Primorsky Krai region of Russia on Tuesday. Sputnik via AP The Kremlin said Monday that Kim was visiting at Putin\u2019s invitation and that there would be negotiations between delegations from the two countries. It said that Kim\u2019s visit would happen in \u201cthe coming days\u201d and that it could include a one-on-one meeting with Putin \u201cif necessary.\u201d North Korean state media reported Tuesday that Kim left for Russia from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, by train Sunday afternoon. He was accompanied by unspecified officials from the military, the government and his ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, state news agency KCNA said. Kim received \u201ca warm send-off\u201d from senior officials in Pyongyang, according to the agency, which did not say whether he had arrived in Russia. State media photos showed Kim walking past honor guards and waving from his green-and-yellow train. KCNA had said earlier that Kim and Putin were set to meet, without providing details. One place they could meet is the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, nearly 430 miles northeast of Pyongyang, where Putin arrived Monday for Russia\u2019s Eastern Economic Forum. The two leaders met in Vladivostok during Kim\u2019s last visit to Russia in 2019. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu will join the talks, the Kremlin said Tuesday. Kim, who hadn\u2019t left North Korea since before the pandemic, usually travels by armored train. KCNA \/ AP The U.S. Defense Department said Monday that \u201csome type of meeting\u201d was expected between Putin and Kim. \u201cAs far as the details of that meeting and what will be discussed and when and where, I just don\u2019t have any information to provide,\u201d a spokesperson, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, told reporters. \u201cWe remain concerned that North Korea is contemplating providing any type of ammunition or materiel support to Russia in support of their war against Ukraine,\u201d he added. The White House has repeatedly warned North Korea against making any arms deal with Russia, which would violate multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week that North Korea would \u201cpay a price\u201d in the international community if it were to provide Russia with weapons. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday that the Biden administration would monitor any Putin-Kim meeting closely. He said the U.S. would continue to enforce sanctions against entities that fund Russia\u2019s war effort \u201cand will not hesitate to impose new sanctions if appropriate.\u201d Russia has been casting about for international support as it struggles against a Ukrainian counteroffensive, turning to fellow U.S. adversaries, including North Korea. Last month Kim and Putin exchanged letters pledging to increase their cooperation, according to U.S. officials and state media in both countries. U.S. officials said last week that they expected Kim to travel to Russia and that arms talks were \u201cactively advancing\u201d and were likely to continue during Kim\u2019s visit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un left for Russia by train from Pyongyang on Sunday. KCNA via KNS\/AFP - Getty Images Experts say Russia would probably seek artillery munitions in exchange for providing energy and food aid to North Korea, where there are reports of starvation as Kim prioritizes his nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Kim may also want Russian assistance in advancing North Korea\u2019s submarine, ballistic and satellite technologies, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, South Korea. But Russia is unlikely to make such technology transfers, he said, \u201cbecause even a desperate war machine does not trade its military crown jewels for old, dumb munitions.\u201d He said the two countries would also avoid publicizing the full details of any arms deal \u201cbecause of the serious international legal violations involved.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Stella Kim from Seoul, South Korea.

Issued on: 23\/12\/2023 - 13:21 2 min The commission cited \"mistakes in documents\" submitted by Yekaterina Duntsova, a former journalist and city councillor campaigning \"for peace and democratic processes\", Russian television reported. The commission's chief, Ella Pamfilova, said the members unanimously rejected Duntsova's bid to stand in polls that President Vladimir Putin is expected to win comfortably. Putin confirmed this month that he would participate in the election, scheduled to be held over three days beginning March 15. The commission said Duntsova could not go on to the next stage of gathering thousands of supporters' signatures. Pamfilova told her: \"You are a young woman, you have everything ahead of you.\" Duntsova, 40, had filed documents to stand in the March race as an independent candidate. She was required to provide documents proving that a group of at least 500 people had held a meeting backing her. \"A people's initiative is not needed, is not welcomed,\" Duntsova told journalists afterwards, saying she would not have time to file another application as an independent candidate. She wrote on social media that she would file an appeal against the ruling with the Supreme Court. 'Should have a choice' She also urged the leadership of liberal party Yabloko to nominate her as its candidate. Yabloko, Russia's oldest democratic party, \"should not stand on the sidelines. Russians should have a choice\", she wrote on Telegram. Duntsova told journalists on Saturday \"we are now waiting for some official, public answer on whether (Yabloko) are prepared to support me so we meet the deadline\" of January 1. Yabloko's co-founder Grigory Yavlinsky said in a YouTube video broadcast on Saturday that the party is not nominating any candidate. The 71-year-old was unable to comment on Duntsova's request for nomination, saying he \"had no idea\" about her. Candidates from political parties lacking MPs in the national parliament, like Yabloko, have a less arduous procedure to participate than independents. They have to gather signatures of 100,000 supporters by the end of January, while independent candidates have to find 300,000. Duntsova said she was sure her supporters had no illusions about the outcome of the presidential \"elections\" in inverted commas. But \"you must not do nothing\", she wrote on Telegram, since standing as a candidate is the \"last legal opportunity for citizens to express their disagreement with the policies of the current authorities\". Pamfilova said Saturday that 29 people have filed to run for the presidency. Moscow has for years sidelined opposition figures from elections and political life, a clampdown that accelerated after the Kremlin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in 2022. \u00a9 2023 AFP Today's top stories 54 soldiers killed in suspected Jihadist attack in Benin Africa Weinstein made victims 'feel small', jury told as retrial begins Americas A trap?

More than 20 people were hurt \u2014 none Israelis \u2014 in the clashes Sunday night that Putin cast as part of U.S. efforts to weaken Russia. Hundreds of angry men, some carrying banners with antisemitic slogans, rushed onto the tarmac of the airport in Makhachkala, the capital of the predominantly Muslim region, looking for Israeli passengers on the flight from Tel Aviv. Police officers and civilians were injured and two of them were in critical condition, regional health authorities said. More than 80 people were detained in the unrest, according to police.

Speaking to top government officials in televised comments, Putin said the Israel-Hamas war had been triggered by \u201cthe terrorist attack against peaceful citizens of Israel and other countries\u201d but said that the Israeli response indiscriminately targeted civilians \u201cwho have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.\u201d Video and photos on social media showed some in the crowd waving Palestinian flags and shouting \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d or \u201cGod is great,\u201d as they broke into the airport terminal. Some held handwritten banners saying, \u201cChild killers are not welcome in Dagestan\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re against Jewish refugees.\u201d Some rushed onto the tarmac Sunday night and surrounded the jet belonging to the Russian carrier Red Wings, only to find it empty. Others stopped a bus carrying passengers from the flight from Israel, including some children who underwent medical treatment and their parents, and started examining their passports. They eventually let them go after some passengers on the bus who had dual Russian and Israeli citizenship showed their Russian passports, according to Russian media reports. It took the authorities several hours to disperse the mob, which hurled stones at police. Putin avoided any assessment of the authorities\u2019 response to the airport\u2019s seizure but launched a new attack against the U.S. on Monday, blaming it for sowing chaos in the Middle East and fueling the fighting in Ukraine. \u201cThe ruling elites of the U.S. and its satellites are the main beneficiaries of the global instability,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey are earning their bloody rent from it.\u201d Without offering evidence, he also accused \u201cagents of Western special services\u201d in Ukraine of using social networks to provoke the rampages in Dagestan to weaken Russia. \u201cI\u2019m not certain if everyone in the U.S. leadership is aware of that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt if they run a probe into what their special services have been doing in Ukraine, trying to inspire pogroms in Russia. They are real scum, it\u2019s impossible to call them otherwise.\u201d Russia\u2019s state news agency RIA Novosti cited Dagestan Gov. Sergei Melikov as saying that the unrest was coordinated in a Telegram channel run by \u201ctraitors\u201d based in Ukraine, with the goal of destabilizing Dagestan and fueling unrest. Some local Telegram channels had said before the unrest that \u201crefugees from Israel\u201d were coming to Dagestan. Following some of those posts, a crowd reportedly gathered outside a hotel in the Dagestani city of Khasavyurt on Saturday, searching for Israeli nationals staying in the hotel, but left after not finding any. Following the Dagestan unrest, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said Israel \u201cexpects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis.\u201d The Israeli Ambassador to Moscow, Alexander Ben Zvi, told the RTVI news outlet that no passengers on the flight, which included Israelis, Russians and people with dual citizenship, were hurt. The Makhachkala airport resumed operations at 2 p.m. Monday. Some Russian airlines offer flights from Israel to Makhachkala with a subsequent connection to Moscow, a cheaper option compared to direct flights. In the wake of the rampage, Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the Foreign Ministry said they have updated the travel warning to the highest Level 4 for Dagestan and other regions in southern Russia, advising Israelis to avoid visiting them and urging all those currently there to leave. ___ Associated Press writer Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.","question":"What happened at Uytash Airport in Makhachkala, Dagestan, in October 2023?","answer":"Protesters stormed the airport, shouting antisemitic slogans and attempting to target passengers arriving from Israel on a flight from Tel Aviv.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: In October 2023, Uytash Airport in Makhachkala, Dagestan, experienced a significant security incident when a large group of people stormed the airport.

The move, though expected, is evidence of the deep chill between the United States and Russia, whose ties are at their lowest level since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis over the war in Ukraine and what Moscow casts as Washington's attempts to stymie the emergence of a new multipolar world order. Sign up here. Washington expressed deep concern about Russia's decision and it was a step in the wrong direction. \"Russia's action will only serve to set back confidence in the international arms control regime,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Moscow says its deratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is merely designed to bring Russia into line with the United States, which signed but never ratified the treaty. Russia will not resume nuclear testing unless Washington does, say Russian diplomats. Nor, they say, will the move change the nuclear posture of Russia, which has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, or the way it shares information about its nuclear activities as Moscow will remain a treaty signatory. But some Western arms control experts are concerned that Russia may be inching towards a nuclear test to intimidate and evoke fear amid the Ukraine war. Putin said on Oct. 5 that he was not ready to say whether or not Russia should resume nuclear testing after calls from some Russian security experts and lawmakers to test a nuclear bomb as a warning to the West. Such a move, if it did happen, could usher in a new era of big power nuclear testing. Robert Floyd, head of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty Organization, whose job is to promote recognition of the treaty and build up its verification regime to ensure no nuclear tests go undetected, condemned Russia's step. 'DEEPLY REGRETTABLE' \"Today\u2019s decision by the Russian Federation to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is very disappointing and deeply regrettable,\" Floyd, who had tried to lobby senior Russian officials to get them to change their mind, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. The treaty established a global network of observation posts that can detect the sound, shockwaves or radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion. Post-Soviet Russia has not carried out a nuclear test. The Soviet Union last tested in 1990 and the United States in 1992. No country except North Korea has conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion this century. Andrey Baklitskiy, senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, has said Russia's deratification of the CTBT is part of a \"slippery slope\" towards resuming testing. It is part of a disturbing trend in recent years that has seen arms control pacts scrapped or suspended, he said last month on X. \"We don\u2019t know what steps will follow and when, but we know where this road ends. And we don\u2019t want to go there,\" he said. Putin's approval of the de-ratification law was posted on a government website which said the decision took immediate effect. Russia's parliament has already approved the step.

(Photo by Genya SAVILOV \/ AFP)        (Photo credit should read GENYA SAVILOV\/AFP\/Getty Images) Reacting to the news that Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov and dozens of other detainees have been released as a part of prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International\u2019s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said: \u201cOleg Sentsov and many others jailed following Russia\u2019s occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea are simply victims of politically-motivated prosecution and they should never have been imprisoned in the first place. While it is a relief that they are now free, it is a travesty to see them being used as human bargaining chips in political deals. \u201cThe conflict in eastern Ukraine opened a new and tragic chapter for human rights in the country and beyond. Following his arrest, illegal transfer to Russia and deeply flawed trial by a military court, Oleg Sentsov spent more than six years behind bars. \u201cThe Russian authorities derisively refused to recognize his Ukrainian citizenship and transported him 3,000 kilometers away from his family and native Crimea to the frost-bitten penal colony at Labytnangi in the far north of Russia. \u201cNo-one should be prosecuted and imprisoned solely for political reasons; we demand justice for all remaining prisoners subjected to these politically-motivated trials, those who had been imprisoned solely for exercising their human rights, should be immediately and unconditionally release.\u201d Background On September 7, Russia and Ukraine finalized the exchange of 66 prisoners held in both countries. They include 24 Ukrainian sailors captured off the coast of Crimea last year and Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov.

Passengers aboard a Russian plane that crash-landed in a cornfield have given an emotional thank you to the airline crew for saving their lives. The Ural Airlines Airbus 321 heading to Simferopol in Crimea made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff near Zhukovsky International Airport southeast of Moscow on Wednesday. The state-run news agency TASS reported that the plane had struck a flock of birds shortly after take-off and two engines caught fire. The agency reported that there were 234 people on board, including seven crew members. At least 23 people were injured, including nine children ranging from 2 to 9 years old. They are being treated in hospital. Initial reports suggest there were no fatalities. In dramatic scenes, video footage shows the plane resting in a cornfield and its passengers walking through crops to safety. Footage tweeted by REN TV shows shocked passengers on the ground being told over a loudspeaker by what appears to be a pilot to not return to the plane to pick up their luggage. One woman then shouts, \"Thank you to the pilot, and the cabin crew,\" while another woman said \"thank you so much!\" before the passengers burst into spontaneous applause next to a stewardess who is in tears. \"Well done guys, thank you for saving our lives,\" one woman said. An unnamed male passenger films himself in front of the plane with his phone and says in the video: \"I can't explain it, it was heart-stopping. It was really, really crazy.\" \u041f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u044b \u0410321, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e \u0432 \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0432 \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442. \"\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\". pic.twitter.com\/etm1kbedem Another passenger, named as Alla Lyetyashaya, said that on the plane she had heard \"some kind of strange noises\" adding that \"we were told that there were sparks, but I didn't see any myself.

{"year":"2019","month":"03","event_desc":"212 March  2019 Winter Universiade, a multi-sport event in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.","text":"The world\u2019s premier winter multi-sport event for university athletes, hosted in the heart of Siberia, promises to be a memorable edition with reigning and future Olympic champions amongst the competitors Preliminary play is under way in Bandy and Ice Hockey in the day before the official opening of the Krasnoyarsk 2019 Winter Universiade KRASNOYARSK\u00a0\u2013 The 29 th edition of the Winter Universiade is set to open full of fanfare Saturday in this Siberian city. The biannual winter multi-sport event will kick off with a spectacular opening ceremony at 20:19 (local time) on 2 March 2019. More than 1,700 of the world\u2019s best university student-athletes will compete through 11 days in 11 sports: Alpine Skiing, Bandy, Biathlon, Cross-Country Skiing, Curling, Figure Skating, Freestyle Skiing, Ice Hockey, Short Track Speed Skating, Ski Orienteering and Snowboard. The Krasnoyarsk 2019 Organising Committee is particularly enthused that Bandy, known as \u2018Russian Hockey\u2019 in the host country, is part of the Winter Universiade for the first time in 2019. With 58 countries participating, Winter Universiade 2019 promises to be one of the best ever event editions, where records are broken and iconic moments are captured and broadcast to a global audience. The Russian delegation with 295 athletes leads the field and will be looking to top the medals table, as they did in the event\u2019s most recent edition two years ago in Almaty, Kazakhstan. With Lucerne hosting the next Winter Universiade in 2021, Switzerland has put its best foot forward in Krasnoyarsk with 100 student-athletes competing. Kazakhstan, Japan and China also have large delegations closing in on 100 athletes. The Universiade Village situated on the Siberian Federal Univesity is the hub and the heart of Winter Universiade 2019 That fact that the Winter Universiade is the student-athletes\u2019 games was not lost on FISU President Oleg Matytsin. \u201cThis is the intersection of education and sports participation\u201d President Matytsin said. \u201cYoung people should do sports; young people should be healthy. This is how we build both unity and the skills to be tomorrow\u2019s leaders.\u201d The 76 medal events of the Winter Universiade will be broadcast live on the Russian network Match TV and internationally on major networks including Eurosport and the 280-member strong Asian Broadcasting Union with a potential reach of over 3 billion audiences across Asia and the Pacific. Competition gets underway on 1 March 2019 with preliminary round match-ups in Ice Hockey and will conclude with a not-to-be-missed closing ceremony on 12 March. Media interest in the first Winter Universiade ever on Russian soil has attracted robust media coverage even before the start of the event With over 100 previous Universiade participants going on to win medals at the PyeongChang 2018 and Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, Krasnoyarsk is poised to be an important proving grounds for future sports stars. French Freestyle Skier and 2018 Winter Olympic Winter Games Moguls gold medalist Perrine Laffont headlines the field along with South Korean Short Track Speed Skater and double Olympic gold medalist in the 3000m Relay, Kim Alang. The event has attracted attention of many top winter sports stars. This list includes Alexei Yagudin, the 2002 Olympic champion and four-time world champion in figure skating. \u201cAt its very minimum, the Winter Universiade is a springboard to elite sports,\u201d Mr. Yagudin said. \u201cAs a father of two young daughters, I know what sports can mean for their future.\u00a0For them, it\u2019s so important to take part in events like this.\u201d With the 5,000 volunteers already showing the warmth of Siberians to athletes, officials and spectators alike, and more than 165,000 tickets sold, Krasnoyarsk is ready for the Winter Universiade. When Krasnoyarsk 2019 organisers say \u2018Welcome to #RealWinter\u2019 there\u2019s meaning behind the motto. Situated in the heart of Siberia, the host location has deep sporting roots. As the capital of the Krasnoyarsk territory in Russia, the city is ideally suited to cement its position as a top-level winter sports venue. Nineteen athletes from the region have won gold medals at the Olympic Games, with three others becoming Paralympic Games champions. FISU Secretary General \u2013 CEO Eric Saintrond emphasised the social capital the citizens of Krasnoyarsk were building by hosting the Winter Universiade. \u201cTo organise a great event, you need great staff. By putting on this event, you\u2019re building great experience,\u201d Mr. Saintrond said. \u201cWith a young, professional team so actively involved in hosting this event, Krasnoyarsk is setting itself up for long-lasting social legacy benefits. \u201cYou only have to look to Kazan,\u201d he added. \u201cThe team there now putting the FINA World Swimming Championships and the FIFA World Cup this past summer is the same team that was in place back in 2008 in preparation for the Kazan 2013 Summer Universiade. Just like Kazan, I see you going on and hosting other important sports events.\u201d With a delegation 295-athletes strong, university sport attracts the interest of sportspersons throughout the host country Krasnoyarsk has also benefitted from the full support of the Russian Federation, which brings a wealth of experience having already hosted the 1973 Summer Universiades, 1980 Summer Olympics, 2013 Summer Universiade and 2014 Winter Olympics. This though, is the first time that a city in the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Universiade. With the eve of the Winter Universiade upon us, the hosts have left no stone unturned to ensure it\u2019s a memorable one. Hosting the Universiade is an opportunity for the host city to showcase regional cultures and traditions For the American\u2019s Women\u2019s Ice Hockey team captain Maddie Wolsmann, her first days in Krasnoyarsk had already left an indelible mark. \u201cTo tell my friends and family I am in Siberia is not an experience that every American gets to have. We haven\u2019t even stepped out onto the ice yet, but being here has already left an impression. I am honoured to be here.\u201d For the figure skating icon Yagudin, who met his wife in Krasnoayrsk, the reason for this is simple: \u201cKrasnoyarsk is the real heart of Siberia. Krasnoyarsk will become the heart of winter sports, not just in Siberia but for all of Russia.\u201d All information related to the Krasnoyarsk 2019 Winter Universiade is available on the official website: www.krsk2019.ru\/en\/home Related News A closed look at gender representation The numbers behind FISU\u2019s progress towards gender equality 8 March 2025 Numerous types of legacy Torino 2025 World University Games: the aftermath 6 March 2025 A last look back at Torino 2025 The Torino 2025 FISU World University Games in numbers 20 February 2025 A closed look at gender representation The numbers behind FISU\u2019s progress towards gender equality 8 March 2025 Numerous types of legacy Torino 2025 World University Games: the aftermath 6 March 2025 A last look back at Torino 2025 The Torino 2025 FISU World University Games in numbers 20 February 2025","question":"When did the 2019 Winter Universiade take place in Krasnoyarsk?","answer":"The 2019 Winter Universiade took place from 2 March to 12 March 2019.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: The 2019 Winter Universiade took place in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, from March 2 to March 12, 2019.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer in terms of the dates and location of the 2019 Winter Universiade.

The law, which critics say is reminiscent of Soviet-era legislation used to target political dissidents, stipulates fines of up to 100,000 roubles (\u00a31,155) for \u201cindecent\u201d online posts that demonstrate a \u201cblatant disrespect for society, the country, Russia\u2019s official state symbols, the constitution, or the authorities\u201d. US in virtual tie with Russia on global confidence, poll finds Read more Repeat offenders can be hit with fines of up to twice this sum, or 15 days behind bars. Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of the Moscow-based Sova Centre, which monitors abuse of anti-extremism legislation, said people could face prosecution for online comments such as \u201cPutin is a bastard\u201d, or jokes about parliament. Others expressed concern that the law was so vaguely worded that almost any online criticism of the authorities, including satirical memes, could be construed as \u201cdisrespect\u201d. \u201cSoon we\u2019ll be telling jokes about the authorities in whispers in the kitchen,\u201d Sergey Shvakin, a Moscow-based lawyer, wrote on Facebook. The law, which was authored by Andrei Klishas, a senator from Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party, was criticised by some MPs and government officials. \u201cOne of the tasks of government bodies is to calmly hear out criticism of its work,\u201d Alexei Volin, the deputy communications minister, told the Vedomosti newspaper. \u201cIf we stop calling a fool a fool, he won\u2019t stop being a fool,\u201d said Sergei Ivanov, an MP with the nationalist LDPR party, which usually backs the Kremlin on major issues. Klishas denied the law was a form of censorship and said the authorities were \u201cin and of themselves worthy of respect\u201d. Putin is expected to sign the law into force in the coming weeks. Parliament also approved separate legislation, likewise authored by Klishin, that will give the authorities powers to block webpages that publish \u201cdisrespectful\u201d material or \u201cfake news\u201d. Klishin insisted, however, that the law would not be used to target independent or opposition websites, saying it would not affect \u201ctraditional media\u201d. The laws come after Putin\u2019s trust ratings hit a 13-year low of 33% in the wake of a vastly unpopular move to increase the national retirement age by five years. The results of January\u2019s poll, carried out by the state-backed Public Opinion Research Centre, represented a decline of 37 percentage points from 2015. Putin is thought to be extremely sensitive to perceived insults. One of his first acts when he came to power in 2000 was to target a satirical television show called Kukly (Puppets) that was broadcast by the NTV television station. In one episode, aired in January 2000, Putin was depicted as an evil, infant gnome muttering obscenities. Within months, the NTV channel was taken under state control, and jokes about the ex-KGB officer quickly disappeared from Russia\u2019s television screens.

Emergency officials in the Sverdlovsk region said on January 12 that the cause of the fire in the residential building overnight remained unknown. According to preliminary data, the blaze started in an apartment on the second floor and smoke quickly filled the building, making it impossible for many residents on upper floors to escape. Firefighters managed to rescue 90 people, including nine children, from the building. The eight residents who lost their lives were found in apartments on the second, fifth and ninth floors, officials said. The regional prosecutor's office said that an investigation had been launched into the incident. Deadly fires caused by violations of safety regulations or faulty wiring are common in Russia.

{"year":"2021","month":"01","event_desc":"23 January  Protests against the arrest of Alexei Navalny begin throughout Russia.","text":"Police crack down on Russian protests against jailing of Kremlin foe Navalny By Anton Zverev and Andrew Osborn January 24, 2021 9:22 AM UTC Updated  ago Text Small Text Medium Text Large Text Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police detained more than 3,000 people and used force to break up rallies across Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters ignored extreme cold and police warnings to demand the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August. The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday's demonstrations, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event. But protesters defied the ban and, in at least one case in temperatures below -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit), turned out in force. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, called on them to do the same next weekend to try to free Navalny from what he called \"the clutches of his killers\". In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated up to 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans. The authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up, while the foreign ministry questioned Reuters crowd estimate. \"Why not just immediately say 4 million?\" it suggested sarcastically on its official Telegram messenger channel. Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, put turnout in the capital at 50,000, the Proekt media outlet reported. Some protesters chanted \"Putin is a thief\", and \"Disgrace\" and \"Freedom to Navalny!\" U.S. CONDEMNS 'HARSH TACTICS' Navalny's wife Yulia was briefly detained at the rally before being released. Some of Navalny's political allies were detained in the days before the protest, others on the day itself. At one point, protesters surrounded a sleek black car with a flashing light used by senior officials, throwing snowballs at it and kicking it. A group of policemen were also pelted with snowballs by a much bigger crowd. The OVD-Info protest monitor group said that 3,435 people, including 1,360 in Moscow and 523 in St. Petersburg, had been detained at rallies in around 100 towns and cities. The United States condemned what it described as \"harsh tactics\" used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny's \"immediate and unconditional\" release. \"We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on Twitter that he deplored the authorities \"disproportionate use of force\", while Britain's foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned the \"use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists\".

Some protesters marched on the prison, where police were waiting to arrest them. Images of protesters with injuries such as bloodied heads circulated on social media. The scenes were reminiscent of the months-long unrest in Russia's neighbouring ally Belarus where anti-government protests flared last August over allegations of voter fraud. One Moscow protester, Sergei Radchenko, 53, said: \"I'm tired of being afraid. I haven't just turned up for myself and Navalny, but for my son because there is no future in this country.\" 'PUTIN PALACE' There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of \"provocateurs\". State prosecutors opened criminal cases into alleged violence against police officers by protesters. In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny's arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris. Police in Siberia's Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed. In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy. \"Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,\" spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter. \"Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly.\" There were outages on mobile phone and internet services, the monitoring site downdetector.ru showed, a tactic sometimes used by authorities to make it harder for protesters to communicate among themselves. In a push to galvanise support ahead of the protests, Navalny's team released a video this week about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. As of Saturday the video had been viewed more than 70 million times. Navalny's allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up frustrations among the public over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic. But Putin's grip on power looks unassailable for now and the 68-year-old president regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, much higher than that of Navalny.

Mayor Sergei Sobyanin called the incident a \"tragedy\" and confirmed two people were killed by the gunman, who had been detained. Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said two employees of the public services centre \u2014 \"an administrator and a security guard\" \u2014 were killed in the shooting in southeastern Moscow. She said four people were injured, including the girl. Doctors said the child had been wounded in the neck, and that she had undergone a successful operation.\u00a0Three wounded adults were also operated on, authorities said. The incident took place at a multi-functional government office that deals with a variety of administrative issues. Rakova said the Ryazansky Public Offices Center's staff and visitors were \"immediately\" evacuated when the shooting started at around 3:00 p.m. Moscow time (12:00 GMT). In a statement, the Interior Ministry said the man entered the center \"and started firing at the citizens there, after which he tried to hide.\" A law enforcement officer who was at the scene \"managed to catch and neutralize the attacker,\" the ministry added. Policeman Georgy Domolayev told national television that he ran after the shooter, who he said had a gun and knife attached to his waist. 'Worldwide conspiracy' Several Russian news agencies, citing law enforcement sources, said the gunman believed the coronavirus pandemic to be a conspiracy and that he began behaving aggressively after being told to put a mask on. \"He spoke about coronavirus and about a worldwide conspiracy,\" state news agency RIA Novosti cited a source as saying. The shooter will undergo a psychiatric examination. Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, launched a criminal probe into the shooting. In a statement, investigators said a man had entered a room in the government-run building and \"opened fire with a firearm on the people who were in the room.\" \"Two people died on the spot from their injuries,\" the statement said. Mass shootings in Russia are relatively rare. The country was rocked this year by two separate tragic killing sprees \u2014 one at a school, another at a university \u2014 spurring lawmakers to tighten laws regulating access to guns. Authorities have blamed foreign influence for school shootings, saying young Russians have been exposed online and on television\u00a0to gun attacks in the United States and elsewhere. In one high-profile public shooting in 2019, a gunman opened fire near the FSB domestic intelligence agency headquarters in central Moscow, killing an officer and wounding five people. Other high-profile shooting cases have taken place in Russia's army. In November 2020, a 20-year-old soldier killed three fellow servicemen at a military base near the city of Voronezh south of Moscow. In a similar attack in 2019, a young recruit shot dead eight servicemen.

The incident came at a moment of acute tension between the two countries, with Ukraine saying it fears a possible Russian invasion and Moscow denying it has any such plan. Sign up here. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had made arrests in 37 of Russia's more than 80 regions and that two of those held had planned attacks on educational institutions. An FSB statement identified the alleged group as the MKU, which state television said stood for the words \"Maniacs. Cult of Murder\". The FSB said the group was set up by a Ukrainian under the patronage of Ukraine's intelligence services. Ukraine's SBU security service said: \"The current statements of the FSB are part of a coordinated information operation which should only be viewed through the prism of hybrid warfare.\" It said in a written comment to Reuters that the FSB was playing to a Russian domestic audience and trying to discredit it. Russia has aimed a barrage of hostile rhetoric at Kyiv in recent weeks as Ukraine, the United States and Western capitals have raised fears over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine and the possibility of an invasion. Moscow has denied planning an attack and blamed Ukraine and NATO for stoking tensions, demanding assurances from the U.S.-led alliance that it will not grant membership to Kyiv. Washington has said it believes Russia may be planning to use alleged \"provocations\" by Ukraine to justify military aggression. Mutual recriminations between Russia and Ukraine have been rising for weeks. Ukraine last month accused Russia of being behind an alleged coup plot against President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which the Kremlin denied. Russia said on Dec. 2 it had arrested three suspected Ukrainian intelligence agents, including one accused of planning to carry out an attack using two homemade bombs, allegations that Kyiv dismissed as trumped up.

Among the dead were five rescue workers, although a sixth was found alive and taken to hospital in a serious condition. The blast happened at the Listvyazhnaya mine when coal dust caught fire in a ventilation shaft on Thursday. Rescuers suffocated as they tried to reach dozens of missing miners. At the time of the accident early on Thursday there were 287 people in the mine, some 3,500km (2,175 miles) east of Moscow. Many managed to get out and 49 people were taken to hospital, some of them suffering from smoke inhalation. But dozens were trapped and rescue operations had to be suspended because of high concentrations of methane. Officials said a methane gas explosion had filled the mine with smoke and the victims had died because of a lack of oxygen and high concentration of poisonous gas. At the mine By Petr Kozlov, BBC Russian Relatives sobbed outside the mine office on Friday. One man who said his grandson had died was prevented from going in and argued bitterly with a guard. A woman came out carrying a black plastic bag containing her dead son's clothes and boots: \"My boy is under the ground now, there is nothing more to say.\" Relatives comforted each other at the Listvyazhnaya mine entrance Relatives said warnings about growing levels of methane gas in the mine had gone unheeded. They said there had been a fire at the mine only 10 days earlier and miners had been frustrated that more was not done to improve safety. Amid all the sadness there was one moment of relief. As hope faded for the lives of the missing, the rescuers managed to find one man alive. The survivor from the rescue team was named as Alexander Zakovryashin and Russian Emergencies Minister Alexander Chupriyan said it was a \"miracle carried out by our people\". The mine director, his deputy and the disaster area supervisor were arrested over alleged safety failings, according to Russian news agencies. Russian mine accidents are not uncommon and this is not the first accident at Listvyazhnaya. In 2004, a methane gas explosion left 13 people dead. In 2016, authorities assessed the safety of the country's 58 coal mines and declared 34% of them potentially unsafe. The list did not include the Listvyazhnaya mine at the time, reports say. President Vladimir Putin described the loss of life as \"a great tragedy\".

(Satellite image \u00a92022 Maxar Technologies via AP) Read More Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit The Russian Supreme Court on Tuesday declared Ukraine\u2019s Azov Regiment a terrorist organization banned in Russia, a designation that fuels the Kremlin\u2019s narrative of the war in Ukraine and that may expose Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Moscow to terrorism charges. Azov, which played a key part in the defense of the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, has been repeatedly portrayed by Russian officials and state media as a Nazi formation allegedly committing atrocities against Ukraine\u2019s civilians. Russian state media have repeatedly shown what is claimed to be Nazi insignias, literature and tattoos associated with Azov, but no evidence has surfaced to back up the assertions about their treatment of civilians. The Azov Regiment is a unit within Ukraine\u2019s National Guard. It grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that rose to bolster Ukraine\u2019s underfunded and questionably led military in the fight against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Azov Battalion drew its initial fighters from far-right circles and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. Its current members rejected accusations of nationalism and radicalism. Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s office filed a motion to designate the regiment as a terrorist organization in May. Azov in an online statement Tuesday dismissed the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, accusing Russia of \u201clooking for new excuses and explanations for its war crimes.\u201d Azov urged the U.S. and other countries to declare Russia a \u201cterrorist state.\u201d \u201cRussia has been proving this status for many years with its daily actions,\u201d the statement said. Scores of Azov fighters are being held captive by Moscow. The Russian authorities have opened multiple criminal cases against them, accusing them of killing civilians. Last week, dozens of Ukrainian POWs were killed in an explosion at a barracks at a penal colony in Olenivka, an eastern town controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Moscow and Kyiv have have traded blame for the strike, with Kyiv saying Russia blew up the barracks to cover up torture against the POWs.","question":"What did the Russian Supreme Court declare the Azov Regiment as in August 2022?","answer":"The Russian Supreme Court declared the Azov Regiment a terrorist organization.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: In August 2022, the Russian Supreme Court declared the Azov Regiment a terrorist organization.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer exactly, stating that the Russian Supreme Court declared the Azov Regiment a terrorist organization in August 2022.","judge_model":"deepseek-ai\/DeepSeek-V3","tokens_usage":{"completion_tokens":52,"prompt_tokens":199,"total_tokens":251}}
{"year":"2022","month":"02","event_desc":"21 February  Putin announces that Russia has recognized the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in Ukraine as independent nations. This came after the Duma asked for it a week ago.","text":"The Russian president recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities. Russian President Vlamidir Putin has signed the presidential decree recognising the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine \u2013 a move that will severely ratchet up tensions with the West amid fears of a Russian invasion. Putin\u2019s announcement comes after a meeting of the presidential Security Council and paves the way for Russia to openly send troops and weapons to the long-running conflict pitting Ukrainian forces against Moscow-backed rebels. A 2015 peace deal ended large-scale fighting, but violence has simmered and has seen a spike in recent weeks amid the wider crisis. In a lengthy televised address, Putin described Ukraine as an integral part of Russia\u2019s history and said eastern Ukraine was ancient Russian lands and that he was confident that the Russian people would support his decision. He said that Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood and complained that post-Soviet Ukraine had wanted everything it could from Moscow without doing anything in return. Putin announced his decision in phone calls to the leaders of Germany and France, who voiced disappointment, the Kremlin said, and was later shown on state television signing the decree. Moscow\u2019s move could torpedo a last-minute bid for a summit with US President Joe Biden to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine. Russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour, but it has threatened unspecified \u201cmilitary-technical\u201d action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO. Putin delivered a long, televised address that ended with his announcement, delving into history as far back as the Ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over NATO\u2019s eastward expansion \u2013 a key irritant for Moscow in the present crisis. \u201cI deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago \u2013 to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d Putin said. The announcement comes amid soaring tensions over the situation in Ukraine, where Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near the border. Satellite images also appeared to show new deployments of Russian equipment and troops in farms and forests as near as 15km (9.3 miles) to the Ukrainian border. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Putin during a phone call that any move to recognise the independence of the breakaway regions in Donbas would amount to a \u201cone-sided breach\u201d of the Minsk agreements designed to end a long-running separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, Scholz\u2019s office said in a statement. Scholz also urged Putin to pull Russian troops from Ukraine\u2019s border and deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine. His office said he would consult with Ukrainian and French leaders about the situation. France and Germany are mediators in the conflict between Kyiv and Russia-backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The West has repeatedly warned Russia not to recognise the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday called an emergency national security meeting to address recent developments linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the Elysee Palace said. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc will move to impose sanctions on Russia if Putin recognises Ukraine\u2019s separatist territories as independent. \u201cWe call upon President Putin to respect international law and the Minsk agreements and expect him not to recognise the independence of Lugansk and Donetsk oblasts,\u201d Borrell said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. \u201cWe are ready to react with a strong, united front in case he should decide to do so.\u201d Russia\u2019s rouble, already under pressure from a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine, tumbled to new weeks-long lows as Putin spoke.

Originally, the honor was introduced by Joseph Stalin after World War II, when the Soviet population plunged by tens of millions. The award stopped with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Once it comes back in existence, a payment of 1 million rubles ($16,500) will be given to Russian mothers once their 10th child turns one, if all have survived. According to the latest Rosstat statistics published this summer, Russia\u2019s population shrank by an average of 86,000 people per month between January and May, a record. In addition Russia is suffering heavy losses among troops in Ukraine, but the true number of casualties has not been disclosed. Meanwhile, an estimated 75,300 migrants have left Russia. Some citizens are fleeing the country in the light of the Ukrainian war and a domestic political crackdown, search data, immigration figures and flight information show.

In an attempt to relieve the population crisis in the country, the Kremlin has also focused on promoting traditional values. Putin has long been an advocate of driving up Russia\u2019s birth rates through the implementation of policies which encourage large families through state financial aid. The Russian President also frequently brings up the importance of having a family and traditional values in his public speeches. \u201cOur historical responsibility is not only to get out of the demographic trap but also to ensure sustainable natural population growth by the middle of the coming decade,\u201d Putin said during his annual speech in 2020.

But after temporarily shutting down more than 800 restaurants following the invasion of Ukraine, McDonald\u2019s has decided to leave Russia altogether. The burger chain will sell its Russia business, saying the \u201chumanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald\u2019s to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald\u2019s values.\u201d In March, shortly after the war began, McDonald\u2019s followed other Western companies and temporarily shut down its restaurants in Russia. Once the sale is finalized, the Russian restaurants will be \u201cde-Arched,\u201d meaning the locations will no longer be allowed to use the McDonald\u2019s (MCD) name, logo or menu. McDonald\u2019s (MCD) said its employees will still be paid until the transaction closes and that \u201cemployees have future employment with any potential buyer.\u201d CEO Chris Kempczinski said he\u2019s proud of the more than 60,000 workers employed in Russia and said the decision was \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d \u201cHowever, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values. And our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the Arches shining there,\u201d he said. End of an era The decision brings to a remarkable end McDonald\u2019s three-decade relationship with Russia. McDonald\u2019s opened the doors of its first restaurant in Moscow on January 31, 1990. More than 30,000 were served and the Pushkin Square location had to stay open hours later than planned because of the crowds. Its arrival in Moscow was about more than just Big Macs and fries, noted Darra Goldstein, a Russia expert at Williams College. It was the most prominent example of Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbechev\u2019s attempt to open up his crumbling country to the outside world. \u201cThere was a really visible crack in the Iron Curtain,\u201d she previously said. \u201cIt was very symbolic about the changes that were taking place.\u201d About two years later, the Soviet Union would collapse. McDonald\u2019s exit \u201crepresents a new isolationism in Russia, which must now look inward for investment and consumer brand development,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData said in a note Monday. He added that other Western brands take \u201cprincipled stance on the concepts of freedom and democracy\u201d and revisit their businesses in Russia. A big cost to leaving McDonald\u2019s will take a significant write-off from exiting Russia \u2014 between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Shares were barely changed in early trading. \u201cThe fact that McDonald\u2019s owns most of its restaurants in Russia means there is an asset rich business to sell,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cHowever, given the circumstances of the sale, the financial challenges faced by potential Russian buyers, and the fact that McDonald\u2019s will not license its brand name or identity, it is unlikely the sale price will be anywhere near the pre-invasion book value of the business.\u201d In its most recent earnings report, McDonald\u2019s said closing its restaurants in Russia had cost it $127 million last quarter. Nearly $27 million came from staff costs, payments for leases and supplies. The other $100 million was from food and other items it will have to dump. McDonald\u2019s had 847 restaurants in Russia at the close of last year, according to an investor document. Together with another 108 in Ukraine, they accounted for 9% of the company\u2019s revenue in 2021. \u2014 CNN Business\u2019 Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.","question":"Why did McDonald's decide to exit Russia in May 2022?","answer":"McDonald's exited Russia due to the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine and the unpredictable operating environment, which conflicted with the company's values.","region":"Russia","model_answer":"Answer: McDonald's decided to exit Russia in May 2022 due to the geopolitical and economic implications following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russia earlier in the day said it would respond to Germany's broadcasting regulator\u2019s decision on Wednesday to ban the transmission of the state-run channel RT DE over its lack of a broadcasting license. The broadcaster was blocked last year from Europe's satellite network at the request of German authorities less than a week after going on air, but was still available over the internet and via a mobile app. The head of Russian state broadcaster RT on Wednesday said the network's German-language channel would continue to operate despite the ban. The decision to ban DW comes after a number of foreign journalists lost the right to work in Russia. In August 2021, the Kremlin expelled veteran BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford in retaliation for what it called discrimination against Russian media in Britain. Russian authorities in November revoked the residence permit for Tom Vennink \u2014 a longtime Dutch correspondent for the daily de Volkskrant \u2014 over past minor legal infractions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions in February before launching a war against Ukraine to bring the country back under the Kremlin's sphere of influence. Putin has backed separatists that control parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions with money, weapons, and troops since 2014 as he seeks to prevent Ukraine from joining Western-led organizations including the European Union and NATO. \"I think a referendum will be held in the near future,\" Leonid Pasechnik, the Luhansk separatist leader, said on March 27, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Russia is reportedly discussing the pros and cons of a \"referendum.\" The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that such a vote in Luhansk would not be recognized. \"The Russian Federation does not abandon attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Any fake referendums in the temporarily occupied territories are legally null and void and will have no legal consequences,\" ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko said in a statement to RFE\/RL . \"But Russia will receive an even more decisive response from the international community, which will accelerate its fall into the abyss of global isolation,\" Nikolenko said. The Kremlin tightly controls elections inside Russia and in territories it holds to generate the outcome it seeks. After seizing Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin immediately pushed through a \"referendum\" on joining Russia. Though Moscow claims citizens overwhelmingly voted in favor of annexation, a leaked report from its Human Rights Council two months later put turnout at only 30 percent , with about half of those voting to join Russia. The internationally community deemed the vote to be rigged and only a few countries today recognize the peninsula as part of Russia. The West has imposed sanctions preventing its companies from doing business in Crimea. It has also imposed sanctions on the separatist-controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk.

At least nine people were killed in an overnight missile and drone attack on Kyiv only hours after officials said there was progress toward a resolution of the conflict during negotiations in London between representatives of US, Europe, and Ukraine. Ukraine's State Emergency Service said 63 people were injured, including six children, who were among those hospitalized. \"Russia has launched a massive combined strike on Kyiv,\" the State Emergency Service said on Telegram. Residential buildings have been damaged and \"the search for people under the rubble is under way,\" it added. The number of dead and injured rose dramatically from two killed and 54 wounded reported earlier by Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who also said six children were hospitalized. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov also reported an attack on the city in northeastern Ukraine, saying on Telegram that seven missiles hit the city. The attacks began hours after the talks in London ended and after US President Donald Trump said he thinks he has reached a deal with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to settle the war. \"I think Russia is ready and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. And I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskiy,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. Trump also said he found it harder than expected to work with Zelenskyy. \"I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it's been harder.... But, I think we have a deal with both. I hope they do it, because I'm looking to save and, you know, we spent a lot of money, but this is about a lot of humanity,\" Trump said. Asked about reports of a US proposal that would see Crimea recognized as Russian territory, Trump said he had \"no favorites\" between Ukraine and Russia and that he just wanted the war to end. SEE ALSO: What\u2019s On The Table: Ukraine Talks Get Downgraded As Top Officials Pull Out Other administration officials said earlier on April 23 that a deal remained elusive and that the United States could walk away from peace talks in the absence of quick progress.

Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . His post included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Trump warned Ukraine earlier on social media that it needs to make a deal to end the fighting while sharply criticizing Zelenskyy for saying Kyiv sees any recognition of Crimea as part of Russia is a red line for Ukraine. \"It\u2019s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy\u2019s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,\" Trump said in a social media post in which he denied anyone is asking Ukraine recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. Late on April 23, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he met Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko Washington. A Treasury Department statement said Bessent stressed the need to sign an economic partnership between the two countries as soon as possible. The statement noted that \"the highly productive technical talks remain ongoing between the two sides.\" The talks in London were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting . A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said they involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said. Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy for Ukraine, assessed the talks as positive. \"It is time to move forward on President Trump's UKR-RU war directive: stop the killing, achieve peace, and put America first,\" Kellogg wrote on X . The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talk amid Trump's complaints of a lack of progress in the negotiations. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL.

Lithuania\u2019s State Security Department (VSD) says it has uncovered a covert operation by Russian and Belarusian intelligence services aimed at inciting violence against Belarusian exiles living in Lithuania. The plot, involving staged provocations and disinformation campaigns, was revealed in a statement released by the VSD and reported by the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT. According to Lithuanian authorities, foreign intelligence services have been orchestrating increasingly dangerous incidents targeting the Belarusian diaspora in Lithuania, which numbered more than 57,000 people as of early 2025. Authorities say foreign agents have attempted to simulate clashes between so-called \"Litvinist\" Belarusians -- followers of an ideology tying Belarusian identity to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania -- and fabricated Lithuanian nationalist groups. \"The organizers are trying to stage conflicts between opposing forces -- Belarusians who advocate for Litvinist ideas and so-called Lithuanian groups who appear to resist them,\u201d the VSD said. Recent Provocations Officials stressed that no real extremist Litvinist groups have been identified in Lithuania, and that they believe the narrative is being manipulated in Belarusian and Russian propaganda to stir mistrust and division. Recent provocations include fake video messages allegedly from Belarusian soldiers, anti-Belarusian graffiti, threats against Lithuanian lawmakers and Vilnius-based exiles, and social media campaigns spreading pseudohistorical claims about the region's past. The VSD warned residents not to fall for such provocations, noting that \"participation in these activities could lead to administrative or criminal liability.\" Meanwhile, there has been growing scrutiny of Belarusian nationals living in Lithuania. Many face increasingly strict visa checks, difficulties extending residence permits, and even deportation due to past affiliations with Belarusian state institutions or the military. Lithuanian media have labeled the disinformation campaign \u201cLitvinism.\u201d Authorities emphasize that the real danger lies not in the ideology itself, but in its exploitation to destabilize communities. In recognition of its reporting on this issue, the Lithuanian government's Department of National Minorities recently presented an award to RFE\/RL\u2019s Belarus Service for an investigative piece that shed light on the actors behind the campaign and its broader geopolitical implications.

(file photo) A federal court judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to reverse its efforts aimed at forcing the closure of Voice of America (VOA), which was shut down last month in a move the broadcaster had called illegal. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled late on April 22 to grant a preliminary injunction that says officials must \"take all necessary steps\" to restore employees and contractors to their positions at VOA and to restore Congress-approved funding to two other U.S.-government funded broadcasters -- Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks -- and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts. Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees the federal broadcasters, also ordered the media outlets to provide monthly status reports showing the USAGM was complying with the order to allow the outlets to \"provide news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive.\" The USAGM has not responded publicly to the court decision. VOA last month filed a lawsuit saying the Trump administration has taken \u201ca chainsaw\u201d approach to the USAGM through an executive order that directed it and six other federal agencies to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\u201d The USAGM subsequently placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and terminated some 600 contractors, forcing VOA to stop its broadcasts for the first time since it was founded in 1942. The USAGM had argued in the case that no \"final decision\" on VOA's future had been made and that the lawsuits should be treated as \"employment disputes\" with those workers who had been terminated. Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty has also filed a lawsuit against the USAGM \u201cto avoid irreparable harm\u201d to the broadcaster over the withholding of its Congress-approved grant as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to terminate RFE\/RL\u2019s funding. RFE\/RL's case continues to be pursued in court.

Officials from Ukraine, the United States, and Europe said a meeting in London was \"substantive\" despite the last-minute postponement of a broader set of talks with foreign ministers. The April 23 talks, which were aimed at trying to resolve Russia's 38-month war on Ukraine, were already facing serious headwinds after top diplomats, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pulled out, effectively downgrading the meeting and casting a major pall over ongoing peace efforts. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy also opted to skip the meetings, leaving a Ukrainian delegation that included Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's top aide -- to meet with lower-level officials and US Ukraine envoy Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. In the end, the talks involved \"substantive technical meetings with European, US, and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting\" triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters. \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and these talks today are an important part of that,\" the spokesperson said.

Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace,\" he said on X . Speaking to reporters at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he thought the London talks went well. He also said he thinks he has a deal with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the war. But he also implied that a deal with Zelenskyy remained elusive, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been more difficult to deal with than Putin. Putin was quoted as saying he viewed the deal on the table positively and hoped that Ukraine feels the same way. Trump and Zelenskyy are both scheduled to attend the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on April 25. There has been no announcement of a meeting between the two. The scrapping of a meeting between the top diplomats of Ukraine, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain at the London talks highlighted the divide between the countries in finding a path to peace talks. It also came after Trump complained of a lack of progress in the negotiations, prompting him to threaten to make a deal soon or Washington will walk away from the table. \"I think we read it all the same way,\" one European diplomat, who asked not to be named, told RFE\/RL. \"It's the US one step further toward checking out.\" \"I see it as additional pressure on the Ukrainians: take it or leave it,\" another European diplomat told RFE\/RL.

The situation for Ukraine is dire -- He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\" Trump added. Zelenskyy in his post on X included a copy of a 2018 statement by then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling on Russia to end its occupation of Crimea and uphold the principle of not changing borders by force. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day during a trip to India, US Vice President JD Vance said Washington had issued a \u201cvery explicit proposal\u201d to Russia and Ukraine, though he gave no details. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance said. \u201cThe current lines, somewhere close to them is where you\u2019re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,\u201d he said.

A Russian drone attack hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian town of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens of others, local authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, saying that Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacks on civilians are 'commonplace' in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions, as well as the frontline cities of Kupyansk and Pokrovsk. \"Russians struck a bus which was transporting workers of a mining and processing plant.

Speaking at a meeting of the State Military-Industrial Commission on April 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that more than 1.5 million drones of various types had been produced in Russia last year. Putin added that this amount included about 4,000 FPV drones. A wave of Russia's attacks also targeted civilian infrastructure across other Ukrainian regions. At least five people were reported injured in the Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Odesa. \"Residential buildings, business facilities, warehouses, and garages have been damaged,\" Ukraine's emergency service said . Large-scale fires had also broken out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said . The emergency service said the attack targeted 'solely the city's civilian infrastructure.' Meanwhile, in the Yelabuga district of Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region, two fires broke out following a reported drone attack, local authorities confirmed on April 23. The Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over Tatarstan by air defense systems on duty. Officials have not released further details on the type of drone or its intended target. Rustem Nuriyev, head of the Yelabuga district administration, said in a statement that there were no casualties or injuries as a result of the incident. In response to the drone activity, temporary flight restrictions were imposed on Kazan and Nizhnekamsk airports. Kyiv has not commented on the incident. Also, a fire that had been burning at an ammunition depot on a military base -- where a large explosion occurred a day earlier -- in the Kirzhach district of Russia's Vladimir region, northeast of Moscow, has been \u201cgradually ending,\u201d regional Governor Aleksandr Avdeyev said. Four people were injured when ammunition exploded, prompting an evacuation order, Avdeyev said , adding that ammunition caught fire and shells exploded in the storage area. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier that the fire had been caused by a breach of safety protocols and had resulted in the detonation of ammunition stored in a warehouse. \"As a result of a fire on the territory of a military unit in the Vladimir region, ammunition stored in a warehouse detonated,\" the Defense Ministry said. \"According to preliminary information...the cause of the fire was a violation of safety standards in work with explosive materials.\" A state of emergency was declared in the Kirzhach district, which is about 130 kilometers northeast of the Russian capital. The base was evacuated along with about 450 people from at least seven nearby settlements, the governor said. The ammunition depot is one of the largest of the Russian armed forces. It is more than 500 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. There had been no reports of drone attacks in the Vladimir region prior to the explosion. Yan Matveyev, a Russian military analyst, told Current Time that the ammunition stored at the depot could range from typical 155-millimeter artillery shells to Iskander-M missiles. \"This depot is close to the capital, close to Moscow, so it's easy to transport all this [ammunition] around the country,\" Matveyev said. Unverified video published earlier on Telegram channels showed a huge fire ball, a loud blast, and clouds of thick smoke rising into the sky. Baza, a Telegram channel close to security services, said 10 to 11 explosions had occurred and firefighters from neighboring regions had been called in to contain the blaze. It said a special commission has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire.

(file photo) Farmers in Uzbekistan say the government is forcing them to surrender land to Chinese businesses under the guise of state-backed development, taking thousands of hectares of fertile cotton and wheat fields out of the hands of locals. Concerned over the fate of the lush lands of the Ferghana Valley, they told Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty that large patches of land have been taken into the state reserve and transferred to Chinese businessmen. Official documents say the land transfers are voluntary. But dozens of accounts given to RFE\/RL from those who signed over their land appear to describe a different reality: coercion, threats, and intimidation by Uzbek law enforcement officers acting on orders from local officials. \"The governor told me: 'This is a presidential order. Either give up the land or go to jail,'\" said one farmer who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal for commenting publicly on the issue. Creeping Influence? Land transfers in the Ferghana Valley, which is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, are the latest flashpoint in what is becoming an increasingly visible and volatile undercurrent across Central Asia -- a surge of anti-Chinese sentiment driven by land disputes, debt dependency, labor market tensions, and fears of creeping influence.

Neither the local government nor the prosecutor can take it away. According to the legislation, the land can only be seized by the state by court decision. Farmers, though, say and seizures are being carried out based on a verbal order from Shuhrat Abdurahmonov, the head of the region. \"I did not want to give up my land and put up some resistance, but in response, the district governor called more than 20 police officers and the National Guard to the district administration building and ordered them to arrest me and my wife,\" a farmer from Qurgonteppa district told RFE\/RL. \"That is why none of the farmers resist now; otherwise, they could be imprisoned. It is unlikely that any of us would be able to get out of there alive and well.\" Regional administrations failed to comment on the claims by farmers when contacted by RFE\/RL. Concerns over China taking over the use of large swaths of land extend beyond the farming community. Beijing's economic presence in Central Asia has grown rapidly in recent years under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. As of early 2025, China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner, with bilateral trade reaching $12.5 billion. Over 3,400 Chinese firms operate in the country, surpassing even the number of Russian entities. Similar patterns have emerged in other Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan.

Uzbek political analyst Nargiza Muratalieva points out that Central Asian countries are increasingly falling into what she calls China's \"economic trap:\" easy access to credit -- often with opaque terms -- that can eventually leave weaker states vulnerable to political pressure or asset forfeiture. Muratalieva points out that Beijing gained over 1,100 square kilometers of land in Tajikistan in 2011 in exchange for debt relief, a clear example of the potential consequences of falling into this \"trap.\" China is already the largest lender in Uzbekistan, with outstanding loans totaling $3.8 billion. \"The general characteristics of Chinese lending for all countries in the region are the ease of obtaining debts, their difficult repayment, as well as the lack of transparency of procedures and specific conditions,\" according to Muratalieva.

Whether it's propaganda or not, the fear that China could one day treat Kazakhs or Uzbeks the same way has further sown seeds of opposition to Beijing's expanding presence. \"It turns out that the Chinese really like my land; they want to take the land from other farmers too. Naturally, we are against it, but the district governor, the prosecutor, and the police chief continue to put pressure on us,\" one farmer from Uzbekistan's western Andijon region told RFE\/RL. \"What worries us most is that they can subsequently seize our country and do to us the same as they did to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\" SEE ALSO: Trump's Tariffs, Like Russian Sanctions, Benefit Chinese EVs In Central Asia Read more April 22, 2025 By Ray Furlong , RFE\/RL's Russian Service and Current Time Russia Issues Warrant For Film Critic Turned War Critic Yekaterina Barabash in court. In a baggy red blouse and matching glasses, Yekaterina Barabash was pictured apparently blowing kisses from behind a bulletproof glass screen when she stood in the dock at a Moscow court. A well-known film critic, she was sentenced to two months of house arrest for allegedly spreading \u201clies\u201d about the Russian military\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. Now, Russian authorities have issued a wanted note for her and she faces up to 10 years in prison after they found the 63-year-old wasn\u2019t home during a check on April 13. On April 21, the Russian prison agency issued a statement saying that she wasn\u2019t home when they called several days earlier. Subsequently, a Moscow court changed her sentence, meaning that she now faces prison. Friends of Barabash contacted by RFE\/RL declined to comment on her disappearance amid fears for her safety. Barabash has been an occasional guest on RFE\/RL\u2019s Russian Service programs for some years and has often criticized the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip on society. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, she immediately condemned it. Russian forces \u201chave bombed the country, levelled whole cities to the ground,\u201d she wrote a few weeks into the conflict. Words such as these were a direct challenge to the Kremlin\u2019s narrative, which banned the word \u201cwar\u201d and denied that civilians were being targeted in attacks despite evidence to the contrary. Shortly after the invasion began, Russia passed new legislation providing jail sentences for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the armed forces. It has been used to jail hundreds of people since the war began, and has led to many others keeping silent. Barabash in court. Moscow, February 26, 2025. In a recent case , a 19-year-old woman in St. Petersburg received a nearly three-year prison sentence for gluing a short verse to a statue of a Ukrainian poet. The same law eventually led to Barabash\u2019s arrest in February 2025. In court, prosecutors said she had distributed \u201cintentionally false information about the activities of the Russian military\u201d on social media. After receiving her sentence, she emerged from the court declaring \u201cat least I\u2019ll have two months of freedom,\u201d suggesting perhaps that she expected a jail sentence in the future. Describing the moment of her arrest, she said it was \u201csurprising.\u201d \u201cThe doorbell rings and [you expect] a kind person, you open the door and there are men in masks.\u201d Her case led to an outpouring of support from leading cultural figures.

Massive Russian aerial strikes hit residential buildings in several Ukrainian cities, leaving at least one dead and more than two dozen injured, including several children, in attacks President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \"deliberate terror.\" Two guided aerial bomb strikes hit the city of Zaporizhzhya on April 22, killing one woman and injuring 38 others -- four of whom were children and a pregnant woman, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Drone attacks were also seen in the city of Kharkiv, though casualty figures were unknown. The daytime strikes came after a drone attack overnight sparked massive fires in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, where a a housing block in a densely inhabited area was hit. The attack left one woman dead and at least three other residents injured. The attack came amid ongoing diplomatic activity to secure a cease-fire in the Ukraine war, following Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. \"All of this is absolutely deliberate Russian terror that can be stopped by a single order, an order in Russia and for the Russian Army,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \"Our proposal for a cease-fire regarding civilian buildings also remains in force. Russia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this. There are no obstacles on the Ukrainian side and there will be none.\" Across the country, the Ukrainian Air Force reported dozens of drone attacks overnight. Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhaniv wrote on social media on April 22 that many apartments had been damaged and that \u201cthe residents are in shock.\u201d Emergency services posted photos and videos of fire crew battling blazes at what they said was civilian infrastructure. The renewed attacks came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that his forces were attacking civilian targets in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the governor of Russia's Vladimir region, Aleksandr Avdeyev, said on April 22 that an explosion occurred in the region's Kirzhach district. Avdeyev did not provide details but said emergency services were on site. Telegram channels reported the blast happened in the village of Barsovo, near military unit 11785, also known as the 51st arsenal of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, which stores ammunition. Residents reported several explosions. A \"powerful attack\" was reported, prompting evacuations in Barsovo and nearby villages within a 5 km radius. Roads to Kirzhach from Moscow were blocked. Local authorities announced a state of emergency in the area. Russia also launched large-scale missile strikes on Easter Monday on April 21, following the expiry of a self-declared 30-hour Easter truce. Kyiv claimed Russian forces violated the truce 3,000 times. On April 22, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot dismissed the truce as a \u201cmarketing operation\u201d by Putin aimed primarily at US President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at continuing Russian attacks as he pushes diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire. SEE ALSO: Ukraine Stands By Proposal To End Attacks On Civilian Targets, Zelenskyy Says \"The Easter truce, which he announced somewhat unexpectedly, was a marketing operation, an operation of charm, aimed at preventing President Trump's impatience and anger,\" Barrot was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying on FranceInfo television. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said he spoke to Barrot the previous evening to coordinate positions ahead of a meeting in London on April 23. The London meeting was set to bring together Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, following a gathering in Paris on April 18 -- the first joint talks in this format since Trump took office. Barrot told FranceInfo that the European countries used that meeting to tell Washington what their red lines were for a deal. Trump has said he\u2019s hopeful an agreement can be wrapped up this week, which feels ambitious to many observers. But in another sign that diplomacy is picking up steam, Putin said on April 21 that he was ready for direct talks with Zelenskyy -- something that he had until recently refused.

Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin's proposal but said Ukraine \"was ready for any conversation\" about a cease-fire that would stop strikes on civilians. \"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure.\" SEE ALSO: Zelenskyy Demands Russia Return Ukrainian Children In New International Campaign Ukraine and Russia are facing pressure from the United States to make progress on negotiations to end the war.

Ukrainian authorities reported dozens of Russian missile and drone attacks on April 21, while a Ukrainian drone strike was reported in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region. Strikes were reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns and cities. A man was reportedly injured by shelling in Kherson. Russian forces attacked Ukraine's northeastern region, killing one person in a border village, according to regional prosecutors. The report on Telegram said a Russian drone struck and killed a man on a scooter in the village of Ivashki. Russian forces also launched a late night drone attack on residential areas of Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, triggering fires and damaging many apartments, local officials said early on April 22. A day earlier US President Donald Trump voiced hope that an agreement would be reached between the two countries this week. Trump told reporters at the White House on April 21 that he plans to comment on the war in Ukraine and mediation efforts in the next three days. He made the comment in response to a question about whether the United States had proposed that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Russia occupied the peninsula in 2014 and then annexed it in violation of international law. \"So I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,\" Trump said. \"But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia,\" he added without providing details. In his comments earlier on April 21, Putin said Russia was open to any peace initiatives and expected the same from Kyiv. \"We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude toward any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way,\" Putin said on state TV. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when Putin said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, he meant bilateral negotiations. There have been no direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"President Putin and the Russian side remain open to seeking a peaceful settlement. We are continuing to work with the American side and, of course, we hope that this work will yield results,\" Peskov told reporters. Peskov declined to comment on the prospects of a deal this week.

At age 16, Vladyslav Rudenko was captured by Russian forces and held in children\u2019s camps in Russia-occupied Crimea and Kherson for nine months. Unlike some 20,000 other Ukrainian youths, Rudenko was rescued by the NGO Save Ukraine and returned to Ukrainian-controlled territory after nine months in captivity. It's the fate of those thousands, many of whom remain in Russian-occupied areas -- in what Moscow calls \u201crehabilitation centers\u201d -- that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials say they are now focused on. \"This crime must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held accountable,\" Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said over the weekend as part of the launch of the ChildrenAreNonNegotiable campaign. \"A just and lasting peace requires the return of all these Ukrainian children home.\" SEE ALSO: Amid Interrogations And Threats, Ukrainian Civilians Flee Russian Occupation US President Donald Trump has made ending Europe's longest conflict since World War II a top foreign policy priority since taking office three months ago. While the talks have lurched between several contentious issues, Ukrainian officials have kept the repatriation of all of those taken from Ukraine a major negotiating point. Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of orchestrating what some groups have called a \"systematic deportation\" of children out of Ukraine and into Russia-controlled parts of the country, or even further to destinations in Russia and its ally, Belarus. Evidence gathered last year by RFE\/RL's Belarus Service and Schemes , the investigative unit of RFE\/RL's Ukrainian Service, indicated camps were being used to teach young Ukrainians to identify with concepts that both Moscow and Minsk promote. That came after a November 2023 study by the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab that deemed Ukrainian schoolchildren's escorted trips to Belarus were coordinated by Belarus and Russia as part of the two countries' so-called Union State. SEE ALSO: Abducted Ukrainian Children: Calls Made To Continue Search For Kids Taken By Russia As US Closes Investigation Team The study said the process involves \"re-education,\" which it defined as \"the promotion of cultural, historical, societal, and patriotic messages or ideas that serve the political interests\" of both regimes. Military training, including by Interior Ministry troops, occurred with \"at least six groups of children,\" according to the report. Rudenko told RFE\/RL's Ukrainian service earlier this month that during the time he was held by Russian authorities his daily routine had an obvious orientation. \u201cWe woke up to the Russian anthem, raised the flag, did exercises. After breakfast, they told us what had happened in Russia overnight. Literally. Then we went to watch Russian movies,\" he said, recalling his regiment while held in camps. According to the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab more than 8,400 children from Ukraine have been systematically relocated to at least 57 facilities: 13 facilities in Belarus and 43 facilities in Russia and Russia-occupied territory. According to Ukraine\u2019s official government portal childrenofwar.gov.ua , a much higher number -- around 20,000 -- have been taken away and only 1,300 children have been successfully returned. \u201cWe remind the world that without the return of the children abducted by Russia, the war cannot truly be considered over,\u201d a statement published by Zelenskyy's office during Easter said. Washington has supported Kyiv on the issue of repatriating children, saying last month it remains committed to supporting the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. However, Ukrainian officials are worried recent budget cutting moves by the Trump administration could significantly hinder investigations into where the children have been moved and efforts to enable their return. Meanwhile, Karolina Hird, deputy team leader and an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, an American nonprofit research group, warned that Ukrainian teenagers forced to accept Russian citizenship may face conscription into the Russian army and could be forced to fight against their own people, a violation of international law. \u201cNegotiations and an end to the fighting without consideration for the deported children will empower Russia to continue to commit these crimes with absolute impunity,\u201d Hird wrote .

Oreshkin said Putin\u2019s 30-hour truce was merely a show for propaganda purposes. \u201cBut Zelenskyy managed to turn it to his own advantage, by proposing a 30-day truce,\u201d he added. \u201cPutin was forced to not agree to that. That can be presented how they like to the [Russian] domestic audience, But externally, it\u2019s clear where the threat to peace comes from.\u201d Read more Updated April 21, 2025 By RFE\/RL Pope Francis, Pioneering Pontiff Who 'Inspired Millions,' Dies Aged 88 Pope Francis (1936-2025) Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88 after battling a serious bout of double pneumonia. Despite his illness, his death came as a shock after he had been driven around St. Peter's Square to greet cheering crowds on Easter Sunday. \"Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vatican's TV channel on April 21. \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father,\" he said. Francis, who had also delivered a blessing at this year's Easter services a day before his death, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church and the first from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first pontiff born outside Europe in over a millennium. At the Vatican, locals, tourists, and pilgrims visiting for Easter expressed their shock and grief. \"This is something that really hits you hard,\" Rome resident Emanuela Tinari told Reuters. \"He was a pope who brought so many people closer to the church. He was not appreciated by everyone. But he definitely was by ordinary people.\" Embed share Around The World, People Mourn The Pope Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. width px height px Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:02:20 0:00 Tributes have also been pouring in for the late pontiff from leaders around the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin published a statement saying Francis \"enjoyed great international authority as a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious statesman, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice.\" \"Throughout his pontificate, he actively contributed to the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive interaction between Russia and the Holy See,\" he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also praised the pope's tenure, describing the pontiff as someone who \"knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\" \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,\" he added. \"We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!\" 'Painful And Shameful' -- Pope Francis On The Ukraine War Pope Francis, who died on April 21, Easter Monday, did not deliver his final annual Angelus address in person. But the text of his address said the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 was \u201ca painful and shameful occasion for all of humanity.\" He went on to voice \u201csolidarity with the martyred Ukrainian people.\" The Pontiff\u2019s death-bed statement was his last attempt to give the Vatican a voice in the conflict. While he was clearly sympathetic to the plight of Ukrainians, Pope Francis\u2019 previous interventions were not always welcomed by Kyiv. He raised particular ire in March 2024 by calling on Ukraine to find \"the courage of the white flag\u201d to enter peace talks with Russia. He later said that the \u201cfirst condition\u201d for peace was that Russia \u201cput an end to its aggression.\u201d But earlier, his avoidance of specific criticism of Russia was a cause of frustration. In June 2022, he condemned the \u201ccruelty\u201d of Russian forces while also suggesting the war was \u201cperhaps somehow provoked.\u201d This echoed a Kremlin argument, repeatedly made without evidence, that it was forced to attack. -- By Ray Furlong, senior international corresponden t \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Trump announced later on the same social media platform that he and first lady Melania Trump would attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome. Trump's predecessor also praised Frances on social media. \"He promoted equity and an end to poverty and suffering across the globe,\" said Joe Biden, himself a devout Roman Catholic. US Vice President JD Vance, who met with the pontiff on April 20, said his heart \"goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis,\" adding that \"he inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.\" Moldovan President Maia Sandu also expressed regret at the news of Francis's death, saying that he had \"tirelessly promoted compassion and social justice\" and \"led with love, stood by the vulnerable, and called for unity in times of division.\" Her comments were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the pope had been \"a man of humility, on the side of the most vulnerable and the most fragile.\" Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Francis would be remembered for his \"tireless commitment to the weakest in society.\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tweeted that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Francis's death. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to the news with a short a Facebook post that included a picture of him with the late pontiff. \"Thank you for everything, Holy Father,\" he said. \"We bid you farewell.\" An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman voiced sadness over Francis's death, saying that he offered \"condolences to all Christians around the world.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Francis was \"a spiritual leader who gave importance to dialogue between different faith groups and took the initiative in the face of humanitarian tragedies, especially the Palestinian issue and the genocide in Gaza.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev , Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani , Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze , and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajic also posted tributes to the pope. A Papacy Focused On Social Justice Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis worked as a chemical technician before entering the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a priest in 1969 and became the provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed archbishop of Buenos Aires. Three years later, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Elected Pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, reflecting his commitment to humility and the poor. Images From Francis's Years As Pope No media source currently available 0:00 0:01:01 0:00 His papacy was marked by a focus on mercy, social justice, and environmental stewardship. In 2015, Pope Francis issued the encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019,\u201d calling for global action on climate change and care for the environment. He also emphasized interfaith dialogue, notably signing the Document on Human Fraternity with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Ahmed el-Tayeb, in 2019, a landmark agreement promoting peace and coexistence among different faiths. 'A Poor Church For The Poor' Pope Francis was known for his pastoral approach, advocating for a \u201cpoor Church for the poor\u201d and reaching out to marginalized communities. He made efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s financial systems and address alleged clerical sexual abuse within the church. In 2025, he published his autobiography, \u201cHope,\u201d offering insights into his life and papal mission. In his later years, Pope Francis faced several health challenges. In 2021, he underwent colon surgery to address diverticulitis, and in 2023, he had abdominal surgery to repair a hernia. He also experienced chronic knee and back pain, often using a wheelchair for mobility. Despite these issues, he maintained a rigorous schedule, continuing his pastoral duties and international travels. In early 2025, Pope Francis was hospitalized with a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, which developed into double pneumonia. His condition remained complex, requiring an extended hospital stay. He had been discharged from hospital on March 23.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would continue to mirror Russia's actions, following reports of further missile strikes by Moscow. In a Telegram post , Zelenskyy noted that Moscow had ignored both a proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire and a call to halt air strikes on civilian infrastructure, including missile and drone attacks. \u201cThe nature of Ukrainian actions will remain mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, and any Russian attacks will be met with our own. Actions always speak louder than words,\u201d he added. An Easter truce in fighting between Russia and Ukraine appeared to reduce some air strikes on Ukrainian cities, but Kyiv angrily claimed nearly 3,000 violations by Moscow\u2019s forces while calls for an extension went unheeded by the Kremlin. Nevertheless, US President Donald Trump said late on April 20 that \"hopefully, Ukraine and Russia will make a deal this week.\" \"Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform without elaboration.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said Moscow's actions following the midnight end to the truce will indicate the Kremlin's real attitude toward any initiatives to end the war. \"Regarding the so-called 'Easter Cease-fire,' we have still not heard Moscow\u2019s response to our proposal to extend it to 30 days,\" he wrote on X. \"Russia's actions after midnight, tomorrow, and throughout the week will reveal Russia\u2019s true attitude toward US peace efforts and the 30-day full cease-fire proposal. They will show whether Russia is serious about peace or Putin's statements from yesterday were simply manipulations,\" Sybiha added. The US State Department earlier said it would welcome an extension to the Easter cease-fire that was set to expire a few hours later. \"We have seen President Putin's announcement of a temporary cease-fire due to Easter. We remain committed to achieving a full and comprehensive cease-fire,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement e-mailed to news media. \"As we assess their seriousness in this instance, we would welcome it extending beyond Sunday,\" the statement added. In the early morning hours of April 21, Zelenskyy accused Russia of 2,935 violations following Putin's call for the Easter truce, although he added that there had been \"no air raid alerts\" during the period. \"Either Putin does not have full control over his army or the situation proves that in Russia they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X on April 20.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Recognition of the two regions in eastern Ukraine as independent would largely invalidate the Minsk process | Alexander Nemenov\/AFP via Getty Images February 15, 2022 3:07 pm CET By Victor Jack Russia\u2019s parliament on Tuesday urged President Vladimir Putin to recognize the independence of two Russian-backed breakaway regions in Ukraine, a move that could threaten diplomatic efforts to avoid a broader war between the two countries. Lawmakers in the Duma, the Russian parliament\u2019s lower house, voted overwhelmingly in favor of sending an appeal directly to Putin asking him to recognize occupied portions of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as self-standing \u201cpeople\u2019s republics.\u201d The Kremlin said no official decision on the demand had been made. Recognition of the two regions in eastern Ukraine as independent would largely invalidate the Minsk process, a set of agreements that Russia and Ukraine signed in 2014 and 2015 guaranteeing the regions would remain part of Ukraine, albeit with \u201cspecial status.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement The leaders of countries such as France, Germany and the U.S. have pointed to the Minsk agreements as a possible basis for talks regarding Russia\u2019s massive troop build-up along the Ukrainian border. Moscow refuses to remove its forces unless NATO allies significantly roll back their presence in Eastern Europe \u2014 a request the military alliance has mostly dismissed as unreasonable. Russia has repeatedly denied it is planning to invade Ukraine and has condemned such claims as Western \u201chysteria.\u201d After the parliament vote, Western allies were swift to denounce the move, warning that diplomatic efforts could rupture if the Kremlin signs off on the recognition. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made that point standing next to Putin, speaking after the two leaders met to discuss ongoing military tensions. \u201cThat would be a violation of these agreements,\u201d he said during a joint press conference. \u201cThat would be a political disaster.\u201d Only when all sides \u201chonor\u201d the agreements, Scholz added, \u201ccan we move forward.\u201d In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg echoed Scholz\u2019s sentiment. Advertisement Advertisement \u201cIf that happens, that would be a blatant violation of Ukraine\u2019s territory and sovereignty once again,\u201d he said. And in an interview with BBC, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko questioned how Kyiv could negotiate if the recognition takes place. \u201cIf you take such a step, how can you expect Ukraine to make a concession?\u201d he said . Russia and Ukraine have disagreed for years over the Minsk agreements, diverging on how much power local governments in the regions should have on national decisions. The accords have also failed to prevent the ongoing war in the region, now in its eighth year. Earlier on Tuesday, Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, reaffirmed Russia\u2019s commitment to the Minsk process and said no official decisions had been made on recognizing the independence of the regions. \u201cRussia has repeatedly declared that it remains committed to the Minsk package of measures and is a supporter of the implementation of the entire Minsk action plan as soon as possible,\u201d he told state-linked news agency TASS. Advertisement Advertisement Lawmakers shut down an alternative proposition by Putin\u2019s United Russia party to send the appeal to multiple state departments for consultation first, which could have extended deliberations. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said on his Telegram channel that the resolution would be signed immediately and sent to Putin. \u201cThe deputies believe that the recognition of the [Donetsk People\u2019s Republic] and the [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic] will create the basis for ensuring the security and protection of the inhabitants of the republics against external threats as well as for strengthening international peace and regional stability,\u201d he said.

The bill criminalises any act regarded as an attempt to promote what Russia calls \u201cnon-traditional sexual relations\u201d \u2013 in film, online, advertising or in public \u2013 and expands on a notorious 2013 law that banned \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\u201d among minors and was used to detain gay rights activists. Under the new law, individuals can be fined up to 400,000 roubles (\u00a35,400) and organisations 5m roubles (\u00a368,500) for \u201cpropagandising nontraditional sexual relations\u201d, while foreigners could face up to 15 days\u2019 arrest and expulsion from Russia. Human rights groups and LGBTQ+ activists say the extension of the law means any act or public mention of same-sex relationships is functionally being outlawed. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is expected to sign the bill in the coming days. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin has launched a fresh effort to promote \u201ctraditional values\u201d, with the Russian leader making anti-gay rhetoric one of the cornerstones of his political agenda. In a recent speech, Putin accused the west of \u201cmoving towards open satanism\u201d, citing the promotion of gay and transgender rights in Europe as an example. Alexander Khinshtein, a senior lawmaker and one of the bill\u2019s designers, said the war in Ukraine had given the proposed anti-LGBTQ+ law \u201cnew relevance\u201d. \u201cThe special military operation takes place not only on the battlefield but also in the minds and souls of people,\u201d Khinshtein said, referring to the conflict in Ukraine. In an earlier discussion of the bill, Khinshtein targeted the popular children\u2019s cartoon Peppa Pig, after a lesbian couple joined its cast of characters in an episode titled Families. Patriarch Kirill , the head of the Russian Orthodox church and a close ally of Putin, also backed the new law. In an earlier sermon, Kirill bizarrely blamed the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on gay pride parades. Human rights activists on Thursday condemned the bill. Igor Kochetkov, the head of the rights group Russian LGBT Network, said the bill was an \u201cabsurd\u201d government attempt to further discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community in Russia. \u201cThis law is part of an ongoing homophobic government campaign against LGBTQ rights,\u201d said Kochetkov, who recently left Russia. \u201cThis is part of a broader attack on anything the government deems \u2018western and progressive\u2019.\u201d Kochetkov said the bill was also an attempt by the Kremlin to look for internal enemies and distract attention from battlefield losses. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kochetkov said the vague wording of the bill made it difficult to gauge just how restrictive the law would be. \u201cOfficials don\u2019t explain what they mean under \u2018LGBT propaganda\u2019. At this point, it is hard to know how this will affect the community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the situation of the LGBTQ community was already very dire before this bill.\u201d Over the past few years, Russia has banned a number of prominent LGBTQ+ rights groups, including the Sphere Foundation, an organisation that shed light on violent anti-gay purges in Chechnya. Kochetkov\u2019s LGBT Network, with a number of other human rights groups, has also received the \u201cforeign agent\u201d label, a Soviet-era tag designed to target groups the authorities say receive \u201cforeign funding\u201d and engage in \u201cpolitical activity\u201d. But while the Russian government has expanded its attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, recent polling has indicated parts of Russian society are becoming more tolerant towards the gay community, with a 2019 poll showing that 68% of younger Russians view the LGBTQ+ community as \u201cnormal\u201d. And in July, Daria Kasatkina, Russia\u2019s highest-ranked female tennis player, came out as gay , a move applauded by fellow athletes and parts of the Russian public. Pointing to these reactions, Kochetkov said the new law would not drastically change the way Russians viewed lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people. \u201cMany in the country are becoming more accepting of the LGBTQ community and a new law will not buck this trend,\u201d he said.

Darya Dugina, whose father is the Russian political commentator Alexander Dugin, died when the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving was ripped apart by a powerful explosion about 12 miles (20km) west of the capital near the village of Bolshiye Vyazemy at about 9.30pm local time (1930 BST), according to investigators. Prominent Russian hawks without evidence quickly blamed Kyiv for the attack, calling it an assassination attempt and demanding the Kremlin respond by targeting government officials in Kyiv. \u201cDecision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!\u201d wrote Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-funded RT television station, reposting a call to bomb the headquarters of the Ukrainian SBU intelligence agency. If the car bombing is tied to the war it would mark the first time since February that the violence unleashed on Ukraine has reached the Russian capital, touching the family of a Kremlin ally near one of Moscow\u2019s most exclusive districts. Location map Kyiv strongly denied the allegations. \u201cUkraine has absolutely nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state like Russia, or a terrorist one at that,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in remarks broadcast on television. The blast occurred shortly after Dugina left the \u201cTradition\u201d cultural festival at an estate where her father had given a lecture. The two were expected to leave together but instead got in different cars, a friend said. Five minutes later, a bomb exploded in the car Dugina was driving, killing her immediately. Witnesses said debris was thrown all over the road as the car was engulfed in flames before crashing into a fence. Investigators believed the bombing was \u201cpremeditated and of a contract nature,\u201d said Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the investigative committee, the main federal investigating authority in Russia.

Photograph: Investigative committee Of Russia\/Reuters Andrey Krasnov, a friend of Dugina and the head of the Russian Horizon social movement, confirmed the reports, according to the news agency Tass . He said the bomb could have been intended for her father. \u201cThis was the father\u2019s vehicle. Darya was driving another car but she took his car today, while Alexander went in a different way. He returned, he was at the site of the tragedy. As far as I understand, Alexander or probably they together were the target,\u201d Krasnov said. \u2018Key to white survival\u2019: how Putin has morphed into a far-right savior Read more However, the independent Russian news agency Agentstvo reported that leaked government databases showed the car was registered to Darya and not her father.

They said they were considering \u201call versions\u201d when it came to working out who was responsible. View image in fullscreen Alexander Dugin. Photograph: Francesca Ebel\/AP Dugin is known for developing an extreme rightwing view of Russia\u2019s place in the world. He has been described as a \u201cRussian fascist\u201d and is a well-known conspiracy theorist. Some claim he helped shape the Russian president\u2019s expansionist foreign policy. But the influence of Dugin over Putin remains a subject for speculation, with many insiders saying his sway on the Kremlin was minimal. The Kremlin through state media nonetheless found uses for Dugin, sometimes adopting his aggressive ideology, while at other times using him to discredit calls for a more aggressive nationalism in politics. Undeniably, however, his worldview of a clash of civilisations and his rejection of Ukrainian statehood appear to have gone mainstream in Russia, even if Dugin is still viewed as a man on the distant fringes of power. Dugin and his daughter had been sanctioned by the UK and US for acting to destabilise Ukraine. In its filing, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation called Dugina a \u201cfrequent and high-profile contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platforms\u201d. The US Treasury sanctioned her as the chief editor for the website United World International, which it claimed was owned by the Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin.

( Reuters: Maxim Zmeyev ) abc.net.au\/news\/vladimir-putin-signs-law-against-lgbt-expression\/101736890 Link copied Share Share article Vladimir Putin has signed a law expanding restrictions on the promotion of what it calls \"LGBT propaganda\", effectively outlawing any public expression of LGBT behaviour or lifestyle in Russia. Under the new law,\u00a0 Russia has\u00a0widened\u00a0its interpretation of what qualifies as \"LGBT propaganda\". This means that any action or the spreading of any information that is considered an attempt to promote homosexuality in public, online, or in films, books or advertising, could incur a heavy fine. The law expands Russia's previous law against LGBT propaganda that had banned the \"demonstration\" of LGBT behaviour to children. It comes as the Kremlin exerts increased pressure on minority groups and opponents of the Russian president at home, quashing independent media groups and further stifling free speech as Moscow ramps up a decade-long campaign to promote what it says are \"traditional\" values. Authorities have already used the existing law to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists. Rights groups say the new law is intended to drive so-called \"non-traditional\" LGBT lifestyles practised by lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people out of public life altogether.
