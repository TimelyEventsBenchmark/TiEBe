The decadeslong conflict in eastern Congo has produced one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, with over 100 armed groups fighting for control of the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Many groups are accused of carrying out mass killings, rapes and other human rights violations. The violence has displaced about 7 million people, many beyond the reach of aid. The town of Rubaya holds deposits of tantalum, which is extracted from coltan, a key component in the production of smartphones.

Rwanda\u2019s Foreign Ministry in a statement spoke of threats to Rwandan national security stemming from the presence in Congo of an armed group whose members include alleged perpetrators of the 1994 genocide. The rebel group, known by its initials FDLR, \u201cis fully integrated into\u201d the Congolese army, the statement said. Although Rwanda has long cited a threat posed by FLDR, authorities there had never admitted to a military presence in eastern Congo, whose authorities accuse the tiny central African country of actively supporting the violent armed group known as M23. The U.S. State Department in a statement Saturday criticized the worsening violence caused by M23, describing it as a \u201cRwanda-backed\u201d armed group. That statement also urged Rwanda \u201cto immediately withdraw all Rwanda Defense Force personnel from the (Congo) and remove its surface-to-air missile systems.\u201d The U.S. statement represented \u201can abrupt shift in policy, or simply a lack of internal coordination,\u201d causing Rwanda to \u201cquestion the ability of the United States to serve as a credible mediator\u201d in Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region, the Rwandan Foreign Ministry said.

M23\u2019s rebellion has caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Congo\u2019s North Kivu\u2019s province in recent years. Fighting near Goma, the region\u2019s largest city, has intensified in recent days as the rebels threatened to take over the metropolis. Residents of the nearby town of Sake have been fleeing fierce fighting between Congolese government troops and the group. Many M23 fighters, including Congolese Tutsis, were once members of Congo\u2019s army. M23 is one of more than 100 armed groups active in eastern Congo, seeking a share of the region\u2019s gold and other resources as they carry out mass killings . The rebel group rose to prominence just over a decade ago when its fighters seized Goma, which borders Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal it accuses the Congo government of not implementing.

Rebel fighters affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) have killed at least 38 people in an overnight attack on a village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) , officials and a civil society leader in the region have said. The armed men used guns and machetes to attack residents of villages in Beni territory, in North Kivu province, overnight on Friday, local official Fabien Kakule said. District official Leon Kakule Siviwe said that the recent surge in violence was due to the attackers taking advantage of a small security presence. Local civil society leader Justin Kavalami blamed members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) for the attack. The ADF, which is also accused of being behind another village assault that killed at least 16 people earlier this week, was originally based in neighbouring Uganda. After spreading to the eastern DRC, it pledged allegiance to ISIL in 2018 and has mounted frequent attacks, further destabilising a region where many armed groups are active. The ADF has killed more than 50 people in the war-torn region of the DRC this week, local officials said. Since the end of 2021, the Congolese and Ugandan armies have conducted joint operations against the ADF in North Kivu and neighbouring Ituri, but have so far failed to stop the deadly attacks on civilians. The eastern DRC has been plagued by violence by armed groups for decades, with both the government and foreign actors providing belligerents with weapons. The Rwandan-backed M23 (March 23 Movement) resumed its armed campaign in the region at the end of 2021, seizing swaths of territory in North Kivu, as intensified fighting continues to displace tens of thousands of people. About 6.9 million people across the DRC were displaced by the end of last year, mostly in the eastern provinces. Since an escalation of hostilities in March 2022, more than 1.6 million people have been driven from their homes in North Kivu in the east of the country.

The Rwanda Defense Force said in a statement it also arrested two Congolese soldiers who had been with the one killed. It said they crossed the border at Isangano village in Rubavu district, near the Congolese city of Goma in eastern Congo. A local farmer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals, told The Associated Press the Congolese soldiers appeared to have crossed into Rwanda unknowingly, as some border markings can be difficult to see. Congo\u2019s military said in a statement that its soldiers were on patrol and inadvertently crossed into Rwandan territory, which is a common occurrence, but this time they were shot at instead of being repatriated.

For months, Congo\u2019s government has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 armed rebel group that\u2019s been active in eastern Congo, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. Rwanda has repeatedly denied the claim. In March last year, the Rwandan army shot dead a soldier from Congo whom it alleged had crossed the border and shot at Rwanda Defense Force soldiers in Rubavu district. The incident led to an exchange of fire between soldiers from the two countries but no further casualties were reported, the force said. Congo\u2019s President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi , while campaigning for his reelection last month, alleged that Kagame was behaving like \u201cHitler,\u201d which Rwanda\u2019s government described as \u201ca loud and clear threat.\u201d Relations between Rwanda and Congo have been fraught for decades. Rwanda alleges that Congo gave refuge to ethnic Hutus who carried out the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed at least 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. In the late 1990s, Rwanda twice sent its forces into Congo. The Rwandan forces were widely accused of hunting down and killing ethnic Hutu, even civilians. Rwanda denies it. Tshisekedi has long accused Kagame and Rwanda of providing military support to M23, the latest iteration of Congolese Tutsi fighters to seize towns in parts of mineral-rich North Kivu. The U.N. and human rights groups accuse M23 of atrocities ranging from rape to mass killings and say it receives backing from Rwanda. Rwanda denies any ties with the rebels.

In all these villages, people's belongings were taken, houses were burnt down,\" said Vital Tungulo, president of Djugu's Nyali-Kilo community. The motive for the attacks was not clear but militia violence in Congo is linked to long-running competition for influence and the region's rich mineral resources. The human rights situation in Ituri has deteriorated since the beginning of the year as CODECO carries out more attacks, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) said in a report published in March. The army spokesperon in Ituri, Jules Ngongo Tshikudi, confirmed the attacks, describing them as unacceptable. CODECO and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), another militia, are responsible for most civilian killings in eastern DRC, according to a report by the U.N. peacekeeping mission released in March.

{"year":"2024","month":"07","event_desc":"3 July  A court-martial in Butembo sentences 25 soldiers to death for desertion during fighting with M23 rebels.","text":"Military court in Butembo set up as part of crackdown on soldiers fleeing M23 rebels as fighting rages in the east. Twenty-five soldiers accused of fleeing fighting against M23 rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been sentenced to death. The Butembo military court in North Kivu province handed the sentences down on Wednesday, deeming them guilty of fleeing the enemy, dissipation of war munitions and violation of orders. \u201cI find them guilty and sentence each of them to death,\u201d said Colonel Kabeya Ya Hanu, president of the military court. The tribunal was set up close to the scene of recent clashes between the Congolese army and M23 fighters with the aim of discouraging soldiers from fleeing the front line. A total of 31 defendants, including 27 soldiers and four of their civilian wives, appeared before the military court during the one-day trial, said Jules Muvweko, one of the defence lawyers. The four women were acquitted while one soldier was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 jail for robbery. The verdict for the last soldier was unclear. In early May, eight Congolese soldiers, including five officers, were sentenced to death in Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, for \u201ccowardice\u201d and \u201cfleeing the enemy\u201d. Moise Hangi, a human rights activist, noted DRC\u2019s government only recently lifted a moratorium on the death penalty that was in place since 2003. \u201cWe are in danger of reaching the point where many military personnel are going to be candidates for this decision, rather than improving our security apparatus. This kind of decision will increasingly weaken our military and give more fear to those on all the front lines,\u201d Hangi said. Last week, M23 \u2013 the March 23 movement, which the United Nations claims is backed by Rwanda \u2013 seized several towns on the northern front of the conflict. Rwanda denies any involvement. Its recent gains include the strategic town of Kanyabayonga, which is seen as a gateway to the major commercial centres of Butembo and Beni. Faced with the combined might of the Rwandan army and M23, Congolese troops have repeatedly retreated without a fight, news reports say. \u201cMany units have less than half the number of soldiers they are supposed to have due to desertions and casualties,\u201d said Jason Stearns, a former UN investigator who now runs the Congo Research Group at New York University. \u201cAbove all, there is a lack of accountability and morale.\u201d    M23 has seized vast swaths of territory, almost completely encircling Goma, and killed scores of people. There are already 2.8 million displaced people in North Kivu, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). DR Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east has been racked by fighting between both local and foreign-based armed groups for the past three decades, the conflict having spilled over from the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. Last March, the Congolese government lifted the moratorium on the death penalty that had been in force since 2003 in the country. Successive Congolese governments and UN peacekeeping missions have struggled to quell violence in the east, where more than 100 armed groups are fighting over land and minerals, including rich deposits of gold and coltan, essential for making mobile phones. Some have received backing from DRC\u2019s eastern neighbours, which have a history of intervening in the region. The eight officers convicted at a well-publicised court martial in May stared blankly as a colonel in a black beret declared them guilty of cowardice for abandoning their posts. Defence lawyer Alexis Olenga rejected the charge, saying the battalion commander, Colonel Patient Mushengezi, was being treated in Goma for high blood pressure at the time, while his men left to replenish their ammunition when another unit failed to deliver the supplies. A growing number of arrests is spreading fear and distrust in the military, army officers told Reuters news agency. \u201cEven our greatest fighters have been put in prison for mere rumours,\u201d an unnamed military intelligence officer was quoted as saying. \u201cEvery officer who comes in is afraid.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","question":"How many soldiers were sentenced to death by the Butembo military court in July 2024 for desertion during fighting with M23 rebels?","answer":"Twenty-five soldiers were sentenced to death.","region":"the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","model_answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide real-time or future information.

Share M23 seizes town in east DR Congo as rebels gaining ground share Print Kanyabayonga, DR Congo \u2014 The M23 militia group has seized another town in the war-torn east of DR Congo, as the rebels gain more ground, sources told AFP Sunday. Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of backing the Tutsi-led M23 rebel group which has seized swathes of eastern DR Congo in an ongoing offensive launched in 2021 \u2014 something Kigali denies. On Sunday the M23 (March 23 Movement) moved into the town of Kirumba, in North Kivu province, which has been rocked by violence since 2021 when the group resumed its armed campaign in the region. Kirumba is the biggest town in the south of the Lubero territory, where the group has been advancing, and a big commercial center with more than 120,000 residents. \"We regret that the large entity (the town) has since yesterday evening been in the hands of the M23,\" a local official, who did not wish to be named, told AFP Sunday. He said the group was now heading north from the town. \"They are numerous, some arrived on foot and others in vehicles,\" a civil society leader, who asked to remain unnamed, told AFP. During a meeting with residents Sunday the M23 said, \"they are going to Butembo and Beni, then to Kinshasa (DRC capital),\" a participant told AFP over the telephone. \"Go tell the population of Butembo that we are on route (there), we will arrive everywhere,\" M23 General Gaceri Justin said during the meeting, according to a recording heard by AFP. Strategic town On Saturday M23 seized the strategic town of Kanyabayonga, as other surrounding areas also fell into the hands of the rebels. Kanyabayonga is home to more than 60,000 people and tens of thousands of people have fled there in recent months, driven from their homes by the advance of the rebels. The town is considered a pathway to Butembo and Beni in the north, strongholds of the Nande tribe and major commercial centers. It is in the Lubero territory, the fourth territory in the North Kivu province that the group has entered after Rutshuru, Nyiragongo and Masisi. Other towns near Kanyabayonga have also been seized by M23, according to officials and security sources. Five people including three civilians and two soldiers were killed in the town of Kayna where the rebels took control Saturday, Console Sindani, vice president of Kayna civil society, told AFP Sunday. The mayor of the commune of Kayna, Clovis Kanyauru, told AFP on Sunday there had been three deaths. President Felix Tshisekedi held a meeting of DR Congo's defense council Saturday. During a speech to mark the country's Independence Day, Tshisekedi said \"clear and firm instructions have been given for the safeguarding of the territorial integrity of our country,\" without giving more details.

The motive for the attacks was not clear but militia violence in Congo is linked to long-running competition for influence and the region's rich mineral resources. The human rights situation in Ituri has deteriorated since the beginning of the year as CODECO carries out more attacks, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) said in a report published in March. The army spokesperon in Ituri, Jules Ngongo Tshikudi, confirmed the attacks, describing them as unacceptable. CODECO and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), another militia, are responsible for most civilian killings in eastern DRC, according to a report by the U.N. peacekeeping mission released in March.

The aid workers were killed on Sunday after their convoy had arrived in Butembo city in North Kivu province, where armed rebels have been fighting Congolese security forces, the organization said in a statement late Monday. It wasn't immediately clear which group was behind the attack. More than 120 armed groups in eastern Congo have been carrying out attacks, often involving bombs targeting residents, as they seek a share of the region's gold and other resources. More than 170 such security incidents have targeted humanitarian workers, causing at least four deaths and the abduction of more than a dozen people, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Congo said Tuesday in a statement that called for the protection of aid workers. \"At a time of immense humanitarian need, it is unacceptable that those working to help affected people are being attacked and killed,\" said Bruno Lemarquis, the humanitarian coordinator for Congo. Violence in the province has worsened in recent months as security forces battle the rebels. Two people were killed last week in the region when mortar shelling targeted a base operated by South Africa's military, which is part of a regional peacekeeping mission. The rebels have also taken over more villages in recent weeks.

Uganda denied involvement, saying it is cooperating closely with the Congolese government forces. The U.N. has long accused Rwanda of backing the M23, which has repeatedly seized large parts of mineral-rich eastern Congo, allegations Rwanda denied. Sign up here. Congo has been riven by conflict for decades. Uganda and Rwanda invaded in 1996 and 1998 for what they said was defence against local militia groups. Uganda is still conducting joint operations with Congolese troops against a rebel Ugandan group. The Tutsi-led M23 rebels have been waging a fresh insurgency in Congo's militia-plagued east since 2022. Ugandan troops were part of a regional force deployed in November 2022 to monitor a ceasefire with the M23. Congolese authorities called for the force to withdraw last year, saying it was ineffective. \"Since the resurgence of the M23 crisis, Uganda has not prevented the presence of M23 and Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) troops on its territory or passage through it,\" the U.N. Security Council's Group of Experts said in the report, which was sent to the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee at the end of April and then to members of the Security Council in June. The U.N. group also said it had obtained evidence confirming active support for M23 by officials from the military and military intelligence, with M23 leaders, including the sanctioned Sultani Makenga, travelling to Uganda for meetings. Contacted by Reuters, deputy spokesman for Uganda's armed forces, Deo Akiiki, said such reports falsely accuse the east African country's army when its relationship with the Congolese forces (FARDC) is at its best. \"It would be mad for us to destabilise the same area we are sacrificing it all to have it stable,\" Akiiki said. The U.N. report said some 3,000-4,000 Rwandan soldiers were fighting the Congolese army alongside the M23. The Rwandan army's \"de facto control and direction over M23 operations also renders Rwanda liable for the actions of M23\", the experts said. In response, Rwanda said Congo was financing and fighting alongside a Hutu rebel group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), that has attacked Tutsis in both countries. \"The DRC has all the power to deescalate the situation if they want to, but until then Rwanda will continue to defend itself,\" Rwanda government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told Reuters.

Gospel singer and pastor Mike Kalambay was performing at the 80,000-seater Martyrs Stadium in the capital, Kinshasa, but photos taken at the event show scenes of overcrowding. A 10-year-old child is among those who died, according to local media. The governor of Kinshasa, Daniel Bumba, has released a statement blaming \"excesses and crowd movements\" for the disaster. DR Congo's justice minister has ordered an investigation , and the questioning of the police officers who were present at the time and the event organiser Maajabu Gospel. In a statement released after Saturday's concert, Maajabu Gospel said it was deeply saddened to learn of the deaths. It blamed \"troublemakers\", and said there were 2,000 police officers at the event who had tried to pacify them. The organisers also insisted there were about 30,000 people at the concert - much less than the venue's maximum capacity. The stadium, which is a major landmark and said to be one of the biggest in Africa, is now closed until further notice. It regularly plays host to some of the biggest names in music, various football matches, and was also the venue for President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi's swearing-in ceremony. Following Saturday's chaos, Kinshasa city authorities have asked police to strengthen security measures and told event organisers to adhere to safety regulations. Incidents like these are not uncommon at large-scale events in DR Congo. In 2022, a stadium crush at the same venue during a concert by Congolese star Fally Ipupa left 11 people dead.

Saturday\u2019s attack took place in the village of Kinsele, around 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kinshasa, the capital. Because of insecurity and poor infrastructure in the region, attacks can take days to be reported. Kinsele is in the Kwamouth territory, where conflict has raged for two years between the Teke and Yaka communities, leading to hundreds of civilian deaths. The attackers were with the Mobondo militia, a group presenting itself as defenders of the Yaka people. \u201cThe search continues to find other bodies in the bush,\u201d David Bisaka, the provincial deputy for the Kwamouth territory, told The Associated Press in a phone interview.

Mining activities are suspended until further notice because of \u201cthe disorder caused by mining operators,\u201d Gov. Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki said in a statement, without providing further details. The statement said the aim of the decision was to \u201crestore order to mining throughout the Province and to preserve not only human lives, but also the traceability of mineral production in these sites.\u201d The local authorities gave 72 hours to \u201call mining companies, businesses and cooperatives to leave the sites and places of exploitation,\u201d the statement added. It was difficult to immediately assess whether the decision would be respected, as certain mining areas are under the control or influence of armed groups. It was also difficult to immediately assess the impact of this decision at the economic level. Thousands of residents of this gold- and coltan-rich province depend directly or indirectly on mining. Many Chinese companies mine gold and other minerals in South Kivu, one of the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that have been plagued by violence from armed groups for nearly three decades.

He justified the decision as protecting \u201cthe interests of the local population and the environment\u201d. But following political pressure, the measure was subsequently lifted. A parliamentary commission of inquiry was launched, but its conclusions were never published. At the time, the government said it was working to secure better terms on a $6.2 billion mining contract with China, which authorities say has not been profitable enough for the Central African nation since the deal was signed in 2008.

He did not provide any evidence to support his claim. Tshisekedi\u2019s accusation follows the U.S. announcement of sanctions against the AFC last month. Washington accused the alliance of seeking to overthrow Congo\u2019s government and fueling conflict in the east of the country. It said the main member of the alliance, the renowned rebel group M23, is already under U.S. sanctions. Tshisekedi, along with U.S. and U.N. experts, accuse neighboring Rwanda of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February it effectively admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

The officers arrived via the Ishasha border crossing in Kanungu district in southwestern Uganda, Major Kiconco Tabaro, a regional spokesperson for the Uganda People's Defence Forces, said. Sign up here. The 98 officers arrived with 43 guns and ammunition and were subsequently disarmed. \"They were fleeing fighting by M23 and other militias and the Congo military, there's a lot of violence there and then there's also hunger,\" Tabaro said. Over the past four days at least 2,500 more Congolese refugees have arrived in Uganda fleeing the raging violence across the border, he said. \"The main push factor is the intensifying violence and insecurity,\" Tabaro said, adding that pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and young children were among the refugees. The M23 has been waging a fresh insurgency in Congo's militia-plagued east since 2022. A United Nations report seen by Reuters last month said the Ugandan army has provided support to the Tutsi-led rebel group, a charge Uganda denies. The U.N. has long accused Uganda's neighbour Rwanda of backing the M23, which has repeatedly seized large parts of mineral-rich eastern Congo, allegations Rwanda denied. Efforts by Congo's military to push back the rebels have intensified over the past year with the use of drones and aircraft, although the rebels have still expanded territory under their control. In June, the M23 seized the town of Kanyabayonga , whose location on high ground makes it a coveted gateway to other parts of eastern Congo's North Kivu province. Fighting in North Kivu has driven more than 1.7 million people from their homes, taking the total number of Congolese displaced by multiple conflicts to a record 7.2 million, according to U.N. estimates.

The defendants, most of them Congolese but also including a Briton, Belgian and Canadian, have five days to appeal the verdict on charges that include attempted coup, terrorism and criminal association. Fourteen people were acquitted in the trial, which opened in June. The open-air military court in the capital, Kinshasa, convicted the 37 defendants and imposed \u201cthe harshest penalty, that of death\u201d in the verdict delivered in French by presiding judge Maj. Freddy Ehuma. The three Americans, wearing blue and yellow prison clothes and sitting in plastic chairs, appeared stoic as a translator explained their sentence. Richard Bondo, the lawyer who defended the six foreigners, disputed whether the death penalty could currently be imposed in Congo, despite its reinstatement earlier this year , and said his clients had inadequate interpreters during the investigation of the case. \u201cWe will challenge this decision on appeal,\u201d Bondo said. The coup attempt Six people were killed during the botched coup attempt led by the little-known opposition figure Christian Malanga in May that targeted the presidential palace and a close ally of President Felix Tshisekedi . Malanga was fatally shot while resisting arrest soon after live-streaming the attack on his social media, the Congolese army said. Malanga\u2019s 21-year-old son Marcel Malanga, who is a U.S. citizen, and two other Americans were convicted in the coup attempt. He told the court that his father had forced him and his high school friend to take part in the attack. \u201cDad had threatened to kill us if we did not follow his orders,\u201d Marcel Malanga said. Other members of the ragtag militia recounted similar threats from the elder Malanga, and some described being duped into believing they were working for a volunteer organization. Marcel\u2019s mother, Brittney Sawyer, maintains that her son is innocent and was simply following his father, who considered himself president of a shadow government in exile. In the months since her son\u2019s arrest, Sawyer has focused her energy on fundraising to send him money for food, hygiene products and a bed. He has been sleeping on the floor of his cell at the Ndolo military prison and is suffering from a liver disease, she said. The other Americans are Tyler Thompson Jr. , 21, who flew to Africa from Utah with the younger Malanga for what his family believed was a free vacation , and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company. The company was set up in Mozambique in 2022, according to an official journal published by Mozambique\u2019s government, and a report by the Africa Intelligence newsletter. Reactions in the US U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington on Friday that the federal government was aware of the verdict. The department has not declared the three Americans wrongfully detained, making it unlikely that U.S. officials would try to negotiate their return. \u201cWe understand that the legal process in the DRC allows for defendants to appeal the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEmbassy staff have been attending these proceedings as they\u2019ve gone through the process. We continue to attend the proceedings and follow the developments closely.\u201d Thompson had been invited on an Africa trip by the younger Malanga, his former high school football teammate in a Salt Lake City suburb. But the itinerary might have included more than sightseeing.

A provisional assessment showed that 24 inmates were shot dead by \"warning\" gunshots as they tried to escape from the overcrowded Makala Central Prison in Kinshasa early Monday, Congolese Interior Minister Jacquemin Shabani said on the social platform X. \"There are also 59 injured people taken into care by the government, as well as some cases of women raped,\" he said, adding that order has been restored at the prison, part of which was burned in the attack. Prison capacity Makala, Congo's largest penitentiary with a capacity for 1,500 people, holds over 12,000 inmates, most of whom are awaiting trial, Amnesty International said in its latest country report. The facility has recorded previous jailbreaks, including in 2017 when an attack by a religious sect freed dozens. Gunfire inside the prison started around midnight on Sunday into Monday morning, residents said. A senior government official earlier said only two deaths were confirmed during the incident, a figure disputed by rights activists. Videos that appeared to be from the prison showed bodies lying on the ground, many of them with visible injuries. Another video showed inmates carrying people who appeared to be dead into a vehicle. No alert There were no signs of forced entry into the prison, which is located in the city centre, 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the presidential palace. The attempted escape was plotted from inside the prison by inmates in one of the wings, Mbemba Kabuya, the deputy justice minister, told the local Top Congo FM radio. In the hours that followed the attack, the road to the prison was cordoned off while authorities convened a panel to investigate the incident. Makala \u2014 among other prisons in Congo \u2014 is so overcrowded that people often die from starvation, activists say. Scores of inmates have been released this year as part of efforts to decongest the prisons. Justice Minister Constant Mutamba called the attack a \"premeditated act of sabotage,\" adding that those who \"instigated these acts of sabotage ... will receive a stern response.\" He also announced a ban on transferring inmates from the prison and said authorities would build a new prison, among other efforts to reduce overcrowding.

A frantic search and rescue operation was underway hours later as many remained unaccounted for from the vessel, believed to have had 278 people on board. Jean-Jacques Purusi, the governor of the South Kivu province, said the death toll was provisional and that the number of fatalities could rise further. He said that according to the information that local authorities had, there were 278 people on board. The boat set off from the port of Minova, in South Kivu province, earlier in the day and was en route to Goma, in North Kivu province, Purusi said, speaking over the phone. \u201cWe do not yet have (the full picture of) the whole situation but we will have it by tomorrow,\u201d he told The Associated Press. The boat sank while trying to dock just meters (yards) away from the port of Kituku, according to witnesses who said they saw rescue services recover at least 50 bodies from the water. It was the latest deadly boat accident in the central African country, where overcrowding on vessels is often to blame. Maritime regulations also are often not followed.

But in remote areas where most passengers come from, many are unable to afford public transport for the few available roads. \u201cWe will establish responsibilities and put in place a sanctions regime but also recommendations to improve navigation on the lake,\u201d Purusi told the AP. He added that a lack of adequate equipment \u2014 there were no life jackets on the vessel \u2014 likely contributed to the tragedy, as did the overcrowding and negligence. Also, there had been a strong storm in the morning in the area of the lake, he added. In June, an overloaded boat sank near the capital of Kinshasa and 80 passengers lost their lives. In January, 22 people died on Lake Ma\u00ee-Ndombe and in April 2023, six were killed and 64 went missing on Lake Kivu. Witnesses of the Thursday tragedy said the boat was visibly overcrowded. \u201cI was at the port of Kituku when I saw the boat arriving from Minova, full of passengers,\u201d Francine Munyi told the AP. \u201cIt started to lose its balance and sank into the lake.

Since the fighting between the armed forces and the M23 rebels made the road between the cities of Goma and Minova impassable, forcing the closure of the passage to trucks transporting food, many traders have resorted to maritime transport on Lake Kivu. It\u2019s an alternative considered safer than road traffic, which is threatened by insecurity. But according to Elia Asumani, a shipping agent who works on this line, the situation has become dangerous: \u201cWe are afraid,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cThis shipwreck was predictable.\u201d Bienfait Sematumba, 27, said he lost four family members. \u201cThey are all dead.

The defendants, most of them Congolese but also including a Briton, Belgian and Canadian, have five days to appeal the verdict on charges that include attempted coup, terrorism and criminal association. Fourteen people were acquitted in the trial, which opened in June. The open-air military court in the capital, Kinshasa, convicted the 37 defendants and imposed \u201cthe harshest penalty, that of death\u201d in the verdict delivered in French by presiding judge Maj. Freddy Ehuma. The three Americans, wearing blue and yellow prison clothes and sitting in plastic chairs, appeared stoic as a translator explained their sentence. Richard Bondo, the lawyer who defended the six foreigners, disputed whether the death penalty could currently be imposed in Congo, despite its reinstatement earlier this year , and said his clients had inadequate interpreters during the investigation of the case. \u201cWe will challenge this decision on appeal,\u201d Bondo said. The coup attempt Six people were killed during the botched coup attempt led by the little-known opposition figure Christian Malanga in May that targeted the presidential palace and a close ally of President Felix Tshisekedi . Malanga was fatally shot while resisting arrest soon after live-streaming the attack on his social media, the Congolese army said. Malanga\u2019s 21-year-old son Marcel Malanga, who is a U.S. citizen, and two other Americans were convicted in the coup attempt. He told the court that his father had forced him and his high school friend to take part in the attack. \u201cDad had threatened to kill us if we did not follow his orders,\u201d Marcel Malanga said. Other members of the ragtag militia recounted similar threats from the elder Malanga, and some described being duped into believing they were working for a volunteer organization. Marcel\u2019s mother, Brittney Sawyer, maintains that her son is innocent and was simply following his father, who considered himself president of a shadow government in exile. In the months since her son\u2019s arrest, Sawyer has focused her energy on fundraising to send him money for food, hygiene products and a bed. He has been sleeping on the floor of his cell at the Ndolo military prison and is suffering from a liver disease, she said. The other Americans are Tyler Thompson Jr. , 21, who flew to Africa from Utah with the younger Malanga for what his family believed was a free vacation , and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company. The company was set up in Mozambique in 2022, according to an official journal published by Mozambique\u2019s government, and a report by the Africa Intelligence newsletter. Reactions in the US U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington on Friday that the federal government was aware of the verdict. The department has not declared the three Americans wrongfully detained, making it unlikely that U.S. officials would try to negotiate their return. \u201cWe understand that the legal process in the DRC allows for defendants to appeal the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEmbassy staff have been attending these proceedings as they\u2019ve gone through the process. We continue to attend the proceedings and follow the developments closely.\u201d Thompson had been invited on an Africa trip by the younger Malanga, his former high school football teammate in a Salt Lake City suburb. But the itinerary might have included more than sightseeing. Other teammates alleged that Marcel had offered up to $100,000 to join him on a \u201csecurity job\u201d in Congo, and they said he seemed desperate to bring along an American friend. Thompson\u2019s family maintains he had no knowledge of the elder Malanga\u2019s intentions, no plans for political activism and didn\u2019t even plan to enter Congo. He and the Malangas were meant to travel only to South Africa and Eswatini, his stepmother, Miranda Thompson, told The Associated Press. The Thompsons\u2019 lawyer in Utah, Skye Lazaro, said the family is heartbroken over the verdict. \u201cWe urge all who have supported Tyler and the family throughout this process to write to your congressmen and request their assistance in bringing him home,\u201d Lazaro said. Utah\u2019s U.S. Sens.

Twenty people have been rescued so far. The sinking of the ferry late Friday came less than four days after another boat capsized in the country\u2019s northeast, killing 25 people. The ferry was traveling as part of a convoy of other vessels and the passengers were primarily merchants returning home for Christmas, said Joseph Joseph Kangolingoli, the mayor of Ingende, the last town on the river before the site of the accident. According to Ingende resident Ndolo Kaddy, the ferry contained \u201cmore than 400 people because it made two ports, Ingende and Loolo, on the way to Boende, so there is reason to believe there were more deaths.\u201d Congolese officials have often warned against overloading boats and vowed to punish those violating safety measures on rivers. However, in remote areas many people cannot afford public transportation on the few available roads. At least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country\u2019s east while 80 lost their lives in a similar accident near Kinshasa in June.

The military governor of North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has died from injuries sustained during fighting on the front line, local authorities say, as M23 rebel fighters close in on the provincial capital, Goma. The circumstances around the death of Major General Peter Cirimwami were unclear, but Cirimwami, who led army operations in restive North Kivu in the eastern DRC, visited troops on the front line in Kasengezi, about 13km (8 miles) from Goma, on Thursday, the day of his death. His death was confirmed by a government source, a military source and a United Nations source on Friday, all of whom spoke to the media on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak about the matter publicly. M23 has made significant territorial gains in recent weeks, encircling Goma, which has a population of about 2 million people and is a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. On Thursday, panic spread in Goma as rebels took control of Sake, a town 27km (16 miles) northwest of the provincial capital and on a road that is one of the last main routes into the city still under government control, according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The UN warned that the raging conflict in North Kivu had displaced more than 400,000 people this year and could spark a regional war. \u201cThe number of displacements is now over 400,000 people this year alone, almost double the number reported last week,\u201d Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesman for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said at a news briefing in Geneva on Friday. Saltmarsh said the UNHCR is \u201cgravely concerned about the safety and security of civilians and internally displaced people\u201d in the east of the country. \u201cHeavy bombardments caused families from at least nine displacement sites on the periphery of Goma to flee into the city to seek safety and shelter,\u201d he said, adding that many were living rough. The United States, the United Kingdom and France on Friday called on their nationals to leave Goma while airports and borders are still open, issuing the advice in online statements or in messages sent directly by email or SMS. M23 has been accused of widespread atrocities, including rape. More than two million people have been forced from their homes since the conflict restarted three years ago. \u201cWe fled as a precaution because we know that when the enemy arrives in our village, they will forcibly recruit many young people,\u201d Mumulirwa Baguma Destin, a displaced resident from Mukwija, told Al Jazeera.    M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich eastern DRC along the border with Rwanda in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises. This month, M23 captured the towns of Minova, Katale and Masisi, west of Goma. M23 seized Goma in 2012 and controlled it for more than a week. The DRC, the UN and UN experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. Rwanda\u2019s government denies the claims but last year admitted that it has troops and missile systems in the eastern DRC to safeguard its security, pointing to a build-up of Congolese forces near the border. Al Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb, reporting from Nairobi in Kenya, said many people who have fled the fighting lived through M23\u2019s 2012\u00a0 offensive and are terrified of the group. \u201cWe\u2019ve met people in camps who say they don\u2019t want to live under what they see as a foreign occupation,\u201d he said.

This is the second town seized by the M23 group in as many days in the mineral-rich North Kivu province. The group has taken control of vast swathes of eastern DR Congo since 2021, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. Angola has been attempting to mediate talks between President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame. But these broke down last month. \"It is with dismay that we learn of the capture of Masisi centre by the M23,\" Alexis Bahunga, a member of North Kivu provincial assembly, told the AFP news agency. He said this \"plunges the territory into a serious humanitarian crisis\" and urged the government to strengthen the capacity of the army in the region. One resident told AFP that the M23 had held a meeting of the town's inhabitants, saying they had \"come to liberate the country\". The Congolese authorities have not yet commented on the loss of the town. It is not clear how many people were killed in the fighting between the M23 and the army and pro-government militias. The town was reported to be quiet on Sunday. Chinese nationals arrested with gold bars and $800,000 cash in DR Congo Masisi, which has a population of about 40,000, is the capital of the territory of the same name. It is about 80km (50 miles) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, which the M23 briefly occupied in 2012. On Friday, the M23 captured the nearby town of Katale. Last year, there were fears that the M23 would once again march on Goma , a city of about two million people. However, there was then a lull in fighting until early December when fighting resumed. In July, Rwanda did not deny a UN report saying it had about 4,000 soldiers fighting alongside the M23 in DR Congo. It accused the Congolese government of not doing enough to tackle decades of conflict in the east of the country. Rwanda has previously said the authorities in DR Congo were working with some of those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide against ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The M23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. However, Rwanda's critics accuse it of using the M23 to loot eastern DR Congo's minerals such as gold, cobalt and tantalum, which are used to make mobile phones and batteries for electric cars. Last month, DR Congo said it was suing Apple over the use of such \"blood minerals\", prompting the tech giant to say it had stopped getting supplies from both countries.

The M23 has taken control of the Goma branch of state broadcaster RTNC, according to the UN-sponsored Radio Okapi. One Goma resident, Lucie, told AFP she was hiding in her bed because she was terrified. \"We can hear the shooting outside our homes. We cannot leave.\" AFP has reported that at least 17 people have been killed in the fighting and over 300 injured. This swift advance comes hours after DR Congo's foreign minister accused neighbouring Rwanda of declaring war by sending its troops over the border to support the M23. Rwanda does not deny backing the M23 but accuses the Congolese authorities of supporting militias trying to topple the government in Kigali. Kenya's President William Ruto, the current chair of the East African Community, has called for a ceasefire, and announced that the presidents of both the DR Congo and Rwanda will attend an emergency regional summit on Wednesday. As it happened: The day's events as they unfolded What's the fighting in DR Congo all about? President Ruto said it was incumbent on regional leaders to help facilitate a peaceful solution to the conflict. Amid the escalating clashes in Goma, Rwanda has also been hit. Five civilians had been killed and 25 seriously injured in the town of Gisenyi, just across the border from Goma, a Rwandan military spokesperson told the AFP news agency. The M23 group has taken control of vast parts of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo since 2021. In the past few weeks, the group has been advancing swiftly on Goma amid intense fighting. Since the start of 2025 more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes in the provinces of North and South Kivu, according to the UN's refugee agency. One woman, Alice Feza, said she was at a loss about  what to do next, as this was the fourth time she had had to run away from the M23 advance. \"People are fleeing everywhere, and we don't know where to go any more, because we started fleeing a long time ago,\" Ms Feza said, adding: \"The war catches us here among the host families, now we have nowhere to go.\" Key roads surrounding Goma are blocked and the city's airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts, the UN has said. Following the M23 claims that it had seized the city, the government said its forces were still controlling strategic areas, including the airport. \"Contrary to the manipulative messages circulating on social networks the FARDC [the DR Congo army] hold the Goma airport... and all the strategic points of the capital of the North Kivu Province,\" it said in a statement early on Monday morning. It added that the army was \"more than determined to defend the homeland at the cost of the supreme sacrifice\". A resident told the Reuters news agency that there was \"confusion in the city; here near the airport, we see soldiers. I have not seen the M23 yet\", adding that there were also some cases of looting of shops. Reverend Damiri, chaplain of the HEAL Africa hospital in Goma, told the BBC that it was calm where he was, although he could hear gunshots from another side of the city. \"Goma is a large city... We still have quite a number of soldiers that have gathered together, governmental soldiers, but a big part of the city is controlled by the rebels,\" he said. There have been reports of heavy artillery hitting the centre of Goma, and of a mass escape from a prison in the city, with unverified videos being shared online appearing to show prisoners fleeing. A security source told the AFP news agency that the prison holding 3,000 inmates was \"totally torched\" and that the jailbreak had resulted in deaths. Power and water has reportedly been cut to many areas of the city. Watch: Escaped prisoners walk through the streets of Goma The rebels had ordered soldiers to surrender their weapons and imposed a 48-hour deadline that ended early on Monday. UN peacekeepers said that some Congolese soldiers had surrendered their firearms with them before the deadline. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called on Rwanda to withdraw its forces from the DR Congo's territory and on the M23 to stop its advance. This comes after 13 soldiers serving with peacekeeping forces were killed in clashes with the rebels. Both DR Congo and the UN say the M23 group is backed by Rwanda. Speaking at the Security Council meeting, Rwanda's UN representative Ernest Rwamucyo said he regretted that the international community had chosen to condemn the M23 group rather than the Congolese army, which, he said, had violated a ceasefire. On Saturday, the UN said it would be pulling all of its non-essential staff out of Goma. The M23 formed as an offshoot of another rebel group in 2012, ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in eastern DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. Rwanda has previously said the Congolese authorities were working with some of those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide, who then fled over the border to DR Congo. However, Rwanda's critics accuse it of using the M23 to loot minerals such as gold, cobalt and tantalum from eastern DR Congo.

Early Monday morning, gunfire was heard throughout the city, according to two aid workers sheltering there who were not authorized to speak to the media. In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium. The M23 rebels\u2019 offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa\u2019s longest wars and further displace civilians. According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation. Late Sunday night, U.N. peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city. RELATED COVERAGE At least 50 people killed in east Congo as government and Rwanda-backed rebels trade blame Thousands of children have been raped and sexually abused in eastern Congo, UNICEF says Congo and Rwanda-backed rebels hold high-stakes talks in Qatar in a renewed push for peace Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying that the country is \u201cin a war situation where the news is changing.\u201d Late Sunday, the U.N.\u2019s special representative for Congo told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that with the airport shut down and roads blocked in the vast region\u2019s humanitarian and security hub, \u201cwe are trapped.\u201d Congo late Saturday broke off relations with Rwanda, which has denied backing the M23 despite evidence collected by U.N. experts and others. The surge of violence has killed at least 13 peacekeepers over the past week. And Congolese were again on the run. The U.N. Security Council condemned the M23 advances in a statement late Sunday and urged the rebels to withdraw from the territory they\u2019d claimed. The M23 has made significant territorial gains along Congo\u2019s border with Rwanda in recent weeks, after months of regional attempts to make peace failed. On Sunday night, the rebels called on Congo\u2019s army to surrender their arms and present themselves at a local stadium by 3 a.m. or they would take the city. The Uruguayan army, who are in Goma serving with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said in a statement on X late Sunday that some Congolese soldiers have laid down their weapons. \u201cMore than a hundred FARDC soldiers are sheltered in the facilities of the \u201cSiempre Presente\u201d base awaiting the (Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration) process,\u201d the statement said. In photos shared with the statement, armed men are seen registering with the peacekeepers in a mix of military uniforms and civilian clothing. The U.N. special representative, Bintou Keita, told the Security Council that despite U.N. peacekeepers\u2019 support for the Congolese armed forces, M23 and Rwandan forces entered the Munigi neighborhood on Goma\u2019s outskirts, \u201ccausing mass panic.\u201d Munigi is 9 kilometers (5 miles) from the city. Keita said M23 fighters were advancing and using residents \u201cas human shields\u201d as others fled for their lives. \u201cM23 has declared the airspace over Goma closed,\u201d she added. \u201cIn other words, we are trapped.\u201d She said the U.N. was temporarily relocating nonessential personnel from the city. Congo\u2019s foreign minister, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Kayikwamba Wagner, told the Security Council that Rwanda was committing \u201ca frontal aggression, a declaration of war which no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.\u201d Rwanda\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, did not confirm or deny Congo\u2019s claims. He blamed Congo\u2019s government, saying the crisis could have been been averted if it had \u201cdemonstrated a genuine commitment to peace.\u201d The United States and France called for a ceasefire and appealed to Rwanda to withdraw its support to M23, with acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea warning that the U.S. would \u201cconsider all the tools at its disposal\u201d to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining the armed conflict. In the past 48 hours, two U.N. peacekeepers from South Africa and one from Uruguay were killed and 11 others were injured and hospitalized, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 spokesman said ahead of the Security Council meeting. The U.N. chief reiterated his \u201cstrongest condemnation\u201d of the M23 offensive \u201cwith the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces,\u201d and called on the rebel group to immediately halt all hostile action and withdraw, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Congo cuts ties with Rwanda Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It\u2019s one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises. Rwanda\u2019s government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate up to 4,000 Rwandan forces are in Congo. Congo\u2019s foreign ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling all diplomatic staff from the country \u201cwith immediate effect.\u201d Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told The Associated Press on Sunday that the decision to cut ties was a unilateral move by Congo. \u201cFor us, we took appropriate measures to evacuate our remaining diplomat in Kinshasa, who was under permanent threat by Congolese officials,\u201d Nduhungirehe said. The M23 took Goma once before in 2012, withdrawing after considerable international pressure was put on Rwanda. Yet Congo experts say it might be harder this time to talk M23 down as their motives this time are different. \u201cPreviously, they had clear demands to be integrated into (Congo\u2019s) army and have greater participation in the political process. This time around, their motivation for launching this assaults is rooted in their desire to have control of territory, specifically the North Kivu region,\u201d said Darren Davids, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. There\u2019s significant uncertainty surrounding the way forward and if there\u2019s fighting in the city it would be disastrous with significant casualties, he said. Civilians flee the rebel advance On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, a few kilometers (miles) from the front line. Scores of children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo for displaced people, near the Rwandan border. \u201cWe are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,\u201d said Safi Shangwe, who was heading into the city. Some of the displaced worried they would not be safe in Goma, either. \u201cI heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d said Ad\u00e8le Shimiye. Hundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda. Migration officers at a border crossing east of Goma carefully checked travel documents. \u201cI am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,\u201d Goma resident Muahadi Amani told the AP. U.N. deputy humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya said the situation was rapidly deteriorating. \u201cIf hostilities spill into Goma \u2013 a densely populated urban center \u2013 the impact on civilians could be devastating,\u201d she said. Congo\u2019s army has said it was fending off the M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. peacekeepers and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC. In addition to the two South African peacekeepers, seven South African troops with SAMIDIRC have been killed in recent days, South Africa\u2019s defense ministry said. Since 2021, Congo\u2019s government and allied forces \u2014 including the 14,000-strong U.N. mission \u2014 have been keeping M23 away from Goma. Goma resident Bahati Jackson\u2019s family has been hearing gunfire and remembers fleeing M23\u2019s seizure of the city in 2012. But this time, they\u2019re staying. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to die, it\u2019s better to die here,\u201d Jackson said. __ Pronczuk reported from Dakar, Senegal.

In a statement, the group - which includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels - cited \"humanitarian reasons\" for the ceasefire, after it has been capturing territory in eastern parts of the country. The UN said at least 900 people have been killed and 2,880 injured in recent fighting in and around Goma, DR Congo's largest eastern city, after it was seized by rebels. The G7 nations and the EU have condemned the offensive as a flagrant violation of DR Congo's sovereignty. The alliance of rebel groups - known as the Congo River Alliance - has accused the Congolese military of killing people using aircrafts to bomb areas it holds. It added it does not intend to seize any further territory, despite saying otherwise last week, and it will hold its positions. The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo What's the fighting in DR Congo all about? DR Congo's failed gamble on Romanian mercenaries In a statement, the alliance said: \"We reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions.\" Regional fighting has seen hundreds of thousands of people displaced over the last three years. Since the start of 2025, more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes, according to the UN's refugee agency. Rwandan President Paul Kagame - who is also commander-in-chief of the Rwanda Defence Force - said he did not know if his country's troops were in the DR Congo. \"There are many things I don't know. But if you want to ask me, is there a problem in Congo that concerns Rwanda? And that Rwanda would do anything to protect itself? I'd say 100%,\" he told CNN on Monday. Meanwhile, human rights groups have been calling for more pressure on Rwanda to back down. The DR Congo's communications minister called for the international community to impose sanctions on Rwanda. \"A strong decision (must be taken) not only to condemn, but to stop what Rwanda is doing, because it is not acceptable if you want to preserve peace in Africa and in our region,\" Patrick Muyaya told Reuters. \"Sanctions are the minimum,\" he added. The Congolese and Rwandan presidents are due to attend a regional peace summit in Tanzania on Friday. With 30 years of conflict behind them, it is expected that any negotiations if they do not break down - as they have several times in the last year - could go on for months.

Violence has surged across eastern Congo, where conflict has raged for decades. More than 120 armed groups are fighting in the region, most for land and control of mines with valuable minerals, while some are trying to protect their communities. Armed men from the CODECO militia attacked the Djaiba group of villages, which is also home to a camp for the displaced, in the province of Ituri Monday night, Antoinnette Nzale, the leader of the camp, told The Associated Press. She said 55 civilians died but added that the death toll is likely higher, as bodies continue to be retrieved from the burned down houses. The Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or CODECO, is a loose association of militia groups mainly from the ethnic Lendu farming community. The group\u2019s attacks killed nearly 1,800 people and wounded more than 500 in the four years through 2022, according to the African Center for the Study and Research on Terrorism. The United Nations has said some of the attacks could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. \u201cAlmost the entire village was attacked,\" Nzale said, adding that the U.N. peacekeeping force known as MONUSCO and Congolese government troops intervened but were overwhelmed by the more numerous attackers. Jean Richard Lenga, chief of Bahema Badjere district, where the villages are located, confirmed the attack, adding that at least 38 people were killed. He also said the death toll is likely higher as bodies continue to be retrieved. Most of the victims were displaced people who were killed with machetes and firearms, Mumbere David, a resident of Djaiba, told the AP over the phone. In September, CODECO fighters killed at least 20 civilians in Djugu, the same territory that was attacked on Monday night.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"12 February  Kasanga massacre The Allied Democratic Forces kill 70 Christians inside a church in Lubero Territory.","text":"Media inquiries: contact Melany at Melany@alarryross.com . On February 13, 2025, militants rounded up 70 Christians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), took them to a church, and then killed all 70 of them. Open Doors field sources say the violence began at about 4 a.m. on Thursday, February 13, 2025, as militants captured and tied up some 20 Christians in the community of Mayba. The militants are suspected to be members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group with ties to the Islamic State group. \"[M]ilitants went door by door saying, 'Get out, get out and don't make any noise,'\" says an elder in another town about 40 km from Mayba. \"Twenty Christian men and women came out, and they tied them up for an unknown destination.\" Mayba is predominantly Christian and is located in the North Kivu province in eastern DRC, which has also been home to fierce fighting as another rebel group has taken over territory. After the 20 were taken, the rest of the village was agitated and began to try to figure out how to free the people who had been abducted. They gathered together to develop a plan, but by the time they met, militants had surrounded their village. Open Doors sources report that the extremists captured about 50 other Christians and tied them up. All 70 captives were taken to a Protestant church in Kasanga where they were killed inside with machetes or hammers. Field sources say that even several days after the attack, some families had not been able to bury their dead because of the insecurity in the region. Many Christians have fled the area to somewhere deemed safer. \"We don't know what to do or how to pray; we've had enough of massacres,\" said an elder in a nearby church. \"May God's will alone be done.\" \"Open Doors strongly condemns this heinous act of violence against civilians and calls on civil societies, governments and international organizations to prioritize civilian protection in eastern DRC where armed groups such as the ADF are operating,\" says John Samuel*, Open Doors' legal expert for our work in sub-Saharan Africa. \"The violence takes place in a context of impunity, where almost no one is held accountable. This massacre is a clear indicator of widespread human rights violations against civilians and vulnerable communities, often targeting Christians, perpetrated by ADF\u2014an ISIS affiliate. \"We further call on the international Christian community to remain in prayer for Christians and vulnerable communities in eastern DRC,\" Samuel continues. \"Pray for an end to violence and that government at all levels will diligently, impartially and transparently address the violence and its effects.

Goma remains \u201cunder occupation\u201d by Congo\u2019s M23 rebels and the ceasefire they announced has been broken as their forces engage in heavy fighting along the main route to South Kivu\u2019s main city Bukavu, the U.N.\u2019s deputy representative in Congo, Vivian van de Perre said Wednesday. M23 rebels are now approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Bukavu, she added. The M23 rebels on Monday announced the ceasefire on humanitarian grounds after pleas for the safe passage of aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. But Congo\u2019s government has described the ceasefire as \u201cfalse communication,\u201d and the United Nations has noted reports of heavy fighting with Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region. Van de Perre said all exit routes from Goma and its airport are under control of the M23 and Rwandan military forces backing them, and movements of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as MONUSCO in the city have been restricted.

The United Nations is also \u201cgravely concerned\u201d at losing Bukavu\u2019s Kavumu airport, which is now used by Congo\u2019s military, she said. N\u00e9n\u00e9 Bintou, president of the civil society of South Kivu province, told the AP that the mining town of Nyabibwe was under the control of the M23. Nyabibwe is midway between Bukavu and Goma, the city the rebels seized last week and still control. \u201cThey have taken over Nyabibwe since this morning from 9 a.m.,\u201d said Mo\u00efse Bisimwa, a resident reached by phone. \u201cSo we are here, we are worried about the situation. Apparently, the ceasefire that was declared by the M23 is just smoke and mirrors.\u201d \u201cThe RDF\/M23 Coalition is violating the unilaterally declared ceasefire and is facing fierce resistance from the FARDC around Nyabibwe,\u201d the Congolese authorities said in a statement. The RDF stands for Rwandan Defense Forces, or Rwanda\u2019s military. \u201cThe RDF\/M23 unilateral ceasefire was nothing but a Rwandan lie. Troops crossed the great barrier of Goma at night to attack the city of Nyabibwe,\u201d the statement added. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. That\u2019s far more than in 2012 when they briefly captured Goma and then withdrew after international pressure. The M23 is the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups active in Congo\u2019s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology. Rwanda\u2019s president, Paul Kagame , told CNN on Monday that he didn\u2019t know whether Rwandan military forces were in Congo but said his country would do what\u2019s needed to protect itself. Experts and analysts have expressed concern that Rwanda aims to take control of parts of Congo to ensure access to minerals. Rwanda\u2019s government, meanwhile, has framed the conflict as the defense of ethnic Tutsis in eastern Congo from ethnic Hutu forces linked to the genocide in Rwanda three decades ago that killed some 800,000 Tutsi, moderate Hutus and others. Rwandan forces have entered Congo in the past while asserting the same aim, helping to fuel what has become one of Africa\u2019s longest-simmering wars, with millions of Congolese displaced. Neighboring Uganda also has deployed soldiers inside Congo, with hundreds in Ituri province in the northeast since 2021 to fight the Allied Democratic Forces, another armed group, with the authorization of Congo\u2019s president. Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesperson for the Ugandan military, told the AP there had been no new deployments of soldiers to Congo in recent weeks. After seizing control of Goma, a provincial capital of 2 million people at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, the rebels were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on Bukavu. The rebels on Monday said they did not intend to seize Bukavu or other areas, though they earlier expressed ambition to march on Congo\u2019s capital , Kinshasa, a thousand miles away. \u201cHowever, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,\u201d M23 rebel spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said. In Goma, where the U.N. said almost 2,000 bodies of those killed in the violence were collected by the Red Cross and 787 bodies were still in health care facilities, residents continued to bury their loved ones. \u201cWe expect this number to go up, and there\u2019s still many decomposing bodies in certain areas,\u201d said van de Perre. The situation was \u201cvery fluid.\u201d \u201cThe escalating violence has led to immense human suffering, displacement, and a growing humanitarian crisis,\u201d she said. The U.N.\u2019s humanitarian partners in Congo will be affected and suffer from the U.S. halt to aid funding, as will the International Organization for Migration, she added. Meanwhile, Congolese authorities issued an international arrest warrant on Wednesday evening against Corneille Nangaa, one of the M23 political leaders. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court also on Wednesday called for the presentation of information and evidence regarding atrocities committed in eastern Congo. \u201cThe Office will continue to investigate alleged crimes committed by any person, irrespective of affiliation or nationality and will not be limited to particular individuals, parties or members of specific groups,\u201d the statement said. ___ Kamale reported from Kinshasa, Congo, and Pronczuk from Dakar, Senegal.

The M23 rebels entered the city\u2019s Kazingu and Bagira zone and were advancing towards the center of the city of about 1.3 million people, according to Jean Samy, vice-president of the civil society in South Kivu. He reported gunfire in parts of the city. Videos posted online appeared to show rebels marching toward the Bagira area. In one of the videos, a voice in the background shouted: \u201cThey are there ... there are many of them.\u201d Hours earlier, the rebels had claimed to have seized a second airport in the region, in the town of Kavumu, following a days-long advance, while the U.N. warned that the recent escalation of fighting with government forces has left 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter. The M23, which is supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, took control of eastern Congo\u2019s biggest city, Goma, in late January. The rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east.

The Associated Press could not immediately confirm who was in control of the Kavumu national airport, which is located about 30 kilometres (18.5 miles) from Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province. Government officials and civil society leaders did not immediately comment. Kavumu airport became a target after the M23 rebels seized Goma an its international airport. Goma is a critical trade and humanitarian hub that hosted many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced in the conflict, the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on X that the rebels took over Kavumu airport and its surroundings to \u201celiminate the threat at the source.\u201d \u201cThe airport posed a danger to the civilian population,\u201d he said. Congo\u2019s Communication Ministry issued a statement criticizing the rebels for violating a ceasefire that regional leaders have called for. The rebels were \u201cimposing an urban war by attacking the positions of the FARDC (Congolese military) who are keen to avoid bloodshed in Bukavu,\u201d the ministry said. A local civil society leader in Kavumu reported seeing soldiers \u201cabandon their positions and head towards Bukavu.\u201d \u201cThis caused fear within the community (and) I took the necessary measures to bring my family to safety,\u201d the leader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Congo\u2019s President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi criticized what he described as the failure of the international community to stop the aggression from the rebels and troops from Rwanda. \u201cThis raises the question of the United Nations, which for me has become a two-tier organization depending on whether you are among the powerful or privileged (countries) or whether you are among the weak and disadvantaged,\u201d said Tshisekedi, who is attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Chaos and panic among residents The rebels\u2019 latest advance caused chaos and panic among residents in different parts of South Kivu. Some were fleeing from Kavumu into the provincial capital of Bukavu, while others were emptying from Bukavu into neighboring towns. Some were also stocking up on household supplies as economic activities appeared to be collapsing. \u201cI noticed that the soldiers were dropping out and fleeing, so I told myself that I could no longer stay in this place,\u201d said Chirimwami Alexis, among residents fleeing from Kavumu. \u201cThe fear we have is people moving without any preparation or food. We are running away just because of this situation,\u201d he added. The rebels last week declared a unilateral ceasefire that the government dismissed as false. They later continued to advance toward Bukavu, seizing several nearby towns, including the town of Katana on Friday. The town is 7 kilometers (4 miles) from Kavumu airport. African leaders to hold summit The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that hundreds of thousands of displaced people are now in overcrowded makeshift shelters, churches, schools and hospitals. \u201cHeavy artillery shelling and looting have destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around Goma and Minova in North and South Kivu provinces, leaving some 350,000 internally displaced people once again without roofs over their heads,\u201d the agency said.

A meeting on Monday between Ugandan forces and Congolese troops in Bunia, the capital of Ituri province, agreed on a joint deployment in the city, said Maj. Gen. Felix Kulayigye, spokesman for the Ugandan military. Ugandan forces now control Bunia together with Congolese forces, he said, asserting that the action was provoked by crimes, including killings, along ethnic lines by armed groups. He did not provide specific details, but Bunia and other nearby areas have long been the scene of violent conflict between the Lendu farming community and the Hema pastoralists. Ugandan military commander Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba last week threatened to capture Bunia because of allegations the Hema faced attacks. Bunia is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Congo\u2019s border with Uganda. Ugandan forces have been deployed to eastern Congo since 2021 under an agreement with Congo\u2019s government. The Ugandans are hunting down members of other rebel groups that include the Allied Democratic Forces, or ADF, which has ties with the Islamic State group. Confrontations between Ugandan troops and the ADF have been reported in remote mountainous parts of Ituri as well as in neighboring North Kivu, where the Rwanda-backed M23 rebellion reemerged in 2021. There is concern that Uganda\u2019s escalation of its military presence in eastern Congo could raise fears of a widening conflict in a large and often lawless part of the central African nation. Other belligerent forces could get involved The M23 rebellion has left a security gap on the Congolese side of the border with Uganda, which wants protection \u201cagainst other militant groups that might seek to exploit (Congo\u2019s) war with M23 and mount attacks,\u201d according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. It said \u201cthere is a low likelihood that Uganda will involve itself in the (M23) conflict as a belligerent, as it intends to maintain a largely defensive position to secure its borders.\u201d But some analysts in the region fear a repeat of the 1990s conflict in which Congo\u2019s then-leader, Laurent-Desire Kabila, invited armies from countries such as Angola and Zimbabwe to fight rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Rwandan and Ugandan military involvement in eastern Congo could provoke the entry of other belligerent forces, said Angelo Izama, an analyst with the Uganda-based Fanaka Kwawote think tank. \u201cThis is the first shot in the regional escalation that had been anticipated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pattern being reenacted is that of Uganda-Rwanda interests in (Congo).\u201d Vast mineral wealth South of Bunia, M23 rebels now control Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and the largest city in eastern Congo. The rebels over the weekend also seized Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province, after rapid military advances in recent days. Congolese forces have put up little resistance. Congolese authorities see M23 rebels as a Rwandan proxy army. The rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from Rwanda, according to evidence collected by United Nations experts. Uganda and Rwanda have entered the conflict in eastern Congo since 1996, sometimes competing for influence among rebel groups opposed to Congo\u2019s government. Congo\u2019s neighbors also have been accused of illegally exploiting the country\u2019s vast mineral wealth, including gold and coltan. Facing pressure from M23, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi recently sought the help of allies to protect the territorial integrity of his country, about the size of western Europe.

Rwanda\u2019s government described the sanctions against Gen. James Kabarebe, a deputy minister of foreign affairs, as \u201cunjustified and unfounded.\u201d Responding to the sanctions, Rwanda\u2019s government said in a statement that such action makes \u201cno contribution toward long-term security, peace and stability for all the countries of the Great Lakes region.\u201d Securing the border with Congo is \u201ca matter of national security, and that is our only driver,\u201d it said. Sanctions against Kabarebe are a blow to Rwanda, which for years has evaded the international community\u2019s punishment over its aggression in neighboring Congo. The first sign of Washington\u2019s evolving policy toward Rwanda came last year when the U.S. described M23 as a Rwanda-backed group and asked Rwandan authorities to remove their missile systems from Congolese territory. The sanctions announced Thursday finger Rwanda as the primary force behind M23, whose fighters now say they want to overthrow Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi. The U.S. State Department statement said Kabarebe, who is officially the minister of state in charge of regional integration, is the Rwandan official who liaises with M23 in handling revenue from exports of minerals from Congo.

Two companies linked to Kanyuka and registered in the United Kingdom and France were also sanctioned. The U.S. and the U.N. sanctioned M23 years ago. M23\u2019s \u201caggression has undermined the territorial integrity of (Congo),\u201d the U.S. State Department statement said. \u201cWith Rwanda\u2019s support, it has also threatened, injured, killed, and displaced thousands of innocent civilians, cost the lives of three U.N. peacekeepers and wounded several others.\u201d Kabarebe is revered in Rwanda and reviled in Congo. His current role in government came after he retired from the Rwandan military, which he once served as chief of defense staff. He is also a former minister of defense and a close ally of President Paul Kagame. He was among those by Kagame\u2019s side when his rebels entered Kigali, the Rwandan capital, to end the 1994 genocide by the Hutu majority against the Tutsi. But Kabarebe is also a key figure in the intrigue that has led to decades-long instability in eastern Congo. After Rwanda-backed rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila removed dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from power in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, in 1997, Kabarebe was installed as army chief of staff. But Kabila fired Kabarebe in 1998, turning on Rwanda and igniting a war that killed the most people since World War II as regional armies fought against each other. Rwanda has long denied support for M23, even though Kagame has asserted that the rebels deserve to be supported. Kagame insists that any efforts to end the conflict must address security concerns stemming from lawlessness in eastern Congo as well as persistent discrimination against Congolese Tutsis. M23\u2019s top military commander, Sultani Makenga, is an ethnic Tutsi born in eastern Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, where the rebels resurfaced in 2021 after a period of calm. M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo\u2019s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. Around 4,000 Rwandan troops are backing up M23, according to U.N. experts. The rebels made territorial advances in a lightning offensive, first seizing eastern Congo\u2019s main city of Goma last month and then the second-largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday. Regional leaders have urged talks between M23 and the Congolese government. Tshisekedi has previously ruled out such dialogue, saying the rebels were a Rwandan proxy army. Last year, Congo\u2019s government reached a short-lived ceasefire deal with Rwanda that was mediated by Angola, and the U.S. is urging the warring parties to return to talk under that deal. ___ Rodney Muhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda.

The exact reason for the invitation to appear before the prosecutor was not clear, said Jean Mbuyu, a lawyer for the officials and former security adviser to Kabila. Sign up here. But after leaving the prosecutor's office on Monday evening, one of the officials told Reuters they had been called in for questioning over February 26 comments made by Aubin Minaku, vice president of the party and former president of the National Assembly. \"The chief said 'we must be ready for anything',\" Minaku said at the time, referring to Kabila. \"When the chief says we must be ready for everything, each of us, a pure-blooded (party member) understands... the time for silence, for clandestine actions is over, now is the time for open actions.\" Marcel Bombamba, another of the group's lawyers, said no charges were laid against them. President Felix Tshisekedi, who once formed an awkward power-sharing deal with Kabila, has recently accused him of sponsoring the M23 rebels who have seized east Congo's two biggest cities since January. Kabila has also reached out to opposition politicians and civil society members to discuss the country's political future, amid criticism of Tshisekedi's response to M23's military campaign. The military prosecutor's office had sent about 10 invitation letters to members of Kabila's People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, though only three appeared for questioning in the capital Kinshasa on Monday. They were Minaku, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, a former interior minister and presidential candidate, and Ferdinand Kambare, national executive secretary of the party. Minaku said earlier the officials would respond to the invitations \"to avoid any suspicion\" and denied links to M23 or any other armed groups. \"We are taking a purely republican approach, not one of rebellion,\" he told Reuters, using republican to indicate loyalty to the country. \"We clearly denounced any illicit presence of foreign forces,\" he said. The latest M23 advance is the gravest escalation of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources. Rwanda denies providing arms and troops to M23, and says its forces are acting in self defence against the Congolese army and militias hostile to Kigali.

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have pushed deeper into the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), capturing the town of Walikale despite growing international calls for a ceasefire. The rebels entered the mining hub in North Kivu province on Wednesday, a day after DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame called for an immediate ceasefire after meeting in Qatar\u2019s capital Doha. Nestor Mavudisa, a spokesperson for the Congolese army (FARDC), confirmed on Thursday that \u201cthe enemy\u201d now controlled Walikale, located about 400km (250 miles) from Kisangani, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city. Corneille Nangaa, head of the Congo River Alliance (AFC), which includes M23, dismissed the calls from the leaders of DRC and Rwanda for a ceasefire. \u201cWe are Congolese who are fighting for a cause,\u201d he told the Reuters news agency. \u201cWhat happened in Doha, as long as we don\u2019t know the details, and as long as it doesn\u2019t solve our problems, we\u2019ll say it doesn\u2019t concern us.\u201d An officer in the Congolese military told the AFP news agency that forces had \u201cretreated to avoid human losses\u201d.  Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale, told the Reuters news agency: \u201cThe rebels are now visible in the centre of the city. There are at least seven people wounded who are at the general hospital.\u201d The seizure of Walikale marks the farthest west that M23 has advanced into the DRC\u2019s interior since it first emerged in 2012. The town of about 15,000 people sits about 125km (78 miles) northwest of eastern DRC\u2019s largest city, Goma, which the M23 rebels seized in January. Al Jazeera\u2019s Alain Uaykani, reporting from Goma, said residents of Walikale confirmed the presence of M23 in the town. \u201cThousands of people are already on the road, as a majority of people are trying to take the road towards the neighbouring province of Kisangani, where they can seek shelter,\u201d Uaykani said.    Earlier this month, M23 captured Nyabiondo city, 110km (68 miles) northwest of Goma, after days of fierce fighting with government forces and pro-government groups. In February, it captured Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. The offensive had already caused the mining group Alphamin earlier this month to evacuate its employees and halt operations at its Bisie mine for the tin ore cassiterite, the world\u2019s third largest, in the Walikale district. The region is also home to several gold mines. Neighbouring countries and foreign powers have been stepping up diplomatic efforts to halt what has quickly become eastern DRC\u2019s worst conflict since a 1998-2003 war that drew in multiple neighbouring countries. The United Nations says Rwanda has supported M23 by providing arms and sending troops \u2013 an accusation Kigali denies. The DRC and M23 had been expected to have their first direct talks on Tuesday in Angola. However, M23 pulled out of the talks on Monday, blaming European Union sanctions against some of its leaders and Rwandan officials. The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people to flee to surrounding territories and neighbouring countries, according to the UN.

The three were originally sentenced to death by a military court before their sentences were commuted to life in prison last week . US Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the three were \"in our custody\". The repatriation comes as the US and DR Congo explore a deal to exploit the central African country's huge mineral wealth . Last week, US President Donald Trump's senior adviser for Africa visited DR Congo and confirmed that the two countries were in talks about minerals and said it could involve \"multibillion-dollar investments\". DR Congo has large deposits of coltan and cobalt, used in electronic equipment and batteries for electric cars, which are currently largely extracted by Chinese mining companies. The three American convicts - Marcel Malanga Malu, Tylor Thomson and Zalman Polun Benjamin - left DR Congo on Tuesday to serve the remainder of their sentences in the US, said Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama. They were escorted to N'Djili International Airport in Kinshasa in \"strict compliance with legal procedures\", said DR Congo's presidency. The transfer \"is part of a dynamic of strengthening judicial diplomacy and international cooperation in matters of justice and human rights\" between DR Congo and the US, the presidency added.

They were accused of leading an attack on both the presidential palace and the home of an ally of President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi last May. Later they were convicted of criminal conspiracy, terrorism and other charges, which they denied. The suspected leader of the plot, Christian Malanga, a US national of Congolese origin, was killed during the attack, along with five others. Hi son, Marcel Malanga Malu, is among those sent home on Tuesday. Details of the prisoner transfer agreement were not immediately clear but the State Department said it was aware of the repatriation done in collaboration with the US embassy in Kinshasa, the DR Congo capital. But legal experts say it's unlikely the US will release them or shorten their sentences, reports the AP news agency. The Department of State spokesperson said that the US condemned the armed attacks and supported DR Congo's bid to hold the convicts accountable, but she also sought \"consistent, compassionate, humane treatment and a fair legal process\". Joseph Szlavik-Soto, a lobbyist working for the Congolese government, told Reuters news agency that it had agreed to pay for the damage caused by protesters who attacked the US embassy and other missions earlier this year.

The disaster occurred near Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur Province, at the confluence of the Ruki and the vast Congo River -- the world's deepest. The mayor's toll, the first official one from the blaze, was far lower than that of at least 143 deaths previously given to AFP. Josephine-Pacifique Lokumu, head of a delegation of national deputies from the region, had put the toll at 143. And Joseph Lokondo, a local civil society leader who said he helped bury the bodies, put the \"provisional death toll at 145: some burnt, others drowned\". Bako said the discrepancies over the death tolls were due to people having confused the numbers from previous disasters, which are frequent on the Congo River. He was speaking after having met deputy interior minister Eugenie Tshiela, who flew into Mbandaka from the capital Kinshasa on Saturday. 'Never forget you' Funerals were already underway in the provincial capital Mbandaka on Friday, according to videos filmed by local journalist Eric Liyenge Ekamba shared with AFP. The footage showed vehicles arriving with coffins that were then transported by Red Cross workers and displayed under a large tent. The incident took place in the northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo \u00a9 Valentin RAKOVSKY \/ AFP In another video, at least 11 coffins are seen under the tent as people walk around the site as if to pay their last respects. In front of one coffin, a photo of a woman is displayed with the message: \"Maman Bolangi Souzane, we will never forget you.\" After the ceremony, Red Cross workers and other volunteers carried out burials at an area cemetery, as seen in the footage. Several families directly retrieved the bodies of their loved ones once they were found, according to testimonies. Hope fades for missing Lokumu said the blaze was caused by a fuel explosion ignited by an onboard cooking fire. \"A woman lit the embers for cooking. The fuel, which was not far away, exploded, killing many children and women,\" she added. Videos circulating on social media showed flames leaping from a long boat stranded far from shore, with smoke billowing from the wreckage and people aboard smaller vessels looking on. Search efforts continued on Saturday, \"but the chances of finding survivors or additional bodies are slim, three days after the tragedy\", a humanitarian source told AFP, speaking on the condition of anonymity. A vast central African nation that covers 2.3 million square kilometres (900,000 square miles), the DRC suffers from a lack of practicable roads. Planes serve only a limited number of cities and towns. As a result people often travel on lakes, the Congo River -- the second longest in Africa after the Nile -- and its winding tributaries, where shipwrecks are frequent and the death tolls often heavy. A chronic absence of passenger lists often complicates search operations. In October 2023, at least 47 people died after a boat navigating the Congo sank in Equateur. More than 20 people died in October last year when a boat capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern DRC, according to local authorities.

Since January, M23 has captured major cities in eastern DRC, resulting in thousands of deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of residents. The group's rapid advance has raised concerns about a potential wider regional conflict, involving neighboring countries such as Uganda and Burundi. Walikale is strategically located along a road linking four eastern DRC provinces and is situated in a mineral-rich area, notably containing tin deposits. The town had remained under M23 control despite previous pledges to withdraw, with the rebels accusing the Congolese army of not fulfilling its commitments, including the removal of attack drones Local residents, officials, and the Congolese army have confirmed the rebels' departure from Walikale. However, M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka warned that continued provocations from the government could nullify their goodwill gesture. Humanitarian organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders, reported that civilians and aid teams had been trapped by the recent violence in Walikale, with essential medical supplies running low. The upcoming talks in Doha mark the first direct negotiations between the DRC government and M23. This development follows surprise meetings between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame in Doha, as well as separate talks between Qatari officials and M23 representatives.

At least 36 people were killed during an overnight attack on a village in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. A local official and the head of a civil society group said on Thursday the assailants were believed to be members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) \u2013 a Ugandan armed group based in eastern DRC that has pledged allegiance to ISIL (ISIS) and wages frequent deadly raids on villages. The attack targeted the village of Mukondi, 30km (19 miles) south of the city of Beni in North Kivu province, an area plagued with rebel activity and which has been under military administration since 2021 in an attempt to restore order. Provincial governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita said on Twitter at least 36 people had been killed in the attack, which began on Wednesday evening.

The ADF often wages attacks using machetes and hatchets. A local army spokesperson, Antony Mwalushayi, confirmed there had been an attack but did not give a death toll. Kakuke Kilalo Emmanuel, a resident of the nearby village of Kalunguta, said he went to Mukondi on Wednesday but turned back after he saw people in a state of panic as the attack was unfolding. Many Kalunguta residents have fled out of fear for their safety, he added. The ADF was formed in 1995 by a coalition of rebel forces \u2013 including the Uganda Muslim Liberation Army and the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda \u2013 to fight against the Yoweri Museveni administration. It is among the most violent groups in the DRC, and has been accused of a string of bomb attacks and civilian massacres. According to the Catholic Church in the country, the ADF has killed about 6,000 civilians since 2013. US-based monitor the Kivu Security Tracker blames the group for more than 1,200 deaths in the Beni area alone since 2017. The DRC government declared a state of siege in North Kivu and neighbouring Ituri province in 2021 in an attempt to stem rampant violence in the country\u2019s vast mineral-rich east.

Burundi will on March 4, 2023 deploy 100 soldiers to the troubled region. PHOTO | GLODY MURHABAZI | AFP By AFP  Nairobi Burundi will deploy 100 soldiers to the volatile eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Saturday as part of a regional force, a senior Burundian military officer told AFP . The seven-nation East African Community deployed troops late last year in the eastern DRC, which has been struggling with the rise of militias including the rebel March 23 Movement. The fighting in North Kivu province has displaced huge numbers of people and exacerbated regional tensions, with the DRC government accusing Rwanda of backing the M23 \u2014 claims denied by Kigali but supported by the US and several Western nations. The militia re-emerged from dormancy in late 2021, subsequently occupying swathes of territory in North Kivu, including much of the region north of its capital Goma. The EAC, which has held several meetings to defuse the crisis and called for the withdrawal of the M23 from occupied areas, created a regional force aimed at stabilising the eastern DRC. But thousands demonstrated in Goma last month, accusing the EAC force of passivity in the face of armed groups. On Friday, a senior Burundian army officer told AFP \"a company of about 100 soldiers will fly tomorrow to Goma\". The troops will be deployed in Kitshanga and Kilorirwe \u2014 areas occupied by the M23 in North Kivu \u2014 as well as Sake, he said on condition of anonymity. An EAC press statement on Friday confirmed Burundian troops would be deployed on Saturday, but did not elaborate on the number of soldiers travelling to the DRC. According to a new timetable adopted by East African leaders last month, \"all armed groups\", including the M23, must withdraw by March 30, following a three-step process that was due to start on February 28. The crisis has led to a sharp deterioration in ties between Kigali and Kinshasa. In an incident along the tense border between the two nations, Rwanda's defence ministry said that a soldier from the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) \"crossed over from DRC\" on Friday evening and shot at Rwandan soldiers manning the area. \"The RDF soldiers returned fire, killing the FARDC soldier on the Rwandan side of the border,\" the statement said. \"Several other FARDC soldiers fired at the RDF position resulting in a brief exchange of fire,\" it added. There was no immediate response from Congolese officials to the report, which follows similar incidents along the border in June and November last year. The regional force is expected to include soldiers from Burundi, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda. But its total intended size remains unclear. Rebel militias have plagued the eastern DRC for decades, many of them a legacy of regional wars that flared during the 1990s and the early 2000s. Some 5.5 million people were displaced within the country as of last November, according to the UN agency. In addition, more than one million had left for a neighbouring country, with more than 500,000 seeking shelter in Uganda alone.

Photo: AFP Pope Francis landed in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday, hailing his \"beautiful trip\" to Africa as he comes bearing a message of peace to the conflict-torn nation and its troubled neighbour South Sudan. Large crowds of well-wishers gathered at Kinshasa's Ndjili airport, about 25 kilometres from the centre, to greet the Argentine pontiff, whose plane touched down at 2.35pm local time. \"We've been waiting for a year, it's a beautiful trip,\" the 86-year-old pope told reporters travelling aboard his plane. It is the first time since 1985 that a pope has visited the Democratic Republic of Congo, a desperately poor country of about 100 million people, 40 percent of whom are Catholic. \"I didn't want to miss the opportunity to see him face to face,\" Maggie Kayembe, a woman in her thirties, told AFP as she waited for the pope. \"He always preaches peace wherever he goes, and peace, we really need it,\" she added. The six-day trip to DRC and South Sudan had been planned for July 2022, but postponed due to the pontiff's knee pain that has forced him in recent months to use a wheelchair. He boarded the plane in Rome via an elevator. Security concerns were also said to play a role in delaying the trip, and a stop in Goma in DR Congo's east, where dozens of armed groups operate, is no longer on the itinerary. \"I would have liked to go to Goma too, but with the war, you can't go there,\" the pope told reporters on the plane. On Sunday, he had offered his greetings \"with affection to those beloved peoples who await me\". \"These lands, situated in the centre of the great African continent, have suffered greatly from lengthy conflicts,\" he said after his Angelus prayer at the Vatican. He lamented \"armed clashes and exploitation\" in DR Congo, and said South Sudan, \"wracked by years of war, longs for an end to the constant violence\". As the papal plane flew over the Sahara, the pope held a prayer for \"all the people who, searching for a little well-being, a bit of freedom, crossed (the desert) and didn't make it\". He recalled how many people arrive in north Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean into Europe, only to find themselves \"taken to camps, and suffering there. Let us pray for all those people\".

The capture of Rubaya, a major coltan mining town in Masisi territory, came days after the rebels took control of another key town of Mushaki in North Kivu. The development casts doubt on the commitment of the rebels to withdraw from their positions, which was supposed to begin on Feb. 28 according to a new schedule outlined by East African leaders. Rubaya town \u201cfell to rebels on (Sunday) afternoon after two days of intense fighting,\u201d Meschak Malikidogo, the head of a local mining cooperative, told Anadolu. \u201cGovernment troops withdrew given the large number of rebels,\u201d he added. A senior officer of the Congolese army said government troops \u201cmade a strategic withdrawal to avoid a bloodbath.\u201d The officer claimed the rebels had gained reinforcements from fresh troops from Rwanda.

After the capture of Bunagana, the enemy is getting stronger a little more,\u201d said legislator Juvenal Munubo, calling for urgent efforts to dislodge the \u201cenemy\u201d from the national territory. Defeated in 2013 by government forces and peacekeepers, the M23 rebel group took up arms again in late 2021. Since then the rebels have seized several towns in the territories of Rutshuru, Nyiragongo and Masisi in North Kivu, which has been affected by armed violence for three decades. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23, but Kigali denies. Rwanda has instead accused the Congolese army of collusion with Rwandan rebels of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, whose elements are accused of taking part in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi ethnic group in Rwanda. At a summit Ethiopia\u2019s capital Addis Ababa on Feb. 17, East African leaders adopted a new timetable, seeking \u201cwithdrawal of all armed groups\u201d in eastern Congo by March 30. Last week, leaders of the Community of Central African States at a summit in Kinshasa, Congo condemned the M23 but did not point to Kigali\u2019s responsibility.

Editor\u2019s note: This piece has been updated to include a response from M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka. The M23 rebels have seized the strategic town of Kitshanga in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after days of fierce fighting, drawing condemnation from the UN . The DRC\u2019s army on Friday confirmed its forces withdrew, calling it a tactical move to protect civilians in the face of a renewed offensive by the rebel fighters. \u201cWe have tactically withdrawn from the city in order to attract these genocidal forces deep into the city and avoid the worst for our people in Kitshanga,\u201d said Lieutenant-Colonel Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for the military governor of North Kivu. \u201cWe are making every effort to dislodge this enemy,\u201d he told the AFP news agency. The rebels took control of Kitshanga late on Thursday after capturing several villages on the road linking the town of about 60,000 people to the provincial capital Goma about 90 kilometres (55 miles) apart. Videos on social media appeared to show fighters in the M23 group celebrating and claiming they had captured the town. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos. M23\u2032s political spokesman, Lawrence Kanyuka, in a statement on Thursday accused government troops of attacking civilians in Kitchanga and elsewhere, and said the rebel group was \u201cobliged to intervene and stop another genocide\u201d. \u201cWe have just been through the war in Kitchanga, we saw M23 killing people, we were afraid, that\u2019s why we fled so we wouldn\u2019t die, too,\u201d Angelique Mukeshimana told The Associated Press news agency. The mother of four went to a makeshift displacement site on the outskirts of Goma. \u201cFor months, M23 have been moving towards Kitshanga and Masisi as they fight Congo army, which is widely reported to be backed by militias. Though Congo has denied it,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Malcom Webb said reporting from the Kenyan capital Nairobi. \u201cSources in the Congo army said that two days ago battalion of soldiers crossed from Rwanda to reinforce M23,\u201d he added. \u201cThat helped the rebels in taking control of Kitshanga. And that means that M23 now control the road from Kitshanga to Goma.\u201d Kanyuka told Al Jazeera that reports of killing in Kitshanga were false. \u201cHow can M23 kill where [it] is not present and had to intervene to stop the killing\u2026committed by DRC government coalition? The UN peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym MONUSCO, said more than 500 people, including women and children, are seeking refuge at its base in the town of Kitshanga. MONUSCO spokesperson Ndeye Khady Lo said civilians fleeing from Kitchanga have been given tents, food, water and first aid. \u201cThe M23 must cease all hostilities and withdraw from the occupied areas,\u201d Lo told the AP. Months of intensified fighting have displaced at least 450,000 people. Regional leaders agreed in November that M23 fighters would withdraw from the eastern areas of the DRC, but the M23 has been accused of violating the terms of the ceasefire. Goma, home to more than one million people, located just on the Rwandan border, was already cut off from the north after rebels took National Highway 2 during their offensive in October and November. The M23, which Kinshasa has claimed is backed by Rwanda, took up arms at the end of 2021 and has since seized parts of Rutshuru and Nyiragongo, north of Goma. United Nations experts and the European Union have accused Rwanda of backing the M23. Rwanda has denied backing the group, which is one of the dozens operating in mineral-rich eastern Congo. Under diplomatic pressure and under the supervision of a regional force deployed in the region, the rebels announced their withdrawal in December and January from two captured areas. The fighting came days before Pope Francis was due in the DRC capital Kinshasa for a three-day visit. The trip was originally supposed to include a stop in the east, however, the Vatican scrapped that amid the rising violence.

At least 10 people have been killed and dozens of others wounded in a bomb attack during a service at a Protestant church in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according the country\u2019s army. The explosion killed at least 10 people and wounded 39 others, army spokesman Anthony Mualushay said on Sunday. Both tolls were provisional, he added. Mualushay said the attack during the Sunday service in the city of Kasindi, on the border with Uganda, was likely carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group that has pledged allegiance to ISIL (ISIS). Later on Sunday, the ISIL group claimed responsbility for the attack. The ADF, which began as an uprising in Uganda but has been based in the DRC since the late 1990s. Survivors and witnesses said the blast severed some people\u2019s limbs from their bodies. Masika Makasi, 25, was sitting under a tent outside the church when she heard a noise that sounded like a tire going flat, she told the Associated Press news agency from her home in Kasindi. Her leg was injured in the attack and her sister-in-law, who was several feet away, died instantly, Makasi said. \u201cI am traumatised from seeing people die around me,\u201d she said. Kasindi is in a province where Congolese and Ugandan forces have launched a campaign against the ADF . It pledged allegiance to ISIL in mid-2019 and is accused of killing hundreds of villagers in frequent raids over the past two years. Troops from Uganda\u2019s army have deployed to eastern Congo to try to stem the violence, but the attacks have increased and spread. ADF attacks since April have killed at least 370 civilians and involved the abduction of several hundred more, a report by the United Nations last month said.

Issued on: 23\/01\/2023 - 19:40 2 min By: NEWS WIRES A soldier of the FARDC (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo) takes cover during exchanges of fire with members of the ADF (Allied Democratic Forces) in Opira, North Kivu, on January 25, 2018. \u00a9 Alain Wandimoyi, AFP The attack occurred overnight on Sunday in the village of Makugwe, in the Beni area of North Kivu province, said local civil society figure Roger Wangeve, who put the death toll at 24. \"The ADF surprised 17 people in a small bar where they were drinking beer, and executed them,\" he said. A Congolese army spokesman in the region put the death toll at 24 with 10 people missing. Wangeve added that militants also looted and torched several homes and shops in the village and carried off several villagers into the bush. Provincial deputy Saidi Balikwisha, who was in Makugwe during the attack, said 23 were killed and three others are missing. He urged an increased military presence in the area to better anticipate armed attacks. Islamic State group , which has designated the ADF as its central African affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack on Monday, saying on messaging app Telegram that its militants attacked Makugwe and burned down several houses. AFP was unable to independently confirm the death toll from the attack. Colonel Charles Omeonga, the Congolese military administrator of Beni territory, told AFP soldiers were \"in pursuit of the enemy\", who he said were hiding among the local population. The ADF is one of the deadliest groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a volatile region which has been plagued by militia violence for decades. The ADF has been accused of slaughtering thousands of Congolese civilians and carrying out bomb attacks in Uganda. In 2021, the United States officially linked the ADF to IS and added it to its list of foreign terrorist organisations. On January 15, suspected ADF operatives detonated a bomb in a church in North Kivu, killing at least 14 people and injuring another 63. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi placed North Kivu and neighbouring Ituri province in a \"state of siege\" in 2021, replacing civilian administrators with military and police personnel in a bid to stem the violence. The DRC and Uganda also launched a joint offensive that year to drive the ADF out of their Congolese strongholds, but the measures have so far failed to end the group's attacks.

At least 176 people have been killed in flash floods in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, a regional official says Torrential rain in South Kivu province caused a river to overflow on Thursday and led to significant damage and loss of life in the villages of Bushushu and Nyamukubi, the provincial government said in a statement. South Kivu Governor Th\u00e9o Ngwabidje Kasi put the death toll at 176 and said that other people were still missing.

The weather had cleared on Friday, revealing flattened houses and corrugated iron roofs jutting out from beneath thick layers of mud, photos showed. Haggard-looking survivors stood outside a wooden shed in which Red Cross workers in blue scrubs piled bodies on top of each other. Many had lost clothing and were covered in dirt. Floods and landslides are not an uncommon occurrence in South Kivu. The last incident of a similar scale occurred in October 2014 when heavy rain destroyed more than 700 homes. Over 130 people were reported missing at the time, according to the United Nations. Heavy rainfall and floods have led to tragedies in other parts of the country as well. Last month, at least 21 people died and several were reported missing a day after a landslide in North Kivu province. In December, at least 169 people were killed due to rains in the capital, Kinshasa. The floods add to an ongoing humanitarian crisis in the eastern DRC due to decades of violence from multiple armed groups. The region has been plagued by fighting by at least 122 rebel groups for more than 25 years, according to a recent count by the United Nations. Consequently, millions of people have been displaced, the Norwegian Refugee Council said in a report in June. The DRC is home to more than 5.5 million internally displaced people, the third-highest number in the world. A million other Congolese have also fled the country.

The Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO) group, one of many militias operating in the conflict-ridden east, was responsible for the killings at the \"LALA\" camp, the mission, known as MONUSCO, said in a statement. Sign up here. CODECO claims to defend the interests of Lendu farmers, who have long been in conflict with Hema herders. Its fighters have killed hundreds of civilians in Ituri province and forced thousands to flee their homes, according to the United Nations. Over 45 people were killed and at least 10 wounded in the attack, MONUSCO said, adding that it had liaised with provincial authorities to reinforce security in the area. The U.N. refugee agency said armed assailants killed people, including women and children, with guns and machetes. At least 12 people were burned alive after their shelters were set on fire, it added. Ituri army spokesman Jules Ngongo Tshikudi described the attack as an \"act of sabotage\" against attempts to restore peace and said investigations were underway. Jean Richard Lenga, chief of Bahema Badjere district, said militiamen massacred 46 people with knives and firearms and burnt others in their homes in the middle of the camp. \"The whole village is in mourning now,\" he said, adding that the authorities were still searching for bodies. Many people have fled to the nearby town of Bule, seeking safety, Lenga said. Around 70,000 displaced people arrived in Bule between April 15 and May 15 due to armed violence in the surrounding areas, the U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) said in its latest report. Ituri hosts about 1.7 million internally displaced people in total, it said. A civil rights group head, Charite Banza, said the attack happened a few days after a dialogue between armed groups in Ituri. \"We don't have security here, we say it every day,\" Banza said. The victims' bodies would be buried in a mass grave, he said. CODECO has frequently targeted displacement camps. It killed about 60 people at another camp near Bule last year, in one of its deadliest massacres.

A resident of a nearby village and a member of local civil society blamed Sunday's attack on the ADF. \"The ADF arrived, they set fire to a hospital after looting it with medicines, and they set fire to a hotel,\" said Sadame Patanguli, the resident. He said the militants kidnapped several others, who are now missing. The details of the burned buildings and the death toll were confirmed by two regional officials. The ADF was created in Uganda before moving to eastern Congo in the 1990s, and has been blamed for thousands of deaths in the last decade. The killings have continued despite efforts by the army, which is also fighting the rebel group M23, whose offensive in recent months has displaced 600,000 people. Congo says the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which Rwanda denies. Meanwhile, public support for the United Nations' peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo, known as MONUSCO, has plummeted because of what local residents say is its inability to stem the violence. A delegation from the UN Security Council toured North Kivu this weekend, including to a camp for displaced people. \"There are no magic solutions, it's not the United Nations that will solve the problem on its own,\" said Nicolas de Riviere, the French ambassador to the UN. \"We need a political negotiation, we need a security solution.\" Reporting by Erikas Mwisi and Djaffar Al Katanty, writing by Edward McAllister\nEditing by Raissa Kasolowsky, William Maclean Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Africa Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Read Next Africa category South Africa withdraws planned VAT hike after political pushback 12:39 AM UTC Africa category Congo, M23 commit to work towards peace after Doha talks April 23, 2025 Africa category Tanzania police detain opposition figures on way to court, party says 7:30 AM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago category Atlantic Lithium seeks concessions to salvage Ghana project 7:47 AM UTC \u00b7 Updated  ago","question":"How many people were killed in the suspected Islamist militant attack in Kirindera, North Kivu, in March 2023?","answer":"Nineteen people were killed in the attack.","region":"the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","model_answer":"Answer: 19 people were killed in the suspected Islamist militant attack in Kirindera, North Kivu, in March 2023.","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer matches the expected answer in both the number of people killed (19) and the context of the attack (suspected Islamist militant attack in Kirindera, North Kivu, in March 2023).

At least four of them were hacked to death, and the bodies of four others were later found in pit latrines, he said. A source with a civil society group, also speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the toll, while local administrative official Isaac Kibira said the toll was \"around nine.\" Kibira said the suspects were the M23, a notorious predominantly Tutsi group that is fighting DR Congo's armed forces and local militias. That account was supported by the Kivu Security Tracker (KST), a respected monitor of violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. It said on Twitter that the M23 were suspected of attacking civilians while its men were pursuing a fighter with a predominantly Hutu armed group called Nyatura CMC. In a statement, the M23 condemned \"the killings... which occurred on the night of July 4 in Bungushu, Tongo and the surrounding area,\" and blamed them on the \"Kinshasa government forces.\" After a long period of dormancy, the M23 resumed fighting in late 2021, swiftly capturing swathes of territory near DR Congo's border with Rwanda. As its beleaguered army struggled to cope, the government accused Rwanda of abetting the rebels -- a charge denied by Kigali but corroborated by United Nations experts.

The president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said. The 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems. It had to be extended to a second day in some parts of the vast country. About two-thirds of polling stations opened late, while 30% of voting machines did not work on the first day of the vote, according to an observer group. Millions of people waited for hours before they were able to vote, while some gave up and went home. The opposition said the problems were part of a deliberate plan to allow the results to be rigged in favour of Mr Tshisekedi, 60. Several of the main challengers have called for protests after Sunday's announcement. \"We call on our people to take to the streets en masse after the proclamation of the electoral fraud,\" they said in a joint statement. The army has been deployed in various parts of the capital, Kinshasa, to prevent any unrest, while Mr Tshisekedi's supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate. The head of the election commission has previously said the opposition candidates wanted a new election because \"they know they lost... they are bad losers\". Election chief Denis Kadima acknowledged some irregularities but insisted that the results reflected the will of the Congolese people. President Tshisekedi will be sworn in for a second term on 20 January. The son of veteran opposition leader \u00c9tienne Tshisekedi, the president was first elected in 2019. That followed a poll which some observers, including the influential Catholic Church, said was won by former oil executive Martin Fayulu. He came third in this election with 5% of the vote. None of the other 16 candidates gained more than 1% of the vote.

It is not clear if any of the 18 opposition candidates will challenge the results in court. Mr Katumbi has already said it is not worth it, because the courts are not independent. The Constitutional Court has 10 days to hear any legal challenges before it is due to announce the final results on 10 January 2024. DR Congo is roughly four times the size of France, but lacks basic infrastructure. Even some of its main cities are not linked by road. About two-thirds of the country's 100 million population live below the poverty line, earning $2.15 (\u00a31.70) a day or less. Voters also chose parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives, with about 100,000 candidates in total. During the campaign, Mr Tshisekedi repeatedly lashed out at Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, who he accuses of backing the M23 rebel group which has seized territory in the east of the country. Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charges. In his last election rally, Mr Tshisekedi vowed to declare war on Rwanda, although observers dismissed this as rhetoric aimed at whipping up nationalist sentiment. The elections were not held in parts of the east because of the fighting which has raged in the area for the past three decades. Some seven million people have been forced from their homes - more than in any other country except Sudan . Dozens of armed groups are battling to control parts of the region, home to much of the country's vast mineral wealth.

Joy Bokele, territorial administrator in North Kivu province's Lubero territory, told Reuters that fighters from the Mai Mai Mazembe militia attacked the village of Luhanga at about 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) with guns and machetes. Ethnic rivalries, incursions and competition for mineral-rich land have stoked conflict for two decades among eastern Congo's dozens of armed groups, including many \"Mai Mai\" - self-defence militias originally created to resist Rwandan invasions. The Mai Mai groups take their name from the word for \"water\" in a local Swahili dialect, because some of their fighters believe magic can turn flying bullets into water. \"For the time being, we have a provisional toll of about 30 deaths and about 20 wounded,\" Bokele said. Militias claiming to represent the two ethnic groups have engaged in tit-for-tat violence throughout the year that has killed dozens of civilians. International powers fear tensions over President Joseph Kabila's plan to stay in power beyond the end of his mandate next month could spark large-scale conflict that would feed into such local disputes. A 1998-2003 war in eastern Congo killed millions, mostly from hunger and disease. Bokele said there was no known motive behind the attack but the Centre of Study for the Promotion of Peace, Democracy and Human Rights, a local activist group, said the killings followed a week of threats by the militiamen against local Hutus. Tensions between the Hutu and neighbouring communities have spiked since Congo's army launched a military offensive last year against the main Hutu militia in the region, displacing large numbers of fighters and civilians.

{"year":"2017","month":"05","event_desc":"- United Nations has documented 80 mass graves in Kasai unrest that began in","text":"DR Congo Keeping watch in Kasai in Congo Format News and Press Release Source Caritas Posted 9 Nov 2017 Originally published 8 Nov 2017 Origin View original A brutal conflict emerged in Kasai in the Democratic Republic of Congo between tribal militias and the government armed forces in August 2016 following the killing of a traditional chief. Over 3000 deaths have been recorded by Catholic Church parishes. Hundreds have been mutilated and raped. Villages have been sacked and burned and homes, churches, schools and health centres destroyed. By July 2017, the United Nations had already documented 80 mass graves. Thousands have fled to neighbouring Angola and an estimated 1.4 million people are internally displaced in the country. The conflict has since degenerated into inter-ethnic fighting and the recruitment of children as soldiers by the militias is commonplace. Farmers have moved away from the fields and have missed three crop seasons resulting in a lack of production and massive food insecurity for the overall population and region. Road barriers have also been erected by the government in several villages preventing the population from accessing fields and mining areas. Fifty percent of the economy of the city of Tshikapa in Kasai is based on diamond mining.  The Congo border with Angola, which supplies basic needs is also inaccessible. Now, although security is uncertain displaced people are returning to their villages, generating additional humanitarian needs. There\u2019s a general sense the crisis has been forgotten. Funding has been slow to mobilise: the US$64.5 million flash appeal launched in April 2017 and developed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) remains largely underfunded (37% contribution so far). The UN refugee agency lacks resources to respond to the large-scale crisis. From the US$100 million required for the Congolese Situation and the Angola Response, only 17 per cent has been received. Caritas is one of the few local structures remaining with local and displaced communities in Kasai. Caritas Congo has been key in gathering information on the needs of the people by setting up a humanitarian watch system with all Caritas dioceses affected by the crisis. Caritas regularly informs the humanitarian community about the situation. This has enabled large-scale interventions. Now Caritas is focusing on the return of the displaced to their villages. Caritas International issued an emergency appeal in September with a budget of US$450,000 (390,000 Euros) aimed at improving the living conditions of 9000 people in the diocese of Luebo in Kasai. The effects of the crisis in Luebo have been catastrophic: at least 2623 deaths were recorded, 2767 houses were destroyed, 140 schools, 28 health centres and 30 religious missions damaged and 62 mass graves containing remains have been discovered. Aid is targeting 1,100 displaced households and 400 host families and goes towards delivering adequate food -at least two meals a day, essential household items (such as sleeping articles, mats, clothing, kitchen utensils, soap and 20-liter cans), and hygiene kits for women and girls. Caritas Germany is financing the distribution of essential household items in Luebo and Caritas Italy has also been a long-time partner. Caritas is focusing on advocacy efforts with member organisations, political actors and donors to raise funds at the country level and to facilitate the return of the displaced persons to their communities of origin.

WATCH: Millions remain displaced amid DR Congo conflict (2:25) A series of large-scale prison breaks across the DRC in the past few months has aggravated insecurity since Kabila refused to step down after his mandate expired in December. Assailants wearing red headbands characteristic of BDK members staged the attack on the high-security Makala prison but did not make it past the front door, a witness inside the prison told Reuters news agency. \u201cWe woke up to the deafening noise of gunshots,\u201d said the witness, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. He said he had seen police and soldiers gather several bodies outside the prison walls.

The group aims to revive the pre-colonial Kongo kingdom, which thrived for centuries around the mouth of the Congo River. Government orders internet slowdown BDK demonstrators on Monday held signs that read, \u201cRwanda for Rwandans. Congo for Congolese. Get out, Kanambe,\u201d using another slur to refer to Kabila. The BDK movement is one of just many sources of opposition of Kabila that threaten to plunge the vast, mineral-rich central country into chaos. The opposition has called for nationwide strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Around 4,000 prisoners, including Nsemi, escaped from Makala in May during an attack by suspected BDK members. The mounting unrest has led some of Kabila\u2019s allies to call for a state of emergency. More than 50 people were killed on Friday in the southeast in inter-ethnic clashes, part of rising violence by armed groups across the country. Ruling on killing of UN experts In a separate development, a military tribunal in Kananga, in the DRC\u2019s troubled region of Kasai, gave an important procedural ruling on Monday in the case of two UN experts who were killed in March. Michael Sharp, an American, and Zaida Catalan, a Swedish-Chilean dual national, were found murdered after they went to investigate violence in the region which began to flare in August 2016. A UN specialist panel in New York said the attack was an ambush and did not rule out that members of the security forces may have been involved. The tribunal, which is ruling in the case, gave the go-ahead for all parties to go to the scene of the crime. The visit will take place on August 21, it said.

Rwanda on Sunday \u201cnoted with regret\u201d the decision by the DR Congo to expel its ambassador. \u201cIt is regrettable the Government of the DRC continues to scapegoat Rwanda to cover up and distract from their own governance and security failures,\u201d Kigali said in a statement, adding that Rwandan forces at its border with DRC were on high alert. The latest advance by rebel fighters prompted the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MONUSCO, to increase its \u201ctroop alert level\u201d and boost support for the army. Fierce fighting erupted on Saturday morning between the Congolese army and M23 rebels in Kiwanja, which is 70km (43 miles) from the North Kivu capital, Goma. John Banyene, a local civil society leader, later told The Associated Press that the rebels now controlled both Kiwanja and Rutshuru Centre. AFP, quoting unnamed officials, said the rebels had seized control of the towns. \u201cAs we speak, we confirm that the M23 rebels and their allies control the town of Kiwanja, but the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo are not giving up,\u201d Banyene told journalists in Goma. There was no immediate confirmation from Congolese authorities or the military on the reported seizure of the two towns. The M23 was formed in 2012, claiming to defend the interests of Congolese Tutsis, a group sharing the ethnicity of Rwanda\u2019s President Paul Kagame, against Hutu armed groups, seizing Goma, the largest city in DR Congo\u2019s east, the same year. After a peace deal\u00a0in 2013 , many M23 fighters were integrated into the national military. The group resumed fighting in late 2021 after lying dormant for years, accusing the government of having failed to honour an agreement over the demobilisation of its fighters. It has since captured swathes of territory in North Kivu, including the key town of Bunagana on the Ugandan border in June. Since May, M23 has waged its most sustained offensive in years, killing dozens and forcing at least 40,000 people to flee in only a week\u2019s time. Nearly 200,000 people had already been displaced over the past year even before the latest surge in violence. The M23\u2019s resurgence has inflamed regional tensions and spurred deadly protests against the UN peacekeeping mission in DRC, which civilians accuse of failing to protect them. Rwanda denies the charges and counters that DR Congo works with the Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a notorious Hutu rebel movement involved in the 1994 genocide of Tutsis, which Kinshasa also denies. In August, a report by UN experts said they had \u201csolid evidence\u201d that members of Rwanda\u2019s armed forces were conducting operations in eastern DR Congo in support of the M23 rebel group. Rwanda, though, has repeatedly denied the allegations and has accused Congolese forces of injuring several civilians in cross-border shelling.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has honoured independence hero Patrice Lumumba, marking 60 years since his assassination in a plot linked to the fledgeling country\u2019s colonial master, Belgium. President Felix Tshisekedi on Sunday paid tribute to the charismatic political leader at a site in the capital, Kinshasa, where a memorial is to be installed in his honour. Lumumba became the country\u2019s first democratically elected prime minister after independence from Belgium in 1960. His government lasted just three months before he was overthrown and assassinated by firing squad. Lumumba\u2019s body will never be recovered, however. Shot by Katangan separatists and Belgian mercenaries on January 17, 1961, during the first, chaotic months of independence, his body was dissolved in acid. The only part of his body ever recovered was a tooth seized from a Belgian policeman who, by his own account, took it while helping to dispose of the body. Last month, Tshisekedi said Belgium would return the tooth to his family in time for independence anniversary celebrations on June 30. Juliana Lumumba, the slain leader\u2019s daughter, wrote to Belgium\u2019s King Philippe last year, at the height of Black Lives Matter protests, asking for its return.

The motion, which lawmaker Ch\u00e9rubin Okende said carried the signatures of more than 300 of the National Assembly's 500 members, gives Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga Ilunkamba 48 hours to resign or face a no-confidence vote. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Last month, Tshisekedi moved to end a coalition formed with his predecessor Joseph Kabila that has constrained Tshisekedi's authority since he took office in January 2019. Since then, he has persuaded scores of MPs to defect from Kabila's alliance, which had previously controlled the majority in parliament. While Tshisekedi's new political grouping, known as the Sacred Union, has yet to formally take over the majority, which requires a separate declaration, Ilunga's political fate appeared sealed. \"The majority of the national assembly is in favour of the departure of the prime minister,\" Okende, one of the motion's authors, told Reuters. If his allies do emerge with a parliamentary majority, the president would be able to nominate a cabinet of his choosing after two years in which Kabila's allies have dominated the major ministries, stalling Tshisekedi's agenda.

The 56-member Cabinet of the coalition government dubbed the Sacred Union of the Nation includes 15 women, according to the presidency. The new government is made up of four deputy prime ministers, nine ministers of state, 31 ministers, 11 deputy ministers, and one minister delegate. \"It should be noted that the government's mission is to apply the vision of the Head of State, Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi, essentially focused on improving the living conditions of the Congolese and establishing a climate of peace throughout the national territory,\" the presidency tweeted. The new government came up after two months of negotiations between new allies of the president, who overthrew the parliamentary majority of his predecessor. Lukonde was appointed the new prime minister in February. Tshisekedi picked him over two weeks after former Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga resigned following a no-confidence vote in parliament late January. Ilunga, an ally of former President Joseph Kabila, was the head of the coalition government. His resignation followed Tshisekedi\u2019s decision to end a power-sharing agreement with supporters of Kabila after months of tensions between the two camps.

Twenty-two men convicted over the 2001 assassination of former Democratic Republic of the Congo President Laurent-Desire Kabila have been released from prison after receiving pardons from current leader Felix Tshisekedi. Among those released on Friday from the Makala prison in the capital Kinshasa\u00a0was the slain president\u2019s former aide-de-camp Colonel Eddy Kapend, who has always denied any part in the plot to murder Kabila, who was the father of Joseph Kabila, Tshisekedi\u2019s predecessor. Kapend left the prison by a jeep under escort. Another man, former intelligence chief Georges Leta, was also freed but did not appear at a release ceremony with the others due to ill health. Laurent-Desire Kabila was gunned down in his office on January 16, 2001 by one of his bodyguards, who was then immediately killed. The 22 convicted men were first handed death sentences, which were then commuted to jail terms by Tshisekedi last June.
