{"year":"2016","month":"01","event_desc":"New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany","text":"LONDON \u2014 At first, there was complete silence from officials. As rumors spread on social media, police had nothing to say about allegations of mass sexual assaults and other crimes carried out on New Year's Eve in the German city of Cologne. It was only days later that officials reported that hundreds of women were victims of assault in Cologne, Hamburg and other German cities.\n\nBut numbers that are now emerging are likely to shock a country still coming to terms with what happened in Cologne more than half a year ago. According to a leaked police document, published by Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters NDR and WDR, the previous estimates have to be dramatically revised \u2014 upward.\n\nAuthorities now think that on New Year's Eve, more than 1,200 women were sexually assaulted in various German cities, including more than 600 in Cologne and about 400 in Hamburg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 2,000 men were allegedly involved, and 120 suspects \u2014 about half of them foreign nationals who had only recently arrived in Germany \u2014 have been identified.\n\nOnly four have been convicted, but more trials are underway.\n\nOn Thursday, a court in Cologne sentenced two men in the New Year's Eve assaults. Hussein A., a 21-year-old Iraqi, and Hassan T., a 26-year-old Algerian, were handed suspended one-year sentences. Both arrived in Germany in the past two years, a court spokesman said. He declined to specify whether the two had sought asylum.\n\nOfficials have linked the sexual assaults to the influx of refugees. \"There is a connection between the emergence of this phenomenon and the rapid migration in 2015,\" Holger M\u00fcnch, president of the German Federal Crime Police Office, told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Many suspects had originally come to Germany from North African countries rather than Syria, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also predicted that many of the New Year's Eve perpetrators will never be convicted. \"We have to presume that many of those crimes will never be fully investigated.\" Germany has relatively low CCTV coverage, which makes it more difficult for investigators to identify suspects.\n\nAlthough it is not expected that significantly more CCTV cameras will be installed in the foreseeable future, other measures have been taken. Germany's Parliament passed a stricter sexual-assault law last week that will make it easier for courts to sentence those who facilitate or are involved in assaults.\n\nThe new law will be based on the premise that \"no means no,\" meaning that sexual assault can be punished as rape if the offender ignores the \"discernible contrary will\" of the victim.\n\nProtesters marched through the central train station in Cologne to call for an end to violence against women after dozens of attacks on New Year's Eve. (Video: Facebook\/Rote Antifa [Essen])\n\nLawmakers were facing intense pressure to pass the new legislation, particularly in the wake of the Cologne assaults. Most of the perpetrators in that city stand accused of groping and facilitating sex assaults as part of a group \u2014 accusations that were difficult to prosecute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stricter law is also supposed to make it easier for refugees to be deported if they are convicted in sex-assault cases \u2014 an aspect of the new law that activists and advocates for refugees have harshly criticized.\n\nHalina Wawzyniak, a lawmaker from the Left Party, told The Washington Post last week that immigration issues and sexual-assault cases should not be linked, as refugees could end up facing a \"double punishment\" by being deported. \"The debate used to be about 'no means no' \u2014 now all that is being talked about in social networks are foreigners again,\" she said.","question":"How many men were allegedly involved in the New Year's Eve assaults in Germany in 2016?","answer":"More than 2,000 men were allegedly involved in the assaults.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" Answer: The New Year's Eve assaults in Germany in 2016 allegedly involved hundreds of men, primarily in the city of Cologne, with incidents also reported in other cities.

As of 9 April, the position is still vacant.","text":"Pegida leader Lutz Bachmann deleted his Facebook profile after this picture of him styled as Adolf Hitler was unearthed.

Lutz Bachmann, 41, a butcher\u2019s son from Dresden and co-founder of the organisation, was seen as Pegida\u2019s figurehead and his resignation throws the future of the group into doubt. The picture of Bachmann posing as Hitler after a session at his hairdresser, complete with a Hitler hairstyle dyed black and parted on the right and a toothbrush moustache, went viral on Wednesday after it was published by , a local newspaper, the Dresden Morgenpost. Pegida\u2019s popularity has led to widespread fears that Germany is in the grip of a new breed of far-right ideologues, and the picture raised questions about the group\u2019s allegiance to the far-right scene. The image, which had appeared on Bachmann\u2019s Facebook page, was accompanied by the line: \u201cHe\u2019s Back,\u201d after Timur Vermes\u2019 best-selling 2012 satirical novel of the same name about Hitler. Bachmann, a publicity agent, deleted his profile shortly after being contacted by the Morgenpost. A Morgenpost reader discovered the photograph, along with what appeared to be a closed Facebook conversation between Bachmann and one of his Facebook contacts, in which he described immigrants as \u201ccattle\u201d, \u201cscumbags\u201d and \u201ctrash\u201d. The comments were posted on 19 September, aroundabout two months before the first Pegida march in Dresden. State prosecutors said on Wednesday they had begun investigating Bachmann on charges of sedition. He resigned after a meeting of the 12 members of Pegida\u2019s leadership committee at which Bachmann apologised for the picture A statement is expected to follow on Wednesday evening. Pegida spokeswoman Kathrin Oertel, told Spiegel Online Bachmann\u2019s resignation was the \u201conly possibilty for the movement\u201d. \u201cAs an association, we reject the Facebook postings made by Lutz Bachmann in September which have now come to light in the strongest possible terms. They do nothing to nurture trust in Pegida\u2019s goals or its protagonists.\u201d A spokesman for Bernd Lucke, the head of the political party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, an anti-euro party which has publicly expressed an allegiance with the aims of Pegida, said that with his \u201csad utterings and disgusting jokes\u201d, Bachmann had \u201cembarrassed the people of Pegida who have been compelled by honest concerns to take to the streets\u201d. Responding to the picture, Bachmann told Wednesday\u2019s Bild : \u201cI took the photo at the hairdresser\u2019s, for the publication of the audiobook of the satire He\u2019s Back \u2026 you need to be able to joke about yourself now and then\u201d. Asked about the derogatory comments he allegedly made about immigrants, Bachmann replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment about private matters.\u201d Bachmann, who has multiple convictions for burglary, assault and drug possession, was said by German intelligence services to be a target for Islamist terrorists who said on social media sites they intended to kill him. For that reason, a planned Pegida demonstration in Dresden on Monday, which would have been the group\u2019s 13th, was cancelled. Pegida, which has been growing from strength to strength and at its last gathering attracted 25,000 supporters, has vowed to meet again next week in the east German city. But it is unclear whether it has a future without Bachmann, who was by far its best orator, and had garnered a popular following. Legida, the group\u2019s Leipzig offshoot, will meet on Wednesday evening, with about 100,000 pro- and counter-protesters expected to gather. Nineteen counter-demonstrations and vigils have been registered with authorities. But town officials have banned the Legida marchers from taking the historical route through the city used for the peaceful anti-communist protests of 1989, which started in Leipzig and led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Anger is already high among former dissidents that the movement has hijacked the phrase \u201cWir sind das Volk\u201d or \u201cWe are the people\u201d that was chanted 25 years ago. In Pegida\u2019s first ever press conference in Dresden on Monday, Bachmann and Oertel, insisted that the group was not racist, and later in a heated television discussion distanced themselves from footage showing Pegida demonstrators delivering racist remarks. Bachmann has always been keen to stress his pro-foreigner credentials, showing photographs on his Facebook site of his Turkish best man, and saying he has \u201cMuslim friends\u201d. Meanwhile a Catholic priest who took part in a demonstration organised by the Pegida-offshoot group D\u00fcgida in the western city of Duisburg on Monday has been banned from preaching by his religious elders, after he compared the movement to the Crusades.

Germany will donate six multi-purpose helicopters to Ukraine, Berlin said on Tuesday, boosting Kyiv's assets in the Black Sea against Russia's naval fleet. Kyiv will receive six Sea King Mk41 helicopters from the German armed forces, which are expected to arrive in the country in the next six months, the German Defense Ministry said. The Sea King is a \"a proven and robust helicopter that will help the Ukrainians in many areas: from reconnaissance over the Black Sea to transporting soldiers,\" said German Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius. Germany announced the planned delivery of the helicopters at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, with around 50 of Kyiv's allies coordinating support for the country. \"It is the first German delivery of its kind,\" Pistorius added. \"Thank you, Germany!\" Ukraine's defense ministry said in a post to X. \"Together, we are stronger!\" Berlin describes the Sea King as a \"workhorse of naval aviation\" and they have been operational since the mid-1970s. Originally designed to transport troops and equipment and to conduct sea rescue missions, the Sea King has a range of around 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). The all-weather, amphibious helicopters can be kitted out with heavy machine guns for special forces missions, Germany said. The Sea Kings will improve Ukraine's airborne and naval aviation capabilities in and around the Black Sea, a key battleground in the nearly two year-old war. Kyiv has mounted repeated attacks against Moscow's Black Sea fleet, partly based on the annexed Crimean Peninsula, using its special forces to carry out amphibious landings on the territory. Ukraine has managed to largely stop Russia's fleet operating in the western Black Sea, its missiles and drones making the area dangerous for Moscow's naval forces, the British Defense Ministry said on Monday. Earlier this month, Australia said it would not send its now-retired fleet of Taipan helicopters to Ukraine, despite a request from Kyiv to take them on. Australia retired the Taipans in 2023 after a fatal training exercise crash that killed four people. \"The Ukrainians desperately need military helicopters,\" Michael Shoebridge, the director of defense and security think tank, Strategic Analysis Australia, told Sky News Australia. However, the helicopters are not in \"flying condition,\" said Australia's defense industry minister, Pat Conroy. Germany's Pistorius said on Tuesday that Berlin would also supplement Ukraine's air defenses, delivering more IRIT-T systems and Gepard anti-aircraft guns as part of the \u20ac6 billion ($6.5 billion) of military aid committed to Kyiv since February 2022. Germany is Europe's biggest contributor of military equipment to Ukraine, but has faced criticism over its refusal to send long-range Taurus missiles to the country. Maintaining Ukraine's air defenses is a \"number 1 priority,\" the German defense minister added. Germany and France said in November they would take the lead in strengthening Ukraine's air defenses, bolstering Kyiv's ground-based network. Ukraine uses a variety of air defense systems, ranging from the U.S.-provided Patriots that have intercepted Russian hypersonic missiles, to large-caliber machine guns that have often been used to shoot down the Iranian-designed Shahed kamikaze drones that Moscow frequently launches at the war-torn country. \"This year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend frontline positions, which will have an impact on the strategic situation and the war effort as a whole,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Co-leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel and AfD member Bernd Baumann | John Mcdougall\/AFP via Getty Images January 23, 2024 6:11 pm CET By James Angelos BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s top court ruled in favor of cutting state funding for an extreme-right party in a decision that is likely to further fuel an already strident debate in the country about whether legal steps should be taken to rein in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). In a landmark ruling Tuesday, the Constitutional Court said state financing for a marginal, extremist party known as Die Heimat , or The Homeland \u2014\u00a0previously known as the National Democratic Party or NPD \u2014 could be cut because the party \u201cshows disdain for the free democratic basic order\u201d and aims to replace German democracy with an authoritarian state based on Nazi-era notions of a racially unified Volksgemeinschaft , or \u201cpeople\u2019s community.\u201d The decision is amplifying an impassioned debate in Germany about whether to undertake a legal effort to counter the AfD. For weeks, politicians have weighed in on the possibility of an outright prohibition of the party. Tuesday\u2019s court decision is now sparking discussion on the possibility of revoking the party\u2019s state funding. Advertisement Advertisement The court decision \u201cwould also be a blueprint for the AfD,\u201d Markus S\u00f6der, the conservative Bavarian premier, said in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt ahead of the ruling. The domestic debate about what to do about the AfD has grown all the more intense since a report earlier this month revealed that members of party were present at a secret meeting of right-wing extremists in a hotel near the city of Potsdam in which a \u201cmaster plan\u201d to deport foreigners and \u201cunassimilated citizens\u201d en masse was discussed. Many in Germany drew parallels to similar plans made by the Nazis. That revelation prompted huge protests in Germany against right-wing radicalism and the AfD in recent days. Last weekend alone, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Germany. In Berlin, demonstrators assembled in front of the Bundestag and chanted: \u201cAll of Berlin hates the AfD!\u201d The AfD has continued to rise in polls even as it has steadily become more extreme. The party is now polling at 23 percent, according to POLITICO\u2019s Poll of Polls , and in the regions of the former East Germany, where three state elections will be held in September, the party is leading . Germany\u2019s constitution has long allowed for the prohibition of parties that \u201cseek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order.\u201d In 2017, lawmakers amended the constitution to make possible the revocation of state funding for such parties. Tuesday\u2019s ruling marks the first time the law was put into practice. The legal possibility of banning or revoking a party\u2019s funding is an outgrowth of Germany\u2019s Nazi past. In Tuesday\u2019s ruling, the court referred to the notion of Germany as a \u201cmilitant democracy,\u201d a rough concept that means the state has legal means to restrict the freedoms of authoritarian parties to prevent them from using instruments of democracy to gain power. Advertisement Advertisement The legal hurdles for banning or cutting state funding for a party remain very high. In 2017, Germany\u2019s top court decided against a ban of the NPD, arguing that, while the party intended to undermine democracy, it was so marginal it had no chance of actually doing so. In 2021, the party did so poorly in the federal election that it lost state funding. Prior to that, however, the party received considerable amounts of state money; in 2016, for instance, the party received \u20ac1.1 million. Tuesday\u2019s ruling ensures it cannot get funding for a six-year period. \u201cEven if the constitutional hurdles for future proceedings remain high, we now have another instrument to protect our democracy,\u201d said Germany\u2019s interior minister, Nancy Faeser,\u00a0following the ruling. Many mainstream politicians fear that any effort to ban the AfD or restrict its funding would be a dire tactical mistake, serving only to strengthen the party by allowing its leaders to depict their opponents as suppressing the democratic will of AfD voters.

Public outcry followed revelations that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had discussed plans to mass deport immigrants. Tens of thousands of people have gathered across Germany to protest against a far-right political party and its stance against migrants. People protested in several cities and small towns on Saturday, with some mocking the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party with signs saying \u201cFacism is not an alternative\u201d, German media reported. The protests come following an outcry after it was revealed that AfD members held a meeting with far-right activists and discussed plans to mass deport foreigners. Police said some 35,000 people joined a call under the banner \u201cDefend democracy \u2013 Frankfurt against the AfD\u201d, marching in the financial heart of Germany. A similar number, some carrying posters like \u201cNazis out\u201d, turned up in the northern city of Hanover. Protests were also held in cities including Braunschweig, Erfurt and Kassel and many smaller towns, mirroring mobilisation every day over the past week. Some 50,000 people demonstrated in Hamburg, Germany\u2019s second-largest city, on Friday, police said. In all, demonstrations have been called in about 100 locations across Germany from Friday through the weekend, including in Berlin on Sunday. Politicians, churches, and Bundesliga coaches have urged people to stand up against the AfD.    On January 10, a report by investigative outlet Correctiv, revealed that AfD members had discussed the expulsion of immigrants and \u201cnon-assimilated citizens\u201d at a meeting with other far-right activists. Among the participants at the talks was Martin Sellner, a leader of Austria\u2019s Identitarian Movement, which subscribes to the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory that claims there is a plot by non-white migrants to replace Europe\u2019s \u201cnative\u201d white population. News of the far-right gathering sent shockwaves across Germany at a time when the AfD is polling second in nationwide surveys, just months before three major regional elections in eastern Germany where their support is strongest. The anti-immigration party confirmed the presence of its members at the meeting, but has denied taking on the \u201cremigration\u201d project championed by Sellner. Co-leader Alice Weidel parted ways with one of her advisers who participated in the talks. But leading politicians, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who joined a demonstration last weekend, said any plan to expel immigrants or citizens alike amounted to \u201can attack against our democracy, and in turn, on all of us\u201d. He urged \u201call to take a stand \u2013 for cohesion, for tolerance, for our democratic Germany\u201d. Members of the country\u2019s business industry also voiced their concerns. \u201cIf everything is true as reported, then that is absolutely disgusting,\u201d said Siemens Energy\u2019s supervisory board chairman Joe Kaeser in an interview with Reuters published on Saturday, Kaeser\u2019s comments come after leaders of German companies, including chip manufacturer Infineon and chemicals maker Evonik voiced their concerns earlier this week. Highlighting lessons from Germany\u2019s history, Kaeser warned of the damage to Germany\u2019s image around the world and called on German businesses to publicly warn of the consequences.

Hier lest ihr, welche Rechte sie im Deutschen Bundestag k\u00fcnftig  haben. Die fraktionslosen Abgeordneten stimmen \u00fcber die Rechtsstellung der parlamentarischen Gruppen Die Linke und BSW ab. \u00a9 picture alliance\/dpa | Britta Pedersen Der Bundestag hat am\u00a0Freitag, 2. Februar 2024,\u00a0die\u00a0Rechtsstellung der parlamentarischen Gruppen Die Linke und BSW (kurz f\u00fcr: \u201eB\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht \u2013 F\u00fcr Vernunft und Gerechtigkeit\u201c) geregelt und einen entsprechenden Gruppenstatus beschlossen. Das Plenum hat mit der Mehrheit von SPD, B\u00fcndnis 90\/Die Gr\u00fcnen und FDP gegen die Stimmen von CDU\/CSU und AfD jeweils zwei dazu vorgelegte Beschlussempfehlungen ( 20\/10219 , 20\/10220 ) des \u00c4ltestenrates angenommen. Der \u00c4ltestenrat hatte am Donnerstag, 1. Februar, empfohlen, 28 fraktionslose Abgeordnete als Gruppe Die Linke und zehn Abgeordnete als Gruppe BSW anzuerkennen. Zwei zu den Empfehlungen vorgelegte \u00c4nderungsantr\u00e4ge mehrerer fraktionsloser Abgeordneter ( 20\/10236 , 20\/10237 ) wurden hingegen mit der breiten Mehrheit von SPD, Gr\u00fcnen, FDP, CDU\/CSU und AfD abgelehnt. In den Vorlagen hatten sich die Abgeordneten unter anderem gegen eine Beschr\u00e4nkung des Fragerechts gegen\u00fcber der Bundesregierung gewendet. Hintergrund der Regelung ist die Aufl\u00f6sung der einstigen Fraktion Die Linke im vergangenen Jahr. Nachdem mehrere Abgeordnete die Fraktion verlassen hatten und dadurch die Mindestst\u00e4rke von 37 Mitgliedern nicht mehr gegeben war, trat die Fraktion am 6. Dezember 2023 in einen sogenannten Liquidationsprozess ein. Die einstigen Parlamentarierinnen und Parlamentarier der Bundestagsfraktion sind seitdem fraktionslose Mitglieder des Deutschen Bundestages. Mit der Anerkennung als Gruppe waren f\u00fcr fraktionslose Abgeordnete in der Vergangenheit deutlich mehr Ressourcen und parlamentarische Rechte verbunden als ohne diesen Status. Rechtsstellung der Gruppen Die Linke und BSW Die Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung des Bundestages erm\u00f6glicht Abgeordneten, die sich zusammenschlie\u00dfen wollen, die Fraktionsmindestst\u00e4rke aber nicht erreichen, die Anerkennung als Gruppe. Die 28 Abgeordneten der Linken hatten diese Anerkennung am 1. Dezember, die zehn BSW-Abgeordneten am 12. Dezember 2023 bei Bundestagspr\u00e4sidentin B\u00e4rbel Bas beantragt. Beide Gruppen unterscheiden sich im Hinblick auf ihre Rechtsstellung nur dadurch, dass die Gruppe Die Linke bis zu zwei Aktuelle Stunden und die Gruppe BSW eine Aktuelle Stunde pro Jahr verlangen kann. Im Plenum sollen die Abgeordneten der Gruppe Die Linke vom Pr\u00e4sidium aus gesehen links von der SPD-Fraktion platziert werden, die Abgeordneten der Gruppe BSW links au\u00dfen neben den Abgeordneten der Gruppe Die Linke. Aussch\u00fcsse, Fragerecht und Redezeit Beide Gruppen sollen ordentliche und stellvertretende Mitglieder in die Fachaussch\u00fcsse und gegebenenfalls in deren Unteraussch\u00fcsse entsenden k\u00f6nnen und dort die gleichen Rechte haben wie die von den Fraktionen entsandten Mitglieder. Das Gleiche soll f\u00fcr die Mitgliedschaft in Untersuchungsaussch\u00fcssen und Enquete-Kommissionen gelten. Ebenso sollen beide Gruppen mit jeweils einem Mitglied im \u00c4ltestenrat vertreten sein k\u00f6nnen und dort Stimmrecht bei Beschl\u00fcssen \u00fcber innere Angelegenheiten des Deutschen Bundestages besitzen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus d\u00fcrfen die Gruppen Gesetzentw\u00fcrfe, Antr\u00e4ge sowie Entschlie\u00dfungsantr\u00e4ge einbringen und pro Kalendermonat bis zu insgesamt zehn Gro\u00dfe oder Kleine Anfragen stellen.

Omer Messinger\/Getty Images Berlin CNN \u2014 Germany\u2019s lower house of parliament voted to legalize cannabis for limited recreational use on Friday despite warnings from the opposition and medical authorities. The new rules mean adults can possess small amounts for personal use but the drug remains banned for under 18s. In total, 407 German lawmakers voted in favor of the new regulation, 226 lawmakers voted against and four lawmakers abstained from Friday\u2019s vote. The passage of the bill follows a controversial national debate about the pros and cons of allowing easier access to the drug. The move makes Germany the third country in Europe \u2013 after Malta and Luxembourg \u2013 to legalize the drug for recreational use, removing cannabis from the official list of banned substances. The Netherlands bans possession of drugs but some municipalities permit them to be sold in coffee shops under its so-called policy of toleration. In other countries, like Australia and the US, rules vary in different localities. Under the new legislation, put forward by Germany\u2019s ruling coalition party, adults can cultivate up to three plants for private consumption and be allowed to possess 50g at one time at home, and 25g in public, starting from April 1. From July 1, cannabis would also be available in licensed not-for-profit clubs with no more than 500 members \u2013 all of whom would have to be adults. Only club members would be allowed to consume their output. \u201cThe aim is to crack down on the black market and drugs-related crime, reduce the amount of dealing and cut the number of users,\u201d Germany\u2019s Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said ahead of the vote. The German government said that cannabis would remain illegal for minors and highly restricted for young adults, adding that consuming the drug near schools and playgrounds would be illegal. \u201dChild and youth protection is at the heart of what this law is meant to achieve,\u201d Lauterbach said. \u201cNobody should misunderstand this law: cannabis consumption is being legalized, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t dangerous,\u201d Germany\u2019s health minister said. Germany\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the country\u2019s largest opposition party, has opposed the new legislation. CDU Lawmaker Tino Sorge said in a statement published Thursday, \u201cInstead of protecting children and young people, the coalition is acting like a state drug dealer.\u201d There has also been considerable criticism of the plans from the German Medical Associations (GMA). \u201cThe legalization of cannabis leads to more consumption and trivializes the associated risks. Cannabis can be addictive and cause serious developmental damage. This country does not need cannabis legalization,\u201d President of the GMA Klaus Reinhardt said Friday before the vote.","question":"What did Germany's lower house of parliament vote to legalize in March 2024?","answer":"Germany's lower house of parliament voted to legalize limited recreational cannabis use.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" Answer: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to information about events that occurred after my last training data in mid-2023.

Michael Probst\/AP Berlin CNN \u2014 Huge crowds of protesters have descended on cities in Germany as calls for a ban on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) gain momentum. Tens of thousands had already braved sub-zero temperatures during the week to protest against the party after\u00a0it emerged senior AfD members\u00a0discussed a plan\u00a0to deport migrants en masse in revelations that have been compared to the Nazi era. Public anger continued throughout weekend. Crowds of up to 35,000 gathered in Frankfurt on Saturday under the banner \u201cDefend democracy \u2013 Frankfurt against the AfD,\u201d while a similar number of people turned out in the northern city of Hanover, the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported. Significant crowds were also seen in Stuttgard, Dortmund and Nuremberg. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people again took to the streets, with rallies in Berlin, Munich and Cologne, as well as in the cities of\u00a0Leipzig and Dresden, which are considered more traditional AfD voting strongholds, according to Reuters. Nearly 100,000 people attended the rally in Munich at its peak on Sunday, local police said. Nearly 30,000 people gathered at the beginning of the Berlin protest, with more people arriving as the event continued, according to Reuters. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has welcomed the protests as \u201cgood and right.\u201d In a video message issued Friday night, Scholz said that he tries to imagine \u201chow the more than 20 million citizens who have a history of migration feel\u201d about the deportation plan. A \u2018master plan\u2019 for deportation Many Germans are outraged by reports that senior members of the AfD discussed a \u201dmaster plan\u201d for the mass deportation of German\u00a0asylum-seekers and German\u00a0citizens of foreign origin during a meeting late last year. The gathering of AfD members, neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists took place at a lakeside hotel outside the city of Potsdam on November 25. It did not come to light until January 10, when the meeting was revealed by the investigative journalism network Correctiv, sparking a wave of protests across Germany. In its report uncovering the private meeting, Correctiv wrote: \u201cThe events that will occur today at the hotel\u00a0Landhaus Adlon\u00a0will seem like a dystopian drama. Only they\u2019re real. \u201cAnd they will show what can happen when the frontmen of right-wing extremist ideas, representatives of the AfD and wealthy sympathisers come together.\u201d \u201cThe meeting was meant to remain secret at all costs,\u201d the report\u00a0said. The AfD denies that such plans are part of its policy and the AfD leadership has sought to distance itself from the gathering, calling it a \u201cprivate event and not an AfD party event.\u201d People hold a banner that reads: \"Never again is now! You have to do anti-fascism yourself,\" in Erfurt on Saturday. Jacob Schroeter\/dpa\/AP People protest in Frankfurt on Saturday, holding a banner reading \"Never again 1933!\" Michael Probst\/AP Alice Weidel, the co-chair of the party, announced Monday that she was parting\u00a0ways with her adviser Roland Hartwig\u00a0\u2013 who, according to Correctiv, participated in the talks. The AfD\u00a0told\u00a0CNN that\u00a0the two\u00a0\u201cseparated with mutual agreement.\u201d However, the idea of a \u201cmass deportation plan\u201d was openly supported by one AfD representative in the state of Brandenberg. Ren\u00e9 Springer took to his account on X to write: \u201cWe will return foreigners to their homeland. Millions of times. This is not a secret plan. It\u2019s a promise. \u201cFor more security. For more justice. To preserve our identity. For Germany.\u201d Many have pointed out that the mass deportation plan is evocative of the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945, when millions were transported against their will to concentration, forced labor and extermination camps. \u201cThe plans to expel millions of people are reminiscent of the darkest chapter in German history,\u201d Christian D\u00fcrr, parliamentary group leader of the neoliberal Free Democrats Party (FDP), wrote on X. Rika von Gierke, a spokesperson and activist preparing for a demonstration in Frankfurt on Saturday, told CNN that the AfD\u2019s plans \u201cbring back terrible memories.\u201d \u201cI saw a banner yesterday which said, \u2018Now is the time to show what we would have done instead of our grandparents.\u2019 \u201cThere are parallels. It\u2019s definitely time to take a stand against the right and start opposing the anti-democratic forces.\u201d She added that members of the AfD had been \u201cmaking concrete plans to deport millions of people from Germany.\u00a0We clearly see that these plans are inhumane and an attack on our democracy and the rule of law and on many of our fellow citizens.\u201d Kazin Abaci, a protest organizer from Hamburg, told CNN that the demonstrations are important \u201cbecause we are dealing with a very strong right-wing extremism and neo-Nazi networks in Germany.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis meeting in Potsdam has shown once again how urgent it is that not only politicians speak out, but that a strong signal is sent from the middle of society to defend democracy and our state.\u201d Chancellor Scholz and Foreign Minister Baerbock are pictured at the \"Potsdam defends itself\" demonstrations. Sebastian Christoph Gollnow\/picture alliance\/dpa\/Getty Images Asked whether he thought the protests would encourage people to stop voting for the AfD, Abaci was hopeful. \u201cThere is a core group of AfD voters who vote for this party out of conviction, but there are of course also voters who have voted for AfD out of protest. \u201cBut now is the time for them to wake up and realize that we are not dealing with a protest party, but with a right-wing extremist party. Our rally could help these people to finally wake up.\u201d Rallies in Potsdam Sunday were attended by Scholz, the chancellor, as well as Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Baerbock said she was there as someone who \u201cstands for democracy and against old and new fascism,\u201d while Scholz this week\u00a0thanked the demonstrators for taking to the streets \u201cagainst racism, hate speech and in favour of our liberal democracy.\u201d Paving a way to outlaw the AfD could prove difficult and risks backfiring.  German politicians this week discussed the possibility of calling on the constitutional court to implement a ban. The German constitution says that parties that seek to undermine the \u201cfree democratic basic order\u201d should be deemed unconstitutional.

Matthias Ecke, 41, a member of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was hit and kicked on Friday by a group of four people while putting up posters in Dresden, capital of the eastern state of Saxony, police said. An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation. Sign up here. Shortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as severe. \"Democracy is threatened by this kind of thing,\" Scholz told a convention of European socialists in Berlin. The attacks exemplify increased violence in Germany in recent years, often from the far-right, targeting especially leftist politicians. The BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer, a conservative, said such aggression and attempts at intimidation recalled the darkest era of German history, a reference to Nazi rule. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German conservative minister, and the Italian head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, both condemned the attack on Ecke. \"The culprits must be brought to account,\" von der Leyen said on X. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser vowed \"tough action and further protective measures\" in response to the attacks. FAR-RIGHT SUPPORT The heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement in which they blamed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) for the rise in violence. \"These people and their supporters bear responsibility for what is happening in this country,\" they said. The AfD did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment. The AfD has seen a surge in support in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide. It is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September. Nationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January. Greens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420. Theresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere. The Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.

Authorities have searched the homes and workplaces of the two suspects who stand accused of working for a foreign secret service. One of them, identified as Dieter S., had since October 2023 discussed possible plots with a person linked to the Russian secret service, prosecutors said on Thursday. Sign up here. Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest suppliers of military aid since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and is a major target for Russian spying operations, authorities have said. \"We can never accept that such espionage activities take place in Germany,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told a news conference following an informal EU summit in Brussels. \"So we also have our own defense mechanisms to uncover them, as we always do,\" he added. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said suspicions that Putin was \"recruiting agents from us to carry out attacks on German soil is extremely serious. We will not allow Putin to bring his terror to Germany\". Germany summoned the Russian ambassador over the arrests. The Russian embassy in Germany referred to the incident as a \"provocation\" and said that Berlin had provided no evidence of the detainees' links to Russia. \"We reject attempts to find the involvement of Russian special services in the development of alleged plans to attack military facilities located in Germany, including American military bases, as absurd and ridiculous,\" the embassy said on its Facebook page. loading The Kremlin had earlier said it had no information about the issue. ATTACKS ON MILITARY FACILITIES Dieter S. had been prepared to carry out bomb and arson attacks on military facilities, including those operated by U.S. forces, prosecutors said, adding that he took photos and videos of military transport and equipment. A second person, Alexander J., began helping him from March at the latest, prosecutors said. According to Spiegel magazine, the facilities included the Grafenwoehr army base in the southern state of Bavaria, where Ukrainian soldiers receive training to use U.S. Abrams tanks . U.S., allied and partner training missions at Grafenwoehr, including the training of Ukrainians, continue, a U.S. military spokesperson said, but referred inquiries about the arrests to the German authorities. The prosecutors suspect Dieter S., whose last name has not been disclosed due to German privacy laws, was a fighter for Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine from December 2014 to September 2016 in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. He was in possession of a firearm, prosecutors said. In a separate case, prosecutors last month charged an officer in Germany's military procurement agency with attempting to pass secret information to Russian intelligence. News of Thursday's arrests coincided with a surprise trip by German Economy Minister Robert Habeck to Ukraine. Germany also issued an urgent appeal this week for countries to help shore up Ukraine's air defences as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. \"We will continue to provide massive support to Ukraine and will not allow ourselves to be intimidated,\" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said.

Franziska Giffey, the city\u2019s top economic official, a former mayor and an ex-federal minister, was attacked at an event in a Berlin library on Tuesday by a man who approached her from behind and hit her with a bag containing a hard device, police said. Giffey was taken to a hospital and treated for head and neck pain, police said. A 74-year-old man was detained and police searched his home, police said. They said the suspect was known to police, but did not give any indication for a motive. Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner strongly condemned the attack. \u201cAnyone who attacks politicians is attacking our democracy,\u201d said Wegner, according to German news agency dpa. \u201cWe will not tolerate this. We will oppose all forms of violence, hatred and agitation and protect our democracy.\u201d Giffey wrote on Instagram that \u201cwe live in a free and democratic country in which everyone is free to express their opinion ... and yet there is a clear limit. And that is violence against people who hold a different opinion, for whatever reason, in whatever form.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Police in central Germany hunt for a suspect on the run after 2 people were shot dead A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor \u201cThey are a transgression of boundaries that we as a society must resolutely oppose,\u201d she said. Later on Wednesday, Giffey, protected by several bodyguards, told reporters at a public event in Berlin that she was feeling fine but that \u201cwe also have to make it possible for us to live in a country where those who bear social and political responsibility can move freely.\u201d Last week, a candidate from the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz was beaten up in the eastern city of Dresden while campaigning for next month\u2019s election for the European Parliament and had to undergo surgery. Police detained four suspects, aged between 17 and 18, and said that the same group had apparently attacked a Greens party worker minutes before they attacked Matthias Ecke. At least one of the teens is said to be linked to far-right groups, security officials said. Also on Tuesday, a 47-year-old Green Party politician was attacked by two people while putting up election posters in Dresden, dpa reported. The incidents have raised political tensions in Germany. Both government and opposition parties say their members and supporters have faced a wave of physical and verbal attacks in recent months, and have called on police to step up protection for politicians and election rallies. In February, the German Parliament said in a report there were a total of 2,790 attacks on elected representatives in 2023. Representatives of The Greens were disproportionally affected in 1,219 cases, those from the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, in 478 cases and representatives of the SPD in 420 cases. The country\u2019s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, who is a member of The Greens, was prevented from disembarking a ferry for hours by a group of angry farmers in January, and the vice president of the German Parliament, Katrin Goering-Eckardt, also from The Greens, was prevented from leaving an event in the state of Brandenburg last week when an angry crowd blocked her car. Germany\u2019s federal interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said after a special meeting of the country\u2019s 16 state interior ministers on the issue of violence on Tuesday that possible measures included tightening Germany\u2019s criminal law in order to \u201cpunish anti-democratic acts more severely,\u201d Many of the incidents have taken place in the former communist east of the country, where Scholz\u2019s government is deeply unpopular. The Interior Ministry in the state of Saxony said it had registered 112 election-related crimes so far this year, including 30 against elected officials or representatives. Mainstream parties have accused AfD of links to violent neo-Nazi groups and of fomenting an intimidating political climate . One of its leaders, Bjoern Hoecke, is currently on trial for using a banned Nazi slogan. Alternative for Germany, which campaigns against immigration and European integration, is expected to make gains in the European polls as well as in elections in Saxony and two other eastern German states in the fall.

A court has convicted one of the best known figures in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of using a Nazi slogan in a speech and ordered him to pay a fine. Judges fined Bjorn Hocke 13,000 euros ($14,000) on Tuesday for using the phrase \u201cAlles fur Deutschland\u201d (\u201cEverything for Germany\u201d) during a 2021 campaign rally. Once a motto of the Sturmabteilung, or SA, paramilitary group, which played a key role in Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power, the phrase is illegal in modern-day Germany along with the Nazi salute and other slogans and symbols from that era. Hocke argued that it is an \u201ceveryday saying\u201d. He testified at the trial that he is \u201ccompletely innocent\u201d. The former history teacher described himself as a \u201claw-abiding citizen\u201d. The verdict was delivered months before regional elections in the eastern state of Thuringia, in which Hocke plans to run for governor. The charge can carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison. Prosecutors had sought a six-month suspended sentence while defence lawyers argued for an acquittal. The 52-year-old Hocke is an influential figure on the hard right of the AfD and is considered an \u201cextremist\u201d by German intelligence services. He previously called Berlin\u2019s Holocaust memorial a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d. He has led the AfD\u2019s regional branch in Thuringia since 2013, the year the party was founded, and is due to lead its campaign in state elections set for September 1. A party tribunal in 2018 rejected a bid to have him expelled. Prosecutor Benedikt Bernzen said in Tuesday\u2019s closing arguments that Hocke had used Nazi vocabulary \u201cstrategically and systematically\u201d in the past. Hocke accused prosecutors of not looking for exonerating circumstances and argued that freedom of opinion is limited in Germany.

A party spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that the AfD \u2019s federal steering committee had banned the politician from making public appearances before elections for the European Parliament , scheduled for June 6-9. Krah had told Italian newspaper La Repubblica last weekend: \u201cI will never say that everyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal.\u201d Posting on X on Wednesday, Krah said his statements were being \u201cmisused as a pretext to harm our party\u201d, declaring that he would refrain from further election campaign appearances and would resign as a member of the party\u2019s steering committee.

Krah found himself at the centre of the crisis after one of his aides in the European Parliament was arrested on suspicion of spying for China . Krah and another AfD candidate for the European Union elections, Petr Bystron, have also denied allegations they accepted money to spread pro-Russian positions on a Moscow-financed news website. German prosecutors have launched a preliminary investigation against Krah over reports of suspicious payments received from China and Russia.

Her third, Go, Went, Gone, was longlisted for the International Booker prize in 2018.

The trial of nine men and women allegedly connected to the so-called Reichsb\u00fcrger movement got under way on Tuesday with those accused of being ringleaders appearing before judges. Prosecutors say they hatched a conspiracy to violently overthrow the German government and accuse them of being members of a \"terrorist organisation\". Investigators say the plotters had planned to storm the Reichstag and that they were conspiracy theorists who believed the country was being run by a \u201cdeep state\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re not terrorists. They\u2019re slightly crazy,\" said defence lawyer Roman von Alvensleben. \"They\u2019ve followed conspiracy theories and they found each other during corona in their resistance against corona measures.\u201d The hearing in Frankfurt on Tuesday is the highest profile of three trials following nationwide raids in 2022. The case is seen as highly significant because of both its size and the potential insights it could give into far-right networks. The Reichsb\u00fcrger, or citizens of the Reich, is a loose, disparate group that denies the legitimacy of the modern German state \u2013 even claiming it was installed by the victorious Allied powers after World War Two. Domestic intelligence has estimated that around 23,000 people follow the movement which displays \"antisemitic attitudes\" and a \u201chigh affinity\u201d for weapons. It\u2019s alleged that those on trial followed Reichsb\u00fcrger narratives and drew up plans for an armed group to enter the national parliament in Berlin and arrest MPs on what was called \u201cDay X\u201d. According to the indictment, there were discussions about whether the death of the late Queen Elizabeth II was a \u201csignal\u201d. Much of the attention has focused on Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, a real estate developer from Frankfurt who is descended from an aristocratic family, the House of Reuss. It\u2019s alleged the 72-year-old held meetings of the group\u2019s \"central council\" at his home in east Germany and was earmarked as the \"head of state\", had the coup succeeded. But his lawyer, Roman von Alvensleben, said that while Prince Reuss had invited people to his castle for political discussions, he was incapable of being behind such a scheme. \u201cHe denies he was ever violent. He denies that he ever wanted to kill people or made any plans to do so,\" he said. According to the indictment, he\u2019d have been responsible for negotiating a peace treaty with the Allies \u2013 and had appeared at the Russian consulate in Leipzig, as part of attempts to reach out to Moscow. Also standing trial is former judge and MP for the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, Birgit Malsack-Winkemann. Prosecutors say she used her access rights to parliamentary properties to \u201csmuggle\u201d in co-conspirators to scout the area \u2013 and was responsible for the justice department on the group\u2019s central council. Their plans to reorganise Germany\u2019s political structures would have involved a take-over of institutions at a state and local level. It is alleged that members were aware that this would \u201cinvolve killing people\u201d. The \"council\" was to act as the central body while a \"military arm\" \u2013 consisting of 286 units \u2013 would have enforced the new order nationwide. Prosecutors say the group had access to a \u201cmassive arsenal\u201d of weapons including firearms, ammunition as well as night vision devices and handcuffs.

The Identity and Democracy group said it was expelling lawmakers from the Alternative for Germany party with immediate effect because of growing controversy surrounding its lead candidate in the June 6-9 polls. \u201cThe ID Group no longer wants to be associated with the incidents involving Maximilian Krah,\u201d it said in a statement released by Italy\u2019s La Lega, a member of the group. The expulsion of the German party from its European Union umbrella group exposed deep rifts within the far right across the 27-nation bloc little more than two weeks ahead of elections in which they were supposed to surge. It was not immediately clear whether the spat would influence voters. A swing to the right could raise questions about the bloc\u2019s future direction in issues from climate protection and immigration to support for Ukraine. The Alternative for Germany, or AfD, said it remained \u201coptimistic about the election evening and the days to follow.\u201d RELATED COVERAGE Pope Francis\u2019 conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo announces he will leave club, return to Germany after 2025 season Photos of a German nutcracker maker focused on the US amid Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cTo be politically effective in Brussels, cooperation with aligned parties is essential.

The party said his missteps had led to \u201cmassive damage\u201d and that he would resign from its board. However, he remains a candidate for the European election. Krah, 47, had already been under scrutiny after authorities in Brussels searched his offices at the European Parliament in connection with one of his assistants who was arrested last month on suspicion of spying for China. German media have alleged that Krah has had personal ties to China and also Russia. AfD had been riding high in opinion polls in Germany last year and also hopes to make big gains in state election in the east of the country in the fall. However, it has become less popular this year after millions of Germans protested against its radical far-right stance and as the negative headlines have mounted. Last month, the No. 2 on AfD\u2019s list for the European Parliament election, Petr Bystron, denied allegations that he may have received money from a pro-Russian network.

Prosecutors in the western city of Duesseldorf said they confiscated the 35.5 metric tons (39 U.S. tons) of cocaine last year following a tip from Colombian authorities. They added they found 25 tons of cocaine in the port of the northern city of Hamburg, another 8 tons in the Dutch port of Rotterdam and almost 3 tons in Colombia. The drugs were hidden among vegetables and fruit. The drug seizures had not previously been announced. The suspects \u2014 aged between 30 and 54 \u2014 were arrested in recent weeks and are believed to have been behind the smuggling. The seven include German, Azerbaijani, Bulgarian, Moroccan, Turkish and Ukrainian nationals, the prosecutors said in a statement. Their identities were not given in line with German privacy rules.

The measures would have banned EU member states from re-exporting Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) from EU ports and financing planned Arctic and Baltic LNG terminals. German officials reportedly expressed concern about an expanded measure that would force EU companies to guarantee their customers cannot go on to sell sanctioned goods to Russia. This restriction previously only applied to firearms, military equipment, and dual-use goods with both a military and civilian application. Berlin is concerned that the expansion of this measure to non-dual-use civilian products, such as chemicals or metalworking equipment, could harm German small businesses. Belgium was forced to split talks on the new sanctions package into two separate discussions following Germany's opposition to new sanctions against Belarus. Both France and Germany opposed EU sanctions on Belarus , which were introduced to close a trade loophole that has allowed Russia to import luxury cars and other banned goods produced in Western countries. This latest package would have been the 14th round of EU sanctions against Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. An anonymous source told Politico that the European Commission is now working with the German chancellery to convince Berlin to lift the veto.

Tens of thousands of people opposed to the AfD gathered in the city of Essen, local media reported, with police drafted in from around the country in a bid to prevent disorder. Local police said two officers were \"kicked in the head\", seriously injured and taken to hospital during the violence, which began in the early hours of Saturday morning before the official demonstration had started.

Delegates were seen being ushered towards the venue by riot police after some protesters attempted to prevent the conference from beginning by blocking the road. Police in Essen said two of its riot officers were seriously injured. \"The officers were kicked while they were still lying on the ground,\" the force said. \"[They] had to be taken to hospital. [We] are currently evaluating video recordings to identify the perpetrators.\" The force said a further seven officers suffered minor injuries.

The legislation aims to counter Islamist and anti-Semitic hate crimes. https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/4hX8N Critics have likened the measures to tactics employed by authoritarian regimes Image: Daniel Kubirski\/picture alliance Advertisement German government ministers on Wednesday agreed on draft legislation to simplify the deportation process for individuals who express support for terrorism, Germany's Interior Ministry said. The move comes in reaction to online hate posts that celebrated the Hamas attack on Israel and other terrorist incidents. What is the proposed deportation change? The draft law would allow deportation if someone is considered to have approved of a single terrorist offense. No criminal conviction would be necessary for an individual to be deported. Expressions of approval could include not only posting of hateful content on social media\u00a0but also marking a hate post with a \"like\" or other positive reaction on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. Chancellor Olaf Scholz had announced plans to change the law, allowing deportations to countries such as Afghanistan and Syria, after a deadly knife attack on an anti-Islam rally in Mannheim, in which a policeman died . Promoting and praising\u00a0terrorism was a \"slap in the face for the victims, their families and our democratic order\", he said. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser put forward the changes, arguing that Berlin was \"taking tough action against Islamist and anti-Semitic hate crime online.\" \"It is very clear to us that Islamist agitators who are mentally living in the Stone Age have no place in our country,\" Faeser told the Funke media\u00a0group before Wednesday's cabinet meeting. \"Anyone who does not have a German passport and glorifies terrorist acts here must \u2014\u00a0wherever possible \u2014 be expelled.\" Concern about freedom of speech The draft law, which still needs to be passed by parliament, says\u00a0that glorifying acts of terror online fuels a climate of violence, which\u00a0can encourage extremists and violent criminals. However, critics say the draft excessively clamps down on freedom of speech and said the measures were similar to tactics used by authoritarian regimes. Clara B\u00fcnger of the socialist Left Party\u00a0in parliament said the move was the culmination of a worrying trend.

Die Person sei nicht trotz Kenntnis der Anordnung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts ausgeliefert worden, sagte die stellvertretende Beh\u00f6rdenleiterin Simone Herbeth am Mittwoch im Rechtsausschuss des Berliner Abgeordnetenhauses. \"Die Auslieferung war abgeschlossen, bevor die Entscheidung aus Karlsruhe bei uns eingegangen ist\", so die Leitende Oberstaatsanw\u00e4ltin. Die Beh\u00f6rde habe auch keine Informationen dazu gehabt, dass die Verteidigung eine einstweilige Verf\u00fcgung gegen die Auslieferung anstrebe, so Herbeth. Zugleich betonte sie, dass das Berliner Kammergericht der Auslieferung erst zugestimmt h\u00e4tte, nachdem Ungarn bestimmte Garantien gegeben habe. Demnach gibt es die Zusage, dass die Person bei einer Verurteilung ihre Haftstrafe verb\u00fc\u00dfen kann. Zudem d\u00fcrften deutsche Diplomaten die Bedingungen der Untersuchungshaft jederzeit kontrollieren. Ein mutma\u00dfliches Mitglied einer linksextremistischen Gruppe ist nach Ungarn ausgeliefert worden. Das Bundesverfassungsgericht wollte die Auslieferung stoppen, doch eine Eilentscheidung kam zu sp\u00e4t. Der Fall wirft Fragen auf. Von Max Bauer, ARD-Rechtsredaktion Maja T., 23, in Jena geboren, sich selbst als non-bin\u00e4r identifizierend, ist in der Nacht zum 28. Juni nach Ungarn ausgeliefert worden. Die Beh\u00f6rden dort werfen Maja T. vor, seit 2017 Mitglied einer kriminellen Vereinigung zu sein, deren Ziel es gewesen sein soll, Sympathisanten der extremen Rechten anzugreifen. Maja T. wurde im Dezember 2023 in Berlin festgenommen und sa\u00df in Sachsen in Haft. Die Bundesanwaltschaft ermittelt deswegen ebenfalls gegen Maja T.. Aufgrund des Auslieferungsersuchens aus Ungarn stellte sie ihr Verfahren zur\u00fcck. Nachdem Ungarn die geforderten Garantien gegeben hat, habe das Kammergericht Berlin am Donnerstagnachmittag der Auslieferung zugestimmt, die die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft beantragt hatte. Diese wurde in Windeseile mit einem Hubschrauber vollzogen. Ab 6:50 Uhr befand sich die Person laut Herbeth \"nicht mehr auf deutschem Hoheitsgebiet\", sondern in \u00d6sterreich. Damit habe die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft nicht mehr reagieren k\u00f6nnen auf die Entscheidung der Karlsruher Richter. Am Freitagmorgen haben die Berliner Beh\u00f6rden eine mutma\u00dflich linksextremistische Person an Ungarn ausgeliefert. Nach verh\u00e4ngter Strafe sollte sie nach Deutschland zur\u00fcckgebracht werden. Das Bundesverfassungsgericht fordert eine fr\u00fchere R\u00fcckkehr. Diese haben die Auslieferung untersagt - allerdings erst am Freitagvormittag. Kritiker reden von einer \"Nacht und Nebel-Aktion\". Laut Staatsanw\u00e4ltin Herbeth w\u00e4hlte die s\u00e4chsische Polizei als Transportmittel einen Hubschrauber wegen m\u00f6glicher Sicherheitsrisiken etwa durch St\u00f6rungen aus der linken Szene. F\u00fcr die Fraktionen von Linke und Gr\u00fcnen blieb deren Angaben zufolge unverst\u00e4ndlich, warum die Auslieferung mit einer derartigen Eile vollzogen wurde, ohne die Entscheidung des h\u00f6chsten deutschen Gerichts im Eilverfahren abzuwarten. \"Die Beh\u00f6rden haben hier bewusst Tempo gemacht, um einen erwartbaren Eilbeschluss des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zuvorzukommen\", sagte der rechtspolitische Sprecher der Linken, Sebastian Schl\u00fcsselburg am Mittwoch. Die Gr\u00fcnen verwiesen vor allem auf die Gefahren f\u00fcr Maja T. angesichts dessen, dass Ungarn \"ein offen queerfeindlicher Staat\" sei. Die Justizsenatorin Felor Badenberg (CDU) \u00e4u\u00dferte sich bislang nicht zu dem Vorgang. Schl\u00fcsselburg forderte sie auf, Stellung zu beziehen. Er k\u00fcndigte an, den Fall am Donnerstag in der Sitzung des Abgeordnetenhauses erneut zu thematisieren.

Bis zur einer Verurteilung in einem rechtsstaatlichen Verfahren gilt n\u00e4mlich die Unschuldsvermutung. Klar ist hingegen der begangene Rechtsbruch Berliner Beh\u00f6rden. Mir macht es mehr Angst wenn staatliche Beh\u00f6rden, die mit einer unglaublichen Machtf\u00fclle ausgestattet sind, schwere Straftaten begehen. M\u00f6glicherweise absichtlich. Es ist schon erstaunlich, in einem Zusammenhang wird mit dem Wort deportieren ein gro\u00dfes Szenario gezeichnet und im anderen Zusammenhang wird beschwichtigt.. Sollte ich in meinem ersten Kommentar, Ihrer Ansicht nach,gegen die Netiquette des RBB versto\u00dfen haben, so wenden Sie sich an den RBB. Danke Niemand spricht mehr \u00fcber die begangenen Gewalttaten. Erstaunlich eigentlich... \"Die Auslieferung einer Straft\u00e4terin ist nach Recht und Gesetz abgelaufen.\" Das sieht das h\u00f6chste deutsche Gericht eben nicht. Man wollte die Auslieferung nicht nur verhindern, es fordert auch die R\u00fcckholung von Maja T. \"Allerdings forderte noch am Freitagvormittag das Bundesverfassungsgericht im Eilverfahren, die Auslieferung m\u00fcsse wieder r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig gemacht werden. Die Berliner Generalstaatsanwaltschaft m\u00fcsse erwirken, dass der deutsche Staatsangeh\u00f6rige zur\u00fcck in die Bundesrepublik gebracht wird, entschied das Gericht am Freitagvormittag in Karlsruhe.\" Die Berliner Beh\u00f6rden haben demnach ganz klar Rechtsbeugung begangen und die Verantwortlichen m\u00fcssen zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden. Genau das ist keine Demokratie wenn die Rechte eines Angeklagten mit einer \"Nacht und Nebel Aktion\" unterlaufen werden. Zu einer Demokratie geh\u00f6ren n\u00e4mlich auch die Wahrung der Rechte, auch f\u00fcr Tatverd\u00e4chtige. Sie und andere betreiben hier eine unzul\u00e4ssige Vorverurteilung. Zur G\u00fcte, schauen Sie bitte erstmal was das lat.\/franz. Wort \"deportieren\" auf Deutsch bedeutet und ob Meinungen wie beispielsweise auch ihre vom \"Medienstaatsvertrag\" unber\u00fchrt sind. Genau das ist Demokratie! Wenn jemand Verbrechen begeht, muss er sich vor Gericht daf\u00fcr verantworten, auch im Ausland. Heulen hilft nichts, nur weil die eigene politische \u00dcberzeugung angekratzt wird. Vor Gericht sind alle gleich. Unser Rechtssystem geh\u00f6rt zu den Errungenschaften der Demkratie. Beim \"b\u00fc\u00dfen\" ist es in diesem Fall leider zu erwarten, dass Maja T. keinen fairen Prozess bekommt, vielleicht nicht einmal faire Haftbedingungen. Daher auch das Unverst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr diese \"Nacht und Nebel-Aktion\"... Was soll diese Emp\u00f6rung. Die Auslieferung einer Straft\u00e4terin ist nach Recht und Gesetz abgelaufen. Es gibt zum Gl\u00fcck (noch) keine \"Sonderrechte\" f\u00fcr \"Linke\" und \"Gr\u00fcne\". Und mir machen Leute Angst, die andere Menschen einfach so verletzen, zusammenschlagen und auch deren Tod in Kauf nehmen. Und auch Leute die sowas relativieren. W\u00e4re die \u00fcberstellte Person dem rechten Spektrum zuzuordnen, w\u00fcrden diejenigen, die sich jetzt beklagen jubeln. \"Aus der Gef\u00e4ngnisszelle mit einem Hubschrauber\".

La Roja won all seven games without needing penalties, a record at a European Championship. A 2-1 win over England in the final made them European champions for an unprecedented fourth time. And they did it the hard way, beating every other European nation who have ever won a World Cup - Italy, Germany, France and England, plus beaten 2018 finalists Croatia - on the way to glory in Berlin. In Rodri they had the player of the tournament. In teenage sensation Lamine Yamal they had the young player of the tournament. Dani Olmo shared the Golden Boot. Yamal had the most assists. It is easy to forget they did not come into the tournament as one of the absolute favourites, with England and France the two tipped for glory.

It was not the same style of Spain team which dominated football more than a decade ago - winning Euros 2008 and 2012, and the 2010 World Cup. That team was based on passing teams off the park - with geniuses Xavi and Andres Iniesta in midfield - but wingers are crucial to this team. Nico Williams scored the opener and substitute Mikel Oyarzabal netted the late winner - with Yamal setting up Williams' goal. Williams and Yamal, good friends, had their birthdays on Friday and Saturday - turning 22 and 17 respectively. Barcelona's Yamal is the youngest player to ever play at, score at, assist at and win a European Championship. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton, who won one cap for England, said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It is a good thing for football that Spain won the tournament with the brand they have played.\" BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who used to play for Barcelona, said:  \"It is a hard defeat for England to take but in some ways, it is a victory for attacking football.\" Former Spain midfielder Juan Mata, on BBC One, added: \"We played great football, always tried to win the games and I think we deserve to win this tournament, \"We have young players and older players. It is not only a team for the present, but also a team for the future. \"They are playing such a high level now. \"We are so proud of them and really believe they can keep growing and believing and keep winning trophies.\" Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague said: \"Spain surprised me again. \"They said 'we are going at it without fear by being brave and courageous' - that is what has won them the tournament.\" 'Spain a team compared to the individuals of England' This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

They changed formation midway through the Euros and often improved when players like Ollie Watkins and Cole Palmer, who scored big goals, came off the bench. Southgate had the Premier League's player of the year Phil Foden, La Liga's player of the year Jude Bellingham and the Bundesliga's top scorer Harry Kane in his squad. Spain, in contrast, had two centre-backs who will be playing in Saudi Arabia next season and several players from sixth-placed La Liga side Real Sociedad. Marc Cucurella, much-maligned at Chelsea, ended up being the tournament's best left-back. Only one player from each of Real Madrid and Barcelona were in Spain's starting XI.

England are bits and pieces.\" Ex-England defender Micah Richards agreed: \"What's great about this Spain team, they know their roles and how to fit in. With England at times, we're sort of just getting our best players on the pitch. \"This Spanish side just managed to find a way and pick the players who are going to impact in this system.\" Former England defender Matt Upson, who scored against Germany at the 2010 World Cup, said: \"Spanish subs come on and you see more of the same - it is a system. \"We want an English player to come on and change it - that speaks a lot for the two teams.\" De la Fuente deserves much credit This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The coalition parties have agreed on a draft budget. (Kay Nietfeld\/dpa via AP) By STEPHEN GRAHAM Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) \u2014 The German government said Friday it has reached agreement on the budget for 2025 and a stimulus package for Europe\u2019s largest economy, easing a monthslong squabble that threatened to upend Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s center-left coalition. Scholz, a Social Democrat, and leaders of the Free Democrats and Greens reached agreement on plans including higher spending on defense and affordable housing after marathon talks that dragged into the early hours of Friday. Scholz said ministers would formally approve the plan at a Cabinet meeting later this month. By balancing security, social cohesion and economic growth, Scholz said the budget was designed to reassure citizens unsettled by the war in Ukraine, the impacts of climate change and irregular migration, and offer an alternative to the \u201cdivisive\u201d policies of far-right parties making gains across Europe. \u201cWe don\u2019t need \u2018either-or\u2019 politics,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe need support for Ukraine and stable pensions, the modernization of industry and affordable energy, a strong army and good roads and stable bridges.\u201d Scholz replaced long-serving conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel after federal elections in 2011, heading a coalition built around a program of modernization and digitalization in areas including climate protection, infrastructure and research.

But that maneuver was ruled illegal in November 2023 by the Federal Constitutional Court, prompting a government scramble to seek spending cuts in areas from farm subsidies to overseas development aid. The squeeze opened rifts within the Social Democrats and between the financially conservative Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens, with the latter calling for parliament to suspend the so-called \u201cdebt brake\u201d and allow more emergency borrowing, including to keep supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. The disagreements had fueled speculation that the already unpopular government could collapse and prompt a snap parliamentary election in which Germany could follow other European countries by swinging toward the political right. Opposition leaders said Friday they were skeptical of the government\u2019s budget arithmetic, especially its ability to fund an expanded defense budget, and forecast that coalition partners would fall out again over the details.

The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort, these sources said.\u00a0The\u00a0plan to kill Armin Papperger,\u00a0a white-haired\u00a0goliath who\u00a0has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature. When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.\u00a0A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US. For more than six months,\u00a0Russia has\u00a0been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe,\u00a0largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism \u2014\u00a0all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv. But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west. Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German\u00a0manufacturer of the\u00a0vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine\u2019s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine in the coming weeks , an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow\u2019s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel.

Fabian Bimmer\/Pool\/Getty Images The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign \u2014\u00a0one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing sabotage, we\u2019re seeing assassination plots, we\u2019re seeing arson. We\u2019re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,\u201d a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI believe very much that we\u2019re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN\u2019s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it\u00a0shows how Russia is \u201cwaging a hybrid war of aggression\u201d on European allies. \u201cWe have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,\u201d Baerbock said. In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin\u00a0\u201cwill not be intimidated by the Russian threats\ufeff,\u201d emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at \u201cundermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.\u201d A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment. \u201cThe necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,\u201d Hoffman said. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion\u00a0among\u00a0NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country. But the campaign \u2014\u00a0and in particular Russia\u2019s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil \u2014 has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all. Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a\u00a0shotgun\u00a0approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine;\u00a0Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland, CNN has reported , a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company. Some analysts have referred to the effort as a \u201chybrid\u201d campaign, one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia\u2019s sabotage efforts that way. \u201cI fundamentally reject the idea that what we\u2019re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of \u2018hybrid\u2019, I think of \u2026 defacing monuments,\u201d the senior NATO official said. \u201cThings that meet that traditional definition of \u2018below the threshold of armed conflict.\u2019\u201d Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations \u2014\u00a0lethal action \u2014\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that \u2018hybrid\u2019 implies,\u201d the official said. It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy. Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat\u2019s car:\u00a0US military bases across Europe were placed on a heightened state of alert last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed\u00a0actors were\u00a0considering carrying out\u00a0sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And\u00a0French authorities last month detained a Russian-Ukrainian man who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow.

Issued on: 03\/07\/2024 - 14:59 3 min Suspects were arrested in Sweden and Germany over alleged 2012 abuses over Syrian protests, similar to the one shown in this image \u00a9 - \/ SHAAM NEWS NETWORK\/AFP The arrests, five in Germany and three in Sweden, represent the latest attempt to pursue justice for the victims of abuses committed in Syria's civil war. The suspects detained on Wednesday are accused of taking part in a \"violent crackdown on a peaceful anti-government protest\" in the Al-Yarmouk district in Damascus on July 13, 2012, Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said. It said the four stateless Syrian Palestinians and Syrian national detained in Germany were \"strongly suspected of killing and attempting to kill civilians, qualified as crimes against humanity and war crimes\". It named the Syrian Palestinians as Jihad A., Mahmoud A., Sameer S. and Wael S. and said that they were part of a pro-Assad militia called the \"Free Palestine Movement\" (FPM). The Syrian national, identified as Mazhar J., is believed to have worked for Syrian military intelligence. \"They and other accessories specifically targeted the civilian protesters, shooting at them\", resulting in six deaths and other serious injuries, the prosecutor said. The war between Assad's troops and armed opposition groups, including Islamic State, erupted after the government repressed peaceful pro-democracy protests in 2011. It has killed more than half a million people, forced millions to flee their homes and ravaged Syria's economy as well as its infrastructure. Wednesday's arrests took place as a result of work carried out by an investigation team named \"Caesar\" after a defector who worked as a photographer for Syrian military police. In 2013 he smuggled more than 50,000 photographs out of Syria, many of them documenting the deaths of prisoners in detention centres or military hospitals. 'Severe and repeated' abuse German prosecutors said that those arrested in Sweden also belonged to the FPM and participated in the crimes on July 13, 2012. Ulrika Bentelius Egelrud, the Swedish prosecutor in charge of the investigation, said the suspects were arrested thanks to \"good cooperation with Germany, Eurojust and Europol\". German prosecutors say the four Syrian Palestinians also \"physically abused civilians from Al Yarmouk severely and repeatedly\" between mid-2012 and 2014, including at militia checkpoints on the outskirts of the district, inhabited predominantly by Palestinians. Mahmoud A. is accused of turning over one individual to Syrian military intelligence to be incarcerated and tortured. Prosecutors also say that he threatened a woman at a checkpoint with rape and that he forced her \"to pay with family jewels for the release of her minor son\". Three people arrested at a checkpoint in Yarmouk and turned over to military intelligence by Mahmoud A. and others were allegedly killed as part of \"a scheduled mass execution\" in April 2013. Germany let in hundreds of thousands of Syrians during the 2015-16 refugee influx and has arrested several Syrians since on its soil over crimes committed in their country. It has used the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of certain serious crimes -- regardless of where they took place -- to try Syrians over atrocities committed during the country's civil war. One of the most high profile cases to be brought to trial was that of a former Syrian colonel who was found guilty in January 2022 of crimes against humanity committed in Damascus. In recent years there have also been several investigations in Germany, Austria, Norway, France and Sweden targeting people suspected of crimes in Syria's civil war -- particularly those committed by pro-Assad forces. Last month a Swedish court acquitted a Syrian former general of war crimes charges, saying prosecutors had not proved his involvement in the army's \"indiscriminate attacks\". Former brigadier general Mohammed Hamo, 65, was one of the highest-ranking Syrian military officials to stand trial in Europe. Sweden was the first country to sentence a former Syrian soldier for war crimes in 2017. \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

Krieger\u2019s lawyer Vladimir Gorbach, who took part in the meeting, told the Belarusian state TV that Lukashenko said he would consider Krieger\u2019s request for pardon and announce his decision later. Krieger has been in custody since his arrest in October 2023. Belarusian state media reported that he has been accused of photographing some of the country\u2019s military facilities and of staging an explosion at a railway station on orders from Ukrainian special services.

Human rights activists noted that the accusations against Krieger came amid relentless political repressions in Belarus. More than 35,000 people have been arrested and thousands were beaten in police custody in a brutal crackdown on protests ignited by Lukashenko\u2019s re-election in an August 2020 presidential vote that the opposition saw as a sham. Pavel Sapelka of Belarus\u2019 Viasna human rights group said that Krieger could have fallen victim to a provocation by Belarus\u2019 top security agency that still goes under its Soviet name KGB, noting that some Belarusians have been convicted and sentenced for their remarks made on messaging chats that were created by KGB officers posing as Ukrainians. Krieger\u2019s sentencing has raised speculation that Belarusian authorities could have acted in sync with Russian spy agencies eager to prepare a possible swap involving Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to hint at an exchange involving Krasikov when he was asked about the possibility of releasing Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Earlier this month, Gershkovich was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in maximum security prison on espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government have dismissed as fabricated.

The southern German town of Wiesbaden, known for spas and hot springs, will now serve as a site of NATO's efforts to support the Ukrainian military. There, NATO has launched a new command centre to plan, coordinate, and arrange the delivery of security assistance for Ukraine. The command centre, located at a former US Army base, will coordinate training and equipment donations to Ukraine and will be organised and led by a three-star general. It\u2019s the centrepiece of the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine plan, which was announced when alliance leaders met for an anniversary summit in Washington last week. The base will comprise approximately 700 personnel from NATO allied nations and select partners. NATO says the command centre in Germany will enhance its support of Ukraine but not make the alliance a party to the conflict. A Ukrainian MP within President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s party, who is also fighting in the military, said the centre is an extremely welcomed sign. \u201cWe must certainly meet those people who have produced those munitions and try to train us,\" said Servant of the People party's Sviatoslav Yurash, explaining how NATO training has been invaluable on the frontline. The centre was discussed at last week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington when the alliance also declared that Ukraine was on an irreversible path to membership of the organisation. One foreign policy expert cautioned that although positive, there were potential limits to the extent the alliance would allow Ukraine to enter. \u201cIt will hopefully inspire confidence in NATO\u2019s support for Ukraine but at the same time, everyone knows including Ukrainian politicians that US domestic politics will decide Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership,\u201d said Leonard Schuette, senior researcher at Munich Security Conference. Officials have stated that Ukraine could only enter the alliance once the war with Russia on its territory was over. During the summit, the US also announced it would deploy long-range missiles in Germany. When fully developed, these conventional\u00a0long-range fire units will include SM-6, Tomahawk, and developmental hypersonic weapons, which have significantly longer ranges than current land-based systems in Europe. Green MP Sebastian Schaefer, who sits on the parliamentary defence committee, told Euronews that Germany should focus on re-arming itself. \u201cThis is one of the realities of the 21st century. It\u2019s not a very good thing to see, but it\u2019s just necessary. It would be much wiser if we would live together in peace on this planet.

It could still be appealed. The court in the western city of Muenster ruled in the case of a man from Hasaka province in northeastern Syria who arrived in Germany in 2014. German authorities denied him protected status because he had previously been involved in smuggling people from Turkey to Europe, an offense for which he was given a several-year sentence in Austria.

It also found that he didn\u2019t qualify for a lesser degree of protection in part because there is no longer a \u201cserious individual threat to the life or physical integrity of civilians as a result of arbitrary violence in the context of a domestic conflict in Hasaka province, but also generally in Syria.\u201d The court contended that fighting and attacks in the region no longer reach a level at which civilians face a high probability of being killed and wounded.

Rescue operations are ongoing with more than 200 emergency services personnel at the scene. Located near the banks of the River Moselle, the hotel's roof collapsed at around 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday, shattering windows as the top floor of the building collapsed onto the lower floor. Fourteen people were inside the hotel at the time of the incident, according to local police. A young Dutch family visiting the region was among those rescued on Wednesday morning. Five people were able to flee the building unharmed late on Tuesday night, but nine others were trapped under rubble. In a news conference on Wednesday fire inspector J\u00f6rg Teusch identified the two people killed as a man and a woman, who he said died during the night as a direct result of the building collapse. Dutch media reported that a 23-year-old woman from Urk and her infant son were rescued early on Wednesday morning and taken to hospital. The woman's husband, aged 26, was rescued later the same day and his condition is not yet known. Some 250 emergency services personnel were deployed to support rescue efforts, including firefighters, police, rescue dog teams and medics. Two people are still buried under the rubble, but emergency services have said they are still in contact with them. As reported by local broadcaster SWR, the damaged building in western Germany dates back to the 1600s. It experienced significant renovations back in the 1980s, when an additional floor was added to the now two-storey hotel. The Moselle valley is a popular tourist destination, famed for its vineyards and picturesque old towns. One hotel guest quoted by SWR said he was in the toilet when the floor beneath him collapsed. Nearby residents have been told to evacuate the area given concerns that the hotel building could collapse further.

REUTERS\/Valentyn Ogirenko\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab BERLIN, July 17 (Reuters) - Germany plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year, despite concerns that U.S. support for Kyiv could potentially diminish if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House. German aid to Ukraine will be cut to 4 billion euros ($4.35 billion) in 2025 from around 8 billion euros in 2024, according to a draft of the 2025 budget seen by Reuters. Sign up here. Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. \"Ukraine's financing is secured for the foreseeable future thanks to European instruments and the G7 loans,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Wednesday at a news conference. Washington pushed to \"front load\" the loans to give Ukraine a big lump sum now. Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chance of Ukraine being short of funds if Trump returns to the White House. Alarm bells rang across Europe this week after Trump picked Senator J.D. Vance , who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president. Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance's defence spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them. Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defence. DEPLETED MILITARY STOCKS The stocks of Germany's armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defence units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine. Germany's fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO's spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on. Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2025, with a total of 75.3 billion euros. Days after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a \"Zeitenwende\" \u2013 German for historic turning point - with a 100 billion euro special fund to bring the military up to speed. From this special fund, there will be 22.0 billion euros more for defence, plus 53.3 billion euros in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The defence budget is set to receive a meagre 1.3 billion euros more than in 2024, far below the 6.7 billion euros requested by Pistorius. As ever-increasing annual operating costs outpace this rise, the defence ministry is being forced to cut ammunition orders for 2025 by more than half, reduce procurement by 260 million euros and research and development by over 200 million euros. The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces' special fund to meet NATO's minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defence, as noted in the financial plan. In 2028, there is a gap of 39 billion euros in the regular budget, of which 28 billion euros are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said. Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election. \"The 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,\" said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament's budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU. \"The coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.\" ($1 = 0.9192 euros) Reporting by Maria Martinez and Holger Hansen, additional reporting by Sabine Siebold, editing by Miranda Murray and Christina Fincher Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab Suggested Topics: Europe Share X Facebook Linkedin Email Link Purchase Licensing Rights Maria Martinez Thomson Reuters Maria Martinez is a Reuters correspondent in Berlin covering German economics and the ministry of finance.

Germany has issued a European arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor over his alleged involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea, according to German media. German investigators believe Volodymyr Z was a member of a team that in September 2022 planted explosive devices on the pipeline route carrying natural gas from Russia to Germany, German media reported on Wednesday. German law does not allow publication of the suspect\u2019s surname. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage, which disrupted Russian gas exports to the European Union, hitting Moscow\u2019s energy revenues hard. Volodymyr Z was last known to have lived in Poland, according to a report by the Suddeutsche Zeitung and Die Zeit newspapers and the ARD public broadcaster, which quoted unnamed sources. The Polish prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed on Wednesday that it had received a German arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man who is a suspect in the Nord Stream attack named \u201cVolodymyr Z\u201d. It said it received the warrant in June, but the suspect left for Ukraine last month. It said also that the authorities failed to prevent him from leaving because the relevant information had not percolated down to the country\u2019s border guard. Germany\u2019s investigation has identified another man and a woman who like Volodymyr Z are also Ukrainian diving instructors. However, no arrest warrants have been issued for them for the time being, according to the German media report.    Several explosions on September 26, 2022 damaged the two gas pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2. The explosions were registered near the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. Four leaks were discovered shortly afterwards. Russian natural gas had previously flowed to Germany through Nord Stream 1, which had a capacity of 63 billion cubic metres (82.4 billion cubic yards) per year. The similarly sized Nord Stream 2 was not yet in operation. The route was built to divert Russian gas exports to the EU away from Ukraine\u2019s pipelines, on which they were previously heavily reliant. Russia\u2019s gas sales to the EU were by far the country\u2019s most lucrative until the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and ensuing political disputes all but wiped the trade out. Russia and the West accused each other of being behind the Nord Stream blasts. Each has denied involvement, and no one has taken responsibility. Authorities in several countries investigated the case, but Denmark and Sweden halted their investigations without noting any conclusion. In January 2023, Germany raided a ship that it said may have been used to transport explosives and told the United Nations that it believed trained divers could have attached devices to the pipelines at about 70 to 80 metres (230 to 260 feet) deep. In March last year, The New York Times reported that US officials had seen intelligence indicating a \u201cpro-Ukrainian group\u201d was responsible for carrying out the blasts without Zelenskyy\u2019s knowledge.  Whether the finding that Ukrainians were behind the attack on the pipelines might have any ill effect on Germany\u2019s support for Ukraine is yet to become clear. \u201cThe level of resources, of money, of military hardware that has been channelled from Germany, from Poland to Ukraine is very considerable,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s correspondent Dominic Kane in Berlin. \u201cThe current German government says that these developments will have no effect whatsoever on their relationship with Kyiv.

The multi-billion dollar Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines transporting gas under the Baltic Sea were ruptured by a series of explosions in September 2022, seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday that Poland had received a European arrest warrant issued by Berlin in connection with the attack, but the suspect, a Ukrainian man named as Volodymyr Z, has already left Poland. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that top Ukrainian officials were involved in what happened. \"Ukraine has nothing to do with the Nord Stream explosions,\" Podolyak said, adding that Ukraine did not gain any strategic or tactical advantage from the blasts. Russia has already blamed the United States, Britain and Ukraine for the blasts, which largely cut Russian gas off from the lucrative European market. Those countries have denied involvement. Germany, Denmark, and Sweden all opened investigations into the incident, and the Swedes found traces of explosives on several objects recovered from the explosion site, confirming the blasts were deliberate acts.

Issued on: 24\/07\/2024 - 15:49 Modified: 24\/07\/2024 - 17:37 2 min The Blue Mosque run by the Hamburg Islamic Centre which has been banned by Germany \u00a9 STRINGER \/ AFP Tehran reacted in fury, summoning Germany's ambassador to Iran to condemn a \"hostile action\" it branded as a \"clear example of Islamophobia\". Germany in turn held talks with Iran's ambassador but fell short of formally summoning the envoy. Germany's Interior Ministry accused the centre of presenting itself as a purely religious organisation with no political agenda, but said its probe has found the contrary to be true. In a statement, the ministry said it \"banned the Hamburg Islamic Centre and its affiliated organisations throughout Germany to date, as it is an Islamist extremist organisation pursuing anti-constitutional objectives\". Describing the group as a \"direct representative of Iran's supreme leader\", the ministry said the centre spreads Tehran's ideology \"in an aggressive and militant manner\". It is allegedly seeking to \"establish authoritarian, theocratic rule\" in place of a democracy, the ministry said, accusing the centre of backing the \"military and political dimension\" of organisations like Hezbollah. It is also believed to propagate anti-Semitism, something that Germany has been battling to stem amid a jump in cases following Israel's war in Gaza, launched in response to a deadly attack by Hamas militants on Israeli soil. Investigators raided 53 properties allegedly linked to the centre across Germany on Wednesday, impounding the centre itself while seizing a \"high number of IT devices\" along with cash and documents with links to Hezbollah and Hamas, the ministry said in a later statement. Wednesday's ban will also apply to several organisations related to the Hamburg centre, including four Shiite mosques. \"I want to make it very clear: We are not taking action against a religion,\" said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser. \"We are drawing a clear distinction between the Islamist extremists that we are cracking down on and the many Muslims who belong to our country and live according to their faith. \"This ban absolutely does not apply to the peaceful practice of the Shiite religion,\" she said. 'Outpost' of Iran Germany considers Hezbollah a \"Shiite terrorist organisation\" and in 2020 banned Hezbollah from carrying out activities on its soil. The Hamburg Islamic Centre runs the Imam Ali Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque, and calls have grown in recent years for authorities to close it down because of its alleged links to Iran. Blasting Berlin over its decision, Iran's foreign ministry said \"what happened in Germany today is a clear example of Islamophobia and a confrontation to the teachings of the Abrahamic religions\". The Iranian ministry hailed \"valuable and unforgettable services of Islamic centres, including the Hamburg Islamic Centre, in explaining the religious teachings of Islam, promoting the principle of dialogue and religious tolerance, as well as combating extremism\". Founded by Iranian immigrants in 1953, the Hamburg Islamic Centre had already been under surveillance by domestic intelligence for some time. In November, investigators had conducted sweeping raids of its premises and other related sites across seven of Germany's 16 states. \"Extensive evidence\" that was secured then had \"confirmed suspicions sufficiently to order today's ban\" of the group, the interior ministry said. The regional government of Hamburg welcomed the decision, with the state's interior minister Andy Grote saying the \"closure of this outpost of the Iranian inhumane regime is a real blow against Islamist extremism\". \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

A German court has imposed a $655 (600 euro) fine on a woman for using the slogan \u2013 \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d \u2013 during a protest last year, a ruling her lawyer decried as an assault on free speech . Lawyer Alexander Gorski, who represented the 22-year-old woman in Berlin, said the decision on Tuesday was \u201ca dark day for freedom of expression\u201d. \u201cMy client only wanted to express her hope for a future of democratic coexistence for all people in the region,\u201d he told AFP news agency, adding that the woman, identified only as Ava M, would appeal the decision. A court spokesperson said the woman was found guilty of using the slogan during a demonstration at Berlin\u2019s Neukoelln district on October 11, days after the Gaza war began. The court concluded that the use of the phrase \u201ccould only be understood as a denial of Israel\u2019s right to exist and an endorsement\u201d of Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack, the spokesperson said. By October 11, Israel had killed 1,537 Palestinians, according to local authorities, more than the number of Israelis killed in the October 7 attack. Antiwar activists had been organising protests calling for a ceasefire at that time.    Palestinian rights advocates have said \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d is an aspirational call for freedom and equality in historical Palestine. Israel\u2019s supporters argue the slogan calls for the destruction of Israel. The phrase was outlawed by German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser in November. However, Israel controls the entire area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, where it is imposing a system of apartheid on Palestinians, according to leading rights groups. Moreover, Israeli politicians often show a map of the country that includes the occupied Palestinian territory, effectively saying that Israel extends from the river to the sea. Germany has been a staunch supporter of Israel and one of its top weapon suppliers. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,653 people, levelled large parts of the territory and brought its more than two million inhabitants to the verge of starvation. Domestically, Berlin has cracked down on Palestinian rights activism. Earlier this year, the country passed a law requiring immigrants seeking German citizenship to affirm Israel\u2019s right to exist. In April, German police cancelled a pro-Palestine conference in Berlin. Authorities have also regularly broken up protests against the war on Gaza and assaulted and detained demonstrators. Earlier this year, Germany banned British Palestinian doctor Ghassan Abu Sittah , who worked in Gaza during the early months of the war, from entering the country.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Free article usually reserved for subscribers The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report. | Alexander Koerner\/Getty Images August 17, 2024 1:03 pm CET By Giovanna Coi The German government will stop new military aid to Ukraine as part of the ruling coalition's plan to reduce spending, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Saturday. The moratorium on new assistance is already in effect and will affect new requests for funding, not previously approved aid, according to the FAZ report , which cited non-public documents and emails as well as discussions with people familiar with the matter. In a letter sent to the German defense ministry on Aug. 5, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that future funding would no longer come from Germany's federal budget but from proceeds from frozen Russian assets , according to the German newspaper. Advertisement Germany and other G7 countries in June struck a preliminary deal to use the value of some $300 billion of Russia\u2019s sovereign assets immobilized in Western financial institutions to secure a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But governments have yet to agree on the details of the scheme, and technical talks might drag on for months. Berlin, which is Europe's main supplier of military aid to Kyiv, had already signaled a change in course on Ukraine last month , when the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals adopted a preliminary deal on a draft budget for 2025. The compromise seen by POLITICO detailed plans to slash future assistance to Ukraine by half to \u20ac4 billion to fulfill other spending priorities. Speaking after the Cabinet approved the draft budget in mid-July, Lindner said Ukraine would have to rely more on funds from \"European sources\" as well as the frozen Russian assets. But it's still unclear if, and when, that money will flow. Contentions over Ukraine aid reportedly deepened the rifts in the ruling coalition in Berlin, already tattered by weeks of internal fights over a series of issues from the budget to welfare. Green leader and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said this week he plans to run for chancellor as the Greens\u2019 candidate in the 2025 federal election, casting doubt on the survival of the governing alliance of which he is a member. \u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious that this coalition has major problems finding common ground,\u201d Habeck said regarding the recent disputes. \u201cThe ideas are falling apart.\u201d Advertisement Related Tags Aid and development Air defense Budget Defense Defense budgets Elections European Defense European defense policy Finance and banking Military War in Ukraine Welfare Related Countries Germany Russia Ukraine Related People Christian Lindner Olaf Scholz Robert Habeck Related Organizations G7 German defense ministry Our readers read next DOGE loses its biggest advocate as Musk exits Washington 29 MINS ago 6 mins read Trump squeezes Zelenskyy on peace deal as US leaders skip talks in Europe 3 HRS ago 4 mins read Zelenskyy under pressure at home over peace talks and mineral deal with US 4 HRS ago 4 mins read France floats resurrecting doomed EU-US trade deal it used to oppose 5 HRS ago 2 mins read More from Giovanna Coi Why von der Leyen\u2019s Big Tech tax plan is bluster There are major hurdles to overcome for the EU to retaliate against U.S. digital companies.

The piece dates to the mid to late 1760s and consists of seven miniature movements for a string trio lasting about 12 minutes, the Leipzig municipal libraries said in a statement on Thursday. Born in 1756, Mozart was a child prodigy and began composing at a very early age under his father\u2019s guidance. Researchers discovered the work at the city\u2019s music library while compiling the latest edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue, the definitive archive of Mozart\u2019s musical works. The newly discovered manuscript was not written by Mozart himself but is believed to be a copy made in about 1780, the researchers said. The piece was performed by a string trio at the unveiling of the new K\u00f6chel catalogue in the Austrian city of Salzburg on Thursday. It will receive its German premiere at the Leipzig Opera on Saturday. The piece is referred to as Ganz kleine Nachtmusik in the catalogue, according to the Leipzig libraries. The manuscript consists of dark brown ink on medium-white handmade paper and the parts are individually bound, they said.

The 27-year-old Syrian is a suspected supporter of radical Islamic ideology, according to the Munich public prosecutor\u2019s office. It said that the suspect procured two machetes, each about 40 centimeters (15.75 inches) long, earlier this month, and allegedly planned to attack the soldiers with them. The suspect was brought before a judge on Friday following his arrest a day earlier, the prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement. His name was not released in line with German privacy rules. The arrest comes after an Aug. 23 attack in Solingen that left three people dead and eight wounded. A 26-year-old Syrian suspect was arrested. He was an asylum-seeker who was supposed to be deported to Bulgaria last year but reportedly disappeared for a time and avoided deportation. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the violence, without providing evidence. The violence left Germany shaken and pushed immigration back to the top of the country\u2019s political agenda. In response, the interior ministry extended temporary border controls to all of its nine frontiers this week. The closures are set to last six months and are threatening to test European unity.

Kenya is struggling with increasing difficulties in providing work and sufficient income for its young professionals, while Germany is facing a shortage of skilled labour. The German government has said the deal does not specify the number of workers who will be allowed in. Migration agreements are a central pillar in the German government's efforts to curb immigration. The agreement will also simplify the repatriation of Kenyans who are in Germany without legal permission. Five Kenyan bus drivers have already been welcomed to Flensburg , external , in the north of Germany, in a pilot project. Immigration is a huge issue in Germany at the moment, following the rise in popularity of the far-right anti-immigration party , Alternative for Germany (AfD). Successive governments in Berlin have allowed relatively large numbers of asylum seekers to settle in the country in recent years. Germany took in more than one million people, mostly fleeing war in countries such as Syria, during the 2015-2016 migrant crisis, and has received 1.2 million Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Germany to tighten border controls after stabbing Kenya doctor strike: The public caught between the medics and the government The labour deal was signed in Berlin by Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Kenya's President William Ruto. Germany agreed to ease some of its immigration laws to enable Kenyans to find employment in Europe's biggest economy. Authorities in Berlin will also consider extending temporary residence permits for Kenyan workers who have secured an approved job. Kenyans will also be issued with long-term visas to study or do vocational training in Germany. \"On the expiry of the long-stay visa, Kenyans may receive a temporary residence permit for study purposes in Germany for up to two years,\" the agreement states. The temporary residence permit may be extended if the purpose of residence has not yet been achieved but is achievable within a \"reasonable\" period, it adds. According to the deal, IT specialists from Kenya will be allowed to enter and work in Germany, even if they do not have formal qualifications. Both governments will support the immigration of skilled workers who have finished vocational training or earned a university degree, as long as their qualifications are recognised by the relevant authorities of the other party. Image source, AFP Image caption, The European country needs more nurses but critics say it should not deprive Kenya of much-needed medical professionals The deal also includes provisions for the readmission and return of citizens between the two nations. It spells out guidelines to prevent and fight against labour exploitation, forced labour and human trafficking. While welcoming five Kenyan drivers in Flensburg on Thursday, Schleswig-Holstein's Transport Minister Claus Ruhe Madsen said Germany was in need of  hard-working hands and clever minds. \"We simply have to position ourselves in Germany in such a way that it is attractive to come here,\" Mr Madsen added. The drivers are the first batch of Kenyan workers, who will be trained by the Aktiv bus company in a pilot project, hoping to get a job in Germany. Doctors, nurses and teachers are among those expected to take part in the programme. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) said the deal was expected to significantly increase access to decent foreign jobs for Kenyan workers in Germany and address labour shortages in Germany. \"It includes mechanisms to protect the rights and welfare of Kenyan migrant workers in Germany, ensuring safe, orderly, and productive migration,\" ILO added in a statement , external . But there are concerns about a brain-drain in Kenya with professionals like doctors and nurses going abroad for jobs, leaving local hospitals with a huge shortage of medical workers. \"It is sad that we are going to service other countries at the expense of our own country,\" Ekuru Aukot, a Kenyan lawyer and politician, told the BBC's Newsday programme . But Roseline Njogu, a senior foreign affairs official, said Kenya was simply responding to the global labour market demands. \"We have a youth bulge in Kenya and  every year we have a million people joining the local labour market. It takes time and resources to create job opportunities at home,\" she added. Correction 14 September 2024:  An earlier version of this article put a figure on how many Kenyan workers would be allowed into Germany under the deal.

The vote took place three weeks after the far right made gains in two other states in eastern Germany. According to final results published Sunday evening by the state electoral administration, the Social Democrats won 30.9% of the votes in the election to the parliament of Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin. The far-right Alternative for Germany was a close second with 29.2%. A new leftist movement, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance , or BSW, came in third with 13.5% while the center-right Christian Democrats took 12.1% The first-place showing for the Social Democrats brought a reprieve to the beleaguered Scholz, whose three-party governing coalition has fared poorly in elections so far this year. The Social Democrats have governed Brandenburg continuously since German reunification in 1990, and a loss there would have been a major setback for Scholz, who has his constituency in the state capital, Potsdam.

But the success of the Social Democrats in Brandenburg \u2014 after defeats elsewhere \u2014 was largely credited not to Scholz, but to the efforts of the popular state governor, Dietmar Woidke. He distanced himself from Scholz during the campaign and took the gamble of promising to resign in case of a win by the far right. He was able to celebrate his political survival on Sunday night. \u201cIt is an important victory for me, it\u2019s an important victory for my party, and it\u2019s an important victory for the state of Brandenburg,\u201d Woidke said after polls closed. But he also said he felt the strong showing of the far-right party means there is work to do. \u201cThey (the AFD) have achieved about 30 percent, a lot of voters have voted for the AFD, and that\u2019s too much. So we have to think about these results and we have to make our policies better,\u201d Woidtke told The Associated Press. The far-right party has gained support amid a growing backlash against large-scale migration to Germany over the past decade and recent extremist attacks. Germany\u2019s economy, once a powerhouse, has been weakening, adding to a general feeling of malaise. Sunday\u2019s vote followed a heated election campaign centered on the issues of migration, internal security and peace. Both the far right and the new leftist movement want to end weapons deliveries to Kyiv as Ukraine tries to defend itself against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The Alternative for Germany won the most votes in the state of Thuringia and also did well in Saxony in elections held on Sept. 1. The new party on the left, the BSW, also made a strong impact, while the parties in Scholz\u2019s unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results \u2014 as they did again on Sunday in Brandenburg. The vote in Thuringia marked the first electoral victory for a far-right party in Germany since World War II. It triggered concerns in Germany and abroad about the growing support for the extreme right in Germany, a NATO member and the largest European Union country. Towards the end of voting on Sunday afternoon, a group of anti-AfD protesters gathered near a restaurant where the far-right party\u2019s supporters gathered to learn of the election results. Their chanting and the sound of whistles sought to disrupt the party. One carried a placard saying \u201cAfD is so 1933,\u201d referencing the year Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power. ___ Associated Press writer David Keyton contributed from Potsdam.","question":"What percentage of the vote did the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) receive in the Brandenburg state election in September 2024?","answer":"The AfD received 29.2% of the vote in the Brandenburg state election.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time or updated information after my last training data in mid-2023.

Dornau inked a deal with a local Center for the Isolation of Offenders to employ Belarusians convicted of political infractions at his Belarus-based agricultural company, OOO Zybulka-Bel, according to independent local outlet Reform.news. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ramped up political repression and instituted a mass crackdown on dissent, locking up opponents, in the aftermath of a 2020 presidential election widely dismissed as fraudulent. Advertisement One of the laborers at Dornau\u2019s farm told the outlet he sorted onions for about \u20ac5 per day after being detained in February 2024 for liking a post on social media. He described difficult working conditions, with breakfast at 7 a.m. and no food or water until the end of the working day at 8 p.m. \u201cWe were brought to a shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a horrible basement, people had all kinds of clothes on, so our hands and feet were freezing.\u201d The onions, he noted, \u201cwere tasty.\u201d The work was overseen by a foreman who would decide whether the detainee would be paid, he said. The labor was not forced, according to the prisoner, and the earned money was supposed to go toward the maintenance of the detention center. Dornau, according to the report, made at least one visit to his onion plantation to see his employees in person. Advertisement \u201cI\u2019ve even seen him. A tall, bald man,\u201d the prisoner said, with a description that matches Dornau\u2019s physical traits. \u201cHe came once in his car with German registration.

He has represented the far-right populist AfD party in the Saxony parliament in eastern Germany since 2019 and has come under scrutiny for his business dealings in Belarus, a Russia-friendly dictatorship ruled with an iron fist by Lukashenko. Dornau was ordered to pay a fine of \u20ac20,862 by the Saxony parliament last month for failing to reveal his involvement in Zybulka-Bel. The company was registered in Belarus in October 2020, even as pro-democracy protests roiled the country. As of Tuesday, there are more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna. Belarus has been targeted by waves of sanctions by the European Union over the years, most recently in August for ongoing internal repression and human rights violations.

The flight came a week after three people were fatally stabbed at a street festival in the western town of Solingen. The killings shocked Germany and sparked an intense debate over asylum rules when it emerged the main suspect was a 26-year-old Syrian refugee facing deportation. An Afghan man was detained after another deadly attack in May. The government in Berlin has already announced a series of measures ahead of elections on Sunday in eastern Germany, where the far-right Alternative for Germany is riding high in the polls. Asylum seekers facing deportation are to lose benefits and carrying knives will be banned at most public events and on public transport, ministers say. Sunday's votes in Thuringia and Saxony could end in humiliation for the three parties running the federal government as they are all running below 10% in the polls. In Thuringia, the AfD are being tipped to come first, ahead of the conservative CDU, while in Saxony, opinion polls put the two parties neck and neck. The anti-immigration party has little chance of coming to power in either state as no other group is prepared to help the AfD form a majority. Sean Gallup\/Getty Images The far-right Alternative for Germany is hoping to come first in Saxony and Thuringia on Sunday Friday's chartered flight from Leipzig shortly before 07:00 (05:00 GMT) was carrying 28 Afghan men on board a Boeing 787 to Kabul, German reports said. \"These were Afghan nationals, all of whom were convicted offenders who had no right to remain in Germany and against whom deportation orders had been issued,\" said government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit. Germany halted deportations in 2021 as the Taliban swept back to power in Afghanistan and the security situation deteriorated. Although Germany has no diplomatic relations with the Taliban government, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the deportation of Afghans and Syrians would be allowed after the knife attack in Mannheim last May in which a police officer was killed. A 25-year-old Afghan man was arrested. Last Friday's attack in Solingen, in which three people died and eight others were wounded , has caused outrage in Germany. Issa Al H, 26, is being investigated for murder and links to militant group Islamic State (IS). The Syrian should have been deported to Bulgaria last year but German reports suggest that the attempt failed because officials had failed to find him. During a visit to Solingen this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the government would do all it could to ensure \"those who cannot and must not stay here in Germany are repatriated and deported\". Scholz vows to speed up deportations after Solingen stabbings Man surrenders and confesses to Germany stabbing attack Ministers from the three ruling parties - the Social Democrats, Greens and Liberal FDP - announced what they said were far-reaching measures in response to the attack. Knives are to be banned at most public events including markets and sport as well as on public transport, and there will be a blanket ban on flick knives. Foreigners ordered to leave the country will have to be deported more quickly and efficiently, they say. Anyone facing a jail term for knife crime would face fast deportation. A task force for the prevention of Islamism is being proposed and biometric facial recognition will be used to help identify suspects. IS said it was behind the Solingen attack and a day afterwards released a video purportedly showing the suspect in a mask. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said asylum seekers who had already registered in another European Union country would lose their rights to welfare benefits. Ms Faeser insisted that nobody would be left hungry or sleeping on the streets, as the other EU country would be responsible for paying their benefits. The suspect in custody in the western city of D\u00fcsseldorf had sought asylum in Germany but he was turned down because he had first entered the EU in Bulgaria. Under the EU's Dublin Regulation, an application for asylum has to be made in the country of arrival. The leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz, who met the chancellor this week, had called for a halt on allowing refugees from Afghanistan and Syria to enter Germany, but that was rejected by Mr Scholz.

While still in its early stages, scientists believe that super-fast quantum computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields, from smarter encryption software to artificial intelligence. Scholz hailed the data centre as \"good news for Germany\", adding that Europe's biggest economy needs such \"key technologies\". Scientists believe that super-fast quantum computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields, from smarter encryption software to artificial intelligence \u00a9 SILAS STEIN \/ AFP \"It is precisely these future fields where we have to be at the forefront, where we must not be dependent on others,\" he said. Quantum research is seen as a critical field and both the United States and China have been investing heavily in the area, while Washington has also placed restrictions on the export of the sensitive technology. Olivier Ezratty, an independent expert in quantum technologies, told AFP that private and public investment in the field have totalled around $20 billion worldwide over the past five years. The centre in Germany consists of two quantum computers linked to quantum processors. One of the computers at the site was inaugurated in 2021 by Scholz's predecessor, Angela Merkel, and was the first in Germany. Mind-boggling speed Quantum computers can process complex information at a mind-boggling speed and should eventually vastly outperform even the most powerful of today's conventional computers. Regular computers function in binary fashion: they carry out tasks using tiny fragments of data known as bits that are only ever either expressed as 1 or 0. But fragments of data on a quantum computer, known as qubits, can be both 1 and 0 at the same time -- allowing them to crunch an enormous number of potential outcomes simultaneously. The quantum computers at the German site are vast metal stacks and other components connected via a mass of wiring, and bear no resemblance to regular computers. IBM's quantum data centre in Germany is its first in Europe \u00a9 SILAS STEIN \/ AFP IBM already has 250 customers worldwide who are testing its quantum computers to develop applications in various areas. The US firm has been seeking to develop the technology for 20 years in competition with other tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as research labs and start-ups. Companies that will have access to IBM's quantum systems via the new data centre include German auto titan Volkswagen and technology group Bosch. Nikolai Ardey, executive director from Volkswagen's innovation unit, said quantum computing could \"solve problems in material science, traffic optimisation, or deep learning\". The data centre \"represents an indispensable piece of the bridge between quantum computers and industrial applications at scale,\" he added. IBM says it is confident that it will be able to provide clients with a quantum computer able to run cutting-edge applications by 2029. But the technology still has some way to go. A main challenge is to reduce the rate of errors that systems produce, which experts say is still too high. By the end of the year the German data centre should host IBM's latest quantum system, called Heron, which the firm says will run with reduced error rates and a 25-fold increase in speed from its predecessor. \"In certain aspects... the Heron system is the most advanced today,\" said independent expert Ezratty. In addition IBM has built up a large ecosystem of companies and institutions which \"are already testing their tools on an experimental scale\", he said. But he cautioned that the error rate was still too high \"to perform useful calculations on a large scale\". \u00a9 2024 AFP Today's top stories A trap?

The man, named as Martin Manfred N in court papers, is now 80. He shot Czeslaw Kukuczka in the back at Friedrichstrasse station in 1974, after he had entered the Polish embassy claiming to be carrying a bomb and demanding to be allowed to leave to democratic West Germany. Details of the killing remained unknown for decades after the Stasi secret police shredded files relating to the case before communist East Germany reunified with the West in 1990. Berlin prosecutors filed charges against him in 2023 after persistent investigations by historians and Polish authorities. On 29 March 1974, 38-year-old Kukuczka, a firefighter, entered the Polish embassy on East Berlin's Unter den Linden boulevard with a briefcase. The father of three said - falsely - that he was carrying a bomb. He demanded to be allowed to leave for West Berlin. Stasi officers gave him an exit visa and some West German money and escorted him to Friedrichstrasse station, which was still served by trains from the western side of the city. Kukuczka passed several border checks inside the station. However, before he could make it to the western part of the station, a man approached him from behind and shot him in the back. A group of schoolchildren from Hesse in West Germany were among witnesses to the killing. One gave evidence at the trial that she had seen a man shoot Kukuczka before \"people in uniform\" sealed off the passage. Details of the case were uncovered by historians, who tracked down related files in the Stasi archives. Documents linking Naumann to the killing, which had been shredded, were reconstituted using a purpose-built machine. Kukuczka's family was never officially told of his fate. His ashes were sent to his wife some weeks after he had been murdered. The case was brought to trial after Poland issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann in 2021. The trial has been seen as holding special historical significance in Germany, similarly to trials of surviving Holocaust perpetrators. Martin Manfred N always insisted on his innocence. His lawyer has said there was no proof he carried out the killing. East Germany was created from the parts of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. It was a communist dictatorship, while West Germany - created from the American, British and French occupation zones - was a capitalist, democratic state.

A 1,170km (730-mile) telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany was severed in the early hours of Monday, while a 218km internet link between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island stopped working on Sunday. The incidents came at a time of heightened tension with Russia and Pistorius said \"nobody believes that these cables were cut accidentally\". The Swedish and Lithuanian defence ministers said they were \"deeply concerned\" that the cable connecting their two countries had been cut. \"Situations like these must be assessed with the growing threat posed by Russia in our neighbourhood as a backdrop,\" ministers Pal Jonson and Laurynas Kasciunas said in a statement , with a call for sanctions to be used in response to acts of sabotage. Germany and Finland also expressed grave concern on Monday in response to the severing of the C-Lion1 communications cable, warning that Europe's security was threatened by Russia's war, \"but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors\". A series of incidents involving Baltic pipelines have heightened fears of sabotage since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finnish telecoms and cyber security firm Cinia said its cable may have been severed \"by an outside force\". \"These kinds of breaks don't happen in these waters without an outside impact,\" a spokesperson told local media. Cinia's chief executive said the damage had taken place close to Sweden's Oland Island and could take five to 15 days to repair. On Tuesday, Finland said it had opened a police probe, while the Swedish Prosecution Authority said it had opened an investigation into \"sabotage\" . \"The preliminary investigation is ongoing and at an early stage. There is no further information to share about the investigation at this time,\" prosecutor Henrik Soderman said in a statement. The two cables intersect in the Baltic although the damage is thought to have taken place elsewhere. Arelion, the company that operates the line to Lithuania, has not said where its cable was cut but expects the repair to take a couple of weeks. Swedish civil defence minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said it was \"absolutely central\" to find out why two cables were not working. About a fifth of Lithuania's internet capacity has been reduced, although consumers are understood not to be affected. Arelion spokesman Martin Sjogren told the BBC that cables in the Baltic did get damaged every now and then. \"Fishing vessels accidentally damage cables with anchors,\" he said. \"The timing is odd of course but we haven\u2019t been able to examine it so we don\u2019t know what caused it.\" Samuli Bergstrom, a Finnish government cybersecurity expert, said the failure of the cable from Finland to Germany had not affected internet traffic as other cable routes were available.

It was triggered by a row over the 2025 budget, with Germany now facing its second year without economic growth. \"This is not a good day for Germany and not a good day for Europe,\" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Greens. Olaf Scholz said his former finance minister had \"betrayed my confidence\" and had put the interests of his party base over those of the country. He added that Germany needed to show it could be relied upon by other countries, particularly following Trump's election success in the US. Lindner, who leads the Free Democrats or FDP, accused Scholz of \"leading Germany into a phase of uncertainty\". He had refused Scholz's demand to loosen the spending limit known as a \"debt brake\" that requires German governments to balance the budget. While two of his party colleagues also resigned from their cabinet posts, a third, Volker Wissing, said he had made a personal decision to stay on as transport minister and resign from his party. The head of the conservative Christian Democrats, who are well ahead in opinion polls, said there was no time to wait. \"We simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months,\" said Friedrich Merz. Reuters Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock from the Greens said they would not leave the coalition The so-called traffic-light coalition was formed after Scholz's Social Democrats narrowly defeated the conservatives in federal elections in September 2021. It was named after the individual red, yellow and green colours of three parties - Scholz's centre-left, the economically liberal FDP and environmentalist Greens - who all planned to spend big on their own individual core interest groups. However, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sent energy prices surging, and left Germany facing a increase in defence spending - and the cost of taking in 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees. Scholz and his Green partners want to tackle this by loosening the debt brake to allow more spending. Lindner wanted to pay for tax cuts by slashing welfare and social budgets and pushing back environmental targets. Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the party would not quit the government and that its ministers would remain in office. Scholz announced that a vote of confidence would be held in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, on 15 January. If MPs vote down the government, the country will head for fresh elections within weeks, instead of the scheduled date in September. However, the opposition could force Scholz out earlier if they can find a majority for an alternative chancellor. For now, Scholz will head a minority government comprised of his Social Democrats and the Greens - the second-largest party in the coalition. Without a parliamentary majority, Scholz's coalition will need to cobble together support for individual votes from other parties in order to pass laws and measures. Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz for support in passing budgetary measures to help Germany's ailing economy and boost military spending.

Sharmahd, 69, was put to death in Iran on Monday on terrorism charges, the Iranian judiciary said. That followed a 2023 trial that Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed as a sham. The decision to close the Iranian Consulates in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, announced by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, leaves the Islamic Republic with only its embassy in Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry had already summoned Iran\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires on Tuesday to protest against Sharmahd\u2019s execution. German Ambassador Markus Potzel also protested to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, before being recalled to Berlin for consultations. Sharmahd was one of several Iranian dissidents abroad in recent years either tricked or kidnapped back to Iran as Tehran began lashing out after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers including Germany.

Iran also accused Sharmahd of \u201cdisclosing classified information\u201d on missile sites of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Iran pushed back against Germany\u2019s protests. Araghchi wrote Tuesday on social network X that \u201ca German passport does not provide impunity to anyone, let alone a terrorist criminal.\u201d He accused Baerbock of \u201cgaslighting\u201d and wrote that \u201cyour government is accomplice in the ongoing Israeli genocide.\u201d Germany is a staunch ally of Israel and has sharply criticized Iranian attacks on Israel as tensions spiral over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The closure of consulates, a diplomatic tool Germany seldom uses, signals a major downgrade to diplomatic relations Baerbock said were \u201calready at more than a low point.\u201d Last year, Berlin told Russia to close four of the five consulates it then had in Germany after Moscow set a limit for the number of staff at the German Embassy and related bodies in Russia. Iran\u2019s government \u201cknows above all the language of blackmail, threat and violence,\u201d Baerbock said Thursday. \u201cThe latest comments by the Iranian foreign minister, in which he puts the cold-blooded murder of Jamshid Sharmahd in the context of German support for Israel, also speak for themselves.\u201d \u201cWe repeatedly made unmistakably clear to Tehran that the execution of a German citizen would have serious consequences,\u201d said Baerbock, adding that the cases of Germans held in Iran were a \u201ccentral part\u201d of a meeting she held with Araghchi in New York a month ago. She said Berlin will continue with \u201ctireless work\u201d to get an unspecified number of other Germans released. On Tuesday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that \u201cthe execution of a European citizen is seriously harming relations between Iran and the European Union.\u201d \u201cIn view of this appalling development, the European Union will now consider targeted and significant measures,\u201d he said in a statement, without elaborating. Baerbock noted that the EU imposed a new set of sanctions in mid-October and that she is pushing for Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard to be put on a list of terror organizations. Sharmahd had been in Dubai in 2020, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company. He hoped to get a connecting flight despite the coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel. Sharmahd\u2019s family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It\u2019s unclear how the abduction happened, but tracking data showed that Sharmahd\u2019s cellphone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped.

He said he was \u201ctaking the political responsibility in order to head off damage to my credibility and that of the Free Democrats.\u201d The affair threatens to complicate further the Free Democrats\u2019 campaign for an election in which polls already suggest they risk falling short of the 5% support needed to keep any seats in parliament. Scholz fired Christian Lindner , the Free Democrats\u2019 leader, as finance minister on Nov. 6 as a long-running dispute in his three-party coalition over how to revitalize Germany\u2019s stagnant economy came to a head. The Free Democrats quit the government, leaving Scholz without a parliamentary majority . Scholz plans to call a confidence vote on Dec. 16. He is expected to lose, paving the way for an election on Feb. 23. Scholz and Lindner have traded blame for the collapse of the coalition, a combination of the chancellor\u2019s center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the Free Democrats that had long been notorious for infighting. After the coalition collapsed, German media reported on an internal strategy document which they said set out plans by the Free Democrats to end the government. On Nov. 18, Djir-Sarai denied that the term \u201cD-Day\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Allied landings in France in 1944 that helped liberate Europe from Nazi Germany\u2019s rule \u2014 had been used. But on Thursday, the Free Democrats released what they said was a working document drawn up by a lower-level official on questions of how the party could communicate a possible departure from the government. It is headed \u201cD-Day process scenario and measures\u201d and contains a reference to the \u201cbeginning of the open battle\u201d as one stage in the communication effort. That language drew criticism even from within the party. Djir-Sarai said in his brief resignation statement that he had not known of the internal document at the time of his denial and had unwittingly given false information. He apologized. The party said the paper was first drawn up on Oct. 24 and was last updated on Nov. 5, the version it released. The lower-ranking official who the party said originally created the document, Carsten Reymann, also resigned. The general secretary of Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, Matthias Miersch, told German news agency dpa that Djir-Sarai\u2019s resignation was a \u201csacrifice\u201d meant to \u201cdivert responsibility\u201d from Lindner. He said that \u201cthe decisive question remains: what role did Christian Lindner himself play in these plans?\u201d Lindner said he hadn\u2019t been aware of the \u201cdraft\u201d document and wouldn\u2019t have approved it, but it had been necessary to think through a possible departure from the coalition in light of its internal disputes and Germany\u2019s \u201cgridlock.\u201d He said it was clear the Free Democrats would have had to leave without an \u201ceconomic turnaround.\u201d Anyone who makes a scandal out of that is only pursuing \u201cpower and party interests,\u201d he said in a statement.","question":"What was the title of the internal Free Democratic Party document that caused political controversy in late 2024?","answer":"The document was titled \"D-Day process scenario and measures,\" referencing the party's potential departure from the government.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" Answer: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents or events that occurred after my last training data in mid-2023.

An official from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees told Der Spiegel news magazine on Monday that the move was taken in light of the unclear and unpredictable political situation in Syria, which would place asylum decisions \u201con shaky ground\u201d. No further decisions will be made on undecided asylum cases until further notice, which affects 47,770 applications by Syrian nationals. About 1.3 million people with Syrian roots live in Germany, the vast majority of whom arrived in 2015 and 2016 when then-Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed refugees fleeing Syria\u2019s devastating war. However, in more recent years, Germany\u2019s political climate has turned sharply against immigration. After a deadly knife attack in Solingen in August , committed by a Syrian national whose asylum case had been rejected, top government figures, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called for a deportation ban to Syria to be lifted in the case of criminals. Advertisement On Monday, senior members of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), argued for Germany to begin returning Syrians to their homeland en masse. The party is leading in polls before federal elections in February with campaign promises that include cracking down on irregular migration and increasing deportations. \u201cI believe that there will be a reassessment of the situation in Syria and, therefore, also a reassessment of the question of who is allowed to seek protection in our country and who is not,\u201d Jurgen Hardt, a CDU member of parliament, told the broadcaster ZDF. His party colleague Jens Spahn suggested Germany charter planes and offer 1,000 euros ($1,058) to each Syrian who returns home. Austria\u2019s caretaker government on Monday also announced asylum proceedings for Syrians would be paused. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece, which is also home to tens of thousands of Syrians who fled the war, said in a statement: \u201cA return to democratic normalcy must put an end to migrant flows from the long-suffering country and open the way to the safe return of Syrian refugees to their homes.\u201d (Al Jazeera) Tareq Alaows, spokesman for the refugee advocacy group Pro Asyl, told Al Jazeera that the decision to stop processing asylum applications will leave people in limbo for months, jeopardise their integration into German society, and fuel a sense of fear and uncertainty. He stressed that the political situation is neither safe nor stable in Syria and action from the international community will be needed to create a path to democracy. Advertisement Spahn is engaging in a \u201ccheap election campaign attempt to win votes on the right-wing fringe of society\u201d, he said. Andrea Lindholz, a CDU speaker on home affairs, told the Rheinische Post newspaper that a lasting peace in Syria would mean many Syrians would lose their \u201cneed for protection and thus the basis of their right of residence in Germany\u201d. Some figures within the Greens and Social Democratic Party (SPD), both of which have been in government since 2021, pushed back against making dramatic changes to the country\u2019s asylum policy or making refugees the focus of the election campaign. \u201cI warn against a populist debate with the tenor: \u2018Now everyone has to go back immediately,\u2019\u201d the SPD\u2019s Michael Roth told Der Spiegel. A spokesperson for Germany\u2019s Ministry of the Interior told the Funke media group on Monday that it was not yet clear whether there would be movements of refugees into or out of Syria. The ministry will not yet assess whether the country is safe for refugees to return to or is a safe destination for deportations, the spokesperson said. Currently, Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Office does not consider Syria a safe country of return due to the war and a high risk of torture. On Sunday, Scholz and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock welcomed the end of al-Assad\u2019s rule. \u201cThe people of Syria deserve a better future. They have been through horrible things. A whole generation has grown up in war, hardship and humanitarian deprivation, threatened by constant displacement,\u201d Baerbock wrote on X. \u2018We can live with dignity\u2019 Over the weekend, thousands of Syrians took to the streets of cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Essen to celebrate the overthrow of al-Assad. In the Berlin districts of Neukolln and Kreuzberg, cars draped with the flag of the Syrian opposition circled neighbourhoods, honking their horns, while large crowds gathered to chant and sing late into the night. Advertisement Mohammad al Masri, one of the participants, had already tried to find flights from Berlin to Damascus. \u201cMy feelings are totally mixed up. I don\u2019t even know if this is a dream or if it\u2019s true,\u201d said the 32-year-old, who has been living in Germany for almost a decade. Al Masri is from Daraa, known as the cradle of the Syrian revolution, and took part in some of the earliest protests against al-Assad\u2019s rule in 2011. \u201cMany people died just because they came out and called for freedom. Now, I can see it. \u2026 We are finally realising our dream,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cI can return home, finally meet my parents, meet my friends, sleep in my room again, experience the air, the atmosphere of my homeland.\u201d After a decade in Turkiye, Roaa, 30, who is originally from the coastal city of Latakia, moved to Berlin, where she works as a software engineer. \u201cUp until now, we were always worried about our future because we had no country that we can go back to. But now, we have hope, which is just amazing.\u201d Her family is already planning to return. \u201cWe have hope because we, the Syrian people, love each other and love our country, but it\u2019s going to be a lot of work to get Syria to a place where we can live with dignity, but that\u2019s a very big first step already.\u201d Rana, 34, who took part in protests against al-Assad in Damascus as a student in 2011, hopes to visit her hometown of Qamishli as soon as possible. In Berlin, she works with women\u2019s shelters to help women and children who are at risk of violence. Advertisement \u201cI will be happy to go back and do this to my country and to the women of Syria,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. Like many other Syrians, she hopes al-Assad will eventually be held accountable for the many atrocities committed under his rule. \u201cWe want justice. We want him in the ICC [International Criminal Court] because he\u2019s a war criminal, and we will get him, God willing.\u201d Alaows said that once the initial euphoria subsides, Syrians in Germany will face questions about whether a long-term return to their homeland is possible. \u201cI think it\u2019s very good to talk about the issue of return in Syria because before that, we have to talk about reconstruction.

More accessible, less costly, far less intrusive Kalle H\u00fcmpfner, policy officer for the German Trans* Association (BVT), welcomed the fact that gender self-recognition will now be much more accessible and less costly. H\u00fcmpfner stressed that the new law will also make\u00a0the process far less intrusive. \"In the assessments, people were forced to divulge a lot of very personal information \u2014 information that was shared with the court. There have been many awful reports of people having to talk about their sexual preferences, about their masturbation practices, or their underwear choices,\"\u00a0H\u00fcmpfner said.

He said the move brought Germany back into line with international human rights law and European developments of the last 10 years. It is now the 12th country in Europe to introduce legal self-determination legislation. \"Let's face it, it's an issue affecting a small number of people in a very personal way and respecting their choices doesn't harm anyone else, but it does uphold the core values of dignity and freedom that we all share,\" he said. K\u00f6hler warned that many other countries in Europe are introducing bans\u00a0on legal and medical transition, including in Georgia and Russia. Making lives of a marginalized minority easier The changes make the practical daily lives of transgender, inter-sex, and nonbinary people much easier, as there is no longer a potential mismatch between appearance and official paperwork, which can make traveling abroad prohibitive or even just paying by credit card a serious headache. Once someone has applied to change their gender and first name, no further applications can be made for a minimum of 12 months. Right-wing populists have suggested the new law would lead to people changing their gender marker every year. Altering a birth certificate generates a huge volume of follow-through bureaucracy in changing official documents, from driving licenses to school exam certificates. \"It's an enormous amount of work to make your documents match and no one does that just for fun,\" said H\u00fcmpfner of the German Trans* Association.

Germany's center-left government of Social Democrats (SPD) , Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) took over in late 2021 with a pledge to progress and modernize the government,\u00a0and included the change to the law in their coalition treaty. It was opposed by the largest opposition bloc, the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) and also by the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) . The new Self-Determination law was passed in April 2024 after a hotly contested debate in which a number of restrictions were added. 'Orchestrated attack against democracy, equality,\u00a0diversity' H\u00fcmpfner expressed regret that anxiety and fear of abuse had framed the debate \u2014 with transgender people repeatedly cast in the role of potential perpetrators. \"Time and time again during the entire legislative process, it was forgotten that this is about the basic rights of a marginalized and still very disadvantaged group,\" said\u00a0H\u00fcmpfner. Changes to the draft law included appearing to give business owners the right to decide whether or not to refuse individuals access to their premises on the basis of their gender. \"There was a lot of discussion about women's saunas. Our experience is that many transwomen rarely or never go into saunas because being in these places and being stared at a lot because of their physicality is regarded as unpleasant,\" said H\u00fcmpfner. Another concern raised during discussions surrounding the passage of the bill was about the possibility of transwomen using women's shelters. The Association of Women's Shelters (FHK) told the German newspaper Tagesspiegel this was baseless.\u00a0\"We do not know of a single case from our membership of transgender women misusing a safe house or becoming violent there \u2014 and that although transwomen have been regularly using safe houses for many years and finding protection in them without great ado,\" said the FHK.

And it's deliberate and it's orchestrated and it's heavily financed,\" said\u00a0K\u00f6hler. He said trans people were easy targets because they made up such a small minority and so few people had personal contact with them.

We should not allow ourselves to be divided,\" she said. Von Miquel, whose umbrella organization represents 60 women's associations and groups, warned\u00a0that the trans community and women's organizations should not be played off against one another. \"There is concern that the category woman or women will disappear and that it won't be about women anymore,\" said Miquel. \"We will stay the German Women's Council.

Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany\u2019s stagnant economy . Steinmeier said he made the decision because it was clear after consultation with party leaders that there was no agreement among Germany\u2019s political parties on a majority for a new government in the current parliament. \u201cIt is precisely in difficult times like these that stability requires a government capable of taking action and a reliable majority in parliament,\u201d he said as he made the announcement in Berlin. \u201cTherefore I am convinced that for the good of our country new elections are the right way.\u201d Since the post-World War II constitution doesn\u2019t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Leaders of several major parties agreed earlier on the election date of Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned.

The campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz\u2019s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz\u2019s government, is also bidding for the top job \u2014 though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia.

Officials have cited experiences in Poland, Hungary and elsewhere as illustrating the need to bolster the Federal Constitutional Court. The measure was drawn up by the three parties in the governing coalition that collapsed last month and the mainstream conservative opposition. In what is expected to be one of its last sessions before it is dissolved ahead of an early election in February, parliament\u2019s lower house, or Bundestag, backed the plan by 600 votes to 69. The legislation is set to anchor the court\u2019s ground rules in the constitution. That means a two-thirds parliamentary majority would be required to change them in the future, rather than a simple majority. \u201cWe see when we look abroad that, when autocrats come to power, they almost always first turn against the effectiveness and independence of justice,\u201d Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told lawmakers.

Half of its justices are elected by the Bundestag and the other half by parliament\u2019s upper house, which represents Germany\u2019s 16 state governments. Candidates are proposed by political parties and need a two-thirds majority to be elected, which is meant to ensure balance and effectively rules out highly polarizing figures.

Scholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes. It comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration. Ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign. Losing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted. Thanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled. There were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained. Since Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November , he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government. Given Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate. Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government. Opening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts. 'Kamikaze' move Scholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections. The process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era. This vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schr\u00f6der deployed on two occasions. However, there is a deeper problem within German politics. On the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects. That was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt. Lindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying. Germany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical. In 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%. In 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%. Germany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart Germany plans February election after coalition collapse The AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors. The bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition. That was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals. Rather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties. Another new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand leader, who joined the East German Communist party shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited. They refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens. That leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet. Whatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over.

The train was travelling between Hamburg and Kiel, which are just over 60 miles apart. The man reportedly attacked travellers around 3pm before arriving at Brokstedt station, which is near Neumunster in northern Germany. Interior minister of Schleswig-Holstein Sabine Suetterlin-Waack told DPA that two were killed and another five wounded . Three people were severely injured and four others suffered minor injuries. One person is fighting for their life in hospital, she said. No details were given about the identity of the victims. One eyewitness told how the carriage erupted in panic when three girls rushed in to say there was a man with a knife on the train, according to KN-Online. By then, the suspect had already injured at least one woman.

A large part of the station has been cordoned off and there is a large emergency service response at the scene, including nine ambulances, three emergency doctors and a rescue helicopter from Hamburg. Police - who say the suspect is now in custody - added that he had hand wounds when he was arrested, which they believe were self-inflicted. The man was reportedly tackled by cops as he got off the train. Police did not provide any information on the suspect's identity other than saying he was between 20 to 30 years old. The station was closed for several hours, police said ( Image: AP) The regional interior minister branded the attack a \"horrible act against all humanity\". \"It is terrible,\" Suetterlin-Waack told German public broadcaster NDR. \"We are shocked and horrified that something like this has happened. \"For me it is clear that the horrible act is against all humanity\", she added, saying her \"thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims.\" Police are still investigating the motive behind the attack. The region's interior minister branded the attack \"horrible\" and \"against all humanity\" ( Image: Jonas Walzberg\/picture-alliance\/dpa\/AP Images) Train operator Deutsche Bahn expressed its condolences on Wednesday evening, saying that \"our deepest sympathy goes to the relatives of the victims. We wish those injured a speedy and complete recovery\". A similar incident in May last year left six injured after a knifeman lashed out on a passenger train near the western German city of Aachen. The suspect was detained by police while several were treated in hospital for their injuries. Herbert Reul, the NRW state interior minister, reportedly said six people were wounded, including the suspected attacker. The suspect struck passengers \"indiscriminately and arbitrarily,\" Reul said. \"Based on everything that [they] know so far,\" investigators believed the perpetrator's intent was to harm as many people as possible, Reul added. The attack occurred on a Friday morning on a regional passenger train. Medical staff rushed four passengers to the hospital, none of whom faced life-threatening injuries. Those injured in the attack had sustained wounds to their hands and cut wounds to their faces. Police said the 31-year-old suspect had been overpowered by a 60-year-old police officer who happened to be on the train, reports The Independent , along with two other passengers. The officer, who was not named, said: \u201cI was on my way to work, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d Reul told reporters the suspect was a 31-year-old man who was born in Iraq - though his citizenship remained unclear. In December, a girl was murdered with another left fighting for her life after being attacked by a man on their way to school in Illerkirchberg, a 4,700-inhabitant village in southern Germany. Emergency services raced to the town near Munich to find the pupils, aged 13 and 14, and took them to hospital , but the eldest of the pair couldn't be saved and was pronounced dead after admission. Cops earlier said both girls had \"serious injuries\" but refused to go into further detail. German daily newspaper Bild said the attack happened around 7.30am as the youngsters made their way to school. Horrified locals immediately contacted emergency services and the two girls were rushed to hospital by ambulance. The suspect is understood to have fled into a nearby building, which initial reports suggested may have been a refugee housing. Cops stormed the residence and arrested everyone inside. The prime suspect and two other individuals were taken to the police station and the innocent parties released, cops said.

Her decision dealt a blow to Scholz at a time when Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany's defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. Sign up here. The pressure to find a successor is mounting also because U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is expected in Berlin on Thursday and will attend a conference on Friday at the U.S. military base in Ramstein, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to discuss further support for Ukraine, including whether to send German-built battle tanks. Lambrecht asked Scholz to dismiss her, as formally required, and he has approved, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic (SPD)-led coalition government said. During a visit to arms manufacturer Hensoldt, Scholz thanked Lambrecht for her service and said he would act fast to replace her. \"I have a clear idea and it will be known very quickly for everyone how this should proceed,\" he told reporters. Citing government sources, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said a successor would be announced on Tuesday. Among the candidates mooted by German media are Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces Eva Hoegl, junior defence minister Siemtje Moeller, SPD party chief Lars Klingbeil and Labour Minister Hubertus Heil. Scholz has promised to staff his cabinet with equal numbers of men and women. If a man should succeed Lambrecht, this could result in further reshuffling. PERFORMANCE CRITICISED Lambrecht was blamed by critics for failing to get the German armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr, back in shape quickly, despite a 100-billion-euro ($108.11 billion) special fund being agreed for that purpose after Russia invaded Ukraine. Economy Minister Robert Habeck praised Lambrecht for her ambition to reform the Bundeswehr and said her decision would not have been taken lightly. \"It shows the kind of pressure she is under, but also how she is trying to keep the office from being damaged,\" Habeck said at an energy conference in Berlin. Lambrecht was most recently criticised by media and opposition figures for posting a New Year's message on social media in which she thanked servicemen and women, but struggled to be heard against background noise from firecrackers and seemingly mixed up the war in Ukraine with pleasant personal encounters. \"What kind of a year was 2022? It confronted us with many incredible challenges. There is a war raging in the middle of Europe. Associated with this were for me many special impressions, many encounters with interesting, great people,\" Lambrecht said in the video. Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of Germany's parliamentary defence committee and a member of Scholz's junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), called for her successor to be installed quickly. \"I now expect the Social Democrats to name a successor as soon as possible who is assertive towards the ministry, does not abuse the defence ministry for other political ambitions and, above all, brings with them an understanding and heart for the soldiers,\" she said in remarks carried by the Funke media group.

The joint announcement followed a phone call between Biden and Scholz and amounts to a step change in western military support for Ukraine , which has asked for up to 700 armoured vehicles to help force the Russians out. \u201cThe United States intends to supply Ukraine with Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and Germany intends to provide Ukraine with Marder infantry fighting vehicles,\u201d the White House said in a statement on Thursday. Ukraine has repeatedly said it needs 600 to 700 infantry fighting vehicles plus 300 tanks from from the west in order to give its military a chance of breaking through the increasingly fortified Russian positions along the frontline. Until now, however, the US and Germany have been wary of supplying Ukraine with Nato-standard armour, because they feared it would be interpreted by Russia as escalatory. But the decision to supply western armoured vehicles is significant, even if both countries stopped short of sending tanks. Germany will also supply Ukraine with a Patriot air defence system, in addition to one promised by the US last month, the White House added. Both countries will train the Ukrainian military on the Marders and Bradleys, although it it was not immediately clear how many of each would be supplied. Scholz\u2019s deputy spoke up in support. \u201cThis is a good decision,\u201d said Robert Habeck, the German vice-chancellor and economy minister, whose department has to green-light weapons exports. \u201cSince the start of the war we have continuously expanded our support in coordination with our partners. It is only logical that we also take this step. \u201cUkraine has the right to defend itself against the Russian attack, and we have the duty to help her.\u201d View image in fullscreen Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk. Ukraine has long had its eye on western tanks to complement its reduced fleet of Soviet-designed T-64 and T-72s. Photograph: Reuters France said on Wednesday it was upping its military aid to Kyiv by supplying an unspecified number of AMX-10 RC light armoured vehicles capable, experts said, of scouting roles and supporting main battle tanks. Hours later Biden hinted the US was considering following with the Bradleys. Earlier on Thursday, senior German ministers indicated their country\u2019s position was also evolving rapidly. Habeck, on a visit to the Norwegian capital, Oslo, said Germany\u2019s position had never been \u201cstatic\u201d and that it would be influenced by France and the US\u2019s willingness \u201cto deliver lighter tanks\u201d. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, made similar comments. \u201cI have pointed out time and time again we work with our partners to see what kind of military support is required by Ukraine,\u201d she said after a meeting with her British counterpart, James Cleverly, in London. Cleverly himself said tanks \u201cmight well be\u201d part of the next phase of weapons transfers. On Wednesday night, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Paris\u2019s decision sent \u201ca clear signal to all our other partners: there is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with western-type tanks\u201d. 0:36 'No rational reason': Zelenskiy criticises allies' failure to send 'western-style tanks' \u2013 video Ukraine has long had its eye on western tanks and armour to complement its reduced fleet of Soviet-designed T-64 and T-72 tanks and BMP infantry vehicles, after more than 10 months of fighting. Kyiv has received about 200 post-Soviet tanks from eastern European countries since the start of the war, but the available supply in Europe is now limited. To replenish its stocks and build up a fresh attacking force, Ukraine has sought to obtain Leopard 2 tanks, or US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, but its lobbying was unsuccessful last year. \u201cTanks are potentially decisive because there is no substitute if you want to attack enemy formations in defensive positions,\u201d said Ben Barry, a former British army tank commander and land warfare analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. Russia has largely sought to dig in since abandoning its exposed position in Kherson on the west side of the Dnipro River in November, as it tries to consolidate its occupation of a swathe of territory roughly the size of Portugal in the east and south of Ukraine. A breakthrough, if it comes at all, is likely to require the combined use of tanks, heavy armour and infantry, replicating a standard offensive tactic that dates back to the second world war. \u201cThe effectiveness of infantry is doubled, even with just three or four tanks helping,\u201d Barry added. France\u2019s six-wheeled AMX-10 RC were first deployed in the 1980s and have been used in multiple operations, from Afghanistan to Mali. They are in the process of being phased out by Paris, however, making them an ideal gift for Ukraine. An aide to France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, said it was \u201cthe first time that western-designed tanks are supplied to the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d but experts said the AMX-10 RC was too lightly armoured to be considered a proper tank.

Secondly, the decision to supply such vehicles involves complex calculations regarding international relations and the balance of power in the region. Germany, in particular, has historical sensitivities and maintains significant economic ties with Russia, which influenced its cautious approach.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the sentence as unacceptable, calling on Iran to reverse the ruling. \"The Iranian regime fights its own people in every possible way and disregards human rights,\" Scholz wrote on Twitter. Sharmahd, a German-Iranian national, was sentenced to death on charges of \"corruption on earth\", the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported on Tuesday. The verdict can be appealed. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that the consulate was working to provide further support to the dual national and was in touch with the man's relatives. \"We will continue to provide consular support to the extent that this is possible. I have already explained how difficult this is in Iran,\" the spokesperson said. \"This is a first instance verdict and we will follow the progress of the situation,\" he added. Iran accuses Sharmahd, who also has U.S. residency, of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. Tensions between Iran and the West have intensified in recent months, pushing already-stalled efforts to revive talks on Tehran's nuclear programme further into the background. Germany has been a vocal backer of European Union sanctions against Iran over its crackdown on protesters in the country.

Ukrainian officials have been calling on Western allies to supply them with the modern German-made tanks for months - but Berlin has so far held back from sending them, or allowing other NATO countries to do so. Sign up here. Asked what would happen if Poland went ahead and sent its Leopard 2 tanks without German approval, Annalena Baerbock said on France's LCI TV: \"For the moment the question has not been asked, but if we were asked we would not stand in the way.\" Her remarks appeared to go further than German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's comments at a summit in Paris earlier on Sunday that all decisions on weapons deliveries would be made in coordination with allies including the United States. Germany has been under heavy pressure to let Leopards go to Ukraine. But Scholz's Social Democrat party is traditionally sceptical of military involvements and wary of sudden moves that could cause Moscow to further escalate. German defense minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that he expected a decision soon on the tanks, though he kept up a note of caution. Pistorius told ARD TV that Germany would not make a hasty decision because the government had many factors to consider, including consequences at home for the security of the German population. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated his long-standing plea for the tanks at his Sunday meeting with former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who was visiting Kyiv.

REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab \"We need more weapons: tanks, aircraft, long-range missiles,\" Zelenskiy said, according to a statement on his website. Ukraine says the heavily armoured Western battle tanks would give the Ukrainian ground troops more mobility and protection ahead of a new Russian offensive which Kyiv expects in the near future. It would also help Ukraine retake some of the territory that has fallen to Russia. After the Paris summit, Scholz told a news conference that all weapons deliveries to Ukraine so far had taken place in close coordination with Western partners. \"We will do that in the future,\" he said. Speaking at the same news conference, French President Emmanuel Macron said he did not rule out the possibility of sending Leclerc tanks to Ukraine. Macron said that sending tanks must not escalate the situation, must take into account the time to train Ukrainians to be effective, and must not endanger France's own security. \"Regarding the Leclercs, I asked the Army minister to work on it, but nothing has been ruled out,\" Macron said, adding that the move would have to be coordinated with allies such as Germany in the coming days and weeks. German sources have told Reuters they would allow German-made tanks to be sent to Ukraine to help its defence against Russia if the United States agrees to send its own tanks. But U.S. officials have said President Joe Biden's administration is not poised to send its own tanks, including the M1 Abrams. The Kremlin's spokesman said on Friday that Western countries supplying additional tanks to Ukraine would not change the course of the conflict and that they would add to the problems of the Ukrainian people.

{"year":"2023","month":"03","event_desc":"9 March  A mass shooting in Hamburg kills six people and injures eight others. The gunman then commits suicide.","text":"Hamburg shooting: Seven killed in attack on Jehovah's Witness hall 10 March 2023 Share Save Jenny Hill in Hamburg & Jaroslav Lukiv in London BBC News Share Save Watch: Video appears to show Hamburg suspect firing weapon Seven people, including an unborn baby, have been killed in a shooting at a Jehovah's Witness meeting hall in the German city of Hamburg, police say. They say the gunman acted alone in Thursday's attack, and later took his own life. His motives are unknown. The suspect, named only as Philipp F, is said to have had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member. Video has emerged appearing to show him firing through a window of the hall. At a briefing on Friday, the police said four men and two women were shot dead. All the dead were German nationals. Eight people were injured, four seriously. A Ugandan and a Ukrainian were among those hurt. A woman who was seven months pregnant was shot - killing her unborn baby. The mother survived. The first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) on Thursday, to report that shots had been fired in the building on Deelb\u00f6ge street, Gross Borstel district, the police said. Officers were on site four minutes later, and they were almost immediately joined by special forces. The officers had to break windows to enter the building where about 50 people had gathered. The suspect - described as 35-year-old \"sports shooter\" who had a gun licence - had fled to the first floor. His \"lifeless body\" was found shortly afterwards. He had managed to shoot nine magazines of ammunition, and 20 more were found in his backpack. German Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers had saved many lives. He also described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history. Police confirmed that they had previously received an anonymous tip-off that raised concerns about the perpetrator's mental health. Officers had visited him after the tip-off - but did not have enough grounds to take away his gun at the time. Gregor Miesbach, who filmed the gunman shooting through a first-floor window, told the Bild newspaper: \"I didn't realise what was happening. I was filming with my phone, and only realised through the zoom that someone was shooting at Jehovah's Witnesses. \"I heard loud gunshots... I saw a man with a firearm shooting through a window and filmed it,\" he said. Lara Bauch, a 23-year-old student who lives nearby, told the DPA news agency that \"there were about four bursts of gunfire - several shots were fired in each burst - with gaps lasting roughly 20 seconds to a minute\". She said that from her window she could see a person frantically running from the ground floor to the first floor. \"The man was wearing dark clothing and moving fast,\" she added. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, on Thursday evening telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\". Local residents were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances. Reuters Forensic experts worked at the scene through the night Reuters A bomb disposal unit was also deployed The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described it as a \"brutal act of violence\", saying his thoughts were with the victims and their relatives. In a statement, the Jehovah's Witness community in Germany said it was \"deeply saddened by the horrific attack on its members at the Kingdom Hall in Hamburg after a religious service\". Forensic experts in white suits worked through the night inside the brightly lit interior of the meeting house. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members of the organisation. Jehovah's Witnesses are probably best known for their door-to-door evangelism; witnessing from house to house and offering Bible literature. Although Christian-based, the group believes that the traditional Christian Churches have deviated from the true teachings of the Bible, and do not work in full harmony with God. Germany has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. In 2021, there were around one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters. After mass arrests were made last December in relation to a suspected plot to overthrow the government, the German authorities are planning to tighten the country's gun laws even further.

{"year":"2023","month":"05","event_desc":"25 May  The German economy enters recession for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic amid high levels of inflation.","text":"Germany falls into recession as inflation hits economy 25 May 2023 Share Save Lucy Hooker Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Persistent inflation has helped push Germany into recession in the first three months of the year, an upgrade to growth data shows. Europe's largest economy was also badly affected when Russian gas supplies dried up after the invasion of Ukraine, analysts said. The economy contracted by 0.3% between January and March, the statistics office said. That followed a 0.5% contraction in the last three months of last year. A country is deemed to be in recession when its economy shrinks for two consecutive three-month periods, or quarters. \"Under the weight of immense inflation, the German consumer has fallen to his knees, dragging the entire economy down with him,\" said Andreas Scheuerle, an analyst at DekaBank. Germany's inflation rate stood at 7.2% in April, above the euro area's average but below the UK's 8.7%. Higher prices have weighed on household spending on things such as food, clothing and furniture. Industrial orders are also weaker, reflecting the impact of higher energy prices on businesses. \"The persistence of high price increases continued to be a burden on the German economy at the start of the year,\" the federal statistics agency Destatis said in a statement . Which European nations are winning the heat pump race? Germans split as last nuclear plants are shut down Why is UK inflation higher than US and Germany? Originally, the agency had estimated zero growth for the first quarter of this year, suggesting Germany would side-step a recession. However, the revised figures showed household spending was 1.2% lower than in the previous quarter. Government spending was 4.9% lower, and car sales also fell after government grants for electric and hybrid cars were scaled back. The recession was less severe than some had predicted, given Germany's heavy reliance on Russian energy. A mild winter and the reopening of China's economy, helped ease the impact of higher energy prices. Private sector investment and exports rose, but that was not enough to get Germany out of the \"danger zone\" for recession, analysts said. \"The early indicators suggest that things will continue to be similarly weak in the second quarter [of 2023],\" said LBBW bank analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch. However, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects the economy to grow modestly in the April to June quarter, with a rebound in industry offsetting stagnating consumer spending. The IMF has predicted that Germany will be the weakest of the world's advanced economies, shrinking 0.1% this year, after it upgraded its forecast for the UK from minus 0.3% to growth of 0.4% .

Dies hatte die Debatte \u00fcber den aktuellen H\u00f6henflug der AfD auch in deutschlandweiten Umfragen weiter angefacht. Demnach liegt die Partei aktuell bei 20 Prozent. Der Landesverfassungsschutz in Th\u00fcringen bewertet den dortigen AfD-Landesverband als \"gesichert rechtsextrem\", deutschlandweit stuft der Verfassungsschutz die Partei als Verdachtsfall ein.

Jens Schlueter\/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images By Christopher F. Schuetze Reporting from Dresden, Germany May 31, 2023 Updated 6:36 p.m. ET A German court on Wednesday convicted a 28-year-old woman and three accomplices of organizing and carrying out brutal attacks against people they perceived to be neo-Nazis, in what experts have described as an uncommon case of left-wing extremist violence in the country. The woman, who in accordance with Germany\u2019s strict privacy laws was identified only as Lina E., was sentenced to five years and three months in prison by a court in Dresden, in eastern Germany for membership in a criminal association, several counts of assault, causing damage to property, as well as other lesser charges. Three other members of the group \u2014 Lennart A., 28; Jannis R., 37; and Philipp M., 28 \u2014 received prison sentences ranging from two years and five months to three years and two months for charges including membership or support of a criminal gang, assault and abetting assault. Nancy Faeser, the country\u2019s interior minister, said in a statement after the verdict that \u201cin a democratic constitutional state, there must be no room for vigilante justice.\u201d She added, \u201cNo objective justifies political violence.\u201d The judge, Hans Schl\u00fcter-Staats, announced that Lina E. would be released from jail until possible appeals were played out and she had to start her prison sentence. Supporters in the courtroom, who had protested so loudly when the initial sentence was announced that the judge called a 15-minute recess, rejoiced that she would be free for a time. The three co-defendants were not in custody during the trial. Hours after the verdict was announced, there were clashes, some violent, between left-wing protesters and the police in Berlin ; Leipzig , where Lina E. lived; and other cities. Far-left activists also had announced that demonstrations would be held in Leipzig on Saturday. The case has been widely watched in Germany, where the authorities have long been accused of failing to prosecute or slow-walking the prosecution of figures tied to right-wing attacks, and especially in the east of the country, where the dominance of far-right groups has long overshadowed a smaller and apparently also violence-prone far-left scene. The trial also forced progressives to consider how far the fight against right-wing extremism\u00a0should go, experts say. At the heart of the case were six attacks that prosecutors said the loose, nameless group had planned and carried out from 2018 to 2020. Among those beaten by the masked attackers was a right-wing extremist and martial-arts fighter who himself is in jail awaiting trial for his role leading a violent right-wing group; men returning from a far-right rally in Dresden; and a man wearing a hat from a right-wing clothing company, who later denied being a neo-Nazi. Some of the victims ended up in the hospital with broken bones. One testified that he was traumatized for life. There were 13 known victims in all, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said that Lina E. had led the group with her partner, who is still wanted by the authorities.

Ronald Wittek\/EPA, via Shutterstock Investigators homed in on Lina E., who was then a student, after a second attack on the extremist martial-arts fighter in 2019. After the attack, the police stopped a speeding VW Golf with stolen plates; inside, they found the original plates, which showed that it was registered to Lina E.\u2019s mother. From there, the police connected Lina E. to other attacks through witness testimony, video, DNA evidence and a photo of a crime scene found in a camera at her home. She was arrested in November 2020 at her home in Leipzig, in Saxony State in northeastern Germany, and charged with causing bodily harm and organizing a criminal gang. The case had captured the public\u2019s imagination ever since she stepped off a police helicopter surrounded by heavily armed officers for her arraignment in Karlsruhe, the seat of Germany\u2019s national prosecutors. She was vilified as a violent criminal by some and celebrated as a vigilante by others. \u201cFree Lina E.\u201d graffiti popped up in the one neighborhood of Leipzig. Some stores put out collection boxes to help her with defense costs. Hajo Funke, an expert on the far right, said the violence the left-wing group was accused of was unusual in eastern Germany, where the far right tended to be the source of brutality in public spaces. \u201cEspecially in Saxony, but also in other states in the east, the far right has a tactical dominance against left-wing actors and even democratic-minded citizens in daily situations,\u201d Mr. Funke said. \u201cIf you are active doing something they don\u2019t like, you are actually in danger.\u201d In 2022, the German police attributed 23,493 registered crimes to the far right in the country. In the same year, 6,976 crimes were attributed to the far left, the lowest number in a decade. Because of its Nazi past, Germany has strict laws to fight fascism, banning Nazi symbols and speech. Shortly after the country\u2019s reunification three decades ago, neo-Nazis unleashed a wave of violence on migrants, targeting asylum centers, especially in the east. Although the violence has subsided, the political fortunes of the right have grown. Last year, a far-right group was accused of plotting to overthrow the government . A parliamentary committee report published in 2013 found that Germany\u2019s police and security services had deeply rooted prejudices that had allowed a neo-Nazi cell to carry out violent attacks \u2014 killings, robberies and bombings \u2014 against immigrants for more than a decade without being detected. Image A police officer arresting a protester during a left-wing rally held in solidarity with Lina E. in Berlin on Wednesday. Credit... Filip Singer\/EPA, via Shutterstock The trial of Lina E. and her group unfolded over nearly 100 days under high security.The prosecutors\u2019 star witness was a kindergarten teacher and former associate of the group, Johannes D., 30, who testified about the group\u2019s training and organization, and admitted being present for at least one attack as a stakeout. (A court gave him a suspended sentence for his part in the crime.) On the final day of the trial this month, Lina. E. did not insist on her innocence or explain her motives, but thanked her family and those who had written to her and visited her in jail. Even amid calls for protests, Alexander Deycke, who studies the far left at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, said that within the left-wing community, the verdict might lead to soul-searching. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental contradiction when you want a violence-free, domination-free\u00a0society on the one hand, but you are unwilling to exclude violence on the way to getting there,\u201d he said. Dirk M\u00fcnster, a police officer who runs the state\u2019s special unit on far-left crimes and oversaw the investigation of Lina E.\u2019s group, said that a clear guilty verdict was important. \u201cIt has a signaling effect,\u201d he said before the verdict. \u201cWe have to recognize that we have a real problem and not one that can be discussed away.\u201d Many Germans, he said, refused to see left-wing violence as a problem because they generally sympathized with the fight against fascism. \u201cWe are not fighting against left-wing beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working against actual criminal violence.\u201d Christopher F.

Friedrich Merz\u2019s remarks triggered cries of protest from his own party and raised concerns about the firewall between German conservatives and the far right. In an interview with the state broadcaster ZDF on Sunday, Merz categorically ruled out joining a coalition with the AfD at a national level but said such a taboo should not apply to local politics. \u201cOf course we are obliged to accept democratic votes,\u201d Merz said. \u201cAnd if the head of a district authority or a mayor is voted in who belongs to the AfD, then of course you find ways to continue to work in that town.\u201d German politicians from across the spectrum \u2013 including within Merz\u2019s own camp \u2013 reacted with outrage, leading the CDU leader to backpedal. \u201cTo clarify it once again, and I never said it differently: the CDU resolution is valid. There will be no CDU cooperation on the local level with the AfD,\u201d Merz tweeted on Monday. Fears however lingered that Merz could in future be open to breaching a fundamental taboo in Germany\u2019s politics since the second world war. The AfD won its first German district council in the eastern state of Thuringia last month, and secured its first mayoral post, in Saxony-Anhalt, at the start of July. Recent polls show the rightwing populist outfit at 20-22% of the vote, behind the CDU on 26-28% \u2013 both ahead of the three centre-left, green and liberal parties that form Germany\u2019s government. The CDU mayor of Berlin, Kai Wegner, strongly distanced himself from the party leader\u2019s comments on Sunday evening. \u201cWhat cooperation is there to be had?\u201d Wegner said in a tweet. \u201cThe CDU cannot, does not want and won\u2019t work with a party whose business model is hatred, division and exclusion.\u201d The MP Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, who ran against Merz for the party leadership, warned on Sunday that the AfD \u201cknowingly admits and invites extremist forces into the party\u201d and called it unacceptable for the CDU to work with it \u201con any level\u201d. How Spain\u2019s conservatives joined forces with far-right Vox Read more Across Europe , several conservative parties have in recent years retreated from a prohibitive stance on working with the far right. In Sweden, the nationalist Sweden Democrats function as a support party for the centre-right government, while Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular has formed regional coalition governments with the far-right Vox, and could attempt to form a power-sharing pact after Sunday\u2019s national vote. In Germany, the firewall between the CDU and AfD was fiercely protected under the leadership of Angela Merkel. In 2020, her designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, stepped down as party leader when she appeared to lack authority to stop Christian Democrat delegates in Thuringia from voting with the AfD to oust the state\u2019s leftwing premier . Sharing news of Merz\u2019s earlier comments in a tweet, the co-leader of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla, appeared to hail them as the start of the end of the firewall stance that stopped the centre-right from cooperating or deliberately voting with the far right. \u201cTogether we will tear down this wall in the states and at federal level,\u201d Chrupalla said. Merz\u2019s interview followed a series of comments that seemed to relax the CDU\u2019s strict condemnation of the AfD, which was founded on an anti-euro ticket in 2013 but has progressively tacked harder right since. After the AfD\u2019s district council triumph last month, Merz designated the governing Green party and not the far right as the CDU\u2019s \u201cmain enemy\u201d, and on Friday he described his own party as the \u201cAlternative f\u00fcr Deutschland of substance\u201d.

The legislation passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his ministers still requires approval from the lower house of parliament, where the socially liberal three-party coalition has a comfortable majority. It could take effect in January, depending on how quickly that happens. The government plans to make people eligible for citizenship after five years in Germany, or three in case of \u201cspecial integration accomplishments,\u201d rather than eight or six years at present. German-born children would automatically become citizens if one parent has been a legal resident for five years, down from eight years now. Restrictions on holding dual citizenship will also be dropped. In principle, most people from countries other than European Union members and Switzerland now have to give up their previous nationality when they gain German citizenship, though there are some exemptions.

She said the reform follows years of debates that \u201cunfortunately were often marked by exclusion, resentment and cheap propaganda,\u201d and that applicants for citizenship \u201cwill no longer be forced to give up part of their identity.\u201d Faeser also linked the plan to Germany\u2019s quest to attract more skilled workers to the country, which has Europe\u2019s biggest economy, and address labor shortages in a growing number of professions. \u201cWe are in the middle of a worldwide competition for the best people,\u201d she said, adding that Germany could only attract them \u201cif they can fully become part of our society in the foreseeable future, with all democratic rights\u201d enjoyed by German nationals. Applicants will in most cases be required to prove that they can support themselves and their family without receiving state benefits. The new legislation will specify that \u201cantisemitic, racist or other inhumanly motivated actions\u201d rule out naturalization. The government says that 14% of the population, more than 12 million of the country\u2019s 84.4 million inhabitants , doesn\u2019t have German citizenship and that about 5.3 million of those have lived in Germany for at least a decade.

This was despite all other parties urging their supporters to vote for the other candidate. https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/4T1vM Sonneberg is one of the smallest districts in Germany, but the vote has attracted national interest Image: Martin Schutt\/dpa\/picture alliance Advertisement For the first time in Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has won a district council election, administrators announced on Sunday (25.6.2023). Voters in the eastern German town of Sonneberg \u2014 located in former East Germany GDR \u2014 elected\u00a0AfD candidate Robert Sesselmann at the expense of\u00a0incumbent district administrator J\u00fcrgen K\u00f6pper of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) . In the runoff election in the Thuringian district of Sonneberg, Sesselmann won 52.8%\u00a0of the vote, earning\u00a0him the necessary absolute majority, according to election officials. The area of some 57,000 people is one of the smallest\u00a0districts in Germany. Still, the AfD victory is a major breakthrough for the far-right party, whose Thuringia branch has been classified as far-right extremist by Germany's domestic intelligence service. All\u00a0mainstream parties regularly vow to not enter coalition governments\u00a0with the AfD. The AfD's leader in Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, welcomed the win and said it demonstrates the party's recent momentum. \"And then we'll prepare for the state elections in the east, where we can really create a political earthquake,\" he said, referring to state parliament elections in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia, and Brandenburg. Robert Sesselmann (center) was joined by the party's leader in Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke (left), and national AfD chairman Tino Chrupalla (right) Image: Jacob Schr\u00f6ter\/IMAGO How did AfD's opponents react? Thuringia's Interior Minister Georg Maier, who belongs to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) ,\u00a0described the outcome as \"an alarm signal for all democratic forces.\" He called for party-political interests to be set aside and a joint effort to defend democracy. The President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said although not every AfD voter holds extreme right-wing views, the party itself does. \"This is a watershed that this country's democratic political forces cannot simply accept,\" he told the RND media network. The International Auschwitz Committee also expressed horror. \"Today is a sad day for the Sonneberg district, for Germany, and for democracy,\" Executive Vice President Christoph Heubner said. \"A majority of voters have obviously said goodbye to democracy and deliberately opted for an extreme right-wing party of destruction dominated by a Nazi [ Bj\u00f6rn\u00a0H\u00f6cke. eds ].\" What was at stake? Earlier this month, the first round of elections in the runoff vote saw Sesselmann fall short of outright victory by only a few percentage points. Such a strong showing for an AfD candidate raised the alarm nationally, with all other main political parties \u2014 the SPD, the Greens, the neoliberal FDP, and the socialist Left Party \u2014 backing the incumbent. Though the highest political office in that small arena, the position itself\u00a0is of only moderate consequence and carries rather limited power. Even with the AfD's Sesselmann win, many of his duties will entail simply implementing laws from either the state or the federal parliament at the local level. However, critics fear the idea of the AfD wielding political power in any measure and say the party is\u00a0xenophobic and anti-democratic. Germany's domestic intelligence service classifies the party in Thuringia and its controversial hardline leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, as\u00a0far-right extremists. The German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) had\u00a0also urged voters to turn out to support conservative K\u00f6pper. The CDU\u00a0claimed\u00a0the election campaign had\u00a0been abrasive and nasty, with false claims circulating on social media. AfD making inroads The AfD\u00a0win on Sunday is widely seen as a milestone for the far-right\u00a0party, which is\u00a0currently polling between 18% and 20% nationwide. It has gained a wave of support\u00a0as the center-left\u00a0federal coalition government\u00a0of SPD\u00a0with the environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) is showing signs of infighting. Even with their rise, however, Chancellor Olaf Scholz , who is from the SPD, faces a bigger challenge from the right-leaning CDU. The conservative party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel is polling at just under\u00a030%. The AfD first entered the national parliament in 2017 after campaigning strongly against migration. More recently,\u00a0the party\u00a0has been criticizing German support for Ukraine as Kyiv fights off the invasion from Russia. zc, jsi, rc\/kb (dpa, AFP, AP) While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

A police patrol noticed the overloaded vehicle on the A94 highway east of Munich at about 3:15 a.m. and tried to stop it, police said. The driver didn\u2019t react and accelerated to 180 kph (112 mph). Shortly afterward, he lost control of the vehicle when he took a turning off the highway and the van overturned, hurling several of the 23 people on board out of the vehicle. Seven people were killed, including a 6-year-old child, police said in a statement. The other 16 were injured, some of them seriously, and were taken to hospitals. The people on board were Syrian and Turkish citizens. The driver and suspected smuggler, a 24-year-old stateless man resident in Austria, was among the injured. Police said he was formally detained at a hospital and is under investigation on suspicion of homicide among other offenses. The van was designed to carry nine people, and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible for many of the people on board to use seat belts, German news agency dpa reported.

Daniel Halemba was later released when a judge ruled he was not a flight risk. He was elected to the Bavarian parliament earlier this month. He was detained hours before he was due to gain immunity as an Alternative for Germany (AfD) MP when the parliament was sworn in on Monday afternoon. The 22-year-old politician is one of 32 AfD members elected in the party's best-ever election result in Bavaria, where it is now the largest opposition party in the state. Police issued an arrest warrant for him on Friday and he was tracked down near Stuttgart, in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, on Monday morning. One of the new legislature's first acts on Monday was to lift Mr Halemba's immunity. He has said he intends to participate in parliamentary proceedings. Police in W\u00fcrzburg last month raided the premises of the Teutonia Prag student fraternity after neighbours complained of hearing shouts of \"Sieg Heil\" from inside. The phrase was a key Nazi slogan and is banned in Germany. Officers said they had confiscated banned material and that the raid \"confirmed the allegations [made by neighbours]\". Mr Halemba is under investigation on suspicion of sedition and possessing banned symbols. Nazi iconography is also outlawed in Germany. Prosecutors told the BBC he was accused of collusion or suppression of evidence, as he was trying to influence other members of the fraternity to change their statements. \"They want to arrest me... using a totally lawless arrest warrant,\" Mr Halemba said in a video posted to social media before his arrest. His lawyer, Dubravko Mandic, said the allegations against his client had \"no truth\". Katrin Ebner-Steiner, the leader of the AfD in the Bavarian parliament, denounced what she termed a \"politically motivated\" prosecution. The AfD has enjoyed record election results in recent months. The anti-immigration party came third in this month's Bavarian election and second in the state of Hesse.

Share Share options Copy Link EMail Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Poland's relationship with Germany has taken a further battering thanks to Russia's invasion of Ukraine | Omar Marques\/Getty Images September 1, 2022 4:12 pm CET By Jan Cienski At a time when the attention of the European Union is focused on preventing Russia from conquering Ukraine, Poland is reigniting a conflict from the past \u2014 with the country\u2019s de facto ruler on Thursday calling for Germany to pay 6.2 trillion z\u0142oty (\u20ac1.3 trillion) in reparations for its 1939-1945 occupation. \u201cThis is our goal,\u201d Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the head of Poland\u2019s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, said on the 83rd anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland. \u201cI know that we are embarking on a path that will take a long time and will not be easy. We do not promise quick successes,\u201d Kaczy\u0144ski said in a press conference to publicize a report prepared by Law and Justice. Advertisement Advertisement Poland was ravaged by Germany\u2019s invasion and occupation, with about 6 million deaths \u2014 a fifth of the population (including almost all of its Jewish people). Warsaw was left a smoking ruin. Thursday\u2019s news conference was held in Warsaw\u2019s royal castle, a building destroyed during the war and only rebuilt in the 1970s. \u201cThe Germans invaded Poland and did great damage to us. The occupation was extremely criminal, incredibly cruel and caused effects that in many cases continue to this day,\u201d Kaczy\u0144ski said. But Poland\u2019s post-war communist government \u2014 a satellite of the USSR \u2014 agreed to drop demands for reparations against East Germany in 1953, making it legally complicated for Warsaw to file any claims. Poland also gained large territories from Germany after the war, while losing about a third of pre-war Poland\u2019s lands to the Soviet Union. \u201cThe position of the Federal Government is unchanged, the reparations issue is closed,\u201d said Germany\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cPoland renounced further reparations a long time ago, in 1953, and has confirmed this renunciation several times. This is an essential basis for today\u2019s European order. Germany stands politically and morally by its responsibility for the Second World War.\u201d The ruins of Warsaw after its occupation by German forces in 1940s | Central Press\/Getty Images \u201cThere is no chance for reparations,\u201d Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, a member of the European Parliament from the opposition Civic Platform party and a former Polish foreign minister, said in a radio interview, warning that the only impact will be to worsen relations between Warsaw and Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s pure propaganda, a fairy tale for the na\u00efve.\u201d Donald Tusk, the leader of Civic Platform and a former Polish prime minister and president of the European Council, accused Kaczy\u0144ski of playing politics with his demand. Advertisement Advertisement \u201cThis is not about any reparations from Germany, this is about a political campaign,\u201d he said . \u201cJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski is not hiding it, that they want to rebuild support for the ruling party with this anti-German campaign.\u201d PiS hopes to win an unprecedented third term in power in next year\u2019s parliamentary election. Although the party is still leading in opinion polls , it has been losing ground to the opposition as the country deals with high inflation, slowing economic growth and soaring energy prices. Kaczy\u0144ski has long seen Germany as Poland\u2019s historic enemy, despite both countries being in NATO and in the EU, and Germany being by far Poland\u2019s largest trading partner. He\u2019s suspicious that Berlin is using the EU as a cover to \u201cbuild the Fourth Reich.\u201d Poland\u2019s relationship with Germany has taken a further battering thanks to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Warsaw has been one of the most enthusiastic backers of Kyiv, sending money and weapons to Ukraine, while leading the charge to cut off imports of Russian energy and to block Russian tourists from visiting the Continent. Berlin\u2019s caution in moving rapidly in the same direction has aroused Polish anger. Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s demand is still not official government policy, and Warsaw hasn\u2019t issued any formal request to Berlin. \u201cWe are obliged today to calculate these losses as accurately as possible and present a proper account to those who owe it,\u201d said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Advertisement Advertisement Berlin feels that the 1990 deal allowing West and East Germany to unify ended all outstanding issues related to the war, and rejects demands for reparations. Germany has paid compensation to individual victims of the Holocaust and to people forced to work as slave laborers, but not to other countries; Greece has an outstanding claim estimated at \u20ac289 billion, but the German parliament found it does not have legal merit.

The public prosecutor's office in Kaiserslautern charged the man with the German equivalent of first-degree murder, along with lesser charges. His 33-year-old accomplice was not charged with murder but rather obstruction of justice for helping his acquaintance to flee. Prosecutors said the investigation had shown that the elder primary suspect was the only one to open fire on the officers. A psychological evaluation of the two found they were fit to stand trial and not lacking in mental capabilities. What happened in the fatal shooting death of two police in Kusel in January? More details of the crime emerged thanks to the prosecutor's office as a trial date was set for late June. The prosecutor's office said\u00a0the suspect and his friend had spent the night\u00a0wildlife poaching prior to the murder of the two police officers. When the two police stopped the car with the pair allegedly responsible for their deaths on a remote rural road, the 38-year-old man first fired at the 24-year-old policewoman\u00a0with a shotgun at close range. The man then allegedly shot the policeman with a shotgun, then a hunting rifle. The policeman fired back but missed. He managed to make a distress call declaring, \"They're shooting.\" Having killed the male officer, investigators allege the primary suspect finally fired a close range, fatal\u00a0shot to the head of the severely wounded female officer. The two men were apprehended the following day in Saarland following a major police search and public appeal for leads. What do we know about the man who was charged? The 38-year-old suspect had previously come to the attention of the authorities for wildlife poaching-related offenses. Since April 2020, he had been prohibited from owning or borrowing firearms. He also did not have the requisite hunting permits. The murder weapon in the double police killing legally belonged to the wife of the 38-year-old man. He is accused of both poaching and killing two police officers. Prosecutors believe his motive was to protect and cover up\u00a0his black market poaching operations. ar\/msh (AFP, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement","question":"How did the 38-year-old suspect allegedly kill the two police officers near Kusel in January 2022?","answer":"The suspect first shot the 24-year-old policewoman at close range with a shotgun, then shot the policeman with a shotgun and a hunting rifle.

Ritsu Doan, one of the substitutes, hammered in a shot from the edge of the box in the 48th minute that Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon \u2013 whose poor clearance had created the danger \u2013 could not keep out. Three minutes later, Ao Tanaka scored from close range after the other halftime sub Kaoru Mitoma cut the ball back from the byline. The VAR system took several minutes to confirm the ball had not gone out before Mitoma's touch, sparking wild celebrations by Japan and their fans when the verdict came in. Spain had looked in total control in the first half but were suddenly clinging to their chance of staying in the World Cup as Costa Rica and Germany battled out their own drama in the other Group E match. Alvaro Morata had put the Spaniards ahead when he scored his third goal in three games in Qatar, rising high above Japan's defence to power a header past goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda in the 11th minute after a cross by Cesar Azpilicueta. The breathtaking 2-1 win for Japan - who also beat Germany 2-1 after going behind in their opening match of the tournament - meant they topped Group E, followed by Spain in second who finished ahead of third-placed Germany only on goal difference.

The \"AquaDom\" - home to 1,500 fish - is 15.85m high (52 ft) and was described as the largest free-standing cylindrical aquarium in the world. Two people were injured by falling glass after the blast. Police said there had been \"incredible\" damage. Video showed an empty tank with water pouring into the hotel lobby. Guests have been moved out of the hotel following the incident at 05:50 (04:50 GMT). A spokesman for Berlin's fire brigade told the BBC the vast majority of the fish had died, while the cold weather had made rescue attempts more difficult. The tank had contained more than 100 different species. However, fire brigade official James Klein later told local media that \"several dozen\" fish had been found alive in places where residual water had collected. He said they were being rehoused in other aquariums. Also, the Associated Press quoted officials as saying they were working to rescue another 400-500 fish in smaller tanks under the hotel lobby which had been deprived of oxygen because of the disaster. Outside the Radisson Blu, a pile of debris lay in front of what were the front doors, which now hang into the street - twisted at an angle by the force of the exploding tank. Reuters \/Michele Tantussi More than 100 fire fighters were in attendance at the incident in Berlin on Friday morning Paul Maletzki was staying on the fourth floor with his girlfriend. He described being woken up by a loud bang and shaking. When he looked down into the lobby, he saw water flowing across it. They and other guests were later escorted out of the hotel by armed police. The Mayor of Berlin Franziska Giffey went to the hotel to see the damage and described the tank burst as being like a tsunami. She expressed relief it had happened so early in the morning - saying an hour or so later, and the lobby and street outside would have been busy with visitors, many of them children. Sandra Weeser, a member of the German federal parliament who had been staying at the hotel, told local television that she had been woken up by \"a kind of shock wave\" and described the scene outside the hotel as a \"picture of devastation\". She said fish which may have been saved had frozen to death and recalled seeing a \"large parrotfish lying on the ground, frozen\". The aquarium was modernised two years ago, and there is a clear-walled lift built inside for use by visitors. Some of the rooms in the hotel are advertised as having views of it. Berlin's fire brigade said more than 100 firefighters were sent to the scene and it was not clear what caused the break. It said it used rescue dogs to check the area inside the hotel for anyone potentially injured, with nobody found. Police said \"massive amounts\" of water were flowing into nearby streets and people in the area should drive cautiously. Fabrizio Bensch \/ Reuters The AquaDom in Berlin contained about 1,500 fish and over a million litres of water A police source told local media there is no evidence the break was the result of a targeted attack. But there has been speculation that freezing temperature - which dropped as low as -6C overnight - may have caused a crack in the tank. Berlin's public transport authority said Karl-Liebknecht street outside the hotel had been closed off due to \"an extreme amount of water on the road\". Trams service in the area was also stopped. AquaDom was opened in December 2003 and was given the Guinness World Record for being the world's largest cylindrical aquarium . According to reports at the time of its construction, it cost about \u20ac12.8m (\u00a311.2m) to build. Clarification: An earlier version said the aquarium was operated by SeaLife.

{"year":"2022","month":"02","event_desc":"13 February \u00a0  The 2022 German presidential election Frank-Walter Steinmeier is re-elected.","text":"Politics Germany German presidential election: A foregone conclusion Ben Knight 02\/12\/2022 February 12, 2022 The Social Democrat Frank-Walter Steinmeier has been reelected as German president delivering a widely-praised speech in the Bundestag. In an increasingly polarized Germany, his job could become more difficult. https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/46kXp The German president is not as powerful as his counterparts in the United States, France and Russia Image: Mohssen Assanimoghaddam\/dpa\/picture alliance Advertisement Frank-Walter Steinmeier was overwhelmingly re-elected as German president on Sunday, taking 1,045 of the 1,425 votes cast by the Federal Convention, a body that convenes every five years for this one purpose in the German parliament. The result had been a foregone conclusion ever since December, when Olaf Scholz entered the chancellery and his coalition partners, the Greens and the Free Democrats, made clear that they would not oppose his candidacy. If his election was a formality, however, the acceptance speech was more forthright than many expected. It included a direct appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, at whose door he put the responsibility for the current escalation at the Ukrainian border. \"Undo the noose around Ukraine's neck!\" he said. \"And seek a path together with us that preserves peace in Europe!\" From there, the speech became\u00a0a rallying cry for democracy. \"My responsibility is to all the people who live in our country,\" he told the chamber. \"Non-partisan, yes - But I am not neutral when the issue is democracy. Anyone who fights for democracy has me at their side. Those who attack\u00a0it\u00a0will have me as an opponent!\" A bold move When Steinmeier announced last\u00a0May that he wanted to run\u00a0for\u00a0his office again, many saw it as an unusual gamble in the cautious world of German politics. For one thing, an incumbent president rarely declares his interest in a second term so readily. Secondly, the then 65-year-old could have had no idea last year whether he could rely on a majority in the Federal Convention in this year's election. At the time, his center-left Social Democrats (SPD) were lagging behind the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) in the polls ahead of the September 2021 election. Had the conservative party won, it would probably have installed a presidential candidate of its own. As it was, the campaign of CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet became derailed, and the SPD's Olaf Scholz became head of government against the odds. Scholz's chosen coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats, were soon on board with\u00a0a second Steinmeier term. The CDU, still nursing the wounds of the defeat, decided not to run its own candidate. Drag queen Olivia Jones was one of the celebrIties who attracted media attention in the Federal Assembly in 2017 Image: Annegret Hilse\/SvenSimon\/picture alliance Stability is a plus A total of 1,472 people formed the Federal Convention this year, comprised of all 736 members of the Bundestag plus another 736 people chosen by representatives of the 16 German states. As in most years, the latter group included\u00a0celebrities and other prominent figures, including\u00a0several athletes and actors,\u00a0an astronaut, and a number of epidemiologists and health workers,\u00a0named as a gesture of appreciation for their work during the pandemic. The oldest member of the assembly was 92-year-old Holocaust survivor Karla Spagerer,\u00a0who\u00a0survived a COVID-19 infection. The convention's choice of Steinmeier is not a bad outcome, according to Uwe Jun, politics professor at the University of Trier. \"The general opinion on Steinmeier is that he has performed his role satisfactorily in his first term,\" Jun told DW. \"He's someone who is very down-to-earth, who can talk to different social groups. And he always hit the right tone in difficult questions, in crisis questions, in the coronavirus pandemic.\" There have indeed been easier times to be German president, an office whose social role as a unifying figurehead for the nation usually takes precedence over its constitutional role. \"The president has to represent Germany both domestically and to the world, and he has to perform an integrating\u00a0role,\" Jun said. \"The latter has become more difficult because society is becoming more and more heterogenous and more polarized. Parts of society don't want to be seen to be represented by him.\" \"He plays an important function to society,\" agreed Ursula M\u00fcnch, director of the Bavaria-based institute the Academy for Political Education. \"And I would say that it has become more difficult for the president, because those who have lost faith in the political system will not trust the president as much.\" German president calls for solidarity during pandemic To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A powerful office \u2014 but only in a crisis The German president is not as powerful as his counterparts elsewhere, a legacy\u00a0of the office's place in German history. The president of the Weimar Repubic wielded substantial power, and in 1933\u00a0the elderly \"Reichspr\u00e4sident\" Paul von Hindenburg was persuaded to use it to pave the way for Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler to take over the country. Nowadays the constitutional purpose of the president only rarely becomes obvious. He (and up till now it has always been a he) represents Germany as head of state, but makes no executive or policy decisions. He does, however, have constitutional powers to step in as arbiter when there is a political impasse: It is the president who decides, for example, whether the Bundestag must be dissolved if the chancellor loses a vote of no-confidence. He also has the power to veto laws if he believes they violate the German constitution. \"The founding mothers and fathers of the Basic Law consciously decided not to give the president major powers. It's an important position, but it's not a powerful position \u2014 unless the other institutions are in crisis,\" M\u00fcnch said. And such crises do happen, and indeed can happen more frequently now that there are more parties in the Bundestag, making majority-building more difficult. Steinmeier himself had to step in 2017 when Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to form a coalition with the Greens and the Free Democrats after her election victory. As that crisis unfolded, it fell to the president to decide against triggering new elections, therefore forcing Merkel to form another grand coalition with the Social Democrats. Marginal candidates have a role In theory, any German who is at least 40 years old is eligible for election. Candidates may be proposed by any member of the Federal Convention. If none of the candidates receives an absolute majority in the first and second ballots, a third ballot is held. In this case, a relative majority is sufficient. New candidates can also be nominated for the second and third ballots. Another element of the president's social role arises from his independence from government, something that allows him to raise awareness for issues that may not be on the agenda for the parliament or the government. That is also true of the election itself, which always includes extra candidates who stand no chance of winning, but who can use the opportunity to make a point. This year's election included\u00a0three other candidates: Gerhard Trabert, a doctor\u00a0nominated by the socialist Left party; Max Otte, a CDU member nominated by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD); and Stefanie Gebauer, a 41-year-old physicist with the regional center-right\u00a0Free Voters party. \"It's always been a part of the presidential election that there were alternative candidates \u2014 that is important,\" said M\u00fcnch, who thinks that the Left party's candidate, Trabert, was a \"skillful, clever choice.\" \"Of course, he won't become president, and he doesn't want to \u2014 he wants to carry on working as a doctor helping the disadvantaged,\" she said. \"And he can use the election to draw attention to the fact that there are issues and social groups who we and the media are too often only marginally aware of.\" The AfD, meanwhile, appeared to have\u00a0a different goal in choosing Otte: provoking its political rivals. Otte is a member of the CDU's nationalist-leaning wing, the WerteUnion (Values Union), and the AfD was apparently hoping to use his candidacy to suggest that some CDU voters might be more at home with the far-right party. But these sideshows, important as they might be as illustrations of the political landscape,\u00a0will not concern Steinmeier as he begins his second term as Germany's head of state.

Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said the network was part of the \"Reichsb\u00fcrger scene.\" https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/4KaDg Image: Fricke\/NEWS5\/AFP Advertisement In a nationwide raid, 25 suspected members and supporters of a terrorist organization in Germany were arrested early Wednesday. Officials said the network, part of a wider right-wing movement, was already well established with a\u00a0concrete plan\u00a0to overthrow the German state by force and install a new government. What we know so far The raids were announced by Germany's federal prosecution agency\u00a0and German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann.\u00a0The minister said the investigations were directed against a suspected terrorist network with known ties to the Reichsb\u00fcrger movement. He\u00a0said that the raids had taken place on individuals suspected of planning an armed attack on state institutions. \"The suspicion exists that an armed attack on constitutional organs was planned,\" Buschmann wrote. The search operation is reported to have covered 130 properties belonging to 52 suspects in 11 German states. According to prosecution officials, the arrested suspects \"belong to a terrorist organization\" that was believed to have been founded at the end of November 2021. The group \"set itself the goal of overcoming the existing state order in Germany and replacing it with its own form of state, which has already been worked out in outline,\" prosecutors added. Of the 25 men and women arrested, 24 were from Germany and one suspected supporter is from Russia. One arrest took place in Austria and one in Italy. There are 27 other suspects, the federal prosecutor's office said. What's behind Germany's far-right raids? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Later on Wednesday it was confirmed by\u00a0the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe, southern Germany,\u00a0that 19 of the 25 suspects were\u00a0already in pre-trial detention. The United States has\u00a0offered support to the German government in the wake of the arrests. \"We remain in close contact with our partners in government and stand ready to help if we are asked to do so,\" said White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday. Two ringleaders identified Prosecutors identified the suspected ringleaders only as Heinrich XIII P. R. and Ruediger v. P., in line with German privacy rules. The news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the former was a well-known 71-year-old member of a minor German noble family, while the latter was a 69-year-old former paratrooper. According to prosecutors, P. R., who the group planned to install as the new leader of Germany, had made contact with Russian officials seeking to establish a new order in Germany once the Berlin government was overthrown. A Russian woman, Vitalia B., had allegedly given him help with this.\u00a0The Russian Embassy in Berlin\u00a0denied having links to far-right terror groups. A currently-serving\u00a0soldier in the Bundeswehr's Special Forces Command (KSK) as well as several Bundeswehr reservists are also among suspects in the case, a spokesperson for Germany's Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD) told the DPA news agency. A search was reported to have been carried out at the soldier's home and his barracks office in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The trigger for the raids was an investigation into another Reichsb\u00fcrger group that\u00a0had planned to kidnap German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. German\u00a0Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the case revealed the threat posed by the Reichsb\u00fcrger\u00a0movement. \"The investigations provide a glimpse into the abyss of a terrorist threat from the Reichsb\u00fcrger scene,\" Faeser said in a statement. \"We know how to defend ourselves with all our might against the enemies of democracy,\" she added. The president of the German parliament's lower house,\u00a0B\u00e4rbel Bas, said the operation shows \"that our democratic constitutional state is attentive and capable of action.\" Belief in violence to overthrow 'deep state' The group had targeted members of the Bundeswehr and police in a bid to achieve their goals. It had formed a \"military arm\" and a council presided over by Heinrich XIII P. R. Speaking at a press conference, Germany's chief federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, said that the organization had formed around P. R. at the end of November 2021. Frank said the group had established\u00a0a council that was intended to act as the government of the new state with some individuals already designated for ministerial roles. Among them\u00a0was a former member of the Bundestag who was to take over the justice portfolio, Frank said. To implement their plans, the group's members\u00a0were prepared to use\u00a0military means and violence against state representatives\u00a0and were willing to kill to achieve their goals. According to investigators, the members of the group \"followed a conglomerate of conspiracy myths consisting of narratives of the so-called 'Reichsb\u00fcrger' as well as QAnon ideology.\" The prosecutors\u00a0added that the group's adherents\u00a0believe Germany is ruled by a so-called \"deep state,\"\u00a0similar to baseless claims about the United States that were made by former President Donald Trump. The Reichsb\u00fcrger movement is made up of a number of small organizations\u00a0and individuals, mainly in the states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria. They do not accept the legality of the Federal Republic of Germany or any of its government authorities. The movement\u00a0argues that the German constitution prior to World War II was never properly nullified and that the formation of the former West Germany in 1949, and now reunified Germany, was therefore never valid. jsi, rc\/msh (AFP, Reuters, dpa) While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Der SPD-Landesvorstand beschloss am Dienstagabend in der Hansestadt einstimmig, entsprechende Gespr\u00e4che mit den Gr\u00fcnen aufzunehmen. Vorausgegangen waren auch Sondierungen mit der CDU. SPD und Gr\u00fcnen regieren in Hamburg bereits seit 2015. Die Gr\u00fcnen hatten die Aufnahme von Koalitionsverhandlungen bereits zuvor gebilligt. Die SPD setze auf eine Fortsetzung der \"vertrauensvollen Zusammenarbeit\" mit den Gr\u00fcnen, erkl\u00e4rte die Landeschefin der Sozialdemokraten, Melanie Leonhard. \"Auf Basis der konstruktiven Sondierungsgespr\u00e4che gehen wir sehr zuversichtlich in die Verhandlungen.\" Meine News Ukraine-News im Ticker Ende des Ukraine-Krieges: Trump mit Vorw\u00fcrfen gegen Selenskyj \u2013 Russisches Ultimatum f\u00fcr Waffenruhe Vor 2 Std.

Ein B\u00fcndnis mit der CDU sei \"denkbar\", erkl\u00e4rte Tschentscher danach. Eine Koalition mit den Gr\u00fcnen sei allerdings weiterhin die \"naheliegende Option\". Bei einem Video-Interview mit Gr\u00fcnen-Chef Robert Habeck zur Coronavirus-Krise kam es zu einer witzigen Panne. Hamburg-Wahl: So will die CDU nach dem Desaster personell reagieren Update vom 27. Februar, 21.55 Uhr: Hamburgs\u00a0CDU-Landesvorsitzender Roland Heintze und Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg haben Verantwortung f\u00fcr die Schlappe bei der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl \u00fcbernommen - unmittelbare personelle Konsequenzen aber ausgeschlossen. Heintze sprach am Donnerstagabend bei einem Parteitag angesichts der 11,2 Prozent von einem \u201ebitteren\u201c Wahlergebnis, Weinberg von einem \u201esauschlechten\u201c. Ver\u00e4nderungen auch personeller Art seien n\u00f6tig, sagte Heintze, warnte aber vor \u201eSchnellsch\u00fcssen\u201c. Nach dem Wahldesaster waren personelle Konsequenzen im Landesvorstand und an der Fraktionsspitze gefordert worden, unter anderem von Alt-B\u00fcrgermeister Christoph Ahlhaus . Zun\u00e4chst m\u00fcsse die CDU es schaffen, an Profil zu gewinnen und eine kampagnenf\u00e4hige Organisation zu bilden - \u201eund dann m\u00fcssen wir uns entscheiden, welchen K\u00f6pfen wir das zutrauen\u201c, sagte Heintze, der es ebenso wie Weinberg nicht geschafft hatte, \u00fcber die Landesliste in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einzuziehen. Der Landesvorstand der CDU soll von einem Parteitag im Juni neu bestimmt werden. Im Zweikampf der B\u00fcrgermeisterkandidaten von SPD und Gr\u00fcnen sei die CDU \u201eunter die R\u00e4der gekommen, wir kamen nicht mehr vor\u201c, sagte Heintze. B\u00fcrgermeister Peter Tschentscher (SPD) habe es in kurzer Zeit geschafft, sich einen Amtsbonus anzueignen, der ihn in vielen Bereichen w\u00e4hlbar gemacht habe, \u201eauch f\u00fcr unsere W\u00e4hler\u201c. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: SPD und Gr\u00fcne treffen sich zu ersten Sondierungen Update vom 26. Februar, 17.11 Uhr: Nach der B\u00fcrgerschaftwahl treffen sich Hamburger SPD und Gr\u00fcne am Freitag zu einem ersten Sondierungsgespr\u00e4ch. Die Chancen f\u00fcr eine rot-gr\u00fcne Koalition stehen gut. Die SPD hatte aber am Wahlabend deutlich gemacht auch mit der CDU sondieren zu wollen. Aber bereits im Wahlkampf hatten SPD und Gr\u00fcne eine Neuauflage von Rot-Gr\u00fcn als Wunschoption bezeichnet. Ein neuerliches B\u00fcndnis aus SPD und Gr\u00fcnen gilt in der Hansestadt als wahrscheinlichste Option. Die CDU erkl\u00e4rte sich zwar zu Sondierungen mit der SPD bereit, gab sich angesichts ihres eigenen Abschneidens aber hinsichtlich einer Regierungsbeteiligung zur\u00fcckhaltend. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Arge Vorw\u00fcrfe gegen Lindner - Heftige Wahlpannen, Stimmzettel landeten im Altpapier Update vom 24. Februar, 16.15 Uhr: Bei der\u00a0Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl\u00a0sind bei der Ausz\u00e4hlung der Stimmen gleich mehrere Pannen passiert. In einem Wahlbezirk in Eimsb\u00fcttel sind angekreuzte Wahlkreisstimmzettel\u00a0versehentlich im Altpapier\u00a0gelandet - und sp\u00e4ter von der M\u00fcllabfuhr abgeholt worden, wie Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf am Dienstag sagte. Die meisten Stimmzettel konnten wiedergefunden und am Montag doch noch ausgez\u00e4hlt werden,\u00a018 Zettel mit je f\u00fcnf Stimmen aber blieben verschollen. \u201eDiese 90 Stimmen sind aber nicht mandatsrelevant\u201c, betonte Rudolf. Trotzdem sei das \u201eein sehr \u00e4rgerlicher Vorfall\u201c gewesen. Eine weitere \u201eunsch\u00f6ne Besonderheit\u201c, wie Rudolf es nannte, gab es auch im Wahlkreis S\u00fcderelbe: Dort waren insgesamt 16 fehlerhaft gedruckte Wahlkreisstimmzettel im Umlauf . Bereits bei den Bezirksversammlungswahlen im vergangenen Jahr war es in Wandsbek zu einem \u00e4hnlichen Vorfall gekommen. Auch dieser Panne ist Rudolf zufolge \u201ekeine Ergebnisrelevanz\u201c beizumessen. In zwei Wahllokalen wurden bei der ersten Ausz\u00e4hlung der Landeslisten W\u00e4hlerstimmen vertauscht. In Langenhorn wurden zun\u00e4chst die Gr\u00fcnen-Stimmen irrt\u00fcmlich der FDP zugeordnet - und umgekehrt. Der Fehler wurde sp\u00e4ter festgestellt und berichtigt. Auch in Winterhude waren vor\u00fcbergehend Stimmen vertauscht gewesen. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Urlaubsfoto mit Freundin kurz vorm FDP-Desaster - arge Vorw\u00fcrfe gegen Lindner 13.21 Uhr: Nach dem desastr\u00f6sen Scheitern der FDP bei der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl sorgt ein Foto von Parteichef Christian Lindner offenbar f\u00fcr Unmut bei seinen Parteikollegen. Auf dem Bild zu sehen sind Lindner und seine Freundin, Journalistin Franca Lehfeldt , bei einem Kurztrip nach Amsterdam . Verbreitet hat der FDP-Chef das Foto \u00fcber sein Instagram-Profil . Christian Lindner machte kurz vor der Hamburg-Wahl noch Urlaub mit seiner Freundin Franca Lehfeldt. \u00a9\u00a0Screenshot: Instagram Hamburg: FDP-Chef Lindner muss sich nach desastr\u00f6sem Wahl-Ergebnis Vorw\u00fcrfen stellen Warum sich manche FDP-ler \u00fcber den auf den ersten Blick harmlosen Schnappschuss \u00e4rgern? Lindner knipste das Selfie ausgerechnet am letzten Sonntag vor der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl . Dass sich Lindner einen Liebes-Urlaub g\u00f6nnte, w\u00e4hrend der Wahlkampf in Hamburg auf Hochtouren lief, f\u00e4llt dem FDP-Chef nach dem fatalen Wahl-Ergebnis nun auf die F\u00fc\u00dfe. Denn mit nur 4,9 Prozent verpasste die FDP knapp eine Woche sp\u00e4ter den Einzug in die B\u00fcrgerschaft . Im Gegensatz dazu hatten die Freien Liberalen vor f\u00fcnf Jahren in der Hansestadt immerhin noch 7,4 Prozent geholt. Parteikollegen Lindners monieren nun laut Bild.de , dass der FDP-Chef an einem entscheidenden Tag im Wahlkampf gefehlt habe . Auf Instagram sorgt das Foto nach der Wahl f\u00fcr Spott und H\u00e4me. \u201eSo sieht erfolgreicher Wahlkampf aus\u201c, schreibt ein Nutzer in den Kommentaren - und meint das offensichtlich ironisch. Ein anderer Kommentar:\u00a0\u201eDaf\u00fcr sind die Z\u00e4hne gut gebleeched. Man kann ja nicht alle Baustellen gleichzeitig im Griff haben.\u201c Lindner reagierte bislang nicht auf die Vorw\u00fcrfe und scheint sich generell eher bedeckt zu halten. Wie Bild.de berichtet, soll er eine\u00a0Anfrage von Anne Will zur Teilnahme an ihrer Talkshow abgesagt haben. Schlie\u00dflich war anstelle des aktuellen FDP-Chefs Alt-Liberale Gerhart Baum bei Will. Hamburg: Umstrittener Linken-Kandidat Tom Radtke wird nicht in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehen Update vom 25. Februar 2020, 12.23 Uhr: Die FDP hat in Hamburg den Wiedereinzug in die B\u00fcrgerschaft verpasst - m\u00f6glicherweise eine Folge der Ereignisse in Th\u00fcringen . Auch andere Landesverb\u00e4nde stecken in N\u00f6ten: Eine Umfrage aus Bayern bringt weitere schlechte Neuigkeiten f\u00fcr die Liberalen , wie Merkur.de * berichtet. 22.03 Uhr: Der von den Hamburger Linken im Nachhinein ungewollte Listenkandidat Tom Radtke wird der neuen B\u00fcrgerschaft nicht angeh\u00f6ren. Laut vorl\u00e4ufigem amtlichen Endergebnis erhielt der 18-J\u00e4hrige, der Ende Januar durch einen relativierenden Holocaust-Tweet bundesweit Emp\u00f6rung ausgel\u00f6st hatte, nicht die n\u00f6tigen Stimmen. \u201eIch wurde nicht gew\u00e4hlt, werde aber weiter Politik machen\u201c, twitterte er am Montagabend. Radtke stand auf Platz 20 der Linken-Landesliste. Inzwischen l\u00e4uft nach Angaben der Linken ein Parteiausschlussverfahren gegen ihn. Der Sch\u00fcler hatte sich in seiner Wahlbewerbung als Klima- und Netzaktivist vorgestellt. Sp\u00e4ter hatte er im Netz schwere Anschuldigungen gegen f\u00fchrende K\u00f6pfe der Fridays-for-Future-Bewegung sowie gegen Linke und Gr\u00fcne erhoben. Zuletzt hatte er einen Tag vor der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl ein Bild von sich mit einer Fahne der vom Verfassungsschutz als rechtsextrem eingestuften Identit\u00e4ren Bewegung gepostet - aus der Gedenkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr den von den Nazis ermordeten Kommunisten-F\u00fchrer Ernst Th\u00e4lmann. Hamburg: CDU-Spitzenkandidat verpasst Einzug in die B\u00fcrgerschaft 21.52 Uhr:\u00a0CDU -Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg hat den Einzug in die Hamburgische B\u00fcrgerschaft verpasst. Wie Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf am Montagabend mitteilte, wurden alle 15 Mandate der CDU \u00fcber Wahlkreismandate vergeben. Der Altonaer Bundestagsabgeordnete hatte lediglich auf der Landesliste kandidiert. Seine CDU war bei der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl auf f\u00fcr die Hansestadt historisch schlechte 11,2 Prozent abgest\u00fcrzt. Ebenfalls ohne Mandat blieb der Landesvorsitzende Roland Heintze, der auf Platz drei der Landesliste angetreten war. 20.37 Uhr: Der ehemalige CDU-Fraktionschef und Kandidat auf den Parteivorsitz Friedrich Merz hat das Hamburger Wahlergebnis als \u201eDesaster\u201c f\u00fcr die CDU bzeichnet. Jetzt sei die richtige Analyse wichtig. Diese hei\u00dfe, dass die Gr\u00fcnen wahrscheinlich der Hauptgegner der CDU bei den n\u00e4chsten Bundestagswahlen seien. \u201eUnd da freu ich mich schon drauf\u201c, sagte der 64-J\u00e4hrige. 20.22 Uhr: Die SPD in Hamburg will Gr\u00fcnen und CDU noch in dieser Woche Termine f\u00fcr Sondierungsgespr\u00e4che anbieten. \u201eWir wollen die Hamburgerinnen und Hamburger nicht l\u00e4nger als n\u00f6tig auf eine neue Regierung warten lassen\u201c, sagte die SPD-Landesvorsitzende und Sozialsenatorin Melanie Leonhard am Montagabend am Rande der Sitzung des Landesvorstands. B\u00fcrgermeister Peter Tschentscher (SPD) betonte: \u201eWir werden jetzt sehr bald zun\u00e4chst auf die Gr\u00fcnen, aber eben in einem zweiten Schritt auch auf die CDU zugehen und ein Gespr\u00e4ch anbieten.\u201c Die \u201eerste Option\u201c sei aber ein rot-gr\u00fcner Koalitionsvertrag. B\u00fcrgschaftswahl: FDP scheitert an F\u00fcnf-Prozent-H\u00fcrde in Hamburg 20.16 Uhr: Nach den Hochrechnungen am Montagabend nach der Wahl ist das desastr\u00f6se Ergebnis f\u00fcr die FDP zumindest vorl\u00e4ufig amtlich. Demnach haben es die Liberalen nicht (4,9 Prozent) in das Landesparlament geschafft. Zu stark scheint der Vertrauensverlust nach dem Debakel in Th\u00fcringen zu sein. FDP-Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels sicherte sich allerdings nach den am Montag vom Landeswahlamt ver\u00f6ffentlichten Ergebnissen \u00fcber ihren Wahlkreis Blankenese ein Mandat. Hamburgweit kamen die Liberalen auf 4,9 Prozent der Stimmen. Dass sich in Th\u00fcringen der FDP-Kandidat Thomas Kemmerich von der CDU und der AfD zum Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten hatte mitw\u00e4hlen lassen, wird als ein Hauptgrund f\u00fcr das schlechte Abschneiden der Christdemokraten und der Liberalen gesehen. Auf die Schnelle konnten scheinbar auch nicht die andauernden und vielf\u00e4ltigen Entschuldigungen von Partei-Chef Christian Lindner helfen, W\u00e4hler zu mobilisieren. Nach der Wahl in Hamburg will Lindner nun den Kurs der Mitte in seiner Partei sch\u00e4rfen.\u00a0\u201eWir werden in der n\u00e4chsten Zeit ganz offensiv unsere politische Position der Mitte reklamieren und auch die Auseinandersetzung mit denen suchen, die versuchen, jetzt aus dem Fehler von Erfurt eine grundlegende Ver\u00e4nderung unserer politischen Landschaft herbeizuf\u00fchren\u201c, sagte Lindner in Berlin nach einer Pr\u00e4sidiumssitzung seiner Partei. 17.41 Uhr: Grund zur anhaltenden Verwirrung \u00fcber den Verbleib der FDP im Hamburger Landesparlament ist aber nicht nur die Ausz\u00e4hl-Panne. Das Ausz\u00e4hlungskonzept der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl ist zus\u00e4tzlich extrem komplex. Nach der ersten, vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung der Landesstimmen folgen weitere Ausz\u00e4hlungen. Mit der n\u00e4chsten Hochrechnung darf am Montagabend gegen 18.30 Uhr gerechnet werden. Wegen der sogenannten Heilungsregel kann es bei den aktuellen Ergebnissen aber noch Verschiebungen geben. Zun\u00e4chst ung\u00fcltige Stimmen k\u00f6nnen bei der zweiten Ausz\u00e4hlrunde im Zuge dieser Regel als g\u00fcltig gewertet werden, wenn der eigentliche W\u00e4hlerwille erkennbar ist. Dies w\u00e4re zum Beispiel der Fall, wenn ein W\u00e4hler auf der Landesliste einer einzelnen Partei sechs statt der ihm maximal zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden f\u00fcnf Stimmen gegeben hat. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: FDP bangt um ihren Platz - SPD feiert derweil einen Sieg, der Fragen aufwirft 17.28 Uhr: Die FDP muss in Hamburg weiterhin um den Wiedereinzug in das Hamburger Landesparlament bangen. Nach einer Panne bei der Stimmausz\u00e4hlung am Sonntagabend kann es sein, dass die Liberalen , die es nur knapp geschafft zu haben schienen die f\u00fcnf Prozenth\u00fcrde zu nehmen, zu wenig Stimmen auf sich vereinen k\u00f6nnen. Im Wahlbezirk Langenhorn wurden die Ergebnisse von Gr\u00fcnen und FDP verwechselt: Die 22,4 Prozent der \u00d6kopartei wurden versehentlich den Freidemokraten zugeschrieben, wie der zust\u00e4ndige Bezirkswahlleiter Tom Oelrichs am Montag sagte. 16.37 Uhr: Nach der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg kann die SPD nach einiger Zeit wieder einen eindeutigen Wahlsieg feiern. Das gesteht auch Parteivorsitzende Saskia Esken ein. Die Sozialdemokraten seien zuletzt nicht so daran gew\u00f6hnt gewesen, feiern zu k\u00f6nnen,\u00a0\u201ejetzt haben wir wirklich einen Anlass\u201c, so Esken. Doch dass sie und ihr Kollege Norbert Walter-Borjans sich diesen Sieg zuschreiben k\u00f6nnen, ist eher unwahrscheinlich. Die Landesvertretung in Hamburg hatte das neue Spitzen-Duo der SPD v\u00f6llig aus dem Wahlkampf herausgehalten. Nicht zu einer einzigen Wahlkampfveranstaltung hatte man die SPD-F\u00fchrung eingeladen. Jetzt m\u00fcssen sich Esken und Walter-Borjans den Vorwurf gefallen lassen, man habe sich in Hamburg wohl f\u00fcr die beiden gesch\u00e4mt - oder glaube nicht daran mit ihnen dort gewinnen zu k\u00f6nnen. Doch die Partei, auf Bundesebene sowie in Hamburg, zeigt bisher keine gro\u00dfe Reaktion - zumindest nach Au\u00dfen. \u201eDie SPD ist eine richtig starke Truppe\u201c, sagte der SPD-Wahlsieger Peter Tschentscher . Er bekr\u00e4ftigte, dass f\u00fcr ihn in Hamburg nun die Fortsetzung des Regierungsb\u00fcndnisses mit den Gr\u00fcnen die \u201enaheliegende Option\u201c sei. Diese habe in der Stadt auch \u201egro\u00dfe Unterst\u00fctzung bei den B\u00fcrgern\u201c. Er sei \u201esehr froh, dass wir mit diesem sehr, sehr starken Ergebnis in die Koalitionsbildung einsteigen k\u00f6nnen\u201c, um den \u201eerfolgreichen Kurs in die Zukunft fortf\u00fchren zu k\u00f6nnen\u201c. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: B\u00f6ses Erwachen? \u201eErgebnisse vertauscht\u201c - die FDP verliert Stimmen 11.49 Uhr: In Berlin m\u00fcssen sich die Parteien am Montag mit den Ergebnissen der Wahl in Hamburg auseinandersetzen. Besonders bitter wird dieser Prozess unter anderem f\u00fcr die FDP, die in der Hansestadt einen schweren Verlust eingefahren hat. Aktuell muss sie sogar um den Verbleib im Landesparlament f\u00fcrchten, weil durch einen Ausz\u00e4hlungsfehler am Sonntag mehr Stimmen der FDP zugerechnet wurden, als f\u00fcr sie abgegeben wurden. Das wird best\u00e4tigt, als die FDP in Berlin bereits die Beratungen \u00fcber die Zukunft der Partei begonnen haben.\u00a0Mit dem Wahl-Eklat in Th\u00fcringen sei ein Vertrauensverlust bei den B\u00fcrgern entstanden, sagte Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels-Frowein vor dem Treffen am Montag. \u201eDas war f\u00fcr uns sehr, sehr schwer in kurzer Zeit wieder aufzuholen\u201c, sagte sie. Die FDP kam am Wahlsonntag nach der vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung in Hamburg auf genau f\u00fcnf Prozent. Am Montagabend gegen 18.30 Uhr wird mit dem vorl\u00e4ufigen amtlichen Endergebnis gerechnet. Doch bereits zuvor ist klar: Bei der ersten Ausz\u00e4hlung hat es einen Fehler gegeben. Die Partei verliert einige Stimmen. Mehr Klarheit verschafft die in Hamburg vorgeschriebene zweite Runde der Ausz\u00e4hlung, die morgens begonnen hatte. Hier geht es um die Ausz\u00e4hlung der Kreislisten, nach der dann feststeht, welche Kandidaten in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehen. Auch werden die Landesstimmzettel erneut gez\u00e4hlt. Nach Schlie\u00dfung der Wahllokale am Sonntag waren zun\u00e4chst nur die Stimmen f\u00fcr die Parteien auf den Landesstimmzetteln nach einem vereinfachten Verfahren ausgez\u00e4hlt worden, so dass am sp\u00e4ten Abend nur die voraussichtliche Verteilung der B\u00fcrgerschaftssitze auf die Parteien feststand. Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf will sich erst nach Ausz\u00e4hlung aller Stimmen zu einer m\u00f6glichen Verwechslung bei der Stimmerfassung im Wahlbezirk Hamburg-Langenhorn \u00e4u\u00dfern. \u201eIch werde zu dem Ergebnis von Langenhorn vor dem vorl\u00e4ufigen Ergebnis nichts bekanntgeben\u201c, sagte Rudolf am Montag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Einzelergebnisse zu Wahlbezirke gebe er tags\u00fcber nicht bekannt, sagte Rudolf. Er verwies darauf, dass die Ergebnisse im Internet fortlaufend aktualisiert w\u00fcrden, auch die Ergebnisse in einzelnen Wahlbezirken. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: B\u00f6ses Erwachen? \u201eErgebnisse vertauscht\u201c\u00a0- die FDP verliert Stimmen 11.27 Uhr: Der Verdacht scheint sich zu best\u00e4tigen. Die FDP verliert in Hamburg Stimmen nach einer Z\u00e4hlpanne. Dabei sind Stimmen f\u00fcr andere Parteien versehentlich den Liberalen zugerechnet worden.\u00a0Durch eine Verwechslung im Bezirk Langenhorn wurden dort versehentlich die 22,4 Prozent der Gr\u00fcnen den Liberalen zugeteilt, wie der zust\u00e4ndige Bezirkswahlleiter Tom Oelrichs der Deutschen Presse-Agentur am Montag sagte. Die FDP lag am Sonntagabend zun\u00e4chst hamburgweit nur wenige Stimmen \u00fcber der F\u00fcnf-Prozent-H\u00fcrde. 08.58 Uhr: In Hamburg wird nach der Wahl weiter ausgez\u00e4hlt. Um acht Uhr hat am Montag die Ausz\u00e4hlung der Kreislisten begonnen, nach der feststeht, welche Kandidaten in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehen. Auch werden die Landesstimmzettel erneut gez\u00e4hlt . Nach Schlie\u00dfung der Wahllokale am Sonntag waren zun\u00e4chst nur die Stimmen f\u00fcr die Parteien auf den Landesstimmzetteln nach einem vereinfachten Verfahren ausgez\u00e4hlt worden, so dass am sp\u00e4ten Abend nur die voraussichtliche Verteilung der B\u00fcrgerschaftssitze auf die Parteien feststand. F\u00fcr die FDP, die nach der vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung auf genau 5,0 Prozent kam, bleibt es damit spannend. Gegen 18.30 Uhr wird mit dem vorl\u00e4ufigen amtlichen Endergebnis gerechnet. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Fortsetzung der rot-gr\u00fcnen Koalition? Parteienforscher macht Fehler bei Gr\u00fcnen aus 08.29 Uhr: Wie geht es in Hamburg nach der Wahl weiter? Gibt es eine Fortsetzung der rot-gr\u00fcnen Koalition ? Der Hamburger Parteienforscher Elmar Wiesendahl erwartet schwierige Koalitionsverhandlungen . \u201eEs wird auf jeden Fall zu Rot-Gr\u00fcn kommen. Allerdings werden die Gr\u00fcnen ihre Muskeln spielen lassen. Und die SPD wird im Bewusstsein ihres Erfolges dagegenhalten\u201c, sagte er dem Hamburger Abendblatt (Montag). Es werde nicht einfach: \u201eDie Gr\u00fcnen werden mehr Senatsposten verlangen. Welche Ressorts sie bekommen, d\u00fcrfte zum Streit f\u00fchren.\u201c Dass die Gr\u00fcnen die SPD mit der\u00a0B\u00fcrgermeister-Kandidatin Katharina Fegebank herausgefordert h\u00e4tten, ist seiner Ansicht nach allerdings ein Fehler gewesen. Die H\u00fcrde, Tschentscher zu st\u00fcrzen, sei einfach zu hoch gewesen. Die SPD habe im Wahlkampf dagegen vieles richtig gemacht. \u201eSie hat die Herausforderung der Gr\u00fcnen angenommen und sehr subtil einen Gegen-Wahlkampf gef\u00fchrt. Dabei ist sie thematisch bis in den Markenkern der Gr\u00fcnen vorgedrungen - die Klima- und Umweltpolitik - und hat erfolgreich eine Art Produktpiraterie betrieben\u201c, sagte der 75 Jahre alte Politikwissenschaftler. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Klingbeil zieht die Lehre f\u00fcr SPD 08.12 Uhr: Mit Blick auf die Bundespartei sagte SPD-Generalsekret\u00e4r Lars Klingbeil gegen\u00fcber Bild :\u00a0\u201eNat\u00fcrlich kann man von Hamburg lernen\u201c. In der Hansestadt habe es klare Themen gegeben, Zukunftsthemen und einen Kurs der wirtschaftlichen Vernunft. In Hamburg habe man es geschafft auf Inhalte zu sprechen zu kommen - weg von der Selbstbesch\u00e4ftigung. An dieser Stelle schoss Klingbeil gleich noch eine Spitze gegen die Gr\u00fcnen ab. W\u00e4hrend die Gr\u00fcnen vor wenigen Wochen Umfragen zufolge noch nah dran war den B\u00fcrgermeister von Hamburg zu stellen, sei diese Stimmung\u00a0gekippt, je n\u00e4her die Wahl gekommen sei. Klingbeil schlie\u00dft daraus, dass die W\u00e4hler, wenn es um Regierungsverantwortung geht, den Gr\u00fcnen doch weniger Vertrauen zugestehen w\u00fcrden. Klingbeil meint: \u201eMit sch\u00f6nen Worten, wie man sie von Robert Habeck kennt, wird man nicht mehr weit kommen\u201c. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: SPD-Erfolg wegen Distanz zur Bundespartei? 06.46 Uhr: Die SPD um\u00a0Spitzenmann Peter Tschentscher geht in Hamburg klar als Sieger aus der Wahl hervor. Und das obwohl die Sozialdemokraten nach aktuellem Stand im Vergleich zu 2015 6,6, Prozent der Stimmen einb\u00fc\u00dfen mussten. Im Vergleich mit der bundesweiten Tendenz ist dies allerdings ein durchaus gutes Ergebnis. Nun stellt sich die Frage, wie die Hamburger SPD dies geschafft hat. Ein Teil der Antwort ist wohl, dass die SPD in Hamburg vor der Wahl auf gr\u00f6\u00dftm\u00f6gliche Distanz zur Bundespartei gegangen ist. Die neue eher linke Bundespartei-Spitze um\u00a0Saskia Esken und Norbert Walter-Borjans trat etwa nicht im Wahlkampf auf. Peter Tschentscher baute sich sein eigenes Profil auf und hatte damit offenbar Erfolg. Eine Umfrage von infratest Dimap bei Hamburger W\u00e4hlern ergab entsprechend, dass man bei der SPD in der Hansestadt wesentlich genauer wei\u00df, wof\u00fcr die Partei steht, als dies bei der Bundes-SPD der Fall ist. Unter allen W\u00e4hlern gaben 60 Prozent der Befragten an, dass sie genau wissen, wof\u00fcr die SPD in Hamburg steht. Mit Blick auf die Bundespartei antworteten nur 23 Prozent positiv auf dieselbe Frage. Unter SPD-W\u00e4hlern war der Unterschied \u00e4hnlich klar: 86 Prozent wussten demnach wof\u00fcr die Hamburg-SPD steht, wobei es nur 32 Prozent bei der Bundes-SPD waren. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: AfD atmet sp\u00e4t auf - FDP muss offenbar weiter zittern 05.37 Uhr: Bereits am Wahl -Sonntag hat der Hamburger Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf das Ergebnis der vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung der Landeslisten-Stimmzettel bekannt gegeben. Die Wahlbeteiligung lag demnach bei 63,3 Prozent . \u201eBei der vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung werden nur die eindeutig g\u00fcltigen Stimmzettel ber\u00fccksichtigt. Dem Ergebnis liegen die Schnellmeldungen aus allen Wahlbezirken zugrunde\u201c, hei\u00dft es erkl\u00e4rend zu dem aktuellen Ergebnis vom Landeswahlleiter. Am Montag werden ab acht Uhr morgens die Landeslisten- und Wahlkreislisten-Stimmzettel vollst\u00e4ndig ausgez\u00e4hlt. Erst dann steht das vorl\u00e4ufige Ergebnis fest. Nach dem aktuellen Ergebnis schaffen sowohl die FDP , als auch die AfD den Sprung in die Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaft. Die Erleichterung bei den Liberalen war am Sonntag gro\u00df: \u201eDas war eine Zitterpartie, nat\u00fcrlich. Aber wir k\u00f6nnen einiges ab. Wir sind Optimisten. Es liegt in unserer DNA. Wir haben es geschafft\u201c, sagte FDP-Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels-Frowein am sp\u00e4ten Sonntagabend. Allerdings k\u00f6nnte es f\u00fcr die FDP knapp werden, da von einer m\u00f6glichen Stimmen-\u201eVerwechslung\u201c berichtet wurde (siehe News von 05.28 Uhr). Ein vorl\u00e4ufiges amtliches Endergebnis wird erst f\u00fcr Montagabend erwartet. Das Ergebnis nach der vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung am Sonntag: F\u00fcr die gesamte Ansicht bitte oben rechts auf \u201eBilderzoom\u201c klicken. \u00a9\u00a0Landeswahlleiter Hamburg\/hamburg.de Hamburg-Wahl 2020: F\u00e4llt die FDP noch aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft? Update vom 24. Februar 2020, 05.28 Uhr: F\u00e4llt die FDP doch noch aus der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaft heraus? Eine m\u00f6gliche Verwechslung von Stimmen gef\u00e4hrdet den knappen Wiedereinzug aktuell. Im Wahlbezirk Hamburg-Langenhorn k\u00f6nnte es zu einer Verwechslung bei der Stimmerfassung gekommen sein. In einem Wahllokal kamen die Liberalen nach der vereinfachten Ausz\u00e4hlung am Sonntagabend auf 22,4 Prozent, die Gr\u00fcnen hingegen nur auf 5,1 Prozent. Landesweit war das Ergebnis umgekehrt ausgefallen. \u201eAuff\u00e4llig ist das auf jeden Fall\u201c, sagte Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. \u201eDen Hinweis, dass es eine Auff\u00e4lligkeit gibt, habe ich auch schon weitergegeben.\u201c Sollte es eine Verwechslung der Zuordnung gegeben haben, w\u00fcrden auf die FDP 423 Stimmen weniger entfallen als bisher angenommen. Da die Partei insgesamt nach den vorl\u00e4ufigen Zahlen nur um 121 Stimmen \u00fcber der F\u00fcnf-Prozent-H\u00fcrde liegt, k\u00f6nnte dies dazu f\u00fchren, dass sie den Einzug ins Stadtparlament doch noch verpasst. \u201eDas kann durchaus ausschlaggebend sein\u201c, sagte Rudolf. Alle Stimmen w\u00fcrden am Montag aber ohnehin erneut ausgez\u00e4hlt, so dass ein Irrtum dann auch festgestellt w\u00fcrde. News vom 23. Februar: SPD geht als Gewinner aus Hamburg-Wahl 2020 0.55 Uhr: Ohne belastbares Endergebnis, aber mit einigen Erkenntnissen endet der Wahlsonntag in Hamburg . Als Gewinner kann sich - trotz sp\u00fcrbarer Verluste - die SPD f\u00fchlen. Die Sozialdemokraten werden weiter den Ersten B\u00fcrgermeister stellen und verf\u00fcgen mit Gr\u00fcnen und CDU \u00fcber gleich zwei gespr\u00e4chsbereite potenzielle Partner, die eine tragf\u00e4hige Zweiter-Koalition erm\u00f6glichen. Ein seltener Luxus, angesichts der j\u00fcngsten Landtagswahlergebnisse im Allgemeinen und der schwachen Landtagswahl-Resultate der SPD im Speziellen. Die Gr\u00fcnen - als wahrscheinlichster Koalition\u00e4r - d\u00fcrften Peter Tschentscher und Genossen aber vermutlich Zugest\u00e4ndnisse abverlangen. Die \u00d6kopartei hat kr\u00e4ftigst hinzugewonnen. Bitter lief der Wahltag f\u00fcr die CDU , die ein historisch schlechtes Abschneiden verbuchte und sich nun einer weiter versch\u00e4rften innerparteilichen Debatte ausgesetzt sehen k\u00f6nnte. Die FDP w\u00e4hnte sich am Abend mit einem blauen Auge davongekommen. Ausz\u00e4hlungsfehler k\u00f6nnten die Liberalen aber doch noch aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft bef\u00f6rdern. Auch die AfD schrammte mit 5,3 Prozent der Stimmen nur knapp an einem Debakel vorbei. Alle drei Resultate k\u00f6nnten Auswirkungen auf den weiteren Kurs der Parteien haben . Spannend wird in jedem Fall die erneute und finale Ausz\u00e4hlung der Stimmen am Montag. Wir halten Sie ab dem fr\u00fchen Morgen \u00fcber alle wichtigen Entwicklungen in Hamburg und Berlin auf dem Laufenden. F\u00fcr heute beenden wir den Wahl-Ticker aus Hamburg und w\u00fcnschen eine gute Nacht. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Ergebnisse von Gr\u00fcnen und FDP vertauscht? 0.26 Uhr: Die Berichte \u00fcber m\u00f6glicherweise vertauschte Ergebnisse von FDP und Gr\u00fcnen in einem Hamburger Wahllokal im Wahlbezirk Hamburg-Langenhorn sind auch bei der Landeswahlleitung angekommen. Tats\u00e4chlich k\u00f6nnten die Liberalen nun doch noch aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft herausfallen. \u201eAuff\u00e4llig ist das auf jeden Fall\u201c, sagte Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf . \u201eDen Hinweis, dass es eine Auff\u00e4lligkeit gibt, habe ich auch schon weitergegeben.\u201c Sollte es eine Verwechslung der Zuordnung gegeben haben, w\u00fcrden auf die FDP 423 Stimmen weniger entfallen als bisher angenommen. Da die Partei insgesamt nach den vorl\u00e4ufigen Zahlen nur um 121 Stimmen \u00fcber der F\u00fcnf-Prozent-H\u00fcrde liegt, k\u00f6nnte dies dazu f\u00fchren, dass sie den Einzug ins Stadtparlament doch noch verpasst. \u201eDas kann durchaus ausschlaggebend sein\u201c, sagte Rudolf. Alle Stimmen w\u00fcrden am Montag aber ohnehin erneut ausgez\u00e4hlt , so dass ein Irrtum dann auch festgestellt w\u00fcrde. Dann m\u00fcssen m\u00f6glicherweise auch andere in den aktuellen Stand eingepreiste Ergebnisse auf den Pr\u00fcfstand. Denn mittlerweile sind Beobachtern sogar\u00a0weitere Seltsamkeiten\u00a0aufgefallen. So berichteten User unter einem Posting des Portals\u00a0wahlrecht.de\u00a0auf Twitter, im Bezirk 41008 seien m\u00f6glicherweise der CDU zu viele Stimmen zugerechnet worden. Die Christdemokraten k\u00e4men hier auf 34,9 Prozent, die Gr\u00fcnen nur auf 7,3 Prozent. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: FDP freut sich \u00fcber Wiedereinzug - doch es k\u00f6nnte anders kommen 0.19 Uhr: Ungeachtet der Unw\u00e4gbarkeiten (siehe 23.31 Uhr) herrscht in der FDP am Abend Erleichterung \u00fcber den mutma\u00dflichen Wiedereinzug in die Hamburgische B\u00fcrgerschaft . \u201eDas war eine Zitterpartie, nat\u00fcrlich. Aber wir k\u00f6nnen einiges ab. Wir sind Optimisten. Es liegt in unserer DNA. Wir haben es geschafft\u201c, sagte FDP- Spitzenkandidatin Anna von Treuenfels-Frowein am sp\u00e4ten Sonntagabend. Nach einem Wahlkrimi hatten die Liberalen nach vereinfachter Ausz\u00e4hlung der f\u00fcr die Parteien auf den Landeslisten abgegebenen Stimmen genau 5,0 Prozent erreicht. Entsprechend frenetisch war die Stimmung der noch anwesenden FDP-Mitglieder im Braugasthaus \u201eAltes M\u00e4dchen\u201c. 0.00 Uhr: Der lange Hamburger Wahlabend neigt sich dem Ende entgegen. Noch sind einige Fragen offen - erst am Montagabend wird es wohl Klarheit dar\u00fcber geben, ob die FDP tats\u00e4chlich den Sprung ins Parlament geschafft hat. Klar ist unterdessen: CDU, FDP und AfD geh\u00f6ren zu den Verlierern der Wahl. Das k\u00f6nnte nach Th\u00fcringen weitere Konsequenzen haben. Eine erste Analyse lesen Sie in diesem Artikel . Hamburg-Wahl 2020: B\u00f6ses Erwachen f\u00fcr die FDP? Bericht \u00fcber\u00a0\u201evertauschte Ergebnisse\u201c 23.31 Uhr: Nach den ersten von der Landeswahlleitung kommunizierten Ergebnissen hat die FDP knappst den Sprung in die Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaft bew\u00e4ltigt. Doch nach Ansicht des Portals wahlrecht.de k\u00f6nnte es f\u00fcr die Liberalen noch ein b\u00f6ses Erwachen geben: So ist nach Erkenntnissen der Webseite im Ausz\u00e4hlungsbezirk Tweltenbeek 27 ein\u00a0\u201eoffensichtlicher Fehler\u201c passiert. Hier sei die FDP mit 22,4 Prozent der Stimmen auf Rang zwei gekommen, die Gr\u00fcnen mit 5,1 Prozent auf Rang sechs - offenbar seien die Ergebnisse der beiden Parteien vertauscht worden. Stimmt das und ist das Ergebnis auch so in die Gesamtzahlen eingeflossen, k\u00f6nnte die FDP gut 420 Stimmen verlieren - und damit unter die F\u00fcnfprozenth\u00fcrde rutschen. Laut wahlrecht.de trennen die Liberalen aktuell 120 Stimmen vom Verschwinden aus dem Landesparlament . Bei den nun publizierten Ergebnissen handelt es sich ohnehin noch nicht um das vorl\u00e4ufige amtliche Ergebnis, sondern nur um eine vereinfachte Vorausz\u00e4hlung. Ein vorl\u00e4ufiges amtliches Ergebnis soll am Montagabend ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden. 23.20 Uhr: Jetzt ist ein erstes Ergebnis der Hamburg-Wahl da: Wie die Landeswahlleitung mitteilt, kommen die Sozialdemokraten nach vereinfachter Ausz\u00e4hlung der f\u00fcr die Parteien auf den Landeslisten abgegebenen Stimmen auf 39,0 Prozent. AfD und FDP w\u00fcrden demnach mit 5,3 beziehungsweise 5,0 Prozent in der B\u00fcrgerschaft bleiben . Die Gr\u00fcnen k\u00e4men als zweitst\u00e4rkste Kraft auf 24,2, die CDU auf 11,2 und die Linke auf 9,1 Prozent. Ein vorl\u00e4ufiges amtliches Endergebnis wird erst f\u00fcr Montagabend erwartet. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Warten auf das Ergebnis - eine Partei muss weiter zittern 22.45 Uhr: Die n\u00e4chste Hochrechnung aus Hamburg liegt vor. Anlass zur Freude d\u00fcrften die Zahlen von infratest dimap der AfD geben: Die Partei liegt nun bei 5,3 Prozent, zunehmend deutlich zeichnet sich der Wiedereinzug in die B\u00fcrgerschaft ab. Anders die Lage bei der FDP - die Liberalen verharren weiter bei 5,0 Prozent, sie m\u00fcssen weiter zittern. M\u00f6glicherweise \u00e4hnlich wie in Th\u00fcringen sogar bis zu einer zweiten Ausz\u00e4hlung der Stimmen. Hierzu gibt es allerdings noch keine offiziellen Angaben. Ein Ergebnis war vom Statistischen Amt f\u00fcr Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein f\u00fcr 22.30 Uhr angek\u00fcndigt worden. Bislang gibt es von der Beh\u00f6rde aber noch keine definitiven Zahlen. 22.20 Uhr: Bei\u00a0\u201eAnne Will\u201c im Ersten wird aktuell \u00fcber die Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl debattiert. Die wichtigsten Wortmeldungen von Robert Habeck, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen und Co. finden Sie in unserem Ticker zur Sendung . 22.16 Uhr: Ein bitteres Erlebnis ist die Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl am Sonntag nicht nur CDU, FDP und AfD geworden - ein W\u00e4hler ist bei der Stimmabgabe vor unangehme H\u00fcrden gestellt worden . Wende bei der Hamburg-Wahl? Weidel feiert, FDP droht erneut lange Zitterpartie 21.49 Uhr: Den neuesten Hochrechnungen zufolge k\u00f6nnte sich f\u00fcr die FDP die Zitterpartie der Th\u00fcringer Landtagswahl wiederholen : ARD und infratest dimap sehen die Partei weiterhin bei 5,0 Prozent - nach Angaben von Wahl-Moderator J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nenborn sogar bei 5,00 Prozent. Die AfD nimmt hingegen weiter Kurs auf die Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaft. Sie wird aktuell auf 5,2 Prozent taxiert. Bundestagsfraktionschefin Alice Weidel schreibt in einem Tweet gar bereits vom\u00a0\u201eheutigen Wiedereinzug\u201c. 21.17 Uhr: Es gibt erste Pressestimmen zur Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl - f\u00fcr die CDU fallen die Reaktionen teils verheerend aus. 21.02 Uhr: Ein interessanter Randaspekt der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl : Die Erstw\u00e4hler in Hamburg haben am Sonntag eine klare Pr\u00e4ferenz gezeigt. 36 Prozent ihrer Stimmen gehen auf das Konto der Gr\u00fcnen, wie eine Auswertung des Instituts Infratest dimap f\u00fcr die ARD ergab. Auf Platz zwei folgt die SPD mit 24 Prozent, die Linke erh\u00e4lt 13 Prozent. F\u00fcr die FDP votieren demnach immerhin sieben Prozent der Erstw\u00e4hler - deutlich mehr als die Partei insgesamt laut Hochrechnungen erh\u00e4lt. Die CDU kommt bei den Erstw\u00e4hlern nur auf sechs Prozent der Stimmen, die AfD verbucht lediglich zwei Prozent der Stimmanteile, wie aus der Altersgruppenumfrage weiter hervorgeht. Zur B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg waren alle Staatsb\u00fcrger im Alter ab 16 Jahren zugelassen. Die Hansestadt hatte das Wahlalter bereits 2013 gesenkt, um Jugendliche st\u00e4rker an der Politik zu beteiligen. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: Weitere Hochrechnungen sehen AfD \u00fcber der F\u00fcnfprozenth\u00fcrde 20.55 Uhr: Auch die neueste Hochrechnung der ARD sieht die AfD nun oberhalb der F\u00fcnfprozenth\u00fcrde - 5,1 Prozent werden als aktueller Stand genannt. Damit w\u00fcrde die Partei sogar vor der FDP liegen, die hier weiter bei 5,0 Prozent verharrt. Das ZDF f\u00fchrt AfD und FDP momentan gleichauf bei jeweils genau f\u00fcnf Prozent. Erste handfeste Ergebnisse sind vom Stastischen Amt \u00fcbrigens f\u00fcr 22.30 Uhr angek\u00fcndigt . 20.50 Uhr: Ein Thema an diesem Wahlabend ist auch die Berichterstattung der gro\u00dfen Fernsehsender : W\u00e4hrend ARD-Mann J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nenborn um 18.00 Uhr n\u00fcchtern die Zahlen der ersten Prognose verk\u00fcndete, ert\u00f6nte pl\u00f6tzlich Jubel im Studio . Auch eine n-tv-Reporterin \u00e4u\u00dferte sich nicht besonders neutral zum Ergebnis . Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Unerwartete Wende f\u00fcr FDP und AfD? 20.38 Uhr: Gibt es f\u00fcr AfD und FDP doch noch eine Wende? Darauf k\u00f6nnte eine Hochrechnung des Statistischen Amtes f\u00fcr Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein hindeuten. Das Amt hat um 20.02 Uhr nach Ausz\u00e4hlung von 37,7 Prozent der Stimmbezirke eine Hochrechnung vorgelegt , die die AfD bei 5,6 Prozent und die FDP bei 5,1 Prozent sieht. Damit w\u00fcrden beide Parteien in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehen. Ansonsten zeigt diese Erhebung jene Tendenzen, die zuletzt auch in den Hochrechnungen von ARD (infratest dimap) und ZDF (Forschungsgruppe Wahlen) erkennbar waren: Die SPD n\u00e4hert sich hier der Marke von 40 Prozent (aktuell 39,6 Prozent), die Gr\u00fcnen kommen auf\u00a0\u201enur\u201c 23,6 Prozent . In der ersten Prognose der Fernsehsender waren die Gr\u00fcnen noch deutlich oberhalb von 25 Prozent gelegen. Wahl in Hamburg:\u00a0Kein Sitz f\u00fcr CDU-Spitzenkandid Weinberg? 20.28 Uhr: CDU-Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg schlie\u00dft nicht aus, nach der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl doch in Berlin zu bleiben und weiterhin sein Bundestagsmandat wahrzunehmen - ganz freiwillig w\u00e4re eine solche Entscheidung allerdings offenbar nicht. Es sei aufgrund des komplizierten Hamburger Wahlsystems denkbar, dass die CDU am Ende nur mit Wahlkreismandaten in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehe, sagt Weinberg im NDR. Damit w\u00fcrde ihm als h\u00f6chstplatziertem Listenkandidaten ein Sitz verwehrt bleiben. Man m\u00fcsse \u00fcber eine Ver\u00e4nderung im Wahlsystem nachdenken, fordert Weinberg. Dies sei auch im Sinne vieler W\u00e4hler. Sollte er doch in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehen, werde er die Aufgabe wahrnehmen erkl\u00e4rt er - Versprechen m\u00fcsse man einhalten. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg: Neue Hochrechnungen - AfD und FDP hoffen und bangen weiter 20.16 Uhr: Auch das ZDF hat nun eine neue Hochrechnung vorgelegt. Die Zahlen decken sich weitgehend mit jenen der ARD. Auch hier legt die SPD zu, FDP (5,0 Prozent) und AfD (4,9) m\u00fcssen beziehungsweise d\u00fcrfen weiterhin um den Einzug in den B\u00fcrgerschaft bangen und hoffen. 20.00 Uhr: Es geht langsam voran: Eine weitere Hochrechnung aus Hamburg ist publiziert worden. Nach Zahlen von infratest dimap\/ARD kann die SPD noch einmal deutlich zulegen , auch zulasten der Gr\u00fcnen. Die Sozialdemokraten kommen nun auf 38,6 Prozent, die Gr\u00fcnen auf 24,8. Die AfD kommt der F\u00fcnfprozenth\u00fcrde wieder etwas n\u00e4her - 4,9 Prozent stehen aktuell zu Buche. Vom ZDF und der Forschungsgruppe Wahlen gibt es noch keine neue Daten. Wahlen in Hamburg: Erste Hochrechnungen liegen vor - AfD droht das Ausscheiden aus dem Parlament 19.25 Uhr: Jetzt liegen die ersten Hochrechnungen aus Hamburg vor. Allzu sehr unterscheiden sich die Zahlen nicht von den Prognosen von 18.00 Uhr. Die wichtigste Erkenntnis wohl: Der AfD droht wohl tats\u00e4chlich das Ausscheiden aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft . Die Hochrechnung von infratest dimap sieht die Partei weiterhin bei 4,7 Prozent. Die FDP bleibt bei 5,0 Prozent. Die Zahlen der aktuellen Hochrechnungen im \u00dcberblick: ARD\/infratest dimap: SPD 37,6 Prozent (-8,0) \/ Gr\u00fcne 25,4 (+ 13,1) \/ CDU 11,4 (-4,5) \/ Linke 9,1 (+ 0,6) \/ FDP 5,0 (-2,4) \/ AfD 4,7 (-1,4) ZDF\/Forschungsgruppe Wahlen: SPD 37,8 Prozent (-7,8) \/ Gr\u00fcne 25,4 (+13,1) \/ CDU 11,3 (-4,6) \/ Linke 9,5 (+ 1,0) \/ FDP 5,0 (-2,4) \/ AfD 4,7 (-1,4) 19.23 Uhr: Der Hamburger AfD-Spitzenkandidat Dirk Nockemann sieht das m\u00f6gliche Ausscheiden seiner Partei aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft als \"Ergebnis einer maximalen Ausgrenzungskampagne\". Die Hamburger AfD habe in Umfragen lange konstant bei sieben bis acht Prozent gelegen, sagte Nockemann am Sonntagabend im Norddeutschen Rundfunk. \"Nach Th\u00fcringen ging es dann runter\", f\u00fcgte er hinzu. Mit Blick auf den offenbar rassistisch motivierten Anschlag in Hessen sagte er, man habe \"nach Hanau so getan, als h\u00e4tte die AfD den Finger am Abzug gehabt\". \"Das ist schon unertr\u00e4glich, was sich in den letzten drei Tagen hier in Hamburg abgespielt hat\", sagte er mit Blick auf Anfeindungen gegen\u00fcber seiner Partei. \"Diese Kampagne war geeignet, uns die wesentlichen Prozentpunkte zu nehmen.\" In einer am Sonntag ver\u00f6ffentlichten Umfrage halten 60 Prozent der Befragten die AfD mitverantwortlich f\u00fcr den offenbar rassistisch motivierten Anschlag in Hessen. Jubel \u00fcber einen bundesweiten Abriss der ansteigenden AfD-Ergebnisse w\u00e4re verfr\u00fcht, kommentiert unterdessen der M\u00fcnchner Merkur *. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg: Bittere Verlust f\u00fcr CDU, FDP und AfD - eine Folge von Th\u00fcringen? 19.13 Uhr: Linkspartei, SPD und Gr\u00fcne in Th\u00fcringen sehen in dem Hamburger Wahlergebnis ebenfalls eine Folge der Vorg\u00e4nge in ihrem Bundesland. \"Die schweren Verluste f\u00fcr CDU, FDP und AfD zeigen, wie sehr die W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hler den Tabubruch vom 5. Februar auch an der Wahlurne bestrafen\", erkl\u00e4rte die Th\u00fcringer Linke-Landesvorsitzende Susanne Hennig-Wellsow am Abend in Erfurt. \"Die Hamburgerinnen und Hamburger haben den Rechtspopulisten die rote Karte gezeigt und auch der FDP klar gemacht, dass es keinerlei auch indirekte Zusammenarbeit mit dieser Partei geben darf\", erkl\u00e4rt Th\u00fcringens SPD-Chef Wolfgang Tiefensee.\u00a0\"Das Ergebnis der AfD zeigt, dass Machenschaften auf Kosten der Demokratie von den W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hlern verurteilt werden\", erkl\u00e4rten auch die Th\u00fcringer Gr\u00fcnen-Vorsitzenden Ann-Sophie Bohm-Eisenbrandt und Bernhard Stengele. 19.06 Uhr: Auch die CDU w\u00e4re zu einem rot-schwarzen B\u00fcndnis in Hamburg bereit. \u201eWir schlie\u00dfen das nicht aus\u201c, es gehe um wichtige Weichenstellungen f\u00fcr Hamburg, sagt Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg im ZDF: \u201eWir sind bereit zu Gespr\u00e4chen.\u201c Der Ball liege allerdings im Feld der SPD. Die Runde der Spitzenkandidaten in der Wahlsendung des ZDF wagt auch erste Analysen: Th\u00fcringen sei \u201eeine schwere Hypothek gewesen\u201c, sagt FDP-Politikerin Anna-Elisabeth von Treuenfels-Frowein. Das Ergebnis habe auch etwas\u00a0\u201e mit Hanau und Th\u00fcringen zu tun\u201c, mutma\u00dft Linke-Frontfrau Cansu \u00d6zdemir. 19.00 Uhr: Die erste Hochrechnung l\u00e4sst unterdessen weiter auf sich warten. ARD und ZDF hatten mit ersten Zahlen gegen 19.00 Uhr bis 19.15 Uhr gerechnet. Grund f\u00fcr die sp\u00e4te Ver\u00f6ffentlichung erster Ausz\u00e4hlungsauswertungen sei das komplizierte Hamburger Wahlsystem. 18.57 Uhr: SPD-Spitzenkandidat Peter Tschentscher bewertet die ersten Prognosen erwartungsgem\u00e4\u00df positiv. Sollte sich das \u201eErgebnis best\u00e4tigen\u201c, k\u00f6nne man zufrieden sein. Zugleich sei das m\u00f6gliche Ausscheiden der AfD aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft eine \u201egro\u00dfartige Botschaft, die von Hamburg ausgeht.\u201c Seine erste Wahl f\u00fcr die Zukunft sei eine rot-gr\u00fcne Koalition , erkl\u00e4rt er. Es seien allerdings auch andere B\u00fcndnisse m\u00f6glich. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg 2020: FDP bangt und sucht Gr\u00fcnde -\u00a0\u201eTh\u00fcringen hat durchaus Bedeutung gehabt\u201c 18.51 Uhr: FDP-Chef Christian Lindner galt schon vor der Verk\u00fcndung der ersten Prognosen als angeschlagen - auch aufgrund seiner Rolle bei der Th\u00fcringer Ministerpr\u00e4sidentenwahl. Auf Frage von ZDF-Moderatorin Bettina Schausten weist er allerdings zur\u00fcck, er habe im Fall Th\u00fcringen\u00a0\u201ezu lange laviert\u201c. Richtig sei, dass Hamburg schon vor Th\u00fcringen ein schwieriges Pflaster f\u00fcr die FDP gewesen sein. Das Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen von SPD und Gr\u00fcnen habe die Liberalen Stimmen gekostet, mutma\u00dft Lindner. \u201eKeine Legendenbildung\u201c fordert Lindner auf die Frage, ob die FDP f\u00fcr eine Unterst\u00fctzung von AfD-Vorst\u00f6\u00dfe eine Quittung kassiert habe. Zwar habe man in Hamburg in der Vergangenheit\u00a0\u201eharmlose Antr\u00e4ge der AfD\u201c, etwa beim Thema Zigarettenkippen auf B\u00fcrgersteigen unterst\u00fctzt - aber: \u201eDas wird nicht mehr passieren\u201c, nach \u201eErfurt und der Verschlagenheit der AfD\u201c, betont der FDP-Chef. \u201eSelbst bei harmlosen Antr\u00e4gen der AfD\u201c werde es keine Zustimmung der FDP mehr geben. Zuvor hatte Lindner auf der Berliner Wahlparty der FDP erkl\u00e4rt, die Partei brauche heute Abend einmal mehr\u00a0\u201estarke Nerven\u201c. Ein Ergebnis wie in Hamburg sei\u00a0\u201eeine Niederlage\u201c f\u00fcr die FDP. 18.43 Uhr: Auch Hamburgs FDP-Chefin Katja Suding macht die Vorg\u00e4nge in Th\u00fcringen f\u00fcr das schwache Abschneiden ihrer Partei mitverantwortlich. \u201eWir kennen ja auch schon erste Zahlen, die zeigen, dass das f\u00fcr unsere W\u00e4hler durchaus eine Bedeutung gehabt hat. Deswegen war es ganz wichtig, dass wir uns hier in Hamburg auch ganz klar distanziert haben von den Vorg\u00e4ngen in Th\u00fcringen\u201c, sagt Suding im NDR. 18.30 Uhr: Die Gr\u00fcne Katharina Fegebank sieht am Mikrofon der ARD einen\u00a0\u201eganz klaren Auftrag der W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hler, dass es so weiter gehen soll\u201c - die Gr\u00fcnen regieren bereits seit 2015 mit der SPD. Die Partei ist nach den aktuellen Zahlen die einzige in der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaft , die deutlich zugelegt hat. 20 zus\u00e4tzliche Sitze k\u00f6nnen der \u00d6ko-Partei winken; die Linke k\u00f6nnte ein Mandat hinzugewinnen. Zugleich haben die Gr\u00fcnen in Hamburg ihr bislang zweitbestes Ergebnis bei Landtagswahlen hingelegt. 18.26 Uhr: CDU-Generalsekret\u00e4r Paul Ziemiak findet in Berlin klare Worte f\u00fcr den sich abzeichnenden Wahlausgang: Es sei ein \u201e bitterer Tag f\u00fcr die CDU Deutschlands \u201c sowie \u201eein historisch schlechtes Wahlergebnis\u201c f\u00fcr die Hamburger CDU. Die Ereignisse in Th\u00fcringen h\u00e4tten der Hamburger CDU nicht geholfen, auf ihre programmatischen Punkte hinzuweisen, konstatiert er. Weitere Reaktionen auf das Hamburger Wahlergebnis finden Sie \u00fcbrigens auch in diesem \u00dcberblick bei Merkur.de *. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Kipping sieht Klatsche f\u00fcr\u00a0\u201eKemmerich-Koalition\u201c - CDU mit historisch schlechtem Ergebnis 18.15 Uhr: Linke-Chefin Katja Kipping deutet das Ergebnis als Strafe f\u00fcr jene Parteien, die \u201eim Zweifelsfall mit der AfD stimmen\u201c - nat\u00fcrlich eine Anspielung auf die Vorkommnisse in Th\u00fcringen . \u201eDie Kemmerich-Koalition hat verloren\u201c, sagt sie vor Genossen in Berlin. Tats\u00e4chlich kommen CDU, FDP und AfD zusammen den ersten Prognosen zufolge nur noch auf rund 21 Prozent der Stimmen. Noch bis 2008 hatten konservative bis rechte Kr\u00e4fte in Hamburg regelm\u00e4\u00dfig mehr als 50 Prozent der Stimmen auf sich vereinigt. 2001 hatte die Schill-Partei fast 20 Prozent erhalten. Im Vergleich zur vergangenen B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl betr\u00e4gt der kummulierte Verlust von CDU, FDP und AfD aktuell allerdings\u00a0\u201enur\u201c rund acht Prozentpunkte. 18.14 Uhr: Die CDU rutscht den aktuellen Zahlen zufolge \u00fcbrigens auf ihr bundesweit schlechtestes Ergebnis bei Landtagswahlen seit knapp 70 Jahren. 18.10 Uhr: Zum Vergleich die Zahlen der ersten Prognose des ZDF beziehungsweise der Forschungsgruppe Wahlen: Hier kommt die SPD auf 38,0 Prozent, die Gr\u00fcnen auf 25,5. Die CDU rangiert etwas schw\u00e4cher als bei der ARD (11,0 Prozent). Die FDP liegt auch hier bei 5,0 Prozent, die AfD minimal besser als in den Zahlen von infratest dimap, aber ebenfalls unterhalb der F\u00fcnfprozenth\u00fcrde (4,8 Prozent). 18.08 Uhr: Die Gr\u00fcne-Spitzenkandidatin Katharina Fegebank zeigt sich bei der Wahlparty ihrer Partei im Club Knust in Hamburg-St. Pauli trotz des deutlichen zweiten Platzes zufrieden: \u201eIch bin total ger\u00fchrt\u201c, sagt sie. CDU-Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg spricht vor seinen Parteifreunden offen von einem\u00a0\u201eschlechten Ergebnis\u201c. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg: SPD kann zwischen Gr\u00fcnen und CDU w\u00e4hlen 18.05 Uhr: Rechnerisch m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re f\u00fcr die SPD sowohl ein erneutes B\u00fcndnis mit den Gr\u00fcnen , als auch ein Schwenk zu einer\u00a0\u201eGro\u00dfen Koalition\u201c - die freilich in Hamburg den Namen angesichts des CDU-Ergebnisses nicht mehr verdient. Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz gibt am ARD-Mikrofon allerdings schon jetzt die Richtung vor: Eine Koalition, die in der Bev\u00f6lkerung so gro\u00dfes Vertrauen genie\u00dfe wie Rot-Gr\u00fcn , habe bei den Verhandlungen Priorit\u00e4t, sagt der Amtsvorg\u00e4nger von Peter Tschentscher. Gleichwohl obliege die Entscheidung des Hamburg-SPD. 18.03 Uhr: Die Gr\u00fcnen d\u00fcrften das Ergebnis mit einem lachenden und einen weinenden Auge sehen: Einerseits hat sich die \u00d6ko-Partei verglichen mit der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2015 mehr als verdoppelt - andererseits ist der Griff von Katharina Fegebank nach dem B\u00fcrgermeister-Amt doch vergleichsweise deutlich gescheitert. Wahl in Hamburg: FDP und AfD m\u00fcssen um Einzug in die B\u00fcrgerschaft bangen - CDU erneut abgestraft 18.02 Uhr: Damit scheint schon jetzt klar: Peter Tschentscher (SPD) kann das Amt als Erster B\u00fcrgermeister wohl verteidigen. Die CDU kassiert eine bittere Schlappe. Die FDP muss um den Einzug in die B\u00fcrgerschaft bangen - f\u00fcr die AfD sieht es schon jetzt vergleichsweise d\u00fcster aus. 18.01 Uhr: Hier die erste Prognose nach Zahlen von infratest dimap im Auftrag der ARD: SPD: 37,5 \/ Gr\u00fcne: 25,5 \/ CDU: 11,5 \/ Linke: 9,0 \/ FDP: 5,0 \/ AfD: 4,7 \/ Sonstige: 6,8 B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: Vorl\u00e4ufiges Endergebnis wohl erst am Montag 17.56 Uhr: In wenigen Minuten gibt es erste Prognosen aus Hamburg . Bis zum vorl\u00e4ufigen amtlichen Endergebnis werden die Hamburger aber lange warten m\u00fcssen. Aufgrund des komplizierten Wahlsystems wird es ein solches wohl erst am Montagabend geben. Auch erste Hochrechnungen werden erst f\u00fcr 19.15 Uhr erwartet. Nach Schlie\u00dfung der Wahllokale werden zun\u00e4chst nur die Stimmen f\u00fcr die Parteien auf den Landesstimmzetteln ausgez\u00e4hlt, sodass am sp\u00e4ten Sonntagabend nur die voraussichtliche Verteilung der 121 B\u00fcrgerschaftssitze auf die Parteien feststehen wird. Wie sich diese Stimmen auf die einzelnen Kandidaten der Landeslisten verteilen, wird bei einer erneuten Ausz\u00e4hlung der Landesstimmzettel ermittelt, die zusammen mit jener der Wahlkreisstimmzettel am Montagmorgen beginnt. 17.44 Uhr: Bei der CDU d\u00fcrfte die Vorfreude auf die Verk\u00fcndung der ersten Prognosen eher gering sein. In den Umfragen waren die Christdemokraten seit Ende 2019 konstant im Sinkflug - zuletzt gaben nur noch zw\u00f6lf Prozent der Befragten an, die Partei von Spitzenkandidat Marcus Weinberg w\u00e4hlen zu wollen. Damit k\u00f6nnte eine bemerkenswerte Misserfolgsgeschichte ihre Fortsetzung finden: Noch im Februar 2008 waren 42,6 Prozent der Stimmen bei der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl auf die CDU entfallen. Seither k\u00f6nnte die Partei - stimmen die letzten Umfragen - fast drei Viertel ihrer W\u00e4hler verloren haben. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg: Auch AfD bangt - Wahlaufrufe auf Twitter 17.32 Uhr: Mit Spannung wird in Hamburg auch auf das Wahlergebnis der AfD geblickt. Anders als bei den zur\u00fcckliegenden Landtagswahlen d\u00fcrfte die rechtspopulistische Partei in der Hansestadt um den Sprung \u00fcber die F\u00fcnfprozenth\u00fcrde ringen m\u00fcssen. Letzte Umfragen sahen die AfD bei 5-6 Prozent der Stimmen. Auf Twitter werben Politiker und Aktivisten f\u00fcr den Urnengang - mit dem erkl\u00e4rten Ziel, die AfD aus der B\u00fcrgerschaft fernzuhalten. \u201eNie war es leichter, die AfD aus einem Parlament zu kicken - wenn viele demokratisch und antifaschistisch w\u00e4hlen zu gehen\u201c, schrieb etwa SPD-Vize Kevin K\u00fchnert . Auch die AfD selbst ist sich offenbar des Einzugs nicht sicher: Die Partei brauche\u00a0\u201ejede Stimme\u201c, twitterte der Bundestagsabgeordnete Stephan Brandner noch um 17 Uhr. 17.20 Uhr: Bei der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl deutet sich eine deutlich steigende Wahlbeteiligung an. Bis 16.00 Uhr gaben 57 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten ihre Stimme ab, wie die Landeswahlleitung mitteilte. Bei der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2015 hatten eine Stunde sp\u00e4ter, um 17.00 Uhr, erst 52,3 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten abgestimmt. Am Ende hatte die Beteiligung 56,5 Prozent betragen und war damit auf den niedrigsten Stand seit 1949 gefallen. Die Wahllokale schlie\u00dfen um 18.00 Uhr. B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl Hamburg kurz nach Th\u00fcringen: Folgt die W\u00e4hlerstrafe f\u00fcr Lindner und die FDP? 16.41 Uhr: Die FDP muss an diesem Abend um den Wiedereinzug in die Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaft zittern. Laut ZDF-Politbarometer kommen die Liberalen aktuell auf f\u00fcnf Prozent. Eine recht knappe Vorhersage. 2105 kam die FDP in Hamburg noch auf 7,4 Prozent. Schafft es die FDP nicht in die B\u00fcrgerschaft, kann das als Strafe der W\u00e4hler f\u00fcr das Wahldebakel in Th\u00fcringen gewertet werden. Nicht nur hatte sich dort der FDP-Kandidat Thomas Kemmerich mit Stimmen der AfD ins Ministerpr\u00e4sidentenamt w\u00e4hlen lassen. Auch scheint bis heute die Rolle von FDP-Chef Christian Lindner nicht ganz klar. Lindner hatte sich zwar wiederholt f\u00fcr das Debakel und seine erste Reaktion darauf entschuldigt. Doch in Hamburg sieht es aktuell nicht so aus, als k\u00f6nnten die FDP und er sich so leicht aus der Aff\u00e4re ziehen. 16.10 Uhr: Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD), der fr\u00fchere Erste B\u00fcrgermeister von Hamburg, hat sich unerwartet auf den Weg in die Hansestadt gemacht. Die Hamburg-Wahl 2020 f\u00e4llt mit dem Abschlusstag des G20-Finanzministertreffens in Riad zusammen. Scholz hat von dort aus fr\u00fchzeitig die Heimreise angetreten, wie das Handelsblatt berichtet . Zur Begr\u00fcndung seiner R\u00fcckreise nach Hamburg sagte er demnach lapidar:\u00a0\u201eWeil ich dort wohne.\u201c Vermutlich will der Vizekanzler den erwarteten Wahlsieg seines Nachfolgers Dr. Peter Tschentscher (ebenfalls SPD) zusammen mit seinen Hamburger Parteifreunden feiern. 15.05 Uhr: Was bedeutet die Wahl f\u00fcr CDU und FDP ? Nach aktuellem stand droht den beiden Parteien nach dem Wahldebakel in Th\u00fcringen die n\u00e4chste Katastrophe. Die FDP k\u00f6nnte nach der letzten Prognose sogar unter die f\u00fcnf Prozent-H\u00fcrde fallen. Das w\u00e4re fatal und k\u00f6nnte auch das Aus f\u00fcr Linder als FDP-Chef bedeuten. Auch die CDU liegt laut Umfragen mit 12 Prozent auf so schlechtem Kurs wie noch nie in Hamburg. Hamburg-Wahl: Wahlbeteiligung f\u00e4llt sehr hoch aus 14.59 Uhr: Bei der Hamburger B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl zeichnet sich eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Beteiligung ab als bei der Wahl vor f\u00fcnf Jahren. Bis 14.00 Uhr gaben 46,4 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten ihre Stimmen ab, wie das Landeswahlamt mitteilte. Bei der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2015 hatten bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt 38,5 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten abgestimmt. 2015 war die Wahlbeteiligung insgesamt auf das historische Tief von 56,5 Prozent gefallen. Landeswahlleiter Oliver Rudolf hatte sich zuversichtlich ge\u00e4u\u00dfert, dass die Beteiligung diesmal wieder auf \u00fcber 60 Prozent steigt. Wie die Hamburger gew\u00e4hlt haben, wird in dern ersten Prognosen um 18 Uhr zu sehen sein. Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Kommt ein gr\u00fcnes Wunder? CDU und FDP droht bitterer Tag Hamburg - Welche Auswirkungen haben die politischen Ereignisse in ganz Deutschland auf die Hamburg-Wahl 2020 ? Diese Frage d\u00fcrfte zumindest einige der gro\u00dfen Parteien im Vorfeld bewegen, denn die aktuelle Lage ist f\u00fcr\u00a0manche Beteiligte vor der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl sehr kompliziert geworden. Besonders die CDU und die FDP sind unter Druck geraten. Und das, w\u00e4hrend sie in der Hansestadt sowieso schon eine schwierige Ausgangslage erwarten mussten. +++ Hier finden Sie am Wahlabend alle Ergebnisse, Gewinne und Verluste im \u00dcberblick +++ Hamburg-Wahl 2020: Wie wird sich die CDU-Krise auswirken? In der CDU ist der Machtkampf ausgebrochen. Klar ist, dass Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer den Parteivorsitz abgeben wird - mehrere m\u00f6gliche Nachfolger haben bereits \u00f6ffentliches Interesse an dem Posten bekundet. Die Voraussetzungen f\u00fcr\u00a0Marcus Weinberg, Spitzenkandidat der\u00a0CDU\u00a0in Hamburg , sind deshalb alles andere als rosig. Wenn es um seine Partei geht, stehen kurz vor der Wahl oft die bundespolitischen Akteure im Fokus. Die Umfragewerte von zuletzt 12 bis 13 Prozent f\u00fcr die CDU sahen in Hamburg wenige Wochen zuvor noch um mehrere Prozentpunkte besser aus. Ausgel\u00f6st wurden die Probleme rund drei Wochen vor der Hamburg-Wahl durch den Eklat im Th\u00fcringer Landtag. Ein FDP-Ministerpr\u00e4sident, der sich mit den Stimmen von CDU und AfD w\u00e4hlen lie\u00df, wurde zum Skandal und selbst jetzt setzt sich die Krise in Th\u00fcringen fort und wirft ihren Schatten bis nach Hamburg . Auch die Liberalen in Hamburg k\u00f6nnten dadurch einen Schaden erleiden. Sie wurden Mitte Februar erstmals in den Monaten vor der Wahl von einem gro\u00dfen Umfrage-Institut unterhalb der F\u00fcnf-Prozent-H\u00fcrde verortet. Dass es nach der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg eine b\u00fcrgerlich-konservative Koalition geben k\u00f6nnte, ist nach menschlichem Ermessen ausgeschlossen. Die AfD und die Linke d\u00fcrften jeweils mit einem einstelligen Ergebnis in die B\u00fcrgerschaft einziehen. Die letzten Prognosen vor der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl 2020 in Hamburg Alles deutet darauf hin, dass in Hamburg eine rot-gr\u00fcne Koalition die Mehrheit bekommt. Der SPD wird mit ihrem amtierenden Ersten B\u00fcrgermeister Dr. Peter Tschentscher ein Ergebnis deutlich \u00fcber 30 Prozent vorhergesagt. Zusammen mit den Gr\u00fcnen , deren Umfragewerte zwischen 23 bis 29 Prozent schwankten, ist eine v\u00f6llig stabile Mehrheit absehbar. Spannend wird am Wahlabend aber die Frage, ob die Gr\u00fcnen weiter aufholen k\u00f6nnen. In Einzelf\u00e4llen wurden sie 2020 schon gleichauf oder knapp hinter der SPD verortet. Bei der Hamburg-Wahl hat Katharina Fegebank * also noch eine Chance darauf, die gr\u00fcne Erste B\u00fcrgermeisterin zu werden. Das Rennen an der Spitze konzentriert sich auf diese zwei Kandidaten und das Ergebnis von SPD und Gr\u00fcnen. Erstes Ergebnis der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg schon am Sonntag zu erwarten Die ersten Prognosen der Wahlforschungsinstitute werden am Wahlsonntag wie immer um 18 Uhr erscheinen. Voraussichtlich wird sich bereits zu dieser Zeit andeuten, ob Dr. Peter Tschentscher oder Katharina Fegebank sich durchsetzen kann. Anschlie\u00dfend werden nach und nach die bereits ausgez\u00e4hlten Wahllokale in die Hochrechnungen einbezogen, bis schlie\u00dflich sp\u00e4ter am Abend ein vorl\u00e4ufiges Ergebnis der B\u00fcrgerschaftswahl in Hamburg vorliegt.

Whilst Trost said he was looking forward to \u201csomething of the eerie mood in the empty streets\u201d disappearing, he said he also had some trepidation about the move, which will see small shops of up to 800 sq m reopen. \u201cI\u2019m quite nervous about the relaxation of the rules in that I\u2019m concerned that people will no longer take the illness seriously, and we could soon end up with another lockdown,\u201d the customer service adviser for Berlin Water Works said. \u201cThe sense of solidarity which was obvious at the beginning is starting to disintegrate. And as long as I can\u2019t hug my friends, I won\u2019t feel that life is anything like normal.\u201d Simon, one of 10,000 secondary school students in the state of Brandenburg due to take their exams on Monday, under strict hygiene and physical distancing rules, said he was glad that he was being allowed to sit exams at all after some authorities discussed rewarding exam certificates based on average marks instead. \u201cI didn\u2019t fancy being labelled my whole life as being one of those forced to get the \u2018emergency Abitur\u2019,\u201d he said, ahead of a geography exam and sipping on a latte bought from a cafe selling drinks from behind a perspex window in its doorway. \u201cEven though it\u2019s been an uncertain few weeks, which might affect my performance, I\u2019m glad to have the proper chance to show what I can do. Though the situation is far from normal,\u201d he added.

Photograph: Kate Connolly Kerstin Seefeldt was stacking the shelves of her Babelsberg bookshop, Script, eagerly preparing for a reopening on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to seeing my customers properly again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m organising the shop so that the tables of books are like a labyrinth and customers can avoid coming into contact with each other.\u201d Only two customers will be allowed at a time in the 30 sq m space, she said. Seefeldt ran a thrice-daily bicycle delivery service for customers during the shutdown. \u201cIt has been an intense and rewarding time of mutual solidarity. But I know that the situation is far from normal, and so I will now keep up the delivery service for people considered to be in a risk category because I\u2019m aware that things cannot go back to normal for a long time yet, even if the shop is able to open,\u201d she said. She added she was relieved to have been helped through a financially difficult period by a government investment grant of \u20ac9000, news of which had reached her that morning. Germany: coronavirus deaths The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Germans on Monday to remain \u201cdisciplined and watchful\u201d, and warned that if attitudes towards the pandemic relaxed too quickly, another tougher lockdown may follow. \u201cWe must not lose track of the fact that we continue to be at the start of this pandemic and are far from out of the woods,\u201d she said. Thanking Germans for \u2013 by and large \u2013 sticking to the rules of staying at home and keeping physical distance, Merkel said a lot had so far been achieved. \u201cThe infection is under control to the extent that it is not climbing exponentially any more,\u201d she said. But a \u201crash easing\u201d of the restrictions was in danger of unleashing the \u201cunknown\u201d, she warned. Acknowledging the plight of many people, including artists, single parents and restaurant managers,Merkel said Germans should not be \u201clulled into a false sense of security\u201d. If the infection rate began to rise \u2013 which would first be visible in the statistics in two weeks\u2019 time \u2013 \u201ca new shutdown would be unavoidable\u201d and that had to be prevented for the sake of the economy, she said.

Photograph: Christian Mang\/Reuters But there are signs that social tensions are rising in parts of the country, and the sense that this is a critical moment in tackling the virus is keenly felt. At the weekend, police struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning on Berlin\u2019s Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz against what they saw as constraints placed on their basic rights due to the so-called Corona Verordnungen, or regulations. Amongst the protesters were anti-vaxxers, well-known conspiracy theorists, and rightwing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship. Other similar demonstrations have taken place elsewhere across Germany . By Monday afternoon German health authorities had reported a total of 146,000 confirmed infections and 4735 deaths. The reproduction rate was slightly higher than on Friday, at 0.8, but anything under one is being considered a success by decision-makers.

{"year":"2020","month":"05","event_desc":"5 May  German Bundesverfassungsgericht decided, that the expanded asset-purchase programme (EAPP) since 2015 by European Central Bank violates German law.","text":"Pr\u00c3\u00a4sident Vo\u00c3\u009fkuhle verabschiedet sich mit einem Denkzettel an die Politik aus Karlsruhe: Stichwort \u00e2\u0080\u009cultra vires\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aufregung in Karlsruhe: Das BVerfG erkl\u00c3\u00a4rt das PSPP der EZB f\u00c3\u00bcr kompetenzwidrig, ebenso sei eine Entscheidung des EuGH ultra vires. Damit wendet sich das BVerfG erstmalig in seiner Geschichte direkt gegen die Rechtsprechung des EuGH. Was hat das f\u00c3\u00bcr Folgen? \u00c2 Worum geht es? In Karlsruhe haben die Richter vom BVerfG mit einem Urteil f\u00c3\u00bcr Aufsehen gesorgt. Im Verfahren geht es um das seit l\u00c3\u00a4ngerer Zeit umstrittene Programm der EZB, in dem sie Staatsanleihenk\u00c3\u00a4ufe betreibt. Das BVerfG hat dieses Vorgehen nun beanstandet und es f\u00c3\u00bcr kompetenzwidrig erkl\u00c3\u00a4rt. Mit diesem Urteil wendet sich unser h\u00c3\u00b6chstes Gericht direkt gegen den EuGH. Damit hat das BVerfG sich erstmals in seiner Geschichte gegen die europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Richter gestellt. Es wird daher vermutet, dass das Urteil Auswirkungen hat, die \u00c3\u00bcber die Geldpolitik hinausgehen. Die Entscheidung k\u00c3\u00b6nnte das Verh\u00c3\u00a4ltnis der nationalen Gerichte der Mitgliedstaaten zum EuGH nachhaltig pr\u00c3\u00a4gen. \u00c2 Streit um die Rechtm\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009figkeit vom EZB-Anleihenprogramm Das Verfahren geht schon \u00c3\u00bcber einige Jahre. Mehrere Personen hatten Verfassungsbeschwerden eingelegt, die sich gegen das Anleihekaufprogramm der EZB wenden. Sie monierten das sogenannte Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP), an dem die Deutsche Bundesbank beteiligt ist. Seit 2015 kauft die EZB Staatsanleihen an, damit sich Staaten finanzieren k\u00c3\u00b6nnen. Durch dieses Instrument sollen Deflationen vorgebeugt werden, die Wirtschaften der einzelnen Staaten profitieren erheblich davon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 schlie\u00c3\u009flich betr\u00c3\u00a4gt das Volumen der Ank\u00c3\u00a4ufe mittlerweile mehr als 2, 6 Billionen Euro. Problematisch ist aber nun folgendes: Die EZB hat als europ\u00c3\u00a4ische Institution nur die Kompetenzen, die ihr von den Mitgliedstaaten \u00c3\u00bcbertragen wurden. Grunds\u00c3\u00a4tzlich hat sie daher nur ein Mandat f\u00c3\u00bcr die W\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitik. Durch ihr Handeln besteht aber ein naturgem\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fer Zusammenhang zur Wirtschaftspolitik. Daf\u00c3\u00bcr hat sie aber keine einger\u00c3\u00a4umte Kompetenz, denn Wirtschaftspolitik ist Sache der Nationalstaaten. Der EZB ist in den EU-Vertr\u00c3\u00a4gen lediglich einger\u00c3\u00a4umt, \u00e2\u0080\u009edie allgemeine Wirtschaftspolitik\u00e2\u0080\u009c der EU zu unterst\u00c3\u00bctzen. Gerichtlich wird daher seit Jahren gestritten: Welches wirtschaftspolitische Ausma\u00c3\u009f haben die Staatsanleihenk\u00c3\u00a4ufe, die als w\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitische Ma\u00c3\u009fnahmen gelten? Mit ihren Verfassungsbeschwerden streben die Beschwerdef\u00c3\u00bchrer eine Kl\u00c3\u00a4rung der Legitimationsfrage EZB an. Sie bef\u00c3\u00bcrchten, dass der Ankauf von Staatsanleihen vielmehr eine verdeckte Staatsfinanzierung sei, die zu Lasten der Steuerzahler gehen w\u00c3\u00bcrde. Dazu sei die EZB nicht legitimiert. \u00c2 EuGH sieht kein Problem Dem EuGH wurde 2017 vom BVerfG mehrere Fragen zu diesem Verfahren vorgelegt. Dieses sieht in dem PSPP keine Probleme. Die europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Richter f\u00c3\u00bchrten aus, dass dadurch zwar auch ein Einfluss auf die Gesamtwirtschaft bestehe. Dieser sei aber zwangsl\u00c3\u00a4ufig und zul\u00c3\u00a4ssig, da im Vordergrund das w\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitische Vorgehen st\u00c3\u00bcnde \u00e2\u0080\u0093 und sei daher von den einger\u00c3\u00a4umten Kompetenzen gedeckt. \u00c2 BVerfG: Urteil des EuGH sei \u00e2\u0080\u009eultra vires\u00e2\u0080\u009c Die Sache kam zur\u00c3\u00bcck nach Karlsruhe. Erneut mussten sich die Richter dem Programm der EZB annehmen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 und schreiben nun Rechtsgeschichte. Erstmals befindet das BVerfG, dass europ\u00c3\u00a4ische Organe offensichtlich kompetenzwidrig gehandelt haben. Die EZB habe kompetenzwidrig gehandelt, ebenso sei das Urteil des EuGH \u00e2\u0080\u0093 das keinen Versto\u00c3\u009f feststellte \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009eultra vires\u00e2\u0080\u009c. Ultra vires bedeutet \u00e2\u0080\u009eJenseits der Gewalten\u00e2\u0080\u009c und beschreibt eine klare Kompetenz\u00c3\u00bcberschreitung eines europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Organs. Diese k\u00c3\u00b6nnen nur in den Ma\u00c3\u009fst\u00c3\u00a4ben t\u00c3\u00a4tig werden, die ihnen von den Nationalstaaten \u00c3\u00bcbertragen wurden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 es gilt das Prinzip der Einzelerm\u00c3\u00a4chtigung. Zun\u00c3\u00a4chst musste der BVerfG das billigende Urteil des EuGH als ultra vires erkl\u00c3\u00a4ren, damit es seine Rechtskraft verliert. Das BVerfG findet f\u00c3\u00bcr das Urteil erstaunlich starke Worte. Es bezeichnete die Kontrolle der Verh\u00c3\u00a4ltnism\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009figkeit als \u00e2\u0080\u009eschlechterdings nicht mehr nachvollziehbar\u00e2\u0080\u009c, der EuGH habe die \u00e2\u0080\u009eBedeutung und Tragweite des auch bei der Kompetenzverteilung zu beachtenden Grundsatzes der Verh\u00c3\u00a4ltnism\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009figkeit offensichtlich\u00e2\u0080\u009c verkannt. Die Begr\u00c3\u00bcndung des EuGH sei \u00e2\u0080\u009emethodisch nicht mehr vertretbar\u00e2\u0080\u009c. Der EuGH sei damit seiner Kontrollaufgabe gegen\u00c3\u00bcber der EZB nicht nachgekommen, weil dieser die tats\u00c3\u00a4chlichen wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen des PSPP \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt nicht einbezogen hatte. Es sei zu einem Abw\u00c3\u00a4gungsausfall gekommen. Durch die Erkl\u00c3\u00a4rung des EuGH-Urteils als ultra vires hat es keine bindende Wirkung f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutschland.\u00c2 Nachdem das BVerfG das europ\u00c3\u00a4ische Urteil f\u00c3\u00bcr ultra vires erkl\u00c3\u00a4rte, fuhr es mit dem Programm der EZB fort. Die Karlsruher Richter kritisieren das PSPP schon l\u00c3\u00a4nger, daher ging die Frage auch zur Kl\u00c3\u00a4rung an den EuGH \u00e2\u0080\u0093 die nun vom BVerfG anders beantwortet wurde. Das PSPP sei als unverh\u00c3\u00a4ltnism\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fig anzusehen. Die Richter r\u00c3\u00bcgten die nicht transparente Begr\u00c3\u00bcndung der Verh\u00c3\u00a4ltnism\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009figkeit, sprich: Es h\u00c3\u00a4tte besser begr\u00c3\u00bcndet werden m\u00c3\u00bcssen, wie man bei Festlegung des Programms abgewogen hat. Aus Karlsruhe wurde sich eine bessere Dokumentation gew\u00c3\u00bcnscht, ob die EZB tats\u00c3\u00a4chlich \u00c3\u00bcber so viel Geld verf\u00c3\u00bcgen musste, um ihre w\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitischen Ziele zu erreichen. Diese seien aktuell nicht von au\u00c3\u009fen nachvollziehbar, k\u00c3\u00b6nnten daher nicht gerichtlich kontrolliert werden. Die EZB habe somit jenseits ihrer Kompetenzen gehandelt. \u00c2 W\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitische Folgen Direkt betroffen von dem Urteil des BVerfG ist die Deutsche Bundesbank, die am PSPP teilnimmt. K\u00c3\u00bcnftig darf sie nur weiter mitmachen, wenn seitens der EZB nachvollziehbar dargelegt wurde, dass die \u00e2\u0080\u009eangestrebten w\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitischen Ziele nicht au\u00c3\u009fer Verh\u00c3\u00a4ltnis zu den damit verbundenen wirtschafts- und fiskalpolitischen Auswirkungen stehen\u00e2\u0080\u009c. Die EZB hat nun drei Monate Zeit, um Ausf\u00c3\u00bchrungen zum PSPP nachzureichen. Sollte ihr dies nicht gelingen, kann die Bundesbank an dem Programm nicht weiter teilhaben. \u00c2 Folge f\u00c3\u00bcr die europ\u00c3\u00a4ische Rechtsgemeinschaft Spannend ist aber au\u00c3\u009ferdem die Frage, welche Auswirkungen das Vorgehen des BVerfG auf die europ\u00c3\u00a4ische Rechtsgemeinschaft haben wird. Es wird vermutet, dass diese negativ ausfallen. Das BVerfG gilt unter den nationalen Gerichtsbarkeiten als Vorbild. Nun haben die Richter aber die Rechtsprechung aus Luxemburg angezweifelt und als ultra vires erkl\u00c3\u00a4rt. Dieses Vorgehen k\u00c3\u00b6nnte Einfluss auf andere nationale Gerichtsbarkeiten haben. Die w\u00c3\u00a4hrungspolitische Streitigkeit wird sich im Laufe der Zeit kl\u00c3\u00a4ren lassen, das Verh\u00c3\u00a4ltnis zum EuGH k\u00c3\u00b6nnte aber einen Schaden erlitten haben. Gerade in einer Zeit, in der nationales Denken in einigen europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen L\u00c3\u00a4ndern auf dem Vormarsch ist, wird bef\u00c3\u00bcrchtet, dass sich Staaten wie Polen und Ungarn am BVerfG ein Beispiel nehmen k\u00c3\u00b6nnten und sich im Rahmen von ultra vires gegen den EuGH stellen werden.

April 2020 Link kopieren Pressemitteilung 144 Donnerstag, 30. April 2020 Presse- und Informationsamt der Bundesregierung (BPA) Die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der L\u00e4nder fassen folgenden Beschluss: Nachdem es Deutschland in international beachteter Weise gelungen ist, die Neuinfektionszahlen durch das SARS-Cov2-Virus zu reduzieren, haben die L\u00e4nder auf der Grundlage des gemeinsamen Beschlusses mit der Bundeskanzlerin seit dem 20. April schrittweise erste \u00d6ffnungsma\u00dfnahmen umgesetzt. Es ist noch zu fr\u00fch, um anhand der gemeldeten Neuinfektionen beurteilen zu k\u00f6nnen, ob sich diese \u00d6ffnungsma\u00dfnahmen trotz der Hygieneauflagen verst\u00e4rkend auf das Infektionsgeschehen ausgewirkt haben. Diese Beurteilung und die damit verbundene Entscheidung, ob ein weiterer gr\u00f6\u00dferer \u00d6ffnungsschritt m\u00f6glich ist, soll am 6. Mai in einer weiteren Besprechung der Bundeskanzlerin mit den Regierungschefinnen und -chefs der L\u00e4nder erfolgen. Bund und L\u00e4nder arbeiten w\u00e4hrend dessen weiter intensiv daran, das Infektionsgeschehen durch ein breites Ma\u00dfnahmenb\u00fcndel so gut wie m\u00f6glich zu kontrollieren und das Gesundheitswesen zu st\u00e4rken. Nur mit einer erfolgreichen Infektionskontrolle und konstant niedrigen Neuinfiziertenzahlen kann dauerhaft erreicht werden, dass die \u00d6ffnungen Bestand haben und keine R\u00fcckkehr zu deutschlandweiten Beschr\u00e4nkungen erforderlich wird. Zugleich werden Wirtschaftshilfen und sozialen Leistungen auf den Weg gebracht, um die negativen Folgen der Krise abzumildern. Bund und L\u00e4nder w\u00e4gen bei allen Entscheidungen deren Wirkung in gesundheitlicher, sozialer und wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht sorgf\u00e4ltig gegeneinander ab. Die st\u00e4ndig zunehmenden wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse \u00fcber dieses neuartige Virus und viele interdisziplin\u00e4re Expertenmeinungen flie\u00dfen dabei in die Entscheidungsfindung ein. Die Verantwortung f\u00fcr die Entscheidungen liegt bei Bund und L\u00e4ndern, f\u00fcr die angesichts des Umstandes, dass es sich um eine Situation ohne Beispiel mit vielen noch schwer absch\u00e4tzbaren Risiken handelt, ein vorsichtiges Vorgehen in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Schritten und ein besonders strenger Ma\u00dfstab f\u00fcr vor\u00fcbergehend notwendige Grundrechtseinschr\u00e4nkungen das leitende Prinzip f\u00fcr verantwortbares Handeln ist. Vor diesem Hintergrund vereinbaren die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der L\u00e4nder: 1. Die gemeinsamen Beschl\u00fcsse sowie die begleitenden ChefBK\/CdS-Beschl\u00fcsse sowie die Entscheidungen des Corona-Kabinetts bleiben g\u00fcltig, soweit im Folgenden nicht abweichende Festlegungen getroffen werden. 2. Wesentliches Element der Infektionskontrolle ist die vollst\u00e4ndige Kontaktnachverfolgung bei allen Neuinfizierten. Wenn die Kontaktnachverfolgung nicht gelingen w\u00fcrde, best\u00fcnde die gro\u00dfe Gefahr, dass eine neue Infektionsdynamik entsteht. Deshalb bauen die L\u00e4nder lageangepasst erhebliche Personalkapazit\u00e4ten (ein Team aus 5 Personen je 20.000 Einwohner) auf. Seit dem 24. April melden alle Gesundheits\u00e4mter \u00fcber die zust\u00e4ndigen Landesbeh\u00f6rden an das Robert-Koch-Institut, ob die vollst\u00e4ndige Kontaktnachverfolgung gew\u00e4hrleistet, gef\u00e4hrdet oder bereits aktuell nicht mehr m\u00f6glich ist. Dies erm\u00f6glicht den L\u00e4ndern, diese Kapazit\u00e4ten bei besonders betroffenen Gesundheitsdiensten sofort aufzustocken und vom Bund die dort aufgebauten Kontaktnachverfolgungsteams von RKI, Bundeswehr und aus dem Medizinstudenten-Programm \u201eMedis4\u00d6GD\u201c anzufordern. Die m\u00f6glichst vollst\u00e4ndige Kontaktnachverfolgung ist die Grundvoraussetzung f\u00fcr weitere \u00d6ffnungsschritte und ein wichtiger Ma\u00dfstab f\u00fcr die Bewertung der Frage, welche Neuinfiziertenzahlen im mehrt\u00e4tigen Mittel toleriert werden k\u00f6nnen. 3. Die bisherige epidemiologische Entwicklung in Deutschland hat gezeigt, dass es durch lokale Ereignisse immer wieder zu besonderen regionalen Betroffenheiten bei der Ausbreitung des SARS-Cov2-Virus kommt. Deshalb bereiten Bund und L\u00e4nder weiter schnell abrufbare Unterst\u00fctzungsma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr besonders betroffene Gebiete vor und stimmen sich dabei zwischen den Krisenst\u00e4ben von Bund und L\u00e4ndern weiter eng ab. Wenn die deutschlandweit erzielten Erfolge in der Verlangsamung des Infektionsgeschehens nicht gef\u00e4hrdet werden sollen, muss auf eine regionale Dynamik mit hohen Neuinfektionszahlen und schnellem Anstieg der Infektionsrate sofort reagiert werden. Dazu geh\u00f6rt auch, dass die umfassenden Beschr\u00e4nkungen , die vor dem 20. April g\u00fcltig waren, vor Ort sofort wieder konsequent eingef\u00fchrt werden m\u00fcssen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus k\u00f6nnen auch Beschr\u00e4nkungen nicht erforderlicher Mobilit\u00e4t in die besonders betroffenen Gebiete hinein und aus ihnen heraus im Einzelfall geboten sein. Wenn es erneut zu einer \u00fcberregionalen Infektionsdynamik kommt, die eine \u00dcberforderung des Gesundheitssystems bef\u00fcrchten l\u00e4sst, m\u00fcssen die Beschr\u00e4nkungen auch in allen L\u00e4ndern ganz oder teilweise wieder eingef\u00fchrt werden. 4. Am 13. M\u00e4rz 2020 haben die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der L\u00e4nder die Kliniken in Deutschland aufgefordert, ab dem 16. M\u00e4rz 2020 alle medizinisch nicht zwingend notwendigen planbaren Aufnahmen und Operationen zu verschieben, um sich auf die nicht vorhersehbare Zahl von COVID-19-Erkrankten fr\u00fchzeitig vorzubereiten und intensivmedizinische Kapazit\u00e4ten vorzuhalten sowie aus- und aufzubauen. Aktuell werden etwa 40 Prozent der Intensivbetten \u2013 bei finanziellem Ausgleich \u2013 freigehalten. Die aktuelle Entwicklung der COVID-19-Infektionszahlen und die pr\u00e4zise \u00dcbersicht, die durch das DIVI-IntensivRegister erm\u00f6glicht wurde, l\u00e4sst es nun zu, dass ein etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferer Teil der Krankenhauskapazit\u00e4ten wieder f\u00fcr planbare Operationen genutzt werden kann. Dies ist auch deswegen geboten, weil sich eine dauerhafte ausschlie\u00dfliche Priorisierung nur einer bestimmten Patientengruppe unter Ausschluss anderer Gruppen von Erkrankten nicht rechtfertigen l\u00e4sst. Gleichzeitig sollen ausreichend COVID-19-Behandlungskapazit\u00e4ten freigehalten und an die jeweilige Pandemieentwicklung angepasst werden. F\u00fcr die Umsetzung hat der Bund ein kriterienbasiertes Konzept vorgelegt, unter dessen Ber\u00fccksichtigung die L\u00e4nder ab sofort die regionale Steuerung unter Beachtung der regionalen Besonderheiten vornehmen k\u00f6nnen. Das DIVI-IntensivRegister zur Steuerung der Intensivkapazit\u00e4ten in Deutschland wird aktuell zu einem Tool weiterentwickelt, das anhand bekannter Parameter eine Prognose f\u00fcr den COVID-19-bedingten Bedarf an Intensivbetten bundesweit und regional f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten zwei Wochen vorhersagt. Dieses Tool wird vom Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit weiter gef\u00f6rdert und im laufenden Betrieb best\u00e4ndig weiter verbessert und ausgebaut. 5. Gro\u00dfveranstaltunge n wie z.B. Volksfeste, gr\u00f6\u00dfere Sportveranstaltungen mit Zuschauern, gr\u00f6\u00dfere Konzerte, Festivals, Dorf-, Stadt-, Stra\u00dfen-, Wein-, Sch\u00fctzenfeste oder Kirmes-Veranstaltungen sind derzeit untersagt. Wegen der immer noch gegebenen Unsicherheit des Infektionsgeschehens ist davon auszugehen, dass dies auch mindestens bis zum 31. August so bleiben wird. Ab wann und unter welchen Bedingungen kleinere \u00f6ffentliche oder private Veranstaltungen oder Feiern sowie Veranstaltungen ohne Festcharakter k\u00fcnftig stattfinden k\u00f6nnen, ist derzeit aufgrund der in diesem Bereich besonders hohen Infektionsgefahr noch nicht abzusehen und abh\u00e4ngig vom weiteren epidemiologischen Verlauf. 6. Die Bundeskanzlerin und die Regierungschefinnen und Regierungschefs der L\u00e4nder bekr\u00e4ftigen ihren Dank an die Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften , die mit dem notwendigen Verzicht auf die \u00f6ffentliche Durchf\u00fchrung von Gottesdiensten und Gebetsveranstaltungen trotz hoher Feiertage in den vergangenen Wochen einen wichtigen Beitrag geleistet haben, um die Verbreitung des Coronavirus einzud\u00e4mmen. Die jetzt auch durch diese Ma\u00dfnahmen erreichten Erfolge lassen daher eine schrittweise Lockerung der Ma\u00dfnahmen zu.

{"year":"2020","month":"09","event_desc":"2 September  The German government claims to have \"unequivocal proof\" that Alexai Navalny was poisoned with Novichok.","text":"Alexei Navalny: Russia opposition leader poisoned with Novichok - Germany Published 2 September 2020 Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Reuters There is \"unequivocal proof\" that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, Germany has said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said he was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers. Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma. His team says he was poisoned on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation. The Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. \"Where are the facts, where are the formulas, at least some kind of information?\" she asked. Navlany 'Novichok poisoning' test for the West What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Navalny and Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arsenal of exotic poisons A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the latest attack , external as \"outrageous\". \"The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done,\" he tweeted. What has Germany said? After the government in Berlin released results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory, Chancellor Merkel said there were now \"serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer\". \"Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms.\" Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Navalny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team sees Kremlin behind attack Chancellor Merkel said Germany's Nato and EU partners had been informed of the results of the investigation and they would decide on a common and appropriate response based on Russia's reaction. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya and Russia's ambassador to Germany would also be informed of the findings, the Berlin government said. The European Union has demanded a \"transparent\" investigation by the Russian government. \"Those responsible must be brought to justice,\" a statement read , external . Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also called for an inquiry in a tweet , external , while the US National Security Council (NSC) said the suspected poisoning was \"completely reprehensible\". \"We will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities,\" an NSC spokesman said , external . Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud. It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny's faced over the years tell a different story about his impact. He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the \"Navalny problem\" for good. The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation. The \"collapse\" is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious. Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come. What happened to Navalny? Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. The flight of the prominent Putin critic was diverted to Omsk, where doctors treated him for three days before he was transferred to the Charit\u00c3\u00a9 hospital in Berlin. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Navalny's transfer to Germany came after three days in hospital in Omsk The Kremlin says Russian doctors administered atropine - which can be used to treat the effects of nerve agents - but found no evidence of poisoning. Mrs Navalnaya said she feared Russian doctors had delayed his transfer as authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear. Doctors at Charit\u00c3\u00a9 hospital have said his condition is continuing to improve but he remains in an intensive care unit on a ventilator. What is Novichok? The name Novichok means \"newcomer\" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they can be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. In 2018, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill in the British city of Salisbury, after Russian suspects were alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on the door handle of the former Russian spy's home. What is the Salisbury poisoning's legacy? Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Her partner became critically ill but recovered. Who is Navalny? Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He has called Mr Putin's party a place of \"crooks and thieves\" that is \"sucking the blood out of Russia\". However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. Who else has been poisoned? In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko - an ex-Russian intelligence officer who became a Kremlin critic and fled to the UK - died after his tea was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210. More recently, journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and two years later went into a coma for a week. Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He too was treated by Berlin's Charit\u00c3\u00a9 hospital, and asked the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation to arrange Mr Navalny's airlift there.","question":"What substance was Alexei Navalny poisoned with in 2020?","answer":"Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" Answer: Novichok","correct":true,"refusal":false,"reasoning":"The candidate's answer 'Novichok' matches the expected answer 'Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent' in substance, as it correctly identifies the nerve agent used.

He is in a coma after drinking what his supporters suspect was poisoned tea; they accuse the authorities of trying to conceal a crime. Doctors treating him in Omsk had insisted on Friday that he was too ill to be moved. But they later said his condition was stable enough for the flight. His wife Yulia travelled with him. On Saturday morning, Mr Navalny's medical evacuation flight - paid for by the German non-governmental organisation Cinema for Peace - landed at Tegel airport in Berlin. He is being treated at the German capital's Charit\u00c3\u00a9 hospital, which has said it does not expect to release a statement about his condition before Monday. The founder of the Cinema for Peace Foundation, activist and filmmaker Jaka Bizilj, told reporters outside the hospital that Mr Navalny's condition was \"very worrying\". \"It's not only about the question if he will survive this,\" he said. \"It's a question what kind of damage there is, if he will survive this and come back to normal fully.\" Image source, EPA Image caption, Mr Navalny is in a coma on life support Mr Navalny's personal doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, was not allowed to see him while he was in hospital in Russia. But she said she was hopeful he could recover now that he was in Germany. \"I'm sure that they can treat him and do everything to eliminate this toxic agent from his body.\" Medical staff treating Mr Navalny at the hospital in Omsk said before his flight that his life was not in immediate danger. Mr Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, earlier tweeted: \"Massive thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning.\" Ms Yarmysh said it was a pity that doctors had taken so long to approve his flight as the plane and the right documents had been ready since Friday morning. Image source, EPA Image caption, The medical evacuation flight arrived at Tegel airport in Berlin on Saturday morning Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday, and his plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. A photograph on social media appeared to show him drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe before the flight. His team suspects a poisonous substance was put in his tea. Disturbing video appeared to show a stricken Mr Navalny howling in agony on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said he had heard the activist \"screaming in pain\". What the doctors said on Friday The head doctor at the hospital where Mr Navalny was being treated in Omsk, Alexander Murakhovsky, warned late on Friday that doctors did not recommend flying \"but his wife insists on her husband being transferred to a German clinic\". \"The patient's condition is stable,\" deputy chief doctor Anatoly Kalinichenko was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia's vociferous Putin critic Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Navalny fell ill during a flight on Thursday \"As we're in possession of a request from relatives to permit him to be transported somewhere, we have now taken the decision that we do not object to his transfer to another in-patient facility,\" Dr Kalinichenko said. Doctors said earlier that no poison had been found in his body, suggesting his condition might be the result of a \"metabolic disorder\" caused by low blood sugar. Health officials then indicated that traces of an industrial chemical had been found on his skin and hair. The local interior ministry told the Rapsi legal news agency that the chemical was usually included in polymers to improve their elasticity , external , but its concentration was impossible to establish. The prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin has consistently exposed official corruption in Russia. He has served multiple jail terms. What do Mr Navalny's supporters say? At a news conference in Berlin on Friday, Mr Navalny's aide Leonid Volkov said at first doctors at the hospital had been helping to facilitate his transfer but had abruptly stopped doing so. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Medical experts from Germany were allowed to see Mr Navalny \"[It was] like something was switched off - like medicine mode off, cover-up operation mode on - and the doctors refused to co-operate any more, refused to give any information even to Alexei's wife,\" he said. \"The doctors who were helping to do the paperwork to make the transportation of Alexei to Charit\u00c3\u00a9 possible started to say that he's not any more transportable, he's not any more stable, contradicting themselves.\" In 2018, the Cinema for Peace Foundation arranged for the treatment of Pyotr Verzilov - an activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot - who had symptoms of poisoning. Mr Verzilov's ex-wife, activist Nadya Tolokonnikova, told BBC News that Mr Navalny's condition resembled the \"poisoning\" of her ex-husband. \"What German doctors told me after not finding poison in my ex-husband's blood is that the poison disappears in three days. So the Russian doctors only let him go when they were sure there was no traces of poison left,\" she explained. She also expressed surprise about what has happened to Mr Navalny: \"I thought Alexei was so powerful as a political figure that Mr Putin would not interfere.\" Mr Navalny's wife Yulia wrote to President Putin asking him to allow her husband to be moved. She feared the Russian authorities were stalling so that evidence of any chemical substance would be lost. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary and wished him a \"speedy recovery\". On Friday he said it was purely a medical decision. Foreign leaders including Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron have expressed concern for Mr Navalny. In the US, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has described the incident as \"unacceptable\" , external and vowed that, if elected, he would \"stand up to autocrats like Putin\".

The vote in the Bundestag (parliament) on Thursday makes defiling foreign flags equal to the crime of defiling the German flag. The same applies for the EU anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy theme. The move followed Social Democrat (SPD) complaints about protesters' burning of the Israeli flag in Berlin in 2017. Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht, a member of the centre-left SPD, said \"burning flags publicly has nothing to do with peaceful protests\". She said it stoked up \"hatred, anger and aggression\", and hurt many people's feelings. The new law also applies to acts of defilement besides burning, such as publicly ripping a flag up. Public display of the Nazi swastika and other Nazi symbols is already banned in Germany. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has condemned the new law as \"excessive interference in free speech and artistic expression\".

Early in the day tens of thousands protested against government measures for the coronavirus.","text":"0:44 German coronavirus protesters attempt to storm Reichstag \u2013 video Coronavirus This article is more than 4 years old 'Anti-corona' extremists try to storm German parliament This article is more than 4 years old Police prevent hundreds from entering Reichstag and disband march protesting against Covid protection measures Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage Associated Press Sat 29 Aug 2020 23.45 BST First published on Sat 29 Aug 2020 12.11 BST Share Far-right extremists tried to storm the German parliament building on Saturday following a protest against the country\u2019s pandemic restrictions, but were intercepted by police and forcibly removed. The incident occurred after a daylong demonstration by tens of thousands of people opposed to the wearing of masks and other government measures intended to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Police ordered the protesters to disband halfway through their march around Berlin after participants refused to observe physical distancing rules, but a rally near the capital\u2019s iconic Brandenburg Gate took place as planned. Footage of the incident showed hundreds of people, some waving the flag of the German Reich of 1871-1918 and other far-right banners, running toward the Reichstag building and up the stairs. Police confirmed on Twitter that several people had broken through a cordon in front of parliament and entered the staircase of the Reichstag building, but not the building itself. Force had to be used to push them back. Stones and bottles were also thrown, police said. Germany\u2019s top security official condemned the incident. \u201cThe Reichstag building is the workplace of our parliament and therefore the symbolic centre of our liberal democracy,\u201d the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable that vandals and extremists should misuse it.\u201d He called on authorities to show zero tolerance. Earlier, thousands of far-right extremists had thrown bottles and stones at police outside the Russian embassy. Police detained about 300 people throughout the day. Berlin\u2019s regional government had tried to ban the protests, warning that extremists could use them as a platform and citing anti-mask rallies earlier this month where rules intended to stop the virus from being spread further were not respected. Protest organisers successfully appealed against the decision on Friday, though a court ordered them to ensure physical distancing. Failure to enforce that measure prompted Berlin police to dissolve the march while it was still in progress. During the march, which authorities said drew about 38,000 people, participants expressed their opposition to a wide range of issues, including vaccinations, face masks and the German government in general. Some wore T-shirts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory, while others displayed white nationalist slogans and neo-Nazi insignia, though most participants denied having far-right views. Uwe Bachmann, 57, said he had come from southwestern Germany to protest for free speech and his right not to wear a mask. \u201cI respect those who are afraid of the virus,\u201d he said, wearing a costume and a wig that tried to evoke stereotypical Native American attire. He suggested, without elaborating, that something else was behind the pandemic. Germany figures Another protester said he wanted Germany\u2019s current political system abolished and a return to the constitution of 1871 on the grounds that the country\u2019s postwar political system was illegal. Providing only his first name, Karl-Heinz, he said he had travelled with his sister from their home near the Dutch border to attend the protest and believed that the coronavirus cases being reported in Germany now were false positives. Germany has seen an upswing in new cases in recent weeks. The country\u2019s disease control agency reported on Saturday that Germany had recorded almost 1,500 new infections over the past day. Germany has been praised for its handling of the pandemic, and the country\u2019s death toll of some 9,300 people is less than a quarter of the amount of people who have died of Covid-19 in Britain. Opinion polls show overwhelming support for the prevention measures imposed by authorities, such as the requirement to wear masks on public transport, in stores and some public buildings such as libraries and schools. Along the route were several smaller counter-protests where participants shouted slogans against the far-right\u2019s presence at the anti-mask rally. \u201cI think there\u2019s a line and if someone takes to the streets with neo-Nazis, then they\u2019ve crossed that line,\u201d said Verena, a counter-protester from Berlin who declined to provide her surname. In London, hundreds of people crowded into Trafalgar Square for a Unite for Freedom protest against government lockdown restrictions and the wearing of face masks. The Metropolitan police warned demonstrators that anyone attending a gathering of more than 30 people may be at risk of committing a criminal offence.

State Premier and prominent Green politician Winfried Kretschmann conceded that cases of full-face veiling in schools were\u00a0rare, but said that nonetheless, a legal ruling was necessary for the rare cases. Kretschmann said that full-face veiling did not belong in a free society. But he added that such a ban at the university level, where students are adults, was a more complex question. For now,\u00a0the rule in Baden-Wurttemberg will only apply to primary and secondary education. Read more: German authorities, politicians divided on niqab, burqa ban Controversial debate splits the Green party Proponents of full-face bans in Germany say they are necessary to protect young girls, that forcing or encouraging them to wear them infringes on their rights. Prominent members of conservative parties, including Julia Kl\u00f6ckner in Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), have called for a nationwide full-face veil ban. The Greens have been split on the issue, but in the case of school kids in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, they sided with the CDU. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Green party leaders Sandra Detzer and Oliver Hildenbrand have previously referred to the burqa and the niqab \"symbols of oppression.\" Read more: Where are 'burqa bans' in Europe? But opponents say that such rulings can lead to the marginalization of Muslim communities in Germany. A school\u00a0student in Hamburg recently fought and won a legal battle allowing her to wear the attire, though the court noted that a ban might be possible if the state's school laws were altered, which local politicians are now working on. Filiz Polat, migration policy spokesperson for the Greens'\u00a0 federal parliamentary group,\u00a0has said that the freedom to wear religious symbols or not was one of the features of a democratic society. Currently, full-face veils have been banned in neighboring countries such as The Netherlands, France, Denmark and Austria. A 2019 YouGov poll released found that 54% of respondents in Germany would support a ban on burqas. jcg\/msh (epd, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement","question":"What did the government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ban in schools in July 2020?","answer":"The government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg banned full-face coverings, such as burqas and niqabs, for all school children in primary and secondary education.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" Answer: In July 2020, the government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a state in Germany, banned the use of certain full-face coverings, such as burqas and niqabs, in schools.

Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has extended and tightened the country's coronavirus lockdown as its death toll surpassed 35,000. The leader made the announcement after meeting with the country's 16 state governors to decide on the length of a possible continuation and to what extent schools will reopen. The state and federal governments agreed most non-food shops, bars, restaurants, cultural and leisure facilities and schools will remain closed, as well as new rules being brought in, Merkel said. \"We must further reduce our social contacts in order to fight\" the pandemic, the Chancellor added. The lockdown measures currently in place initially took effect on December 16, after a partial lockdown failed to calm case numbers, and were set to expire on January 10. Now, under even tighter new rules, people in areas that are considered hotspots for the virus will not be allowed to travel over 15 km from their homes without a good reason. And those arriving in the country that have come from a destination deemed to be high risk will have to provide two negative test results, with a mandatory five-day quarantine even in cases where the first test is negative. The restrictions in meetings in private will be limited to one other person from outside the household. On Tuesday, Germany\u2019s disease control agency said 11,897 more coronavirus cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours, up from 9,847 registered on Monday. This puts the country fifth in a tally of COVID-19 infections in Western Europe, behind the UK, France, Italy, and Spain. At least 944 deaths were reported on Tuesday, taking the official coronavirus death toll to 35,518, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). However, the agency said delays in reporting over the festive period could have affected the figures. Vaccinations against COVID-19 kicked off in Germany on December 26 and, in the nation of 83 million, nearly 265,000 vaccinations had been reported by Monday, RKI said. Germany has carried out a relatively fast vaccination rollout compared to many of the other EU27 member states. But it has faced criticism that it has failed to procure enough vaccine doses to speed up the nationwide campaign amid the high infections and hospitalisations. France, for example, inoculated just 516 people in the first week since the vaccine was delivered. One reason for the delay is that France took a more cautious strategy to vaccinations, requiring a pre-vaccination visit and the express consent of the person being vaccinated, according to experts. The EU bloc itself was also facing increased pressure to justify its COVID-19 vaccine plan, with member countries complaining about a lack of doses and a slow rollout. Markus S\u00f6der, the minister-President of Bavaria - Germany's largest region - described the European Commission\u2019s process for buying and approving the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine as \"inadequate\", in an interview with German tabloid Bild am Sonntag. But Merkel said she supported the bloc's policy of securing vaccines for all 27 countries, adding it didn't make sense for Germany to try and get jabs on its own. Along with the Netherlands, Germany is investigating delaying giving out second doses of its coronavirus vaccines in an effort to inoculate more people. Two jabs are required for the highest-possible immunity - the European Medicines Agency (EMA) says the second dose should be given with six weeks of the first to ensure maximum protection. But with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the only jab to have got EMA approval so far, offering short-term efficacy from the first dose, some scientists have suggested a longer gap between doses.

AfD leaders have faced problems with some of the group's past activities. https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/4p4kr The JA has long been a thorn in the side for the party leadership of the AfD Image: Sebastian Kahnert\/dpa\/picture alliance Advertisement The party leadership of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday voted to replace its \"Young Alternative\" (JA) group with a new one under\u00a0greater party oversight. The decision, ahead of the early February 23 parliamentary election , comes after Germany's domestic intelligence service classified the JA as a confirmed extremist movement . What changes are planned? The JA is relatively independent. Members of the association \u2014\u00a0with the exception of the board members \u2014\u00a0do not have to be in the AfD. That would not be possible in the new organization, except for under-16s, who would not yet be able to join the AfD as members. The board's proposal was approved after a lively debate at a two-day party conference in the eastern German town of Riesa, having achieved the two-thirds majority required for the rule change. Board members have suggested the name \"Patriotic Youth\" for the organization. A now-adopted change in the statutes stipulates that the youth organization's activities \"must not contradict the order and principles of the party.\" It says the AfD and its youth organization \u2014 for members up to the age of 36 \u2014 should \"promote each other's activities to the best of their ability.\" The party leadership has long been dissatisfied with the JA, saying its difficult-to-control activities could bring the entire party into disrepute. Germany's BfV domestic intelligence services in 2023 said it had found indications that there was enough evidence that the JA had aspirations against the free democratic basic order for it to be treated as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization. German protesters block far-right AfD congress To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The AfD leadership hopes that the reform will give it more control over misconduct in the JA. Experts also see the motivation as being that the AfD Youth, if it is no longer an independent association, would be better protected from any possible ban. The BfV is monitoring the national AfD party as a suspected right-wing extremist group, with several state-level party organizations already having classified as such. How optimistic is the AfD about its electoral prospects? On Saturday, the party's 600-odd delegates approved co-leader Alice Weidel as the AfD's chancellor candidate ahead of the general election. The vote caps an eventful week for Weidel, who on Thursday was hosted by Donald Trump ally and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk for a wide-ranging livestream on his X social media platform. The AfD is in\u00a0second place in opinion polls, averaging 20% percent, while one survey on Saturday gave them 22%. The conservative CDU\/CSU is leading at 31% while Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats are battling for third place with their Green coalition partners on 15% and 14% respectively. In her speech, Weidel bashed the CDU\/CSU, branding them a \"party of cheats\" and adding that her goal was to overtake them.

The suspect, a former asylum-seeker who was supposed to be leaving Germany, was arrested. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that authorities must clear up why the suspect was still in the country. He said the attack, a month before a national election in which curbing irregular migration is a major issue , must have consequences. The attack occurred just before noon in a park in Aschaffenburg, a city of about 72,000 people. Bavaria\u2019s top security official, Joachim Herrmann, said the assailant attacked the boy, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, with a kitchen knife. He said the 2-year-old of Moroccan origin was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who was passing by and appeared to have intervened to protect the other children. Bavarian officials said two adults and a 2-year-old Syrian girl were injured and taken to a hospital for treatment, and none of their lives were in danger. Other passers-by chased the suspect and he was arrested 12 minutes after the attack, Herrmann said. RELATED COVERAGE A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Russia claims its deadly attack on Ukraine\u2019s Sumy targeted military forces as condemnation grows He said the suspect, a 28-year-old Afghan national, had come to authorities\u2019 attention at least three times because of acts of violence. On each occasion, he was sent for psychiatric treatment and later released. The suspect is believed to have arrived in Germany in November 2022 and applied for asylum in early 2023, Herrmann said. On Dec. 4, he told authorities that he would leave the country voluntarily and would seek papers from the Afghan consulate. A week later, German authorities formally closed asylum proceedings and told him to leave. Police will work over the coming days to identify his motive, Herrmann said, adding that suspicions so far point to his psychiatric illness. A first search of his room at a refugee home found no evidence that he had radical Islamic views, and only turned up medicine that would fit with his psychiatric treatment, he said. The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany\u2019s national election. Scholz issued a strongly-worded statement condemning what he called \u201can incomprehensible act of terror.\u201d \u201cI am tired of such acts of violence happening here every few weeks \u2014 by perpetrators who came to us to find protection here,\u201d he said. \u201cMistaken tolerance is inappropriate here.

He didn\u2019t elaborate. Following a knife attack by an Afghan immigrant in Mannheim in May that left a police officer dead and four more people injured, Scholz vowed that Germany would start deporting criminals from Afghanistan and Syria again. He vowed to step up deportations of rejected asylum-seekers following a knife attack in Solingen in August in which a suspected Islamic extremist from Syria is accused of killing three people. At the end of August, Germany deported Afghan nationals to their homeland for the first time since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. ___ Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report.","question":"What was the political context surrounding the knife attack in Aschaffenburg in January 2025?","answer":"The attack occurred a month before Germany's national election, where curbing irregular migration was a major issue.

Photo-Illustration: Wired Staff\/Getty Save this story Save Save this story Save On Thursday, Elon Musk agreed with the leader of a far-right German political party that Adolf Hitler was a communist and that left-wing groups who support Palestinian causes have more in common with Nazis than with her own party. The deeply weird and disinformation-filled conversation between Musk and Alice Weidel, the leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), took place on X. It came after weeks of Musk\u2019s efforts to boost the far-right party, which has deep links to neo-Nazism and has been surveilled for suspected extremism by Germany\u2019s own intelligence services. \u201c[Hitler] was a communist, and he considered himself as a socialist,\u201d Weidel said in response to Musk asking about media reports linking the AfD to Nazism. \u201cThe biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite,\u201d Weidel said. \u201cHe wasn't a conservative, he wasn't a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Musk responded. In his autobiography Mein Kampf , Hitler\u2014who as leader of the German Reich was responsible for the invasion of the Soviet Union and the enslavement and death of millions of its citizens\u2014repeatedly describes communism as an enemy of the German nation. He believed that Marxism was a Jewish conspiracy to control Germany and the world. Weidel also compared the Nazi Party\u2019s views to those of modern-day left-wing political groups who support Palestine in the face of what a UN commission has called crimes against humanity conducted by Israel . While her AfD colleagues were last month seen attending a secretive meeting organized by former members of a militant neo-Nazi group known for burning the Israeli flag, she said, \u201cThe AfD is the \u200b\u200bonly protector of the Jewish people here in Germany.\u201d Weidel is the AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor in Germany\u2019s snap elections, which take place next month. As someone who previously worked in finance and lives in Switzerland with her wife, who is from Sri Lanka, and their children, she has been presented as a relatively moderate face for the party. This is something Musk picked up on in an op-ed he penned last month for a German newspaper. \"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cDoes that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\u201d Ahead of the conversation on Thursday, the EU said that it would be monitoring the event to see if it was artificially promoted to voters in Germany, something which would be in violation of the region\u2019s sweeping Digital Service Act rules. A European Commission spokesperson told WIRED it would not be commenting on the contents of the livestream. Weidel referenced the EU\u2019s preoccupation with the conversation, claiming 150 officials at the EU commission were listening in, then claimed the DSA was a censorship tool, before adding: \u201cYou know what Adolf Hitler did? He switched off free speech. He controlled the media, and without that he would have never been successful.\u201d \u201cYes, exactly,\u201d Musk responded. The conversation, which was billed as an interview but was more of a love-in, hit virtually event major culture war topic, from the war in Ukraine, where Weidel suggested European government\u2019s lack of strategy would push Russia toward nuclear war, to immigration, where Musk wildly claimed that \u201con the Mexican side of the border in the US is a giant pile of discarded passports and drivers\u2019 licenses, like a huge pile.\u201d It was unclear what Musk was talking about, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk also claimed that \u201cbasically theft is legal in California\u201d and said that the only thing that would slow down what \u201cthe influx of criminals\u201d were stealing is \u201cif your back hurts from carrying out all the goods.\u201d The centibillionaire\u2019s interest in German politics, and the AfD in particular, appear to have been largely informed by a single X user, Naomi Seibt, a 24-year-old German influencer who rose to prominence by posting climate change and Covid-19 denial content. After she posted an image of herself in June saying she had voted for the AfD in last year\u2019s European elections, Musk shared her post, asking: \u201cWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?\u201d He then slid into her DMs, Seibt told Reuters . \"I explained to him the AfD is not similar to the Nazi ideology or Hitler but is like the 19th century liberal nationalist movement ... because they wanted to be free from authoritarians in their own territory,\" Seibt told the outlet. Musk engaged with the 24-year-old 40 more times before sharing one of her posts on December 20 with the comment: \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany.\u201d A week later an op-ed with Musk\u2019s byline appeared in the German Welt am Samstag newspaper claiming that the AfD was the \u201clast spark of hope\u201d for Germany. Musk repeated his endorsement during the livestream, saying, \u201cI think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person, and hopefully people can tell just from this conversation. Nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s endorsement of Weidel and the AfD will have any material impact on the outcome of the election. \u201cIn the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,\u201d Manfred G\u00fcllner, the head of the Forsa Institute, told Politico . \u201cI don\u2019t see very much potential for future change, because Musk has become a negative figure.\u201d","question":"How did Elon Musk describe Alice Weidel and the AfD during their livestream conversation?","answer":"Musk described Weidel as a \"very reasonable person\" and called the AfD the \"last spark of hope\" for Germany.","region":"Germany","model_answer":" Answer: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time or post-training events such as specific livestream conversations, including any remarks made by Elon Musk about Alice Weidel or the AfD.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government notified the European Union\u2019s executive commission of the extension to Sept. 15. \u201cWith the border controls, we are pushing irregular migration down successfully. The figures prove this,\u201d he said. Germany turned back 47,000 people back at its borders, seeing one-third fewer asylum requests year-on-year and arresting 1,900 smugglers. The country was already controlling its borders with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland before it extended the checks last September to its remaining borders, with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.

Germany\u2019s center-left governing parties have cast doubt on whether conservative leader Friedrich Merz can still be trusted not to bring the far-right Alternative for Germany , or AfD, into government after Wednesday\u2019s events. He insists that he didn\u2019t and won\u2019t work with it, and that he didn\u2019t break a political consensus, often called a \u201cfirewall,\u201d to shun the party. But Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Merz made \u201can inexcusable mistake.\u201d Merz, determined to show his center-right Union bloc\u2019s commitment to cutting irregular migration after a deadly knife attack last week by a rejected asylum-seeker, put a nonbinding motion to parliament calling for Germany to turn back many more migrants at its borders, although it might need AfD\u2019s backing to pass. The measure squeaked through thanks to the far-right party\u2019s support. Polls show Merz\u2019s Union leading ahead of the Feb. 23 election with around 30% support, while AfD is second with about 20%, and Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democrats and their remaining coalition partners, the Greens, are further back.

Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Merkel, a former leader of Merz\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, noted in a rare statement that Merz had said in November that no measures should be passed with AfD\u2019s support before the Feb. 23 election. She said she supported that position but \u201cI think it was wrong no longer to feel committed to this proposal and, on Jan. 29, to enable with open eyes for the first time a majority with votes from AfD in a vote in the German parliament.\u201d Merkel added that \u201call democratic parties\u201d must work together \u2014 \u201cnot as a tactical maneuver,\u201d and while respecting European Union law \u2014 to do everything to prevent attacks such as last week\u2019s and others in recent months in which the suspects were immigrants. Merz took over the CDU after Merkel, a former rival, stepped down as chancellor in 2021. A more conservative figure, he has taken a more restrictive stance on migration. He said last week that Germany has had a \u201cmisguided asylum and immigration policy\u201d for a decade \u2014 since Merkel allowed large numbers of migrants into the country. Merkel has largely kept a low profile since leaving office, doesn\u2019t usually comment on day-to-day politics and is no longer actively influential in her party. However, her intervention could be problematic for Merz. Merz appears to hope that he will gain support by making the Union look decisive in forcing a tougher approach to migration, blunting the appeal of the anti-immigration AfD, while making center-left Scholz and the Greens look weak. It\u2019s uncertain whether that will succeed. AfD lawmakers celebrated after Wednesday\u2019s vote while others sat stony-faced. Merz said he had sought a majority in the \u201cdemocratic center\u201d and he regretted that didn\u2019t happen. But he also insisted that \u201ca correct decision doesn\u2019t become wrong because the wrong people approve it.\u201d On Friday, the Union plans to call a vote on months-old proposed legislation that calls for an end to family reunions for migrants with a protection status that falls short of asylum. The measure also could pass with AfD votes, though it would need approval from parliament\u2019s upper house, which is uncertain. This week\u2019s events soured the political atmosphere and may complicate efforts to form a coalition after the election, which could leave Merz needing center-left parties to take power. Wolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the Berlin Social Science Center, said they were a \u201cbreach of the informal firewall\u201d and a \u201ctoxic intervention by Merz and the CDU,\u201d which may help them in this election but are likely to have negative effects in the longer term.

At least 37 people were injured when a car was driven into a crowd of people at a trade union rally. The driver was a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, police said, identified in local media as Farhad N. He was arrested at the scene and prosecutors say he has admitted to carrying out the attack. He appeared to have a religious motivation, officials said. The mother and child were among those taken to hospital with serious injuries following the attack. \"Unfortunately, we have to confirm the deaths today of the two-year-old child and her 37-year-old mother,\" police spokesman Ludwig Waldinger told the AFP news agency on Saturday. The car ramming has brought security issues back into focus the week before federal elections are held in Germany. A series of attacks have been carried out in Munich by immigrants, with two of the alleged attackers coming from Afghanistan. The attack also occurred on the eve of the Munich Security Conference, which began on Friday. Upon arrival in the city on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance expressed his condolences to the victims in the attack. What we know about suspected car attack in Munich Car ramming comes as migration at forefront of German elections Authorities have said the suspect arrived in Germany in 2016 and, although his application for asylum was turned down, he was allowed to stay in Germany as he faced risks being deported back to Afghanistan. He had a valid residence and work permit. He had no previous criminal record, and police said there was no evidence of a link to a jihadist group. He also appears to have acted alone, German authorities say. On Friday, police said the suspect told officers during questioning that he had driven his Mini Cooper car intentionally into the crowd. Munich public prosecutor Gabriele Tilmann told reporters that the suspect had said \"Allahu Akbar\" - God is greatest in Arabic - when he was detained. She suggested he \"may have had an Islamist motivation\". Campaigning around Germany's election on 23 February has for weeks been embroiled in a fevered debate about migration. It was called due to the collapse of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government last year. A number of violent incidents linked to migrants over the past year have led to increased support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In December, six people were killed and at least 299 injured after a man drove a car into a German Christmas market . The suspect was a 50-year-old Saudi asylum seeker who had been an outspoken critic of Islam. And in January an attack that shocked the country saw a two-year-old child and a passer-by who attempted to intervene killed after a group of children were stabbed in a park in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg.

The attack took place on Friday evening, with the assailant approaching the 30-year-old victim from behind before stabbing him and fleeing the scene. A man was arrested nearby after police noticed blood stains on his hands and clothing. The suspect was carrying a prayer rug, a copy of the Quran, and the suspected weapon in his backpack, suggesting \"a religious motivation\", police said. After being taken to hospital with serious wounds to his neck, the victim underwent an operation and was put into an induced coma, but his life is no longer in danger. Police say they are examining possible connections to the current Middle East conflict - but said there is currently no evidence of links to any groups or individuals. They are also investigating whether the suspect is suffering from mental illness. He had no prior criminal record and was not known to the police, they added. Six people who witnessed the attack are receiving counselling from local authorities. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser described the attack as an \"abhorrent and brutal crime\" for which the suspect \"must be punished with the full force of the law\". \"We will use all means to deport violent offenders back to Syria,\" she said. Several stabbing and car-ramming attacks have taken place in Germany in recent months, in the cities of Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich. All of the alleged attackers were migrants. Immigration has become a core issue for voters ahead of federal elections taking place on Sunday.

Hours after the attack in the German capital, Swedish police said they had apprehended three men near the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, on suspicion of preparing to commit violent crime.

Sometimes they look chic and sometimes shabby. But can these sandals be considered art? That\u2019s the question Germany\u2019s Federal Court of Justice wrestled with Thursday, and it ruled they\u2019re just comfy footwear . Birkenstock, which is headquartered in Linz am Rhein, Germany, and says its tradition of shoemaking goes back to 1774, filed a lawsuit against three competitors who sold sandals that were very similar to its own. The shoe manufacturer claimed its sandals \u201care copyright-protected works of applied art\u201d that may not be imitated. Under German law, works of art enjoy stronger and longer-lasting intellectual property protections than consumer products. The company asked for an injunction to stop its competitors from making copycat sandals and order them to recall and destroy those already on the market. The defendant companies were not identified in the court statement. Before Germany\u2019s highest court for civil trials weighed in Thursday, the case had been heard at two lower courts, which disagreed on the issue.

The 24-hour walkout, which started at midnight on Sunday, involves public-sector employees at the airports as well as ground and security staff. At Frankfurt Airport, 1,054 of the day\u2019s 1,116 scheduled takeoffs and landings had been canceled, German news agency dpa reported, citing airport traffic management. All of Berlin Airport\u2019s regular departures and arrivals were canceled, while Hamburg Airport said no departures would be possible.

At the smaller Weeze and Karlsruhe\/Baden-Baden airports, only security workers were called out.

{"year":"2025","month":"02","event_desc":"The AfD becomes the strongest party in the East, securing all five former East German states.","text":"Germany's conservatives celebrate, but far right enjoy record result 24 February 2025 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor in Berlin Share Save Watch: Friedrich Merz thanks voters after German election victory Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won Germany's election, well ahead of rival parties but short of the 30% vote-share they had expected. \"Let's celebrate tonight and in the morning, we'll get to work,\" he told cheering supporters. His immediate priority is to try to form a government with the third-placed Social Democrats of Olaf Scholz. Even before the result was clear, Merz said his top priority was unity in Europe, so that \"step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US\". The other big winner in Sunday's vote was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who are celebrating a record second-place result of 20.8%. The AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, did a victory lap of her supporters, but even her party had hoped for a greater result and the mood at AfD HQ was subdued. Merz, 69, has never held a ministerial job, but he has promised if he becomes the next German chancellor to show leadership in Europe and beef up support for Ukraine. Most Germans have been shocked by President Donald Trump's conduct towards Ukraine and Europe and Friedrich Merz said the US leader had shown \"the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe\". Trump has labelled Ukraine's leader a \"dictator\" and two of his leading figures have openly backed the AfD in the run-up to the vote. Vice-President JD Vance was accused of meddling in the vote during a visit to Munich, while billionaire Elon Musk has made repeated remarks on his X platform. LIVE: Merz calls for security independence from the US Germany's election winner signals seismic shift in transatlantic relations Big challenges ahead for Merz in divided Germany Merz: Risk-taker who flirted with far right Friedrich Merz's first priority will be to try to form a coalition made up of his Christian Democrats (and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU) and Scholz's centre left, despite the Social Democrats' worst-ever showing of 16.4%. Merz's CDU party leadership will meet on Monday and so will the Social Democrat SPD's, separately, but Scholz will not take part in the talks. Merz is keen to form a government by Easter. It could be possible, because between the two parties, they have 328 seats, a majority of 12 in the 630-seat parliament. But it was not until the early hours of Monday that that became clear. After the collapse of Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition late last year, Merz had asked the electorate for a strong mandate to form a clear-cut coalition with one other party. In the event, he secured enough seats only because two of the smaller parties failed to get into parliament. A two-party coalition would enable him to solve as many of Germany's problems as he could in four years, he said, from a stagnant economy to closing its borders to irregular migrants. German voters had other ideas. They came out in big numbers, with a 83% turnout not seen since before reunification in 1990. Merz's Christian Democrats had been looking for more than the 28.6% of the vote they and their Bavarian sister party received. His most likely partner was always going to be the Social Democrats - known in Germany as a GroKo, or grand coalition. But Germany's electorate has fractured, and the two big beasts of its post-war politics can no longer be sure of success. The AfD under Alice Weidel enjoyed a 10-point increase in support on four years ago, their support boosted by anger over high prices and a series of deadly attacks in German cities. Three took place during the election campaign. Weidel also benefited from a successful TikTok campaign that drew in big numbers of young voters. As results came in during the early hours of Monday, it became clear the AfD was far ahead of the other parties in the east, with a projected 34%, according to a survey for public broadcaster ZDF. \"Germans have voted for change,\" said Weidel. She said Friedrich Merz's attempt to forge a coalition would ultimately end in failure: \"We'll have fresh elections - I don't think we'll have to wait another four years.\" But just as the election map turned light blue in the east, much of the rest of Germany turned black - the colour of the CDU. And Merz dismissed the rise of the AfD out of hand. \"The party only exists because there have been problems that haven't been solved. They're happy if these problems get worse and worse.\" \"We need to solve the problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\" Merz was equally withering towards the new Trump administration. President Trump did welcome Merz's victory. He said it was proof that Germans were, like Americans, tired of \"the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration\". If it was an overture, Merz did not take it as one. He told a round-table TV discussion on Sunday night that the interventions from Washington had been \"no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow\". Last week, Trump appeared to accuse Kyiv of starting the war which Russia unleashed on its neighbour exactly three years ago. Merz's victory was quickly welcomed by leaders across much of Europe. France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of uniting at a time of uncertainty to \"face the major challenges of the world and our continent\", while the UK's Sir Keir Starmer sought to \"enhance our joint security and deliver growth for both our countries\". Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats continue to rely on older voters for their success, while voters aged 18-24 appear to be far more interested in both the AfD and another party, the Left, which surged in the polls in recent weeks. Not long ago, the Left was heading out of the parliament, with poll numbers well below the 5% threshold. But a series of TikTok videos showing co-leader Heidi Reichinnek giving fiery speeches in parliament went viral and they ended up close to 9%, and a quarter of the younger vote, according to an ARD survey.

In the context of Germany, the pandemic brought urgent health and economic challenges to the forefront, which shaped the priorities and discussions between the parties. Both parties had to address how they would manage the public health crisis, support economic recovery, and handle the increased financial burdens on the city's budget.

For CDU leader, and Germany's next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, getting the debt brake reform passed before taking office amounts to\u00a0a big win. The CDU is in coalition talks with the SPD, and hopes to get a coalition government on its feet by the end of April. After the CDU came out on top in last month's general election, Merz went on television and warned that the administration of US President Donald Trump was largely \"indifferent\" to the fate of Europe , and that Germany must act quickly to bolster its defense capabilities. Merz was responding to major shifts in transatlantic ties under Trump, who has embraced Russian narratives on the war in Ukraine, while calling into question Washington's commitment to European security. \"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.

The post of speaker \u2014 in protocol terms Germany\u2019s second-highest, behind the president and ahead of the chancellor \u2014 traditionally goes to the strongest group in parliament\u2019s lower house , or Bundestag. After the Feb. 23 election , that is the center-right Union bloc of the country\u2019s likely next leader, Friedrich Merz . Merz\u2019s choice was Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, 52, who was agriculture minister from 2018 to 2021 in then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s final government. Lawmakers elected her by 382 votes to 204, with 31 abstentions. Kl\u00f6ckner promised lawmakers she would carry out her duties in a \u201cnon-partisan, calm and undaunted\u201d way. The atmosphere in the Bundestag has become considerably more heated since the far-right Alternative for Germany , or AfD, first won seats in 2017. It finished second in last month\u2019s election, doubling its share of the vote to 20.8%, and now holds 152 of the 630 seats. \u201cThere is a very clear yardstick for me: decency,\u201d Kl\u00f6ckner said. \u201cWe must conduct and endure controversial discourse ... according to clear rules,\u201d she added. \u201cI will take care that we deal with each other in a civilized way \u2014 and if we don\u2019t do that, learn to.\u201d  According to parliamentary rules, other parties are each supposed to get a deputy speaker, but their candidates must win a majority of lawmakers. In its eight years in parliament, a majority has balked at every candidate AfD has proposed. On Tuesday, the Bundestag snubbed AfD lawmaker Gerold Otten, who failed to win more than 190 votes. It\u2019s not clear when the Bundestag will be able to elect a new chancellor. Merz is still in talks to form a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Scholz and his Cabinet received their dismissal certificates from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Tuesday. But as is customary, Steinmeier tasked the government to stay in office on a caretaker basis until a new chancellor is in place.   Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Thomas Niedermueller\/dpa via AP, File) By KIRSTEN GRIESHABER Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Police were executing raids in six German states Wednesday against a group that authorities say \u201cis part of an international network whose aim is to overthrow the government in Eritrea.\u201d Germany\u2019s federal prosecutor\u2019s office is accusing 17 suspects of founding or being members of the German branch of Brigade N\u2019Hamedu, which it defines as a terrorist organization. Eritrea has long been described as one of the world\u2019s most repressive countries by human rights groups, and some members of its divided diaspora have clashed violently at times. The prosecutors said the investigations \u201csuggest that the suspects assumed senior positions\u201d within the group. The German offshoot has been active since at least 2022 was involved in violence at events connected to the Eritrean government. The prosecutor\u2019s office said the organization coordinated violent riots at Eritrea festivals in Giessen on Aug. 20, 2022, and on Aug. 7-8, 2023, as well as the seminar of an Eritrean association in Stuttgart on Sept. 16, 2023 . Numerous police officers were injured at the events, some of them seriously, and dozens of protesters were detained. The state interior minister of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which includes Stuttgart, said that 56 people were sentenced to prison following the riots in the city in 2023, though some of those sentences can still be appealed, German news agency dpa reported. RELATED COVERAGE Police in central Germany hunt for a suspect on the run after 2 people were shot dead A man slipped into a VIP convoy and hugged the German chancellor in 2023. Now he has to pay a fine German parliament expected to meet May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the new chancellor Prosecutors also say that some members of the association considered violence against German state institutions and police officers to be legitimate. More than 200 federal and state police officers searched 19 properties \u2014 eight in Hesse, four in North Rhine-Westphalia, three in Bavaria, two in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and one each in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Rhineland-Palatinate. Another search took place in Denmark at the same time, dpa reported. No arrests have been made. The prosecutor\u2019s statement also noted that another person who is suspected of holding a senior position within Brigade N\u2019Hamedu in the Netherlands and Germany \u201chas recently been sentenced by a Dutch court to a prison term of several years on account of his participation in clashes in The Hague\u201d last February. The prosecutor\u2019s office did not identify any of the accused by name, in line with German privacy rules. Separately, a court in Sweden jailed six people on Wednesday for violent rioting in connection with an Eritrean cultural festival in 2023, Swedish news agency TT reported. Five people were sentenced to five months in prison, while a sixth person was sentenced to six months in prison, according to TT. At the time, hundreds of anti-government protesters stormed the festival. More than 50 people were injured and nearly 140 people were detained, TT reported. As in German, Sweden is home to tens of thousands of people with Eritrean roots. The festival devoted to the cultural heritage of Eritrea is an annual event that has been held since the 1990s but has been criticized for allegedly serving as a promotional tool and source of money for the African nation\u2019s government, according to Swedish media. Exiles have attacked several festivals held by Eritrea\u2019s diaspora in Europe, North America and Israel in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Eritrea over the years, many setting off into the deserts of Sudan and then North Africa in attempts to reach Europe.

Support for Merz's conservative CDU\/CSU bloc, which won the February 23 election, fell by five percentage points to 24% while the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained three points to land on 25%, according to the Ipsos institute's poll. Sign up here. The AfD came second in the election, the best performance by a far-right party since World War Two. Its polling strength is a setback for Merz's conservative alliance, which wanted to win back voters from the party. The Ipsos poll showed support for outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) unchanged at 15%. The centre-left SPD are in talks with the CDU\/CSU to form Germany's next government, with the two sides forced to iron out their differences in policy areas such as tax and migration to keep the far right out of power. The talks are expected to conclude later on Wednesday, sources told Reuters. AfD leader Alice Weidel hailed her party's polling breakthrough in a post on X. \"The people want political change - and not a 'business as usual' coalition of CDU\/CSU and SPD,\" she wrote.

Merz, 69, said their agreement sent \"a strong and clear signal\" to Germans and the EU that they would get \"a strong government capable of action\". Germany was already in recession before it was buffeted by economic turbulence, caused by US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. \"The key message to Donald Trump is Germany is back on track,\" said the chancellor-in-waiting, promising to fulfil defence commitments and revive economic competitiveness. Follow live updates as China and EU hit back at Trump tariffs Merz and his coalition partners have been under intense pressure to put an end to Germany's political limbo since his Christian Democrats won federal elections in February. He has also just seen his party overtaken in an opinion poll by the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD). Announcing the government deal, Merz promised to reform and stabilise Germany, with a focus on migration, the economy and defence. \"Europe can rely on Germany,\" he said, promising \"a strong plan to bring our country to the forefront again\". He will have to wait for the week starting 5 May for the new parliament to elect him as chancellor, but should have no problem with a 13-seat majority. The coalition parties had already signalled their urgency last month, when they pushed through significant reform of Germany's strict debt rules. Such changes mean the new government will be able to plough significant investment into the military and the country's crumbling infrastructure. Included in Wednesday's agreement were a series of measures to \"control and largely end irregular migration\", and impose border controls aimed at addressing one of the big concerns of voters in the February election. The AfD complained that the plans did not go far enough, accusing Merz of capitulating to the Social Democrats. In a recent report to parliament, Germany's armed forces commissioner highlighted dramatic shortages in the military across the board, from ammunition and soldier numbers to dilapidated barracks. Another significant part of the coalition deal is for defence spending to be increased, and for boosting the strength of the military. Although there will be no conscription, Merz said the coalition was aiming to follow a \"Swedish model\" of voluntary military service. \"We hope that with enough volunteers, we will also be able to achieve an expansion of the Bundeswehr [German armed forces],\" he said. Merz also promised \"comprehensive support\" to Ukraine. Germany leads defiance of Trump car tariffs, saying it \"will not give in\" Germany decides to leave history behind and prepare for war Merz clinches package to revamp defence and infrastructure Although his government will feature almost entirely new names - Merz himself has never been a cabinet minister - there will be continuity at the defence ministry. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, is expected to remain in post. This will be the fifth so-called grand coalition (GroKo) - involving the big parties of the centre right and centre left since World War Two - but the parties were at pains to say it would not be like any previous government. With Germany in economic recession, though, one leading politician on the populist left, Sahra Wagenknecht, said they offered no answer either to Germany's economic crisis or the trade war. She said Germany was threatened with a third and fourth year in recession, which she dubbed \"Merzession\". Merz said he was confident that the coalition deal would be approved by their respective parties and they would be able to get to work in early May. Meanwhile, an Ipsos poll on Wednesday put Merz's conservatives in second place on 24% support, a point behind Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose co-leader Alice Weidel hailed the survey as unprecedented, and promised that \"political change will come\".

Ihnen seien mehr als die 63 Prozent der Aktien des MDax-Konzerns angeboten worden, die sie als Mindestschwelle f\u00fcr die Umsetzung der Transaktion angegeben haben, teilte Stada am Donnerstag mit und best\u00e4tigte damit entsprechende Informationen von manager-magazin.de. Die Bieter, die sich f\u00fcr die Offerte in der \"Nidda Healthcare Holding AG\" zusammengeschlossen haben, pr\u00e4zisierten die Angabe sp\u00e4ter auf 63,85 Prozent. Damit ist eine der spektakul\u00e4rsten \u00dcbernahmeschlachten in Deutschland der vergangenen Jahre beendet. Bain Capital und Cinven waren mit ihrem ersten Anlauf vor rund zwei Monaten gescheitert und hatten danach die Mindestannahmeschwelle von 67,5 Prozent gesenkt sowie den Angebotspreis um 25 Cents auf 66,25 Euro erh\u00f6ht. Ein m\u00f6glichst gro\u00dfes Aktienpaket ist f\u00fcr die Investoren wichtig, um ihre strategischen Vorstellungen so ungebremst wie m\u00f6glich durchsetzen zu k\u00f6nnen. In den kommenden Wochen steht nun eine weitgehende Neubesetzung der Spitzengremien an. Stadas Vorstandsvorsitzender Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink hatte schon bei seinem Amtsantritt vor wenigen Wochen erkl\u00e4rt, nur f\u00fcr eine \u00dcbergangsphase zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stehen. Auch Aufsichtsratschef Carl Ferdinand Oetker wird keine lange Zukunft zugetraut. An der B\u00f6rse kam die Nachricht vom erfolgreichen Angebot gut an: Stada-Aktien B\u00f6rsen-Chart zeigen schossen zeitweise um mehr als 14 Prozent auf \u00fcber 73 Euro. H\u00e4ndler begr\u00fcndeten die Kurs-Rally vor allem mit Eindeckungen von Leerverk\u00e4ufen: Spekulative Anleger, die mit geliehenen Stada-Aktien auf fallende Kurse gesetzt hatten, mussten diese Aktien nun am Markt zur\u00fcckkaufen. Das trieb den Stada-Kurs steil nach oben. Viele Marktteilnehmer d\u00fcrften zudem auf einen Sondergewinn durch einen Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabf\u00fchrungsvertrag hoffen, der ab einer Schwelle von 75 Prozent m\u00f6glich ist, sagte ein H\u00e4ndler. Sollte sie im ersten Schritt noch nicht erreicht worden sein, w\u00e4re es in einer Verl\u00e4ngerungsfrist immer noch m\u00f6glich. Schlie\u00dflich sei es dann auch nur noch eine Frage der Zeit, bis Bain und Cinven nach dem Kauf weiterer Anteile mit dem Ausschluss der Minderheitsaktion\u00e4re (Squeeze Out) beg\u00e4nnen. 5,3 Milliarden schweres Stada-Angebot galt als Test 8 \u00dcbernahmen: Die gr\u00f6\u00dften Private-Equity-Deals Vor dem ersten und zweiten Angebot hatten jeweils scharfe Konflikte in der Unternehmensf\u00fchrung das Unternehmen und den Verkaufsprozess belastet. So mussten etwa vor wenigen Wochen der damalige Vorstandschef Matthias Wiedenfels sowie sein Finanzvorstand Helmut Kraft das Unternehmen mit sofortiger Wirkung verlassen. Noch am Mittwochabend hatte der Stada-Kurs unter dem Angebotspreis gelegen - ein Beleg f\u00fcr die Unsicherheit unter Investoren , ob der Deal zustande kommt. Das insgesamt 5,3 Milliarden Euro schwere Angebot der Finanzinvestoren galt als Test, ob in Deutschland Finanzinvestoren \u00fcberhaupt der Kauf gr\u00f6\u00dferer b\u00f6rsennotierter Unternehmen m\u00f6glich ist. Zahlreiche Private-Equity-Investoren haben bei ihren Anlegern Milliarden eingesammelt, f\u00fcr die sie nun ihrerseits Investitionsm\u00f6glichkeiten suchen. Stadas Vorstandsvorsitzender Engelbert Coster Tjeenk Willink sagte: \"Wir sind froh, dass die Frage der zuk\u00fcnftigen Eigent\u00fcmerstruktur nun gekl\u00e4rt ist.

The law, which came into effect Friday, has re-ignited a fierce national debate about the role of religion in politics and what it means to be German. \u201cThe cross is a fundamental symbol of our Bavarian identity and way of life.  It stands for elementary values such as charity, human dignity and tolerance,\u201d declared Bavarian State Premier Markus Soder at a cabinet meeting in April when the new requirement was announced.  He then walked out and nailed a cross to the wall of the lobby in the Bavarian State Chancellery.

{"year":"2018","month":"11","event_desc":"2 November - The German state of Hesse scraps the death penalty provision from Hesse's state constitution by popular vote, with 83% of the votes in favor.","text":"Death penalty: German state Hesse scraps death penalty anomaly 2 November 2018 Share Save Share Save TORSTEN SILZ\/AFP\/Getty Some 83% of voters in Hesse were keen to update the local law The German state of Hesse has voted to finally scrap the death penalty from its constitution, amending a 69-year-old legal anomaly which allowed it. The western state is the last in Germany to amend its local legal code, after the national constitution abolished capital punishment in 1949. Some 83% of voters were in favour of changing the 1946 provision, referendum results on Thursday showed. The vote is a symbolic one, as federal laws have always trumped state ones. Between 1946 and 1949, two people were sentenced to death in the state, but the rulings were later commuted to life sentences. Capital punishment is banned in all EU countries, so this lingering quirk was seen as an embarrassment to Germany, an outspoken opponent of the practice. How many countries still have the death penalty? The secret executions in Europe's 'last dictatorship' Pope changes teaching on death penalty The referendum, which took place on Sunday, coincided with a regional vote which saw heavy losses for Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party. On Monday, she announced she would quit as party leader and step down as German chancellor in 2021. How did the law last so long? Germany abolished the death penalty with its Basic Law of 1949, but the state of Hesse's constitution predated this. Other states introduced local bans in line with national law, but wealthy Hesse, home to financial hub Frankfurt, was the last to do so. \"Partly it was never modernised because it wasn't necessary - the Basic Law overrules state constitutions,\" local politician Juergen Banzer said, according to Reuters. A second reason was that Hesse is the only state that can change its state constitution - the oldest in modern Germany - through a people's vote. \"There was a fear that if a terrible crime was committed just as Hesse voted on whether to abolish the death penalty, then the vote could go the wrong way,\" Mr Banzer said. Voters had 15 amendments to consider on Sunday, including statements on children's rights, sex equality, European unity and environmental sustainability.

The government decision came amid a row over Mr Maassen's response to far-right unrest in Chemnitz, eastern Germany. Anti-migrant \"hunts\" were reported there on 26 August after a German man was killed in a brawl with migrants. Mr Maassen doubted that foreign-looking people had been hounded. Chancellor Angela Merkel was urged to sack him. Critics said his scepticism downplayed the seriousness of far-right violence and intimidation in Chemnitz. Mr Maassen will leave the BfV spy service and become a state secretary in the interior ministry. German media report that he will actually move to a higher pay grade. It is not yet clear who will replace him. What happened in Chemnitz? Several xenophobic assaults were reported in the eastern city after the fatal stabbing of Daniel Hillig. They were described as racist \"hunts\", and images emerged showing demonstrators chasing people and flinging bottles and fireworks. Controversially, spy chief Mr Maassen said his Federal Office for Constitutional Protection (BfV) , external - which is similar to the British MI5 - had \"no reliable information about such hunts taking place\" in Chemnitz. He also questioned whether a video posted by \"Antifa Zeckenbiss\" - meaning \"anti-fascist tick bite\" - really showed, as claimed, a \"hunt in Chemnitz\" on 26 August.

German public broadcaster ARD said in a \"fact-check\" , external that Antifa Zeckenbiss is an anonymous Twitter account, active since February, posting anti-fascist messages and \"there is nothing to indicate that it is a fake account\". There were more far-right rallies in Chemnitz after 26 August, and smaller counter-demonstrations by leftists. Mr Maassen was also criticised over his contacts with far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politicians. Germany jails Chemnitz Nazi salute man Germany's far right march en masse Are migrants driving crime in Germany? Who decided to force him out? Tuesday's decision was a compromise between Mrs Merkel and her coalition partners - Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the right-wing Bavarian CSU, and centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) leader Andrea Nahles. Mr Seehofer defended Mr Maassen's actions over Chemnitz, but Ms Nahles wanted him dismissed. AfD's Beatrix von Storch tweeted scornfully: , external \"This gives the SPD what it wanted in theory, Seehofer can remain spineless and Merkel gets some peace.\" What happened about the stabbing? Investigations over the murder of Daniel Hillig are ongoing. Earlier on Tuesday, an Iraqi man identified as Yousif A was released from custody, three weeks after he was arrested and detained over the killing. His lawyer Ulrich Dost-Roxin said the detention had been \"illegal\", and accused officials and politicians of using him for political ends. \"No witness accused my client of involvement in the crime,\" he said in a statement. , external Image source, AFP Image caption, A far-right crowd in central Chemnitz on 27 August - further rallies were held recently A Syrian man is still in custody, and police are still looking for a third suspect. What's the bigger picture? The Maassen controversy has fuelled fears that Germany's main state security body may be soft on far-right extremism. AfD is now the main opposition party, with 92 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. It backs the far-right protests, arguing that violent asylum-seekers should be expelled from Germany. AfD is furious with Mrs Merkel for having let in more than a million migrants in 2015-2016. Mr Maassen's predecessor was forced to quit over BfV shortcomings in the notorious NSU neo-Nazi case, in which a terrorist cell killed 10 people in a racially-motivated campaign in 2000-2007. The BfV and police were found to have neglected or ignored racism as a motive. Who does the BfV spy on? It has about 3,100 staff who, along with regional intelligence services, monitor groups acting against Germany's democratic order. It was created in 1950 by the Allied powers in Germany to guard against communist and pro-Nazi groups. It is part of the federal interior ministry and is overseen by the Bundestag. The BfV cannot make arrests. It says most of its intelligence is gathered from open or public sources, including press reports. It can only spy on groups - not private individuals - engaged in anti-constitutional behaviour. Separate BfV departments spy on radical left-wingers, far-right extremists and militant Islamists. The BfV also runs counter-espionage operations, watching foreign spies in Germany. But overseas intelligence-gathering is done by the BND spy service.

{"year":"2018","month":"07","event_desc":"1 July - Interior minister Horst Seehofer offers to resign after rejecting Chancellor Angela Merkel's EU migration deal.","text":"News | Angela Merkel Merkel coalition crisis: Seehofer offers to quit over migration German interior minister Horst Seehofer offers to resign after rejecting Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s EU migration deal. Seehofer confirmed early on Monday morning he would offer to step down [Sven Hoppe\/DPA via AP] Published On 2 Jul 2018 2 Jul 2018 German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has offered to resign after rejecting a migration deal brokered in Brussels by Chancellor Angela Merkel , as the two leaders prepare for final talks on Monday. Early on Monday, Seehofer confirmed he would offer to step down from the posts, while party leaders are reportedly trying to convince the minister to stay put. Speaking outside the CSU headquarters after a leadership meeting, Seehofer told reporters \u201cI said yes, that I would make both posts available, which I will do within three days\u201d. He added he would meet Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday in hopes of reaching an agreement \u201cin the interests of this country and the ability of our coalition and government to rule, which we want to preserve\u201d. Merkel and Seehofer have been embroiled in a dispute for weeks over the interior minister\u2019s plan to start turning away migrants at the German border who have already registered elsewhere in the European Union (EU). If the CSU withdraws its support for Merkel\u2019s coalition, she would be left without a majority in the German parliament, possibly prompting fresh elections. Two-week deadline Merkel is opposed to Seehofer\u2019s plan, which she said would cause a domino effect in Europe. But Seehofer has stood firm and gave the chancellor a two-week deadline in June to broker a European solution or he would start implementing the policy unilaterally. Advertisement On Friday, Merkel and the rest of the EU leaders hammered out a vaguely-worded deal to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and create \u201ccontrolled centres\u201d inside the bloc to process asylum requests. But on Sunday party sources told AFP news agency that Seehofer was unhappy with the accord and complained that he had endured a \u201cconversation with no effect\u201d with Merkel on Sunday. Reuters news agency also quoted a party source as saying that Seehofer saw no alternative to turning some migrants back at the country\u2019s border. The CSU\u2019s hard line on migration comes amid a growth in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Bavaria, where state elections will be held in October. In a televised interview on Sunday, Merkel said \u201cThe sum of everything we have decided has the same effect [as national measures]\u201d. \u201cThat is my personal conclusion. Of course, the CSU will have to decide that for itself,\u201d she added. Government scenarios If Seehofer goes ahead with his resignation, the CSU, the sister party of Merkel\u2019s CDU, can either propose a new interior minister or decide to pull out of the coalition government altogether. This would leave Merkel and her remaining coalition partner the Social Democrats ( SPD) with a minority in the parliament \u2013 something she could bridge by courting support from opposition parties for legislation or finding an additional coalition partner. Last November, when Merkel was negotiating her fourth coalition, the long-time chancellor told German broadcaster ZDF she was \u201cvery sceptical\u201d about leading a minority government and would rather call new elections. Advertisement Under the deal brokered in Brussels, EU leaders agreed to consider setting up \u201cdisembarkation platforms\u201d outside the bloc, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants and refugees boarding EU-bound boats. Member countries could also create processing centres to determine whether the new arrivals are returned home as economic migrants or admitted as refugees in willing states. At the national level, Merkel proposes that migrants arriving in Germany who first registered in another EU country should be placed in special \u201cadmission centres\u201d under restrictive conditions, according to a document she sent to the CSU and SPD. A document circulated by Merkel to coalition allies on Friday night outlined bilateral repatriation agreements with 16 countries and proposed reception centres in Germany where migrants would undergo an accelerated asylum procedure \u2013 measures that represent a significant hardening of her 2015 open-door asylum policy. But the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long sought to position himself as Merkel\u2019s nemesis in the immigration debate polarising the continent, later said they had signed no bilateral agreements on repatriation. Migration downturn Political stability was upset by Merkel\u2019s 2015 decision to keep borders open to migrants and refugees arriving from the Middle East via the Balkans, Hungary and Austria. Since then, more than one million people have arrived in Germany, while Merkel\u2019s governments have repeatedly tightened immigration and asylum laws. The current political crisis over migration comes amid a significant downturn in the number of arrivals. This year, about 45,000 migrants and refugees have reached Europe\u2019s shores by crossing the Mediterranean so far while in 2017 nearly 100,000 people had arrived by the end of June.

Thorsten Wagner\/Reuters By Katrin Bennhold June 8, 2018 It was a gruesome murder: A 14-year-old girl was raped and strangled, her body buried under brushwood in a secluded area near the railway tracks near her hometown in western Germany. But the fact that the chief suspect is an Iraqi asylum seeker has turned a terrible crime into political dynamite. On Friday, the case dominated the German news media and became the latest cudgel for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s opponents and, some predicted, a potential turning point in the migration debate in a country where some 10,000 asylum seekers still enter every month. There is no doubt the murder has given ammunition to those who want to get tougher, led by the far right, who are waging a widening challenge to what they contend is the government\u2019s botched handling of asylum cases. The killing comes on top of a deepening scandal and calls for a full-blown parliamentary investigation over allegations that civil servants may have granted asylum to as many as 1,000 migrants in exchange for money \u2014 and that some of those migrants may have been criminals or even terrorism suspects. The murder suspect, identified as Ali Bashar, a 20-year-old Iraqi, arrived in Germany in October 2015, shortly after Ms. Merkel opened the borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. He was rejected in late 2016, but was allowed to stay in the country while his appeal was pending. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

It was also heard in Clausnitz in early 2016, as a mob of Germans surrounded a bus of refugees entering their town. And later that year in Bautzen, as 80 Germans chased some 20 teenage refugees through the streets. The chant has become a go-to for the German far right. But it wasn\u2019t always an extremist rallying cry. \u201cLeipzig is a city of protest again tonight.\u201d In 1989, people in East Germany took to the streets to demand more freedom, after living under an oppressive communist regime for decades. Their movement was neither of the right nor the left. It was a cry for democracy. After German reunification, the chant largely disappeared. But in recent years, it has been co-opted by far-right groups who violently oppose Angela Merkel\u2019s open border policies. Violent demonstrations against refugees have featured a chant that translates to English as \u201cwe are the people.\u201d Credit Credit... Jens Meyer\/Associated Press By Katrin Bennhold Aug. 30, 2018 CHEMNITZ, Germany \u2014 Waving German flags, with some flashing Nazi salutes, the angry mob made its way through the streets, chasing after dark-skinned bystanders as police officers, vastly outnumbered, were too afraid to intervene. A Syrian refugee and father of two, Anas al-Nahlawie, watched horrified from a friend\u2019s fourth-floor balcony. They were hunting in packs for immigrants just like him, he said. \u201cLike wolves.\u201d For a few perilous hours over two days this week, the mob owned the streets of Chemnitz , where anger exploded after word spread that an Iraqi and a Syrian asylum seeker were suspected in a knife attack that killed a German man early Sunday. Chemnitz, a city of some 250,000 in eastern Germany, has a history of neo-Nazi protests. Usually they draw a few hundred from the fringes of society \u2014 and far larger counter-demonstrations, city officials say. The crowd this time was 8,000-strong. Led by several hundred identifiable neo-Nazis, it appeared to be joined by thousands of ordinary citizens. More marches are planned Saturday. The city had never seen anything like this \u2014 and, to some degree, neither had post-World War II Germany. The rampage now stands as a high-water mark in the outpouring of anti-immigrant hatred that has swelled as Germany struggles to absorb the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived in the country after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to open the borders in 2015.

Rumours circulated online that she had been murdered by a Muslim immigrant. But the truth of what happened was very different from the wild speculation. Karin Gross lives in east Berlin. On 7 March 2018 she received a phone call at work from her 14-year-old daughter Keira. \"She said to me: 'OK, Mama I'm at home, give me a ring when you are coming back.' So when I finished work I got in my car and phoned her. But she didn't answer.\" Karin called again, and again. No one picked up. She sent a WhatsApp message, but it didn't go through. She assumed that the network was down, or that her daughter had turned off her phone to have a nap. Karin drove home. When she entered her flat, she saw that the living room door was closed. \"That was unusual,\" says Karin. \"I searched the apartment for my daughter. I went to her bedroom. She wasn't in there.\" She entered the living room. \"I saw her sitting in front of the couch, gagged with a scarf full of blood.\" Keira had been stabbed more than 20 times. Image caption Karin Gross wants people to remember her daughter Ice skating star I meet Karin at her lawyer's office on a bitterly cold day in Berlin. She has a naturally cheerful disposition and, under normal circumstances, is quick to laugh. \"The daytimes aren't so bad,\" she says. The nights are a lot harder. Karin speaks about the most traumatic experience imaginable with astonishing clarity. She is determined that people understand what losing her daughter has been like. \"I want everyone to remember what happened to her,\" she tells me. Keira was a popular, charismatic girl and already an ice skating star in Berlin at 14. Karin was a single mother and Keira her only child. While the police investigation continued, a very different process was taking place online. Keira's death was swiftly exploited by activists hostile to migrants. \"It only took hours for there to be posts from far-right actors with the hashtag 'Keira' on Twitter and on Facebook,\" says Oliver Saal, a researcher at the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, an anti-extremism organisation. \"Posts appeared about the case suggesting that immigrants had committed this crime. \"The perpetrator was still unknown, and they knew it. But because Keira had been murdered with a knife, (they assumed) it had to be a non-German who had done it. \"Far-right actors claimed that no German could ever do such a thing.\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Migrants entering Germany from Austria in 2015 This speculation appeared to confirm the worst fears of many Germans who opposed Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees in the summer of 2015. Concerns about mass immigration have fuelled the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which entered the German parliament as the third biggest party in September 2017. Keira's death also followed two other widely-discussed murders in Germany: Maria Ladenburger , a student murdered in 2016 by a refugee who claimed to be from Afghanistan; and a 15-year -old girl known as Mia V, who was killed by her Afghan ex-boyfriend in the town of Kandel in 2017. There has been an increase in crime committed by migrants in Germany since 2015. Some researchers put this down to the high proportion of refugees who are young and male. Young men commit more crimes than any other demographic. Overall, however, crime in Germany is falling - down to its lowest level since 1992. While violent crime rose between 2014 and 2016, there was a 2.5% decrease between 2016 and 2017. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Karin's story 'Beast from the Caucasus' Four days after Keira's murder, the police announced they had arrested a 15-year-old boy. When the police told Karin the suspect's name, she was shocked. \"I didn't know him personally, but I had heard a lot about him,\" she says. \"Keira had photos in her room of him. She was a little bit in love with him but they were not together. She always spoke about him like he was her brother.\" Initially, neither the boy's ethnic or religious background was revealed to the public. Despite this being normal police procedure, posts criticising the authorities erupted across social media. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pegida supporters marching in Dresden The criticism leaked into more mainstream politics and media as well. An AfD state representative in Berlin tweeted asking why the perpetrator's \"origin\" had not been made public. The editor-in-chief of Bild, the most popular tabloid in Germany, called for the \"regular information\" about the perpetrator to be revealed. The suggestion that important information was being withheld from the public fed into a narrative that \"the establishment\" was covering up evidence of a migrant crime wave. Oliver Saal says one man played a key role in promoting this conspiracy theory. Lutz Bachmann is the founder of Pegida - otherwise known as the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident - a far-right, anti-Islam organisation. He's now an influential social media personality on the German far right. Following Keira's murder, Bachmann posted online that he knew the identity of the suspect. He claimed that the culprit was a \"beast from the Caucasus\", a \"Chechen Muslim\" and a \"former refugee\". Chechnya has historically been a source of Muslim immigrants to Germany. Bachmann posted a picture of a boy online. He included the boy's full name and linked to his Facebook profile. The post was shared widely. The culprit, as far as many of Bachmann's followers were concerned, had been identified. Except it wasn't him. Image copyright EPA Image caption Lutz Bachmann falsely claimed a \"Chechen Muslim\" was the killer The boy that Bachmann had discovered online had nothing to do with the crime - he just happened to have the same first name and surname initial as the real suspect. With posts accusing him of murder proliferating across the internet, the boy made his social media accounts private. The BBC's efforts to contact him were unsuccessful. We tried to contact Lutz Bachmann through Pegida. They said they had \"no interest\" in speaking to us. Bachmann's post was so wide of the mark that the police felt compelled to take the unusual step of responding online. They posted a screenshot of Bachmann's tweet, and called it \"fake news\". Image Copyright @polizeiberlin @polizeiberlin Report Image Copyright @polizeiberlin @polizeiberlin Report In Germany a victim's relatives are entitled to be represented at court proceedings. A few days after Keira's murder, Karin Gross contacted Roland Weber, a well-known criminal lawyer, to represent her. \"This case for me was like a puzzle,\" says Weber. \"We had many little pieces and then, step by step, I began to see the bigger picture.\" The boy who had been arrested was neither a refugee nor a Muslim, as Bachmann had claimed. He was a white church-going German-born teenager, who because of his youth was given the legal pseudonym \"Hannes\". \"When he was first arrested he told the police a (particular) story,\" Weber says. \"He said that the daughter of my client wanted to commit suicide and that she begged for him to do this for her.\" However, Keira's behaviour with friends and family in the days before she died did not suggest that she had been planning to kill herself. Her calendar was filled with plans she had made for the coming months. Image copyright Karin Gross Image caption Police dismissed the suspect's claims that Keira had been suicidal As the investigation proceeded, a different picture began to emerge, one which indicated there was a greater degree of premeditation in Hannes' actions than he had first admitted. Hannes had brought a backpack with him to Keira's home. It contained a change of clothes, gloves and a mask. Some of his schoolmates told police that in the days before the crime Hannes had spoken, in detail, about what he was going to do. In fact, he had even called one of them minutes after the murder to confirm that he had gone through with it. 'The hardest thing in the world' Karin attended every day of the trial. Hannes sat with his mother on the opposite side of the room. \"I think it was the hardest thing in the world that I have ever been through,\" Karin says. \"I didn't get any regrets or any apologies - not from his family. Nothing. Even when they were talking about what he has done, he didn't apologise. He talked about it like stealing a car.\" Teachers described Hannes as a friendly, popular boy, but there was a very different side to his personality. \"He wasn't sure if his friends were real friends,\" Roland Weber says. \"One day he decided that if he couldn't have real friends then maybe it would be better to be the bad guy: the Joker, the opposite character to Batman.\" You may also be interested in: The truth behind a viral murder video The battle over Britain's newest student movement The memes that might get you jailed in Russia The court heard that for some time before the killing, Hannes had dyed his hair green and even wore white face paint to look like the Joker. Evidence about his actions after the murder also suggested a chilly detachment. Knowing that he needed to destroy Keira's phone - so there would be no trace of the WhatsApp messages they had exchanged - he went to a nearby lake and threw it in. He went home and returned the knife to a block in his parents' kitchen. Then he turned on his computer and began to play League of Legends. A court-appointed psychiatrist concluded that there was no indication that Hannes had a personality disorder or a mental illness. \"In the end,\" Roland Weber says, \"all of us - not only the judge, but also my client and me - we were very sure that he just did it for fun. To see how it is when someone is dying.\" Hannes was convicted of murder and sentenced to nine years juvenile detention. The story was very different from the narrative being promoted by far-right activists online. A Berlin police spokesperson told the press that they had \"never experienced a murder case being politically exploited in such a way.\" Image copyright Karin Gross Image caption Keira was Karin's only child On a January afternoon, Karin takes me to the cemetery where Keira is buried. She comes almost every day. Trimming the leaves of an orange rose to lay on the grave, Karin describes how on one visit, a few months earlier, she made a disturbing discovery. Keira's grave had been desecrated. On the gravestone someone had written the name of the murderer and described him as \"Russian.\" The myth of the \"beast from the Caucasus\" persisted. \"It was a shock for me,\" says Karin, \"because I never thought there would be someone who would write something like that on my daughter's gravestone. \"For me it doesn't make any difference if it was Russian or Japanese or anything like that,\" she tells me. \"My daughter is still dead.\" Karin tried to get rid of the graffiti with water, but it wouldn't come off. She went home to get nail polish remover. Even with that, it took two hours to scrub the marble clean. Image copyright Karin Gross Karin still lives in the same flat where her daughter was murdered. \"People wonder how I can bear it,\" she says. \"I haven't changed anything. OK, I have a new couch. But all the blood and evidence of what happened are gone.\" \"I can't imagine moving away. It was one day that was not good. But there are so many years of memories there.\" Recently she has taken her first tentative steps onto the ice at the hall where Keira practised. She wears her daughter's skating clothes. \"They fit me, although we have a different figure - her shoes too,\" Karin says. \"Perhaps in 10 years I will also be a speed skater. I am just doing it because I want to be near her. I go there to have fun. \"I am not alone. So many friends of hers come ice skating with me. We do it together, in memory of her.\" If you need support for mental health issues, advice is available via the BBC Action Line . Do you have a story for us? Email BBC Trending .
